0,bkoganbing,Jump For Your Life,6,25 February 2008,"Jumper is the story of young Max Thierot who grows up to be Hayden Christiansen and discovers he's got powers of teleportation. Sad to say he also discovers there are some nasty people out there who are led by Samuel L. Jackson and want to kill him.There was the British science fiction series that did run for a time on American television called The Tomorrow People. What they did was something they called Jaunting when they teleported themselves all over the world. Apparently though the producers of that series never saw the possibilities of what could be done.Take young Mr. Thierot who's a picked on kid back in Ann Arbor, Michigan and when he discovers his powers he leaves a drunken and abusive father and moves to New York. His first thing is to rob a bank and create limitless wealth and a life of pleasure.Eventually though Samuel L. Jackson who works for the National Security Agency finds him and spends the rest of the film trying to kill the young man who is Hayden Christiansen now. His group are called Paladins and they have a more sinister relationship to the Jumpers than say the Watchers have to the Immortals on the Highlander. Jackson has also developed some sophisticated technology to deal with Christiansen and fellow Jumpers.Diane Lane is in this film also as Christiansen's mother. Her part is small, but important and to tell any more would reveal too much.This film was definitely one round the world tour with shooting everywhere from the Valley of Kings in Egypt to Ann Arbor, Michigan. The cast is young and appealing, the special effects good and there's also a nice performance by Jamie Bell as a fellow Jumper.",Jumper
1,Leofwine_draca,"Nice idea, shame about the execution",4,6 October 2011,"JUMPER marks a great central idea crying out for a decent movie – and unfortunately this is nothing like a decent movie. It deals with the subject of teleportation, a sci-fi staple that's proved quite difficult to film over the years (THE FLY being one of the few successful instances). Unfortunately, director Doug Liman (THE BOURNE IDENTITY) finds himself saddled with all the stereotypes that come with a teen flick rather than an intelligent work of science fiction, and the movie suffers accordingly.Things begin a bit like SPIDER-MAN, with teenage angst, a love interest and bullying. Pretty soon our hero discovers his superpower, an ability to teleport anywhere he chooses in the world in the blink of an eye. Unfortunately, the bungling scriptwriter immediately loses audience sympathy with this supposed 'hero' by making him rob a bank. It doesn't help that the chosen star is Mr. Charisma-Free himself, Hayden Christensen.The supporting cast isn't much better. Samuel L. Jackson is on autopilot as a stock bad guy, who doesn't really seem all that bad to begin with (especially given the lead's criminal status – I have to say I was rooting for Jackson in this one). Rachel Bilson is pretty, but a walking vacuum of acting talent, and the less said about the appalling cameo by Kristen Stewart the better. It's left to Jamie Bell and Michael Rooker to carry the interest, but neither gets a worthwhile amount of screen time (with Rooker in particular criminally underused).After the umpteenth staid action sequence (including the worst use of the Colosseum in a movie) I realised what this film reminded me of – the climax of Wes Craven's SHOCKER, an '80s-era sci-fi/horror combo which had two brawlers battling their way through different media, swapping from one scenario to the next in an instant. Needless to say, the Craven film was much better.",Jumper
2,SnoopyStyle,Don't particularly like Christensen or his character,5,31 May 2014,"David Rice (Hayden Christensen) has the power of teleportation. His first time, he crash through the ice retrieving a glass globe for Millie and teleported to the library. His mother (Diane Lane) had run away and his father is a drunk. He runs away to NYC. Eventually he learns to control his power and robs a bank vault. Years later, he is tracked down by hunters led by the evil Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) who believe them to be abominations. He finds Millie (Rachel Bilson) still back in their home town and he convinces her to travel with him. However Roland is never too far behind him followed by another jumper Griffin (Jamie Bell).There is something about Hayden Christensen as a hero that annoys me. He always seems to have a bit of douche in him. Rachel Bilson is a little bit blah in this one too. I like the younger versions played by Max Thieriot and AnnaSophia Robb better. David S. Goyer wrote the screenplay and directed by Doug Liman, this has the basic bones of an interesting sci-fi concept. Sure I always hate the idea that the world never knows about these people with supernatural powers. Other than that, this should be a good movie. The effects look good, but the magic is missing. Overall, I really don't like Christensen in this nor the lead character David Rice. All the action in the third act is meaningless and I keep wondering how nobody seems to know anything about Jumpers. In the end, he has no wish to be a hero and has no concept of his power other than as an easy way to travel the world with his girl.",Jumper
3,Prismark10,Jump around,5,10 January 2015,"Jumper is a high concept film let down by a weak story, terrible villains. On the plus side it has cool worldwide location shooting and some nifty special effects.Hayden Christensen plays David Rice, a high school loser, with a drunk father, a mother who ran away, a crush with a girl at high school who one day discovers that he is a Jumper, a person who can teleport around the world. He uses his skill to enrich himself but not for a moment wonders whether he is the only person with this ability or whether there are people who might hunt people like him down. He also does not even consider doing anything good with his powers. Some years he later returns to his hometown to meet up with the girl from the High school he liked and ends up toe to toe with the person who bullied him but all this is really a set up when the Paladins arrive so they can trace David via these people.Samuel L Jackson plays the protagonist. A member of a religious group called Paladins who hunt down and kills Jumpers. They seem to have more powers than a shadowy black ops group associated with the CIA as they seem to be able to bully their way into anywhere, threaten anyone without anyone fighting back even if its the police which comes across as preposterous. The constant bleating that their powers are against God's intentions comes across as stupid. Did Jackson ever think, how does he know what God wants or does not want? Who gave the Jumpers these powers? The film never ask Jackson these questions, so the Paladins go about their ridiculous ways acting above the law.The only person who aids David is another Jumper called Griffin, played by Jamie Bell. Griffin specialises in killing Paladins and is one of the people who is there for exposition as the audience needs to know what is going on and why. Somewhere along the line, there is a fledgling love story, a potential father and son reconciliation after the Paladins nearly killed David's dad, when suddenly the father's story is dropped. David's mother shows up and explains why she ran away and it had nothing to do with his drunk father.The film has some good CGI, plenty of location shooting as we see David jumping around the world but there could had been a better film if it had a tighter and smarter script.",Jumper
4,claudio_carvalho,Reasonable and Forgettable Entertainment,6,6 September 2008,"In Ann Arbor, the teenager David Rice was left by his mother when he was five year-old; he does not have a good relationship with his father; and he has a crush on his schoolmate Millie Harris. When David gives a snow globe with the Eiffel Tower to Millie, the bully Mark Kobold throws it onto a frozen river. David tries to retrieve the object, but the ice shatters and David fall under the ice. Suddenly he teleports himself to a library and discovers that he has the ability to jump anywhere he wants. He decides to run away home, moving to New York, and uses his power to rob a bank vault. Eight years later, David (Hayden Christensen) is living in a fancy apartment in New York and having a life full of adventure, traveling to the most exotic places in the world. He decides to visit Millie (Rachel Bilson) in Ann Arbor and invites her to visit Rome. While in the Coliseum, David meets the jumper Griffin (Jamie Bell) that explains to him that the dangerous Roland Cox (Samuel L. Jackson) and his team of Paladins are chasing him and his family and friends are in danger.""Jumper"" is a reasonable and forgettable entertainment, with a story full of action and special effects but lacking better clarification since neither the power of the Jumpers nor the reason of the existence of the Paladins nor why they kill the Jumpers is satisfactorily explained. Further, the story is typically written and developed to become a franchise with many sequels or a pilot of a TV show. The encounter of David with his mother in the end and the explanations she gives to him to leave her family are absolutely stupid and unnecessary. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Jumper""",Jumper
5,kosmasp,Jumping around,6,22 May 2021,"I'm a bit dissapointed: couldn't they get Mila Kunis too to complete the holy trinity? You know, Rachel Bilson, Kristen Stewart and her ... everyone is calling them that, right? No? Ok kidding aside and back to the movie though (especially because Kristen does not really have a big part here ... not that Rachel Bilson is doing much either, just saying): this is a light and entertaining affair if you suspend your disbelief with more than a stellar cast.If you can get Samuel L. Jackson to play any part in your movie ... I'd say you are good. Doug Liman directing also helps a lot. So while I wouldn't consider this a masterpiece and full of cliches and odd character traits and choices ... you can put all those aside and just enjoy the movie ... it is possible! Just do it - otherwise it is probably better not to watch the movie at all (effects have aged quite good by the way all things considering)",Jumper
6,jboothmillard,Jumper,5,1 May 2009,"I knew the concept, and the three main male stars, so I guess I had to at least give it a go, from director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Mr. and Mrs. Smith). Basically young David Rice (Max Thieriot) discovered his newfound ability to Teleport to anywhere he wants after almost drowning. With this newfound ability, being fifteen years old, he managed to Teleport into a bank vault taking lots of money, and then moves to New York City. An older David (Star Wars Episode II and III's Hayden Christensen) enjoys travelling the world instantaneously, but his crime hasn't been forgotten when a group of government hunters led by white-haired Roland (Samuel L. Jackson). David meets fellow Teleporter Griffin (Billy Elliot's Jamie Bell) who helps him learn more about his gift, and how to escape. David also reacquaints himself with the girl who he once had a thing for, Millie Harris (Rachel Bilson), who was bound to find out his secret eventually, but don't worry, everything turns right in the end. Also starring Untraceable's Diane Lane as Mary Rice, Amadeus's Tom Hulce as Mr. Bowker, Michael Rooker as William Rice and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's AnnaSophia Robb as Young Millie. Christensen is slightly better than in the Star Wars prequels, Jackson has stupid hair but is quite a good villain, and Bell proves a good older actor. The special effects and location filming are what you admire most, and even though the story isn't very original, is a worthwhile near-superhero science fiction thriller. Worth watching!",Jumper
7,ccthemovieman-1,This Guy Is No 'Superhero',4,27 June 2008,"This is one of those films that starts off good, with a great premise, begins to become ""so-so"" halfway through, and then gets increasingly annoying to the point where you hate all the characters and the film is a chore to finish. I will say this: some of the action scenes at the end are the best of the movie and worth hanging around for, especially since the film is less than an hour-and-a-half. However, as most other reviewers seem to agree, when you have a lead character who is not likable, it really detracts from the story. Hayden Christensen plays that lead, ""David Rice,"" a young guy given the powers of teleporting, where he can instantly change where he is - from Ann Arbor to Cairo, if he so desires. After some practice, he can learn to bring other people and objects with him. The only times I've seen Christensen are when he's played ""Anakin Sykwalker"" in two installments of the mega-hit ""Star Wars"" films. (Jake Lloyd played the very young Skywalker in ""Anakin's"" first appearance.)However, he's no ""Skywalker"" in this film, good-guy-wise. He isn't exactly ""Peter Parker,"" either. As ""Spiderman,"" Parker's creed is ""With great power, comes great responsibility."" With Rice, it's more like ""get everything you can, and screw 'em!"" I make the Spiderman analogy because Rice has super powers with the teleportation thing.This is not a ""superhero"" movie, though, because the lead character is not a ""hero,"" in any sense of the word. To emphasize that point, there's a scene early on in which Rice is watching a TV program about flood victims and he just nonchalantly walks away from the set, totally disinterested. That's one of the points: the kid has these powers to do some good and could care less. The problem with that, beside the obvious moral shortcomings, is that it doesn't give the viewer - you and me - anyone to really root for in the picture. He meets another teleporter and that guy is the same: a slimeball only interested in saving his own skin. That guy is ""Griffin,"" an Irishman who, as a kid, played the lead in ""Billy Elliott."" The villain in the movie is ""Roland,"" played by Samuel L. Jackson's who sports a ridiculous-looking ultra-white ""do."" He plays a ""religious zealot"" (there is no other kind in the film world) out to kill all the teleporters. He's a ""paladin,"" as is someone else in the film, which is a surprise.Since none of the characters were anyone you could root for, I tried to just sat back and enjoy the special-effects and the scenery, which were the positive points of the movie. We get quick tours of the world, from the Grand Canyon to Rome, and the special-effects of the teleporters ""jumping"" from one location to another was cool.There was a love interest but little chemistry between David and ""Millie"" (Rachel Belson), a pretty but another annoying character.So there you have it: the good and the bad. At least you've been warned.",Jumper
8,Tweekums,Okay sci-fi action,6,29 July 2012,"David is picked on at school but one day but one day he discovers he has a special ability he falls through the ice on a frozen river but just as he thinks he is going to drown he finds that he is no longer under the water but in the town library. He soon learns how to control this ability but rather than using the power to get back at the bullies or help people in need he robs a bank then enjoys the life normal people can only dream of; going to a pub in London, surfing in Fiji, even having a picnic atop the Sphinx! Eight years later he returns home and has a run in with an old bully; he dumps this character in a bank vault before heading to Rome with Millie, his high school crush (on a plane). The thing that he doesn't know is that there is a group calling themselves the Paladins who are hunting people like him; Jumpers. He learns this when he bumps into fellow Jumper Griffith in the Colosseum along with a couple of Paladins. They manage to get away and he puts Millie on the first plane home. He thinks that should solve the problem but Griffith explains that the leader of the Paladins will do anything to catch Jumpers; including killing their family and friends. They will have to be quick if they are to stop him before he can kill Millie.I hadn't really expected much of this but ended up quite enjoying it despite how preposterous it was. No attempt was made to explain how Jumpers came to have their ability; it is just stated that they had been around for ever and the Paladins had always hunted them this was a good thing as it meant little time was wasted on exposition. Hayden Christensen was okay as Dave but as soon as Griffith, played by Jamie Bell turned up it was clear that the protagonist wasn't the most interesting character which is a weakness in any film. Samuel L. Jackson wasn't on top form as Roland, head of the Paladins with his bleached white hair I was immediately reminded of Wesley Snipes character in 'Demolition Man'; a better villain in a better film. The effects were decent and there was plenty of action; none of it was too violent though so it isn't unsuitable for younger viewers my ten year old nephew certainly enjoyed it! Overall I'd say this is worth watching on television but not really worth seeking out.",Jumper
9,BA_Harrison,A leap too far.,5,22 March 2011,"At the age of 15, David Rice discovers that he is a 'jumper', a being with the ability to teleport anywhere in the world in an instant; rather than use his power for the benefit of mankind, he turns to robbing banks to fund a life of luxury, something which brings him to the attention of Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), one of a race of people dedicated to destroying jumpers, believing them to be inherently evil.Even with a competent director in Doug Liman, a decent cast (Hayden Christensen aside), an interesting basic premise and bags of big-budget Hollywood special effects, Jumper ultimately proves to be an irritatingly lacklustre piece of sci-fi/fantasy fluff: once the novelty of seeing David 'jumping' has worn off (and believe me, it doesn't take long), any viewers with their brain still engaged will find themselves picking at the innumerable holes in the preposterous script, whilst also pondering whether the whole movie was merely an excuse for Liman and his stars to go globe-trotting at the expense of the studio (they sure do cover a lot of ground, taking in New York, Toronto, Prague, Paris, Tokyo, Giza, Tijuana, Rome, and London in the process).",Jumper
10,Scarecrow-88,Jumper,6,11 December 2010,"How would you like to have the ability to teleport yourself anywhere you want? London. Rome. Paris. China. Taiwan. Hayden Christensen discovers as a teenager that he can ""jump"" from one location and wind up somewhere else entirely. But there is a group known as Palladins who hunt jumpers because they believe only God should have such an ability(although, I asked myself if this philosophy is so then how come there are humans granted such teleporting skills?)and that jumpers would ""eventually go bad."" Samuel L Jackson seems to be a leader of the Palladin group, wearing a white hair color this time, with an wand that shoots out an electrical wire which is a cryptonite to jumpers who are unable to teleport because it takes a jolt in order to take off. Rachel Bilson is Cristensen's one true love Jackson will use as leverage against him. Jamie Bell is another jumper who informs Christensen that there are many jumpers and Palladins out there in the world. Christensen will attempt to persuade Bell to partner up and conquer Jackson together. Diane Lane is Christensen's mother, herself, to his surprise, a Palladin who has allowed her son to live, leaving him at five for his safety. Michael Rooker is Christensen's alcoholic father who pays a price for being the father of a jumper. The wonky plot only services as a mechanism to allow the eye-popping effects to work their magic. Often when a jumper teleports, damage is left in his wake. The scene where Christensen carries an entire apartment along with him into the ocean and eventually a library is an example of this. The fight to retrieve a remote control device which is to set off a bomb, between Christensen and Bell, is another instance when visual effects take center stage, as they move from the top of the Golden Gate Bridge to a country at war with bullets firing and tanks driving over cars, eventually landing on a power line. Max Thierot, the lead in Wes Craven's MY SOUL TO TAKE, is the teenage David(Christensen's character). As was the case in director Doug Liman's THE BOURNE IDENTITY, the film features multiple settings, globe trotting to places such as Rome, Ann Arbor(Michigan), Egypt and France.",Jumper
11,dbborroughs,"Samuel L Jackson as the bad guy and some good action sequences are the reason to see this, not the dull leads",5,30 March 2008,"Kid discovers that he has the ability to jump from place to place. After he's been doing it awhile he discovers he's being hunted by a group who feel what he, and others like him, do is wrong.Good action sequence and a kick ass villain in the form of Samuel L Jackson are under cut by a poor plot that is little more than an excuse for the action sequences and two lead characters that are perfectly bland. It doesn't help that the great non actor Hayden Christensen is our hero. How he continues to get roles is beyond me since he has yet to actually prove he can act, even a little, he just looks good.Worth a look on cable for the action, but I wouldn't suggest you actually pay money to see it.",Jumper
12,zardoz-13,"Nothing to ""Jump"" up and down about!",1,20 February 2008,"""The Bourne Identity"" director Doug Liman's new science fiction thriller ""Jumpers"" qualifies as one of the worst super hero adventure sagas since the dreadful ""Hulk"" fiasco. This enigmatic, incoherent, melodramatic gobbledygook belongs to a sub-genre of science fiction that relies on teleportation. Basically, how do sci-fi characters get from point A to point B? They teleport! Teleportation constitutes a form of time travel, like in H.G. Wells' ""The Time Machine."" First, most sci-fi films and TV shows use a teleportation device for time voyages. Prominent among these were the cult British TV series ""Dr. Who,"" the vintage American TV show ""Star Trek"" with its franchise of TV shows and films, ""The Time Tunnel,"" ""Stargate"" with its spin-off TV shows, and ""The Matrix"" trilogy. Characters enter elaborate contraptions that propel them ahead or behind their own time. Second, fewer sci-fi movies and TV shows rely on personal teleportation with no mechanical device between the traveler and their destination. ""Jumper"" chronicles the exploits of a young man that leaps around in contemporary time and space. Previously, the best known personal teleportation TV shows were the obscure 1970s' British series ""The Tomorrow People"" and the American entry ""Quantum Leap."" ""Jumpers,"" loosely based on Steven Gould's sci-fi novels, doesn't tamper drastically with the formula.""Jumper"" opens in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with young David Rice (Max Thieriot of ""The Astronaut Farmer"") giving a snow globe of the Eiffel Tower to a girl, Millie (AnnaSophia Robb of ""The Reaping""), that he has a crush on. Obnoxious high school bully Mark (Jesse James of ""The Butterfly Effect"") snatches the globe and hurls it onto thin ice on a frozen river. Fearlessly, David crosses the ice to retrieve it. The ice breaks beneath him, and he is swept out of sight and presumed dead. Suddenly, he finds himself splashed inexplicably into the local library. Afterward, when David goes home, his alcoholic dad William (Michael Rooker of ""Tombstone"") rants and raves at him so maliciously that he makes another 'jump' to escape this abusive home life. We're told that David's mother Mary (Diane Lane of ""Untraceable"") abandoned him when he turned five. David runs away to New York City and uses his new found powers for monetary gain. He visits a bank and later teleports himself back and forth into the vault, hauling off bags of loot to his cheap motel room. At this point, ""Star Wars"" heartthrob Hayden Christenson assumes the role. In time, he is jumping all over the world, enjoying lunch atop the Great Sphinx in Egypt. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to David, somebody is watching him. Griffin (Jamie Bell of ""King Kong"") has his eye on our hero, because Griffin has the ability to 'jump' across time and space, too. However, more sinister eyes are focused on David. Eventually, David encounters his worst nightmare, Roland (white-haired Samuel L. Jackson of ""Pulp Fiction""), a mysterious individual who masquerades as a government agent that wants to kill David. Roland totes a baton that works like a taser. According to Griffin, Roland is a Paladin, and Paladins have been hunting and killing jumpers without mercy since medieval times.The chief problem with ""Jumper"" is that Liman and his scenarists never fully explain the origins of either Paladins or jumpers. The Paladins lull around an unwieldy device that tracks jumpers. Jumpers can jump anywhere as long as they have seen their destination or been there before. David reunites with his girlfriend Millie (gorgeous Rachel Bilson of TV's ""The O.C."") after eight years and takes her to Rome where the Paladins really make life rough for him. As rough as things are for Dave, they are even rougher on anybody that tries to make sense out of this nonsense. Hayden Christenson gives his usual wooden performance, while Jackson chews the scenery with flair as the villain. Mind you, the PG-rated ""Jumper"" with its 89-minute running time is no ""Quantum Leap,"" and discriminating audiences will probably wish that they could teleport to better movies like ""Step Up 2 The Streets"" or ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" before their 89 minutes elapse.",Jumper
13,Boba_Fett1138,Simply a fine entertaining movie.,7,3 November 2008,"You know, some movies are just not made to shock the world or to break any box office records. They are just made to bring us some entertainment and I feel that ""Jumper"" does not fail at this.Yes, there are more than a several things wrong with this movie and the story could be mostly blamed for that. It's a really simplistic story that makes the good old-Hollywood mistake to focus almost entirely on the love-story aspects than anything else really. Because of this its action and science-fiction/fantasy elements feel more like they got pushed to the back in this one. But also purely its story with its main plot is seriously lacking and is quite simplistic actually. A lot of things don't make an awful lot of sense, since they are simply not being explained every well enough in the movie and the movie is filled with mostly clichés and isn't really quite ever surprising enough.Nevertheless the movie does not fail to entertain and it simply is one fine movie to kill some time with. It's simply a fun movie people! A perfect in-between movie so to speak, just as it must had been a perfect in-between movie for Doug Liman, David S. Goyer, Hayden Christensen and Samuel L. Jackson to make. It has one fine concept of never ending possibilities, which also opens the door for some sequels and/or spin-offs. A sequel has already been announced, with Doug Liman attached again to direct. Not that I will run to cinemas to watch it but I'll probably pick up the DVD when released if it is anything like this movie.The movie is made good and fun by its concept, which is an imaginative one and one that can be used as an excuse to feature as many as possible landmarks and famous big cities and places within one movie. The movie handles its concept well, at least as well as its stories allows it anyway. It's just not a movie you should think about too much, that way you'll simply enjoy this movie for what it is.Hayden Christensen never have been much of an action star but he is simply good in this movie and well cast. Contrary to popular believe, he can act really well. It's also fun to see Samuel L. Jackson in a villainous role for a change again and it's also nice to see Jamie Bell in such a big production and important role again.It's a well made movie that is good looking and obviously cost some money to make. This can mostly be seen back in it's special effects of course, that aren't always convincing but are nice looking nevertheless. Doug Liman is a director who can do action really well and in a refreshing way. He doesn't attempt to let the movie look spectacular and he doesn't try to impress the viewers with any big mind-blowing action sequences but like I said, he knows to handle it in a good and refreshing way, which works out wonderfully for this movie.A fun entertaining little movie for in between, that could had been great had it had a better and more present story though.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Jumper
14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Doesn't stand still... and that's not a bad thing,7,29 February 2008,"I have not read the book, so I don't know if this is an accurate and/or good adaptation of it. Doug Liman may not be the best director to have ever put something up on the silver screen... but this is the third film of his I've watched(the other two being The Bourne Identity and Mr. & Mrs. Smith), and thus far, all I've seen has been consistently entertaining, has held my interest and has been funny. If I had to draw comparisons, this is more like the latter of the two aforementioned other directorial efforts of his... the focus is definitely on keeping it fast and fun, more than explaining or building up the characters. Which is not to say that it's overwhelming, in fact, it's pretty well-paced throughout, nor to claim that the characters are thin, more that they aren't fleshed out particularly much in what we see. Liman may not make the best movies, or necessarily the most intelligent(though Bourne was, to an extent), but they're nicely done, feature good action and are generally solid, on the whole. This is not an exception. The action is very cool, and it's grand in scale at times without ever really losing the audience. The science and internal logic makes sense. The humor is great, almost all of the time, with one or two bits here and there not quite working. The film seems in a hurry, and there could be more explaining done, but with that said, nothing really seems stuck in without reason, and it isn't underdeveloped(more like, there's entirely too much material for just one film, of 90 minutes... I've read another review that said that it's ""a good pilot"", and I agree, in both meanings... if this were a show, I'd watch it, and consider this a marvelous start-off point, and, yeah, by the end of the film, there's still a whole lot to explore. I'm not saying that this was necessarily what the other reviewer meant, only my own opinion and view. The writing does have weak spots. The cinematography is magnificent, somewhat laid-back in tone, at times. The editing is almost flawless, there was one shot that I didn't care for, and more often than not, I could not tell exactly what was going on, in action sequences. The acting is perfectly fine, there aren't any performances that are severely lacking. Christensen works, Jackson is cool as usual. Bell isn't bad at all. The music is fitting. The special effects are excellent, seldom, if ever, showy and they really help ""sell"" the story. I recommend this to fans of action, the actor and definitely Doug Liman. 7/10",Jumper
15,view_and_review,Jump into a lake and never surface,4,16 June 2008,"Damn I wish I woulda checked the credits first. Had I known Hayden Christensen was in this movie I definitely would not have tuned in. Is there anything that he is in that isn't ruined by his presence? ""Jumper""... Human version of X-Men's Nightcrawler. I guess the fact that these ""paladins"" hunt the Jumpers was to make it more exciting, but really it was still lame. I mean honestly, if these guys can jump anywhere and get anything, then certainly they can grab a gun and shoot any one of these paladins, right? I, personally, was rooting for the paladins. The only jumpers shown were self serving, narcissistic, greedy criminals. People like that get arrested in real life. Not everyone can just take what they want when they want it, we actually have to work to earn money and vacations and such. This movie was only mildly entertaining and only because of the CGI. Take away the CGI and this movie is a 100% flop instead of the 60% flop that it was.",Jumper
16,neil-476,Fairly good. Ish. A bit.,7,21 May 2008,"This film was very low profile - it kind of vanished without trace shortly after release. I was pleased to catch it as it temporarily reappeared for a few moments at my multiplex.This is essentially a superhero movie. David, a 16-year old discovers that he has the ability to teleport. As his current life is not something he is particularly attached to (school's not wonderful, mother skipped home when he was young, poor relationship with Dad), he uses his newfound ability to a) withdraw large amounts of cash from bank vaults and b) live the life of Reilly generally. He manages to do this for a number of years until he links up again with Millie, the girl he fancied when he was 16, at which point he discovers that a) he's not the only Jumper in the world, and b) there is a group of individuals called Paladins who seek to kill Jumpers on the grounds that only God should have the ability to be in multiple places at once. They do this by tasering Jumpers - the electric charge screws up the ability to Jump. Our protagonist is played by Hayden Christensen (Annikin Skywalker in the prequels), the new Jumper he meets is played by Jamie Bell (Billy Elliot, and the cabin boy in Peter Jackson's King Kong), and the main Paladin by Samuel L Jackson.That's about it, story-wise - there are some wrinkles and developments, but mostly this is a chase and combat movie, said chases and combat sequences being laced with teleporting special effects. The effects are mostly good - the low point is that some sequences are a little confusing visually, the high point is a London bus plunging down a desert sand dune. But this is a fast film, and there is always enough going on to hold the attention.I was a little uncertain why David and Millie had to be played by different actors at ages 16 and 24 - surely these parts could have been cast with actors who could have played both ends of that age range? And there were times when Jamie Bell's accent was impenetrable - an Irish/Newcastle-ish mumble (I think).My assessment - underrated, though perhaps not by much.",Jumper
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Jumper,5,13 February 2008,"When Samuel L. Jackson took on the role of Mace Windu in the Star Wars Prequels, I think many fan boys were relishing the fact that there'll probably be some major ass-whupping dished out by his character in typical mo-fo style, especially with the prospect of crossing swords with Anakin Skywalker (though for obvious reasons we would know who the victor will be). Well, guess even George Lucas would have chickened out on such a possibility, opting instead for something more accidental than a heartwrenching defeat. And so goes the notion of watching Jackson kick Hayden Christensen's rear.Now here we get to see what could have happened, since the two team up again in director Doug Liman's Jumper, a movie so filled with X-Men's Nightcrawler-styled effects of teleportation, that it doesn't look special anymore. But Doug too steered clear and offered somewhat of a truce. Based on the novel by Steven Gould, Jumper tells the tale of two opposing sides, the Jumpers who have the ability to travel the world for free and basically do what they want without consequence, and the Paladins, who see green at the Jumpers wondrous god-like ability, and make it their moral duty to destroy all these freaks of nature, by posing as various government entities from the CIA to the NSA in their attempts to impose authority.So on one corner, we have David Rice (Christensen), your regular 15 year old loser who grows up to be, well, a 15 year old stuck in the body of an adult, whose career is to borrow interest free loans from banks without their consent of course, and to woo the girl of his dreams, Millie (Rachel Bilson, in yet another seductive temptress role, and a major annoyance in the movie unfortunately). When things start to heat up from both the romance angle, and from Paladin Roland (Jackson), along comes Paladin hunter-killer Griffin (Jamie Bell)) to show David the light.It's quite standard fare for an action movie, hinging primarily on its gimmicky teleportation one trick pony. And the pony has been ridden fairly exhaustively in this less than 90 minute movie, without any signs of assistance from a narrative that could engage further than it being one of those regular, run of the mill teenage romance action adventure. With its Star Wars baggage, I laughed when Diane Lane was introduced, because her character serves little purpose, and negligible offering of an emotional depth or development to characters. The best bit of course is to expect that Star Wars styled reference from a mile away, and waiting for the inevitable punchline to be delivered was nothing short of the expected.Even then, the Jumpers ability has shades of the Butterfly Effect, but without the time travel element of course, only spatial travel. And I wish I had the ability too for obvious reasons, and probably lapse into the decadent lifestyle that David Rice leads, but the first thing I'll do of course is to teleport myself to the other cinema halls just to check out what better stuff are playing than this disappointing movie.",Jumper

Since the wife vetoed anything horror, I've decided that Jumper will have to do. And it was exactly what I expected, plus a bit of bad acting I can't understand from such prominent actors.This boy discovers that he can teleport through space instantaneously. After the thrill of the initial idea wears off, he goes back to his old life, trying to rekindle lost love. And then the bad guys come. After a few action scenes that seem taken right from the Elektra movie, the plot becomes completely random and pointless.

19,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Good beginning, bad ending",6,26 June 2008,"Jumper, I remember when this was released, I had no interest in seeing it, I mean, this movie just looked too over done and was hoping it would flop. It did make number one at the box office, but was getting terrible reviews, so I was pretty sure I wouldn't want to see this even on rental. But I decided to go ahead and give it a shot. What would I have to loose? It was a free rental; so I watched it the other day and actually I was pretty surprised, now I did like most of the movie. But there were some pretty silly moments here and there that I didn't like. I mean, I love Samuel L. Jackson, who doesn't? The man is awesome at yelling and cursing, but the line ""There are always consequences!"" was a little too cheesy, not to mention what was with the sno-cone look? But I thought the effects and story was pretty cool for what it was.David is a teen who doesn't exactly have a loving father, a school where everyone picks on him, except for his crush, Millie, and has discovered that he can do something pretty cool, he can jump from where he is to anywhere he wants too in the world. He takes the chance and runs away, he robs a few banks to make it on his own and is living the high life. He even comes back to his home town 8 years later, taking Millie to Rome on a plane making it look like he's just successful in life. But he has a problem, things are too good to be true when these men who are witch hunters track him down, the leader, Rolland, is on his tail to kill him. But another jumper, Griffin, decides to help David and they team up to battle against Rolland.Jumper is a fun movie at times, but I felt like the ending just collapsed, the story had good concepts. Just I thought it could be predictable and the girlfriend of his, Millie, I mean, I know she restrained a bit, but when David finally tells her, she does still accept everything pretty well. But I know how the audience is, they want them to be together, come on, two hot actors, they definitely want their hotness to be combined, right? Well, as for a recommendation, I am glad that I waited for the rental, because honestly, this movie was a little silly at times, but it's worth the look. It has cool effects, a decent cast, and makes me want to be a jumper as well.6/10",Jumper

21,Buddy-51,for armchair travelers only,4,15 March 2008,"David Rice (Hayden Christensen) is what is known in paranormal circles as a ""jumper,"" one of only a handful of specially-gifted individuals who have the ability to transport themselves from one corner of the globe to another at will (if nothing else, such a talent sure cuts down on a person's transportation costs, no small thing in this age of $4.00/gallon gas). Obviously working below his pay-grade here, Samuel L. Jackson plays Roland, the leader of a group of religious fanatics who, believing only God should have the power to be in more than one place at a time, roam the earth seeking out and destroying all the jumpers they can get their hands on.Essentially a travelogue masquerading as a thriller, ""Jumper"" takes a reasonably promising premise and turns it into inane wish-fulfillment drivel. There are more holes in the plot than there are wormholes for the jumpers to pass through, and the final action sequences border on the incoherent. The movie mistakes hectic activity for excitement and leaves most of its earnest performers stranded high and dry with little to do but play second fiddle to all the hyper-kinetic visuals and special effects going on around them (the gifted Diane Lane, in particular, is woefully wasted as the mother who abandoned David when he was five). Ah well, at least they got a few all-expenses-paid trips to some of the world's most prestigious locales as compensation.Indeed, the one redeeming grace is that the movie takes us to a number of highly photogenic tourist spots around the globe, from the Empire State Building to the pyramids at Giza to, most memorably, the Coliseum in Rome. That last sequence alone is almost worth the price of admission.",Jumper

23,Robert_duder,Unique action film that could have been more but does well the way it is,8,5 March 2008,"It might have taken awhile but Anakin Skywalker himself Hayden Christensen returns to the big screen in an action film that really delivers when it comes to stunning special effects, beautiful scenery and a great plot with some good performances. Jumper might be one of the first truly worthwhile action films of 2008 having a lot to live up to from 2007. It is true what many reviewers are saying that Jumper could have been even more than what it turned out to be but for what it is...it's definitely worthwhile. Jumper felt to a certain degree toned down from maybe their original expectations. Director Doug Liman certainly knows action having directed the enormously successful Mr. and Mrs. Smith (although I can't say I was a big fan---see my review) and The Bourne Identity which redefined action really. So he did have a lot to live up to but maybe a bit of a weaker script to work with. Nonetheless he had some incredible feats to pull off. The film single handedly, in a single jump so to speak, takes you from Egypt, New York, Toronto, Paris, Rome, Tokyo and so much more all filmed on location. They do a terrific job of giving us the background on the hero (or anti-hero as the case may be) and really set up the story for us.As previously mentioned Hayden Christensen plays David Rice, a troubled youngster who inadvertently discovers he can 'warp' or 'jump' from location to location with ease. This changes his life and gives him freedom to escape his current life. Christensen is really terrific in the role. I think better than he ever was in the Star Wars films. I think he has some great potential in this type of role and could really appeal to action fans. Rachel Bilson is the object of Christensen's affections. She is good in her role but I think she's better than this. I don't think they gave her a lot to work with and she was really just eye candy, which is great because she is beautiful and her and Christensen have decent chemistry but I just think Bilson is capable of more which is unfortunate to use her in such a way. Samuel L. Jackson is terrific, perhaps the shining performance of the film, as Jumper stalker Roland who seems to have complete leeway with any government faction to track jumpers. I think his character was a little underused too but he really was terrific and he deserves to come back again. Jamie Bell is also very good in a small but important role as Christensen's new found friend that can teach him more about jumping and those who want him dead. The cast really does work well together, and you definitely want more from them which is good if they plan to serialize the story which they could easily do.I think one of the things that immediately makes Jumper so watchable is the incredible locales as I touched on. They actually filmed inside the Colosseum in Italy, and the Egyptian Pyramids at Gaza and so forth. The action is almost non-stop with some really incredible fight sequences. The unique aspect of the 'jumping' really makes for the fights to be something different. One of the things I think they do a great job with is really establishing the story and the main character and his Dad and their relationship. I think they probably are looking at serializing the entire Jumper series although I have a feeling we wouldn't see some of the key players coming back like Christensen, Bilson or Jackson (which is really disappointing.) It seems more like the type of film that will end up having the cast replaced which is unfortunate. Regardless this particular installment is a decent action film that anyone can enjoy with plenty of heroics and a great story. Worthy to see in the theater. 8/10",Jumper
24,Lejink,Wooly jumper,5,26 October 2010,"Could have titled my summary ""loud jumper"" too, given the pounding sound affects (not to mention modern rock-oriented soundtrack music constantly playing in the background) to this sci-fi adventure, which very much seems to be aiming its sights at a similar, possibly slightly younger audience than the successful ""Matrix"" prototype.Being a sci-fi fan, especially of the time and space travel type tale, I willingly allowed myself to regress some 35 years or so and try to engage with the youthful protagonist at the heart of the action. Thus I actually I enjoyed the first half an hour or so of the film best with geeky Hayden Christiansen giving it his best Peter Parker / Clark Kent bit, getting pushed to one side by his muscle-headed rival for his would-be girlfriend's attention and seemingly coming a cropper on thin ice in a seemingly fatal accident caused indirectly by afore-mentioned bozo competition. Is he dead...well we're only ten minutes or so into the film so draw your own conclusion. Most kids would get off on the idea of teleporting everywhere but the narrative, for me, hits the skids with the emergence of its sub-plot of a group of inter-galactic avengers called Paladins, hunting down Christiansen and his type down the centuries. Their head honcho is an obviously cash-strapped Samuel L Jackson with one of his more out-there looks yet, a cropped albino haircut while the story also takes in for no other reason I can think of than the Transatlantic take, an uneasy alliance with another ""jumper"", a rebellious young Londoner, played in modern-day ""Artful Dodger"" style by Jamie Bell.There's a sub Darth Vader twist at the conclusion too, involving Christiansen's long lost Paladin mother and certainly plenty room for a sequel (which I see from IMDb notes is currently in production). In the end I was reasonably entertained and I suppose the effects were well staged but on the whole I found it just too derivative of some and more besides of the antecedents mentioned above for the film to stamp its own identity on my psyche.",Jumper

He just has no emotion and is like a block of wood on screen. And Rachel Bilson plays the typical girlfriend in movies like this. She's there mainly to be rescued and give the ""hero"" a reason to do something totally stupid.Hayden plays David, a jumper, meaning he can transport his body and material things to where ever he wants. He finds out there are others like him. There is a group called the Paladines who want to kill jumpers. Why?? We have no idea except that lead Paladine Roland says only God should be able to do what you do. Roland has all these sophisticated tools to find jumpers and can even go with them through there time holes.One question I had is why did the director think putting white chalk all over Samuel Jackson's hair would be a great idea.

But, these so-called Jumpers are not allowed to exist, so there are agents called Paladins to exterminate the Jumpers.

The reason my rating is high because the action and yes, the acting. The action is intense and the fights are done well. The acting is actually good.

Now, in high school, Millie is beautiful and popular but David gets picked on. You see, David lives very poorly in Ann Arbor with his alcoholic father, having a mother who took off when David was in kindergarten. One day, Davie presents Millie with a beautiful snowglobe of the Eiffel Tower. She is quite pleased, having a yen to visit Europe. But, alas, a nasty teen named Mark takes the globe and throws it onto a neighboring pond. Its winter. Mighty peeved, David walks out on the ice to retrieve the globe, although Millie cautions him not to. Just as he picks up the globe, the ice cracks and David is plunged into the icy water, risking death. All at once, he dreams he is at the library and, voila, he lands wet and cold on the book-surrounded floor. Thus, David discovers that he is a ""jumper"", able to teleport himself wherever he wants to go. Before long, David runs away from home, ""borrows"" some money from a bank vault and explores his new talent. Before exiting, he leaves the globe in front of Millie's house as a clue that he may be alive. Flash forward several years and David decides to return to Ann Arbor. Hoping to catch a glimpse of Millie, David finds out she works at a local bar and he goes in quietly. After nearly getting beat up when the same nasty dude goes after him, David surprises all by getting out of the situation. Soon, he convinces Millie to go to Europe with him. But, there are problems. David meets another jumper, Griffin (Jamie Bell) who gives him some key pointers and warns him that a group of misguided zealots, led by Samuel L. Jackson, are out to ""eliminate"" all of the world's jumpers. All heck breaks loose in Rome, where David and Millie are touring the Colisseum and barely make it out alive. Will David be able to keep one step ahead of the opposition, which may include his long-lost MOTHER (Diane Lane)? Whew! This fine movie has excellent action sequences and breathtaking world scenery. Imagine having a picnic on top of the Sphinx, if that is your desire? Also, staying ahead of the pursuers takes some inventive twists and turns. The young cast is also quite wonderful, especially Bell who once impressed the world in Billy Elliott.

30,tabuno,Television is Better,6,16 January 2019,"24 August 2013. Interestingly, television series Heroes (2006) or The Lost Room (2006) seem to have trumped the special kid theme much better than movies, at least this one. Even considering movies, X-Men (2000) series has already pretty much covered the same ground.What this movie pretty much relies on is the supposedly need special effects, used over and over of one particular ability. But it gets worn out after a time. The characters are pretty two-dimensional with the stuck up spoiled kid, the naive girlfriend, and the good/bad guys. The A-lister Diane Lane as the movie is wasted to an extent. And the presumptuous belief that this movie was good enough to deserve a sequel-like ending, hoping for a second movie follow-up left the movie last scenes pretty much with loose ends that would remain so. The didn't have an ending in the traditional sense, if any.While the movie was decent with its easy to follow-up plot, interesting action scenes, it really didn't offer up much more. Unfortunately, the animated super-hero actor dog Bolt (2008) or The Incredibles (2004) actually offer even more emotive relational and coming of age sense than Jumper.

31,ironhorse_iv,This movie just jump the shark,6,17 October 2012,"Jumper sounds like a good idea, but it's was execute so badly. It's was suicidal, like jumping off a bridge. It could have been better. Directed by Doug Liman, the director of Swingers and the Bourne Identity. It stars Hayden Christensen and Samuel L. Jackson in reverse roles from their previous film 'Star Wars', with Hayden playing the supposedly good guy and Sam as the bad guy. Hayden Christensen is the jumper (the teleporting man) who can jump into any place he touch or see and Samuel Jackson is trying to stop him. That pretty much sum up the plot. Hayden Christensen is semi-talented, and he seems to be trying to give these realistic, struggling young male performances in all his films, but to be honest, it could have been salvaged if it at least had a decent main character. He spent of the movie using his powers for wrong reasons. Robbing banks and stealing stuff. Nothing likable about the main character, he wasn't a hero...he didn't save people, he was just some selfish guy. Yes—this is the hero, people. Hayden spent every fight scene tied up and unable to do anything, his acting didn't help either. Samuel Jackson's character is a bit better. Samuel Jackson's character belong to a religious group call the Paladins, whom motivation is that all jumpers will go evil. I'm sure he said that line in the film. I think he's clearly right seeing how Hayden used his powers just for himself. Jumpers use their powers to commit crimes. They start off small, like Hayden Christensen's character, who robbed a bank in the beginning of the film, and eventually move up to more crimes more heinous. Why on earth, does a Jumper need to steal a car? But I agree, saying ""only God should have the power to be everywhere"" was a bad description of an Jumpers ability. But to me, it made Samuel's character sound insane. How ironic that the only way those religious fanatics could defend their beliefs was by using technology and science to get rid of the jumpers by the way? Samuel's character also sport horrible white hair as if all that electricity use to get jumpers over the years burn his hair. Supporting cast is Jamie Bell as the loose cannon best friend Griffin who hunts Paladins is even better than the main character and should have been starting this movie. And then there's the really hot Rachel Bilson who plays the love interest. Mostly she just stands around wearing tight outfits, looking doe-eyed, and occasionally shows us her underwear. Sadly she doesn't get much character development. Last Diane Lane as Hayden's mother who really doesn't need to be talk muchshe only appear when the plot is needed. Without giving out too much about the movie, I do want to say. The book that the movie was based off (of the same name) that lacked the entire Paladins part. It was about the boy, his relationships with his mother and father, his trying to fit into normal society where he WAS the only jumper. The book is a million times better than the movie. The only similarities are jumping, and the names (not personality) of the characters. I do like how the story has so much back history and mythology injected into it that it was obvious the director was trying to create another movie franchise. It's a bit of a risk. If the franchise doesn't take off you end up with a story that's weighed down with all lots of useless mythological references and terminology and that's what happen. The ending left us with a cliffhanger that probably never get finished due to the movie, having mix results at the box office. If they do make Reflex (The second book of Jumper) , please make it better than this first film.",Jumper

Let's face it, the explanation for these guys becoming Jumpers is just absurd. I'm sure they could have come up with a myriad of ideas for them to become Jumpers.David is the perfect example of an immature youngster who takes advantage of his new-found powers. He is little more than a thief living the good life on money he promised to return, but apparently never does.The very idea of being able to 'jump' from one place to another is enticing. The visual effects are fantastic. So, the Jumpers are hunted by Roland (Samuel L. Jackson). The film doesn't really clarify much, does it? Who is Roland? Where does he come from? Why is he hunting the Jumpers? Purely because ""no-one but God should have their powers"", as he put it? That's selfish, and pure jealousy if you ask me! They couldn't come up with a better reason? This film has the premise and the opportunity to be so much more, to be a lot more intriguing.

33,Rodrigo_Amaro,Forget the highly and downer reviews. Just watch it and have some fun.,10,28 June 2010,"I think I am the only person in the IMDb or even in the world who really gives this movie a 10 stars rating and mostly because I didn't take it so seriously as most viewers tend to do and I indulged myself to just watch and be entertained and it turned out to be great. It was heavily and sometimes wrongfully criticized by a vast majority of people who simply haven't allowed themselves to see what ""Jumper"" was all about and just have a good time with it. I must say this: people were more harsh with their points of view than film critics. One of the worst writers I ever had the opportunity to read published that the movie was bad because the casting crew made terrible choices with the lead character played by Hayden Christensen, he's girlfriend in the story played by Rachel Bilson also was bad and the movie could be so much better if Jamie Bell (whose screen presence was more effective) was selected to play the main character. Finally she wrote something worth reading and so truthful. The story: David (Christensen) is a young man with an incredible and strange gift: He can teleport himself to anywhere. In few minutes he can go to Paris or Egypt easily and he lives like a wealthy rich man (by stealing banks). He discovers this gift has existed for centuries and finds himself in a war that has been happening for thousands of years between ""Jumpers"" (as they are called) and he's hunted by Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) a mysterious hunter killer of ""Jumpers"". David is helped by Griffin (Jamie Bell) a more experienced Jumper who tells everything about his obscure powers and how to use it to stop Roland. In the middle of this battle back and forth in many countries there's a distractive and not interesting love story between David and Millie (Rachel) a crush of a long date since his times as a shy teenager.What attracted me to this film was the impressive idea of being teleported to anywhere with an incredible speed. It makes you wonder what David and Griffin are going to do next; but perhaps people found out that the screenplay was senseless, it submerged into superfluous directions and it didn't get a moral lesson towards the initial troubles of David. I found that the writing was just careless in presenting a better development to the idea of what being a Jumper is, the romance was unnecessary and a more darker film could be more exciting for the audience that really was disappointed with, as they say a mediocre result. To love is to accept the good and the bad things and that's why I love this movie, because it's not perfect but it ain't all that bad. About the casting: Christensen and Bilson were badly miscast, they were only here because it would attract more people to watch them (strong names) and the movie needed an unknown actor to take their roles; Jamie Bell is excellent as Griffin, his presence overshadows the whole casting and makes ""Jumper"" a very worth seeing movie. He's got some of the best lines, the most funny moments and you're gonna care more for him than the lead character when Roland is making his dangerous moves on the team. Jackson is a good villain but it could be more frightening, towards the ending his character seems to lose his evil ways and becomes more and more vulnerable. Doug Liman made a good effort but it would better if he had stayed directing the Bourne series (he made the pretty decent first film). I know I'm alone in the crowd making such positive statements but I can't lie, I had a lot of fun watching it. It is one of these movies that says: leave your brain to rest a little, forget everything and have some good time. 10/10",Jumper

And i was wrong, this movie is sucked bigtime. The special effects were nice but the plot (bad guys hunting good guys) and character development was terrible.This movie had a lot of potential to be good but it failed miserably. The movie starts out pretty weird then it changes and gets a little better. But near the end, everything is happening so fast and it seemed rushed. The writers ignored all major factors to tell a great story. They didn't mention why THEY ARE JUMPERS, and HOW THEY BECOME JUMPERS, also why did Paladins want to kill jumpers (Griffin says that the Paladins been hunting Jumpers for centuries because Jumpers have powers and could do whatever, but they don't exactly explain why) You can hardly identify with any character, there's barely no development and especially the end turned into a huge disappointment to me. Hayden Christensen's character David was a real idiot, i mean he acted so stupid to his girlfriend and his father. Rachel Bilson's character Millie was really stupid, i mean she didn't even ask David any questions about how and where he was 8 yrs ago and she was very annoying. Griffin was also annoying with his accent but was better acted.The ending was weird. It turns out that his mom left him when he was five when she learns he's a jumper! what kind of mom ditches her kid when she learns he's from a rival gang? then she informs him that she's gonna have to kill him! she leaves us with the line ""I love you. That's why I'm giving you a head start."" (Because she has to kill him.). Then afterwards, you see David walk outside and he see's Millie standing in the cold by herself so he goes towards her and starts talking. Then later, they continue walking and she says ""surprise me"" (about going on a date) and the movie ends from thereAfter re-watching the film, it was still pretty bad and I noticed more of the bad acting and plot holes and things that didn't seem right. Hopefully the sequel will be better, it has a lot of chance and should be better if focused more on the story and explain things. It should also be longer than 90 mins.",Jumper
36,damianphelps,Falls Short of Great,7,17 December 2020,Good film with a creative idea that provides more evidence of Hayden Christensen's acting abilities.

37,insomniac_rod,"Pop-corn fun with the kind of plot that makes you wonder ""What Would I do?"". For instants, it makes you feel ""powerful"". Just for instants.",7,9 August 2009,"I can understand the high criticism on this movie. Well I understand but not share it. Please, watch ""Jumper"" without expectations and just as a pop-corn film to enjoy any Sunday afternoon.The main problem of the movie is that it's important sub-plots do not get fully explored and are left behind. I mean, you don't know ""what happened"" to certain character's fate (such as Griffin, SLJ's bad-ass character, the fugitive mother, the bully, etc.). And some other situations just happen in such an easy manner that the phrase ""ohh it's a movie!"" hits you in the face. For example, Rachel Bilson's character falling in love quickly and easily and traveling with his childhood sweetheart without thinking it after years of not knowing about him.On the positive aspect, we get very good f/x and best of all, we get extremely beautiful settings including the Gizza Pyramids, the mythic Spynxh, The Colisseum, China, Paris, London, etc. That's an accomplishment I admire.As a geek myself; I just want to admit without regret that this is movie is a guilty pleasure and made me fantasize about having such powers and traveling. I'm an accomplished traveler and I've been in most of the places shown in the movie; and for once, I wondered ""I would love to be in his position"". Oh, I just watched the movie because of the Sphynx cover. I have to admit it too.The plot is one of those that make you wish you could live it; I mean, what would you do if you had the chance to travel ANYWHERE in the world? And not only for tourist intentions, no, you can do WHATEVER you want until some weird special agency tries to kill you. But that's not as simple as it sounds; ""Jumper"" mildly tries to connect sub-plots that deal with a not so lucky childhood of our lead character, his fugitive mom, a bully from high-school who later appears and gets what he deserves, bank robberies, dark ancient ultra right sects who act ""in God's name"", and more.Overall, this is popcorn fun that won't harm anyone. Take it for what it is.",Jumper
38,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Too jumpy and poorly executed,3,18 May 2008,"The first warning sign of a bad superhero-esquire action movie is one that gets released in February. The distributors of ""Jumper"" clearly knew they had a rotten egg on their hands and released it in the month that only turns out a successful romantic comedy once every 5 years. They were very right, as ""Jumper"" fails to do everything a successful film of the genre has done.""Jumper"" is a film about a boy named David (Christiansen) who discovers he can teleport at age 15, runs away from home and robs banks to keep himself independent and then runs into problems when he finds people are out to kill his kind (yes, there are more than one) and those ""hunters,"" led by Rolland (Jackson) have been fighting a war with Jumpers since forever. And of course David's childhood crush Millie (Bilson) gets caught up in the mix.The premise is classic comic book, a mixture of ""X-Men"" and ""Underworld"" a war waged between two groups, one with special powers, over the ability to ""play God"" in terms of being in many places at nearly the same time. The concept is not new, but it's not stale either, but the failure of the writers to take the ""origin approach"" that has made superhero films successful today, makes ""Jumper"" hollow and uninteresting.Christiansen is a great actor, but not exactly successful post-Star Wars, so his move to take the role seems justified. Had the film been created better to give his character more depth and actual audience empathy, Christiansen probably would have done a great job with the part, it's just unfortunate the film tells the story in a way that is confusing and well...jumpy.The concept undoubtedly leads to unique action sequences, but there is no significant linear motion in the film; it seems to be just getting started when it ends. That's okay--if there's interest in what happens--but no interest in any of the characters or their dilemmas makes it really hard to care what might lie ahead in the battle between jumpers and ""paladins"" as they are called.Basically, David does some stupid stuff, gets Millie involved, gets himself into more trouble and then there's a lot of teleporting and electric shocking going on. It's a pretty insignificant mess considering no effort is made toward the characters--the most important piece of a better than good action film. So other than some action sequences of note, a cool concept and one that pulls some of its own interest for at least the first portion of the film, ""Jumper"" falls way short for today's action/sci-fi/superhero movie standards.",Jumper
39,Anonymous_Maxine,Interesting but disappointing adaptation,5,18 June 2008,"I read Jumper years and years ago, but I remember the most interesting thing about the book was the part (which was at least much of the first half, maybe more) that showed the kid learning to use his power of teleportation, and the adventures he had. It is one of those powers that can lead to nearly endless possibilities, that I would spend hours imagining what I would do with if I had it. In the movie we see how David learns of his power, in an incident with a school bully that leads to him floating terrified down a river underneath the ice (I didn't know ice formed over moving water), and then suddenly finds himself instantly teleported to safety.Clearly, the idea for the movie is endlessly fascinating, as are the possibilities. Unfortunately, instead of really doing something interesting with the story, they opted to just show us this guy who uses it purely for material gain and does nothing with his life except sit around his fancy apartment until some bad jumpers and some jumper-hunters can turn up and turn the movie into your basic, run-of-the-mill special effects nonsense. As soon as David figures out his powers and starts to feel comfortable using them, the movie reverts into every other 90 minute special effects movie you've ever seen. What a waste.I'm reminded of the hugely disappointing Hollow Man, which also began with endless possibilities and just blew it in favor of some cute special effects shots. I have been unimpressed with Hayden Christensen ever since the new Star Wars films, and Samuel L. Jackson is just wasting his time completely here. Then again, the movie is a cash cow. The premise is interesting, there are big names attached, and clearly the studios really believed in it, which you can tell just by glancing down the list of filming locations. For obvious reasons, they traveled all over the world to make this movie. Maybe that was part of the reason so many big names were attached? I may not have been able to resist the big paycheck and world travel myself, regardless of how dumb the script may have been",Jumper
40,Vartiainen,More convoluted than it needs to be,4,30 March 2019,"Jumper, based on a book series by Steven Gould, is about a young man who in his teenage years finds that he can teleport, seemingly without limitations. Cut some years later and he's living the high life. As much money as he can steal, all the best locations, the best clothes, the best parties. You name it. But then a religious group named the Paladins gets on his tail and suddenly he's thrust into a war that has raged for centuries.It sounds cool. I'll give it that. It even looks cool. The film has some really good locations and takes advantage of the fact that the scenes can happen literally anywhere on Earth. That being said, it is a bit of a mess. And at the center of it are the Paladins. They're not in the original books, if you're wondering. Rather they were added to the film to give the story's antagonists some flair. I presume. And they are led by a character played by Samuel L. Jackson. So that's a plus. But that still doesn't remove the fact they don't make much sense within the narrative. Their weapons are strange, the group as a whole doesn't connect to anything, the religious overtones don't make much sense and as a whole they're just nonsensical.The film is also pretty badly acted. Jackson and Hayden Christensen, playing the lead, are not bad, but the script holds them back. The rest are all kinds of shades of bland.Still, the action scenes are pretty nice. The special effects look suitably impressive and I do like the tricks they came up for teleporters. Summoning things out of nowhere, taking your opponents to different places, popping in and out of the fight. It's good stuff.As a whole the film is pretty brainless. It has some flash and colour to it so if you're just looking for an easy scifi film to watch, there are worse options. Just keep your expectations low and you'll be alright.",Jumper
41,FiendishDramaturgy,"It offers action, intrigue, suspense, and some really awesome effect ideas.",7,5 January 2009,"I thought this film was much better than the lackluster ratings given here at IMDb. The story idea was intelligent, the writing was creative, the dialog was anything but trite, and the overall execution was slick and enjoyable.This film suffered disassociative franchise sickness, plain and simple. Everyone was so sick and tired of Hayden Christensen from the Star Wars prequel trilogy, punctuated by George Lucas's replacing David Prowse's image with CHRISTENSEN'S at the end of Jedi of the Original Trilogy, and everyone basically transposed their disdain of Hayden's face onto his newest work, Jumper. Unfair, but completely understandable.That not withstanding, this is a fun movie. It may not teach us anything, deliver enlightenment to us, or elevate us as a race and/or species, but it IS entertaining, amusing, and fun.All in all? It's fine for a Friday/Saturday night movie, as it offers action, intrigue, suspense, and some really awesome effect ideas.It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Jumper
42,Chris Knipp,"Swifter than the wings of thought, alas",6,7 March 2008,"People see this movie as a great premise that went south, but it just feels like an intensification of all that's soul-destroying about CGI and big-budget action movies--the way they can visualize everything and thus atrophy the spirit and the imagination of the spectator. Note this is an adaptation of a novel, a thing made of words. Those are the real ""jumpers""--that's why Shakespeare called them ""the wings of thought."" They let us imagine things for ourselves. 'Jumper' wouldn't dream of doing that. It has to show us everything, and more.One day a high-schooler named David Rice (Hayden Christensen) is on the verge of drowning in a freezing lake, when he suddenly finds himself providentially transported to the floor of the Ann Arbor public library. He knows the talent for ""teleporting"" this reveals must be good for something more. . . And presto! Flash-forward to David as a twenty-something neo-yuppie in a Manhattan loft full of expensive boy-toys, with a wall of picture postcards to initiate ""jumps"" to Fiji, the Sphinx, or Rome from, as well as a huge stash of dough he's nicked from bank vaults. It seems he can take stuff along with him, when he teleports, and fly through walls, however thick. That David's fun is selfish is wordlessly communicated by showing him ignoring the Katrina disaster on TV. I guess he could have teleported people out of New Orleans before they drowned, or jumped-in piles of stolen dough for poor black people.Instead, apart from dodging the cops who're tracking the bank robberies and living the life of a priapic post-adolescent jet-setter, David woos his high-school sweetheart, Millie (Rachel Bilson), by taking her to see the Colosseum, which she finds really ""cool."" Along with providing too-easy images and robbing the dialogue of any intelligent function, David S. Goyer, Jim Uhls, and Simon Kinberg's dumb screenplay makes changes of venue even more meaningless by providing characters in Jumper who have no sense of culture or of place. The whole Millie thing doesn't seem to fit. It feels like part of another story about a more sympathetic character, which is what Stephen Gould's source novel is. The book has been completely sliced and diced here.In Rome with Millie, David means to hide his peculiar ability--it's not something you want to have to explain--and they go there by plane like you or me and take a taxi into town. But then, wouldn't you know it, it's closing time at the Colosseum, and he just has to break the rules and ""jump"" inside to open the gate. Couldn't they wait till tomorrow? No, being a jumper means basing all your life on instant gratification.Then along comes trouble in the person of Hayden's Star Wars prequel colleague Samuel L. Jackson as a ""Paladin""--an ancient, also medieval, knightly title more recently adopted for a Dungeons and Dragons good guy, but perhaps best known to American pop consumers as Richard Boone's hero of ""Have Gun Will Travel."" This Paladin has more than a gun. He's got a sawed-off light saber--and a hell of a grudge, as well as a weird cropped white hairdo. Dungeons and Dragons and Richard Boone aside, from the jumper point of view Paladins are poison. Maybe they just hate anybody's having so much fun; anyway they're out to eliminate David, having waged war on jumpers for centuries.That must mean there are other jumpers--something David hasn't caught on to till now. Presto! Here's Griffin (another Dungeons and Dragons title), a far more experienced teleporter with a desert retreat, a mass of unruly hair, and two things David conspicuously lacks: manic energy and an ability to project emotion. Jamie Bell livens things up and acts as foil to the pretty but unengaged Christiansen, who when robbed of the opportunity to smolder or cry goes quite blank. No amount of jumping arouses any sign of emotion in him.It's ironic that this movie had a big enough budget to shoot on location in exotic places. Because the trouble is ""jumping"" is a change of location that's unearned and without any particular plot logic. It could be just as well anywhere; that's the point. So why bother to shoot Colosseum scenes in the actual Colosseum? Especially when the heroine's only reaction to it is ""cool""? 'Jumper' gets increasingly more frantic and kinetic, culminating in a fight between David and Griffin (over some difference of opinion, I'm not sure what) in which they flit from continent to continent and move buildings. Stuff catches fire and explodes--what's a budget for? And the more the action speeds up the more pointless it all seems. The increasing use of CGI is one more thing that makes the locations seem a waste, since the resulting images are so artificial.This was an adolescent fantasy so the boy has to have a mom and dad. The source novel is a book--actually this incorporates a sequel-- for young adults blending SCI-FI with the post-S.E. Hinton realistic mode. Young Davy's parents split up early on, and in the book the boy first took to jumping to escape from the abuse of his drunken father (Michael Rooker)--a cause that gives the story's escapism a far greater poignancy. The movie, with its focus on flashy visuals, ""jumps"" from chapter to chapter too fast for such subtleties to bloom. The screenplay--which winds up losing most of the humanity of Gould's concept--starts out with the girlfriend instead. David's mom is Diane Lane--and though she ""cut out"" when he was little, she knew about him all along. But Lane, as too often, is wasted here, her story squeezed into a little belated exposition. Somewhere this David missed out on a good spanking. And the movie missed out on a good rewrite. 'Jumper' seems a very hasty effort, as if the filmmakers were adolescents with ADD themselves and couldn't wait to get to their fat paychecks.",Jumper

Our hero is being chased by sad face white haired (trying to enact like agent Smith minus the white hair) Paladin (Jackson) who are assigned to kill jumpers as they think that only God must have such power but for unknown reasons, maybe just because they don't have this special abilities to jump any where to impress their girlfriend or rob banks, or they have been appointed by God because as per the Paladins only God should have the power of telekinetic.The screenplay is week and the character development is poor, the director had failed to communicate the viewers the reason how the jumpers got their power and why Paladin wanted to kill them. Acting is just average and Samuel L. Jackson is wasted, Rachel Bilson irritates, Jamie Bell was decent but his whereabouts at the end of the movie is still a mystery. The climax suggests that the director was in a hurry to wrap up the shooting hence hurriedly and abruptly ends the movie with certain unanswered doubts.Overall the movie is a disappointment on many fronts and i will said again that they have ruined a beautiful script which could've been turned into a memorable movie.

Diane Lane does also have a small role in this movie, and fit the role well, she was good in the limited amount of screen time she received. Max Theoroit was alright in his small amount of time in the film, so was AnnaSophia Robb.

The only bright spot at his teens years, he has a long time crush on Millie (AnnaSophia Robb). When he tried to present a gift to his would-be girlfriend but he got interrupted by a school bully (Jesse James) by throwing the present at the thin ice. When David tries to get it back, he falls in the ice and finds himself trapped. Then suddenly David finds himself at the library, which he doesn't understand at first. Tired of coming home to his drunken father, he decides to run away to New York to start a new life. When he begins to control and experience his unique gift, he starts by robbing banks at first or departing himself to places he knows by memory.Then many years has passed, David (Hayden Christensen) has grown into a young man by experiencing life by going many cities, different countries he wants. Then David finds himself stalked by a mysterious man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), who wants to kill David for the gift that no man or woman should have. Which Ronald called these people ""Jumpers"", which he has to hunting them for years. Now David returns to his childhood home to make up lost time with Millie (Rachel Bilson) that he still has a crush on.

Then David finds out, there's more like him... especially a wild young British man named Griffin (Jamie Bell) warms David that Ronald and other hunters, who called themselves ""Paladins"". They will stop at nothing to destroy all ""Jumpers"", whatever if they are good or bad. Now David and Griffin find themselves on the run, while David tries to hide from Millie to tell her the truth.Directed by Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Go, Mr. & Mrs. Smith) made an above average, although disappointing sci-fi/adventure that misses on Character Development from the supporting characters that could have used some major fleshing out. Christensen looks the part but like his recent performances, he's quite stiff and there's almost no joy in his role. I thought this film could focus more on the younger David character at the first, i felt Thieriot was enjoy his role as David briefly than the adult David did. Best performance from this movie is Bell, who seems to be having a hell of a time with his part. But the screenplay by David S. Goyer (Blade Trilogy, Batman Begins, Dark City), Jim Uhls (Fight Club) and Simon Kinberg (X-Men:The Last Stand, xXx:State of the Union) tries to make this story coherent by adding sub-plots that doesn't always pay-off & it's also feels tight for everything that runs for under 90 minutes. What should have been 2 hour feature.The single DVD edition has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes an interesting audio commentary by the director, screenwriter:Kinberg and producer:Lucas Foster (Equilibrium, Man on Fire ""2004"", Street Kings) & three featurettes. If you are an major fan of ""Jumper"". There's an two-disc special edition that is presented in Widescreen, includes DTS track, additional special features and a digital copy of the movie if necessary. Overall ""Jumper"" is a watchable movie that could have been much better. Some of Liman's stylish touches and energy on his previous features are still there. The cast are fine, although Rooker and Lane roles are disappointingly short. Some of the CGI effects and action sequences are nicely done but at times, they are more confusing than enjoyment.

This occurrence springs a sequence of events, where he leaves home, robs a bank without opening any locks and then starts living the good life with the stolen money. Unknown to him he is not the only 'jumper' out there and humankind is not wholly unaware of their existence...Actually there is a war going on between the Jumpers and the Paladins, a sect of human beings who deem this ability a travesty and hence aim to eliminate all Jumpers.A mildly hip and entertaining movie, which is suitable for a night out or in with some popcorn. Basically burning time, but there is nothing in this Highlander wannabee movie thats really intrigues, hence my surprise at finding out that a sequel is planned. A semi-successful super-hero story with no real heart and an extremely predictable dramatic structure. The magic and bleakness necessary for the movie to really work was substituted for rad cars, special effects, interesting locations and some nice camera-work. All in all a very rushed script and any promise that the movie had was killed off by the scripwriters focusing too much attention on making the movie feel like something taken out of a Michael Bay diary.Special effects are really cool (i.e. the very impressive London bus scene), but it is unable to cover the skin-deep script, which really could have been much more inventive, but seemed to only scratch any surface of the possibility set out by the basic plot.",Jumper
54,Matt_Layden,Too Many Loose Ends For Jumper.,4,19 February 2008,"After falling into a lake covered in ice, David Rice teleports himself into a public library. He leaves home and goes to New York to hone his skills, which he uses to rob banks. After 8 years David finds that he's not the only one, and that there's been a war going on for centuries. Now those people sworn to kill Jumpers are after him.Hayden Christensen was wooden as a board as Anakin in the Star Wars prequels, but out of nowhere showed he actually has some acting chops when he played a lying journalist in Shattered Glass. Well, now he's back in the sci/fi genre and for some reason he decides to jump back on that wooden board. I don't know why, but it seems that sci/fi films bring out the bad in him.Jumper is an intriguing idea, it has the opportunity to bring a new series to film. The idea of people who can teleport to anywhere at anytime has been done before yes, but now we have people who have been sworn to kill them and that they've been doing it for hundreds of years. Sounds pretty epic, but Jumper doesn't really jump into any of that, they only mention it. Why? I have no clue, to me it sounded more interesting then what they were actually showing us. The filmmakers had a great chance to go back in history and show us this war, as one character mentions, but not once do we get any idea of any of it. There is a lot more story to tell with these Jumpers, but we never get any of it, we only scratch the surface. Are they that confident that it will do so well that they will give a bit more in a sequel? Or did they really have no idea what they were doing and just hope the audience liked the jump scenes.Those jump scenes by the way are nicely done. No, they never reach the coolness of Nightcrawler from X-Men 2, but they are very well done. One second your in New York and the next your sitting on top of Big Ben in London. With a film like this you know the special effects will either make or break the film, because so much of it relies on that. The believability that these people are actually teleporting themselves to another location. They pulled it off for the most part. My complaints are pretty much what other people will probably have. They teleport in open area, for everyone to see, but unless there's a fight going on no one seems to notice, or care. Also, wouldn't Christensen be really fat by now? 8 years of teleporting means he never moves anywhere. He won't even slide 2 feet over on a couch to get a converter. Does teleporting burn calories as well? You know those people sworn to kill them, one is Rolan, played by Samuel L Jackson. Jackson does what he always does, be a bad ass mofo. Here is sports white hair and spews off some dialogue that only God should be at all places at once. Are they the good guys? After all, our so called hero is robbing banks and breaking Italian Collisuem rules. Christensen isn't really likable, so many people will end up routing for Jackson to take him out. They fight scenes are too special, they consist of jumping and using a device that Scorpion from Mortal Kombat should sue for. Once you take away all the jazz from the jumping, you're left with nothing really.The story is boring. Guy can jump, people find him and try to kill him, he gets away. In between he gets back together with a girl he use to like when he was a kid, they go to Rome because ""hey, all girls will put their lives on hold to go to Rome with a guy they knew back in Highschool but haven't seen for 8 years...and maybe I'll have sex with him too."" Bilson is cute, but she is given nothing to do besides ask questions. The real star here is Jamie Bell, who plays Griffin, another Jumper. He's the person we really want to follow in this story, he's funny, kicks ass and takes no crap from anyone.By the time the film is over you're left sitting in your seat asking yourself, but what about this and what about that. There are so many loose ends in Jumper it's funny. We never know what happens to his father, we never know what happens to Griffin, we are never given anything but a sentence for a back story on these people. Also, the last 5 minutes seems like a last minute addition to try to tie one of those loose ends up. It seems way too forced, but you know it has to happen because there is no way this film can end without them going back to it. These loose ends will most likely be sorted out in the sequel. That's how films like this are probably going to end now, leave so many things unanswered that there just has to be another one.Unless you want to see another special effects ridden sci/fi fest, skip Jumper cause there is no real substance. No real story or plot, no character development and no fun...well, there was a bit of fun, but there should have been so much more.",Jumper

The action scenes and special effects are simply incredible, but the story is not so marvelous. And every time I heard someone say ""ONLY GOD SHOULD HAVE THIS POWER"", it almost gave me the giggles. Soooo over the top. The acting is...well, it's OK. I don't think Hayden Christensen is ever going to be on anyone's Oscar shortlist, but this kind of role actually suits him fairly well. Rachel Bilson doesn't really have to do anything but look pretty and ask lots of annoying questions, so there's not much that I can say about her role. Sam Jackson was pretty cool as an ass kicking Paladin, but his role was pretty one-dimensional as well.Anyway, Jumper is still a very fun movie. The world of the Jumpers and the Paladins has enormous potential, maybe next time the acting and story will measure up to the visual effects.",Jumper

He discovers this gift has existed for centuries and finds himself in a war that has been raging for thousands of years between ""Jumpers"" and those who have sworn to kill them.This is the type of film where you go along with it. There's no need to have your millions of questions answered. Maybe, for some of you, the film needs to answer questions you will have after you've finished this film. But I'm one of those people who don't mind. In fact, I really didn't mind it during Spiderwick Chronicles and Cloverfield.Those three films have one thing in common: SHORT RUNNING TIME. You could've probably expect with it's time running 83 minutes that you'll probably have a serious let down. Of course, the director is Doug Liman! He's a great director. I just don't see the problem with adding about 30 more minutes to fill us in.On the other hand, having that to be sacrificed, you have the movie running in a fast pace. That's why you don't care who's who and what's what. You go along with it. One problem: LACKLUSTER ACTION SCENES. I will say that the action here is good but not great. The special effects are great but the whole jumping thing gets really old really fast.So this film turns out to be a huge let-down, lackluster, disappointing action film by Doug Liman.

Also, try to remember that most of those folk (the 'pros') never seem to know what type of movie they're reviewing, or who the target audience is, and what, exactly each 'type' of movie is trying to accomplish. Also, assume that they actually 'have' to review a certain number of movies, no matter whether it's their cup of tea or not, or they don't get paid. Having said all that, my review: This movie is actually pretty good, and pretty standard are for its target audience. The special effects are slickly executed, the acting, casting, and characterizations are all on par. There are some few problems in the story line that could use a little more exposition (such as the Paladins), and a few weak plot points.

Not even ten minutes into the movie, the main character not only accepted that he somehow has a mystical talent to jump around earth as if it was a talent for writing Christmas poems, he also used it to rob a bank, collect dozens of currencies and get laid all over the globe. And thereby reveals one of the weaknesses of ""Jumper"", that it is a very impatient movie.All throughout the film I couldn't help thinking that this would probably make for a fantastic book, but the pressure to press all the action into 90 minutes didn't do it a favor. I liked some of the ideas presented quite much, the two forces fighting each other for ages without usual people noticing for example. Nothing completely new but surely enjoyable. But some other aspects just can't keep up with the pasting, like the everlasting love he left behind for around 8 years, then wins back after one occasion in the bar after which he risks everything for her, after bragging about all the girls he had in the meantime.With a bit more time and a more earnest attitude, this could have been a great title, as it is it is a decent blockbuster but not more.",Jumper

66,jaredmobarak,"I'm giving you a headstart, sonJumper",6,17 February 2008,"Doug Liman's first misstep is the new movie Jumper. I have either greatly enjoyed or loved each of his films until now. This teleportation action adventure is not necessarily bad, however, it is just a bit of a mess. Acting as the first part of a planned trilogy, it is too short, too glossy, and too reliant on the viewers taking the leap and journey without any idea of what is really happening. Why are the Paladins after the Jumpers? When did the fight really start? Is it completely religious based? We are thrust into the plot much like how our lead stumbles upon his ability. He sees the power he has and decides to use it, that power soon becomes too much and takes over his life with any shade of regret or remorse for his thievery gone. The concept is quite fascinating and if the other two installments are made there might be something here. As a standalone, though, there are just too many unanswered questions and, frankly, not enough to really make me care whether the others get made at all.With the ability to teleport taking center stage, the effects need to be believable and flashy to work. I think Liman has succeeded on both counts here. Maybe he uses it a tad too much, turning it into a gimmick, but with the war that is going on he gets the details right. Concepts like electricity grounding a Jumper, the jump scars staying visible for short times to track them, and high-end technology for normal men to be able to use the Jumper's trace in order to follow are very intriguing and add a layer to the tale beyond watching characters go wherever they want. The toys, bells, and whistles deliver the goods, yet their success is a detriment to the work as a whole, really letting us see how it is all just style over substance. Every little insight into our lead David Rice's life is thrown out in the open and never expanded on. Was his father abusive? Did he leave him or the bullies at school when he took off? Why after nine years on his own does he finally go back to see them after almost being captured? When the Paladin Roland finds him, there is a definite chance that he could be killed, yet when all is said and done, he goes out in the open for the first time since the fateful day his power manifested. I understand why he does this as far as progressing the plot, but would the boy who couldn't bring himself to tell the girl he loved what happened to him actually decide to go back after an ordeal like that? No, it should make him crawl into an even deeper hole.As far as the acting goes, Hayden Christensen, as Rice, is pretty much a one-trick pony. He is cast as the rebellious kid always against the establishment. It works to great effect in films like Life as a House and on paper in Star Wars; however, he is mechanical in his delivery and motions, as much as I hate to agree with all the hate spread around on the internet. Christensen is not horrible here, but he is not perfect either. There is just something about his grin that comes across as trying a bit too hard. For the rest of the characters, there isn't anything too special to announce. Samuel L. Jackson is good as Roland, the Paladin on Rice's trail. He is his badass self throughout and is effective if not fleshed out at all. He is a man on a mission to rid the world of Jumpers, but why does he do it? We never find out and it is never shown that we should care. He is there to be the villain and that is all. The only standout to speak of is Jamie Bell. Sadly, it is his performance's success that really shows Christensen's limitations. Whereas you can see the wheels turning in Bell's head, a plan always being hatched and worked on from all angles, Hayden just looks like he is showing us his mind's at work, but he doesn't actually make us believe it. Bell's Griffin is the one man here that you feel has a stake in what is going on. He knows the pain of losing a loved one to his power, he understands the responsibility he has to his kind, and he is the only person that you wonder what he might be really up to. Despite no details on his past, one still gets all that from his limited screen-time, because he creates a character and makes it come alive.Jumper could have been great and I think the fact that they want to make two more, but aren't sure if they will be able to really hurt it beyond recovery. So much is left open, characters are stranded, but not killed, well-known faces are introduced without any relevance for this first film (Diane Lane and Kristen Stewart), and our lead finds himself trying to prove that he is different. He is not the Jumper that will turn evil with time as Roland says they all do, he is not a killer, but someone looking to bridge the gap between the two opposing forces. I just don't know if I can buy it, he has been a bankrobber for almost a decade and he has never cared about the consequences. Why should we believe that he would change now after realizing he is not alone?",Jumper
67,MrGKB,Hard to believe...,5,11 April 2008,"...that the screenwriter of ""Fight Club"" and the director of ""The Bourne Identity"" could go so horribly wrong with this vacuous adaptation of a popular young-adult sci-fi novel by Steven Gould (no, not the famous one with the middle name, Jay). Perhaps the novel is just as empty-headed, but I don't know since I haven't read it, and based on this botched film, I won't be bothering.""Jumpers"" is essentially a superhero origin tale that seems to go out of its way to avoid explicating its premise. It offers no explanation of its hero's powers (teleportation), nor any rationale for or insight into the war being waged between his kind and the ""Paladins"" who want to eliminate them. Worse, the story is specifically structured as a cliffhanger begging a sequel (which, despite ""Jumpers"" relatively lackluster domestic box office, is apparently in the works) that may or may not provide the necessary back story to the first film's shenanigans. All of this is compounded by a narcissistic, uninvolved, unlikeable lead in the person of a distressingly wooden Hayden ""Star Wars"" Christensen, his equally wooden, dispensable love interest (played by Rachel ""The O.C."" Bilson), and an inexplicably boring nemesis (Samuel L. ""Just give me the paycheck"" Jackson) who sports the worst dye-job I've seen in years.It's a shame, really, since the production values are high, with fine DP work from Barry ""Zoolander"" Peterson in exotic locales, and some excellent special effects from the likes of Lola ""Iron Man"" Visual Effects, Soho ""Fantastic Four"" VFX, and others. It's the threadbare story and unconvincing characters (with the exception of Jamie ""King Kong"" Bell as the guy I'd much rather have seen in the lead) that propel ""Jumper"" right into the dumper.

68,Stampsfightclub,Despite the poor scripting a bouncy unconditional hour of fun,6,29 November 2009,"At a young age David Rice (Christensen) discovers he has the ability to jump between places anywhere at any time all over the world, only Roland (Jackson) plans to stop him.This high concept science fiction flick from Doug Liman is one of those funny films; you like it then hate it.To start we wonder what is going on then a flash back to his first jump adds some striking drama. The section under the frozen lake feels nauseating and the bizarre conclusion in the library begins to spell intrigue. However this then evaporates as we see where it is going. His testing his abilities and soon ageing conform to the teenager on screen, a money grabbing selfish and immature stereotype. Then we emerge to a few years later where the main star Christensen is relaxing with his millions and when Roland catches up with him does the film, you anticipate, pick up. After a brutal confrontation and uncomfortable yet necessary inclusion of electrical punishment, the foundation for the future hour viewing time is set, a rivalry between two mystical, er, supernatural cults? The reunion of Hayden Christensen and Samuel L Jackson provokes the same boring rivalry and disdain they had together in Star wars, despite being on the same side. This time they are rivals but despite Jackson's obvious loathing of jumpers you don't have a proper connection to his reasoning. He mentions something about God briefly, as in twice, and for a second you flinch at the thought of the writers mimicking his previous role as Jules in Pulp Fiction. Christensen adds very little excitement to a plot that should be thriving upon adrenaline. His quiet hardly spoken protagonist is a bubbling wimp who is constantly running and is so softy spoken you wonder whether Edward Cullen is a jumper as well as a vampire.And yet despite the unemotional acting and atrocious idea of cults this 2008 release is oddly engaging.The idea of jumping from one place and ending up in another is quite a cool concept, owing some recognition to logic but yet it would save time on buses. This labelled as a science fiction film does not lend itself too much to reason. Why David can jump from one place to the other is fleetingly mentioned but despite the use being cowardice, it is exceptionally interesting.Despite the fighting sequences being none responsive emotionally, Doug Liman has created a charismatic picture owing to the scene sets. From Egypt, to Italy, to wherever the world's most famous landmarks are well used to create the breathtaking beauty of this planet, and to reflect on David's and his friend's deepest desires.Also this is a non conditional flick, an easy to watch film which you can enjoy and yes it has wooden acting and unemotional backchat but the cinematography is good and regardless you want to see what happens in the end.",Jumper
69,fwomp,Anakin Skywalker Jumps ...And Falls,3,4 September 2008,"Anakin Skywalker battles the forces of evil by using the force and ...Oh. Wait a minute. Wrong movie. Sorry 'bout that. Well not truly sorry; just a tad peeved at this flick and how horribly it went astray.It is true, however, that the grim Hayden Christiansen of the new STAR WARS fame is the main character (David Rice), and he has some unique abilities: he can jump through space/time at will, breakfasting on top of the Sphinx in Egypt, jumping back to his New York flat for luncheon pizza, then heading out to surf in Hawaii that same day ...or even hour if he wished it. He learns he has this power during his high school years (the young David is played by Max Thieriot  see THE ASTRONAUT FARMER) and nearly dies after falling through some thin river ice. He miraculously reappears in a local library, water and all, soaking book stacks. David was trying to retrieve a gift from the ice that he'd gotten for a girl he liked named Millie (Rachel Bilson), but he quickly learns that his jumping abilities make him something of a freak, and believes Millie would see him that way too. So he runs away and into the world.Once out amongst the populace he learns how to steal, including jumping into bank vaults and taking as much money as he will. But this also gains him notice by a secret society of men known as Paladins (look up Palatine and you'll find interesting parallels). The head of this religious order is a man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson, SNAKES ON A PLANE), and his goal is to kill Jumpers (""No one but God should have these powers!"") So the battle between Jumper and Paladin is set and interesting shots and gadgets dot the screen. And that's about it...The biggest flaw with the film is that there's no set-up to it. We don't really know why Jumpers can do what they do (Genetic/X-Men-like mutation? Alien DNA? Gods?). We also don't know who funds the Paladins with all of their travel, gadgets, and many, many members. I can guess that it might have been the Roman Catholic Church, but it's never even hinted at. If it was the church, then how did Roland get access to secret information, including bank vaults, police records, etc.? With all of its story flaws, Jumpers does have some amazing CGI. Particularly, there was one scene where Roland is in the desert and a Jumper brings a double-decker London bus with him through a jump scar and tries to roll it on top of Roland. That was incredible and made my jaw drop.But that was it. All style over any substance, Jumper was so weak along story lines that I didn't much care what happened to anyone in the film. The worst part is that the ending was obviously set up for a sequel. Maybe Mace Windu (Jackson's Star Wars character) could magically appear and wield 'The Force' to kill that off, too.",Jumper
70,petra_ste,Adventures of a teleporting whiny jerk,4,30 September 2008,"Genuinely boring from start to finish, Jumper is a dumb superhero movie and a silly travelogue, ruining its high-concept sci-fi/fantasy premise with poor casting and a weak script.David (Hayden Christensen) can teleport around the world at will, so he robs banks, visits exotic locales and seduces hot hicks, including his High School Love (Rachel Bilson); so-called ""Paladins"" led by Roland (a slumming Samuel L. Jackson) hunt for him.Christensen and Bilson complement each other perfectly, meaning they are both good-looking, unsympathetic and dull as dishwater. Like in the Star Wars prequels, Christesen oozes arrogant smarminess, as if he is starring in movies to do us a favour; Bilson stares at disappearing people and mysterious assassins with mild, casual bafflement. Jackson needs more movies worthy of his talent before he joins the list of sell-out celebrities and we get to see him in ""Meet the (Mother)Fockers 3"".Since we have no reason to sympathize with the leads, there is ultimately nothing at stake. What's funny is, Paladins seem quite correct: David is a thief and the other ""Jumper"" we meet, Griffin (Jamie Bell), is no model citizen either. Sadly, the movie just delivers these unlikable protagonists and expects us to root for them because... hey, it's in the script. A better film would have focused on Griffin and Roland, giving them more depth and continuously challenging our allegiances.Even sillier is how Jumpers are ludicrously overpowered compared to their hunters. They are like Nightcrawler with cheat codes, able to get everywhere on Earth in a split-second. Since the movie ponderously informs us Paladins have been persecuting Jumpers since the Middle Ages, one has to wonder HOW, since the only effective weapons against them involve high-tech gadgets.Let's be kind and call this one a disaster.4/10",Jumper
71,cchase,"Good On Paper, Mediocre On-Screen",7,13 July 2008,"What a disappointment. What we have here is not just a failure to communicate, but a classic case of a movie that must've looked so damned good on paper. A young and dynamic cast backed by veteran co-stars; a powerhouse creative team comprised of no less than the director of GO and two of the films in the BOURNE series, and the writer behind such action gems as BLADE and THE CROW, adapting what I've heard is a very popular novel with an unbeatable premise: people with the power to teleport themselves any place at will. So, what went wrong? Everything. Yes, whenever a movie is based on a book, it's virtually guaranteed to have an eager audience - some people who can't wait to see how closely the film holds to the book; others who can't wait to tear it apart for the very same reason. But that's not the key issue here. The biggest glitch is that the writers assumed that most people who would be watching JUMPER had already read the novel...which I haven't. In doing so, there are a lot more questions and plot loopholes left for me as a viewer to resolve, and what's left instead is a really bad aftertaste...kind of like when you've eaten too many cheese curls and that nasty orange stain is all over your fingers and tongue.So we have Hayden Christensen playing a young guy named David Rice. David discovered his ""Jumper"" abilities as a kid when a terrible accident happens that should've killed him, but enables him to save his own life instead with his once-dormant powers. It's a pretty compelling start, and the possibilities his power presents are captivating indeed. What would YOU do if you had the ability to go anywhere, anytime, just by thinking about it?Well, David does that and then some, especially since he has a particularly dreary home life with his estranged single dad, William (Michael Rooker). But here's where one of the first red flags goes up: we don't really get a chance to SEE what makes David's life so bad. A few clichés are thrown in, and it's criminal the way that Rooker's considerable talent is wasted, turning his character into a cardboard cutout. The book probably went into more detail about this, but here's that question again - what if you hadn't read it?And the same thing happens with the wonderful Diane Lane, who plays David's supposedly neglectful mother, who disappeared without a word when he was five years old, and Samuel L. Jackson as well. We all know that Sam is the prime example of the old Mae West line: ""When I'm good I'm really good, but when I'm bad, I'm better."" Here, sporting a frosted platinum 'do, looking like he should really be in a Bond film (which would have been a LOT more interesting to watch), he appears as Roland, the head of a group of ""Jumper hunters"" called Paladins, who track down, capture and kill them rather than run the risk of having them misuse their powers - which David has been doing, of course, with his part-time career as an unstoppable bank robber.There's not a lot of backstory here - exactly how and why David got his powers from his mother; why the Paladins do what they do, (""Only God should have this power"", snarls Roland as he violently dispatches one hapless Jumper, as if that should be enough of an explanation), or even how the whole 'Jumper/Paladin' war got started. My guess is that more details are supposed to be revealed in ongoing sequels to this film, but if that's the case, it would've probably been better off produced as a TV series instead of a big-budget film. Not to say that the special effects aren't impressive. They are pretty much state-of-the-art in terms of what is possible these days, in keeping with the intention of showing the audience something they've never seen before.And there is at least one character who spices things up a bit: Griffin (BILLY ELLIOT'S Jamie Bell, all grown up), who truly fits Roland's definition of ""a rogue Jumper"", especially since he takes the fight to the Paladins and unlike David, feels absolutely no remorse for the 'naughtier' things his powers allow him to get away with. Which brings me to another point: none of the characters here seem to be very likable, and maybe that's because in their youthful zeal to explore all the avenues that can be traveled with their powers, David and Griffin have not yet learned the ""superhero credo"": ""With great power comes great responsibility."" And then you have the Paladins who are supposed to keep them in check, but will not hesitate to resort to murder and torture of other innocent people to do it. And these are supposed to be the 'GOOD' guys?Like way too many movies coming out now, I was impressed overall by JUMPER'S look and the premise, but not by the execution. But hey, even the first STAR TREK movie did a face-plant, before getting back up and sprinting ahead with THE WRATH OF KHAN sequel. Maybe JUMPER will do the same.",Jumper
72,jpschapira,Again..Where's the movie?,5,22 November 2008,"What is ""Jumper""? The plot description in IMDb says ""a genetic anomaly allows a young guy to teleport himself anywhere"". Well, there's your answer, because that's what ""Jumper"" is. It's not a movie that could have been better, it's not a disastrous movie, but then I could also tell you that it may not even be a movie. I'm thinking of a TV series. A guy named David (Hayden Christensen) discovers he can teleport himself anywhere, jumping, when he is 5 (just as Jennifer Love Hewitt discovers she can talk to ghosts in ""Ghost Whisperer"", right?), leaves his house and meets other 'jumpers' that are engaged in a worldwide fight against 'paladins' who are trying to kill them. This way, we could have time over a season to get to know the characters and their reasons for being who they are and doing what they do.But during its 80 minutes of existence, the characters of ""Jumper"" remain complete strangers to us. The plot summary says that David can jump because of a genetic anomaly, but this is something the movie never explains; it's something we must assume. We must also assume that is possible that after eight years of jumping around the world, David can come back home and conquer his high school love Millie's (Rachel Bilson) heart by taking her to Rome without telling her anything about who he is. Don't get me wrong; of course this can happen, but in a film as empty as ""Jumper"" and with a face as inexpressive as Christensen's it becomes impossible to experience any romanticism. Bilson, who's had it better than the rest after ""The O.C"", seems to be here because director Doug Liman gave her a shot; just as he did with Adam Brody in ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", Liman's previous effort. However, Bilson's given an important role, and she delivers more than she's asked for. When it comes to performances, that's a lot to say for a movie like this. You have Bilson, who takes it seriously and succeeds, and at the other side you have Samuel Jackson, who's having a laugh while he cashes a big paycheck. The surprise for me was to see Jamie Bell who plays 'jumper' Griffin and, with a lot of professionalism and ease, delivers the best performance of the film. Clearly he doesn't take himself seriously either. So is there any seriousness here? Again, as in ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" the screenwriters (the script is based on a novel; I wouldn't want to read it) give us characters with no emotions; stereotypes that are there because some basic plot requires it. Again Liman shoots action scenes that look great but say nothing; again he takes us to different places of the world and he doesn't even care about showing their beauty; they are instrumental to the same basic plot standards and appear on screen only because the characters end up there after one of their 'jumps'. I'm not asking for a serious movie; but I'm at least asking for the seriousness that is required to admit that you're not taking yourself seriously. I don't want to judge anyone, maybe after all Doug Liman's plan (or whoever is behind these projects and spends millions in each of them) is to spend the rest of his life jumping, from one place to another. ButWhat for?",Jumper
73,jrarichards,"Thriller perfectly exemplifying the vices and virtues of ""young adult"" cinema",5,4 May 2017,"To begin with the confessions, I should state that thus far I have not felt motivated to complete my watching of ""Jumper"", which leaves this review a little unfair. Furthermore - and pretty much in the same vein - I am not a typical member of this film's target audience! To such an outsider, Doug Liman's 2008 piece is intriguing as an example of the genre. It starts off hugely attractively - it's slick, fast, worthwhile, nicely filmed, with clear motivation. A story smoothly and elegantly told and all is well.We take a first knock when it becomes clear that the older David Rice is living his playboy lifestyle by stealing, but - what the heck - many a crime-thriller/comedy has played with this level of immorality before, whether it be the ""The Lavender Hill Mob"", the ""Italian Job"" or ""Now Your See Me"".At around the same point in the film we get a little teaser which tells us quite a lot within the film plot, but also maybe about the piece itself. Our hero sees a TV news report to the effect that nobody would be able to reach people threatened with death by flooding in time. It then becomes clear he is looking for an umbrella and a mac but ... he goes nowhere near the flood and instead heads for London for a clubbing and one-night stand experience. Hayden Christensen's handsome young smoothie is not fundamentally evil, even if he robs banks and ignores the plight of people he could save, and he did have a difficult childhood, which he at times uses as a mask... and at this stage the immorality is still only at the level of poor-taste joke cashing in on the British capital's infamous weather. And perhaps this naughty joke is even a worthwhile one, since it makes it definitively clear that our ""jumper"" is NOT any kind of selfless superhero. If the makers are satirising the character or wanting us to hate him, well OK; but that is by no means clear from the context of the film, which does seem to be lionising David, even at second glance. Hence, it's still in dubious taste, somehow. Presumably those flood victims are indeed victims, by the time he's hopping into bed with his conquest of the evening, but it's not weighing heavily - or at all - on David Rice's conscience, and do the makers REALLY condemn this attitude?After that, we are very rapidly ""jumped"" to a tropical forest scene in which, pretty much without warning and seemingly out of context, a white-haired Samuel L. Jackson as ""Roland"" - let's say a representative of the fully ""adult"" world, as opposed to David's still-juvenile pleasure world - is murderously plunging a knife into the belly of a trussed-up young man, making gloating and nasty remarks.At this point, we have left comedy and charm (and genuinely young as opposed to young-adult viewers) behind in a way that prevents them from ever really returning, no matter how hard the film tries. For try it apparently does, seeking to bat on with more rom-com stuff, no matter how disturbingly hopeless that cause may now seem - at least to an adult audience-member.Thus a similar circumstance ensues as the longed-for romantic encounter between David and his attractively grown-up childhood sweetheart Millie (played by Rachel Bilson) finally takes place, ultimately in that loveliest and most cultured of cities, Rome. Unfortunately, the would-be love scenes at the Colosseum are ruined - again irrevocably - by a fight breaking out between our ""jumper"" and what later emerge are the long-time enemies of his kind. This fight involves both death and destruction - to an extent that again renders any attempt to rescue comedy or romance from the ruins impossible - at least from the point of view of a watcher of my age.This is intriguing, as the above description would apply equally well to any James Bond film, and yet... Bond manages to fuse the different emotions, while ""Jumper"" just seems cruel, sneering, cynical and amoral. The deaths and violence here are just too throwaway, and somehow a line of decency and taste is irrevocably crossed.As someone who works with young adults on a daily basis, I do note an increasing difficulty with such people not knowing ""where to draw the line"". The only remaining question would be: do films like ""Jumper"" encourage such moral ambiguity, or do they just reflect what is already happening out there in the people they aim at?",Jumper
74,mario_c,Definitely it's not my type of movie!,1,17 February 2008,"JUMPER is a fantasy-adventure film about a guy which discovers that he has an uncommon power which no other human has: he can teleport him self from one place to another; when he wants and where he wants to! Later, he also discovers that he's not the only one to have this strange faculty, and that there're some bad guys that want to kill them (the Palladinos)  hummm NO! Definitely, it's not one kind of cinema that I appreciate, especially when it starts entering in the FANTASTIC FOUR type of movie. It's too much fantasy and no substance to me! The Super-Hero genre never was one of my favourites, and I think this one can be, at many features, related to that genre, even not being a really Super-Hero film, like SPIDERMAN or SUPERMAN.

It's like, the crusades, and witch-hunts, and, you know, stuff, dude. OK? Absolute rubbish. An insult on so many levels it would take a book to catalogue them. A film designed for the sole reason of creating the expectation of a sequel. If that isn't illegal, it should be.You can't blame the actors because the script gives them no leeway. But then again you can blame the actors because these guys are big names who have options and surely should be able to sniff out something less manipulative than this pile of manure. Spiderman said, ""This is my blessing. This is my curse."" And with that we knew that even the super-human had to be human. Thus Batman is re-invented in Batman Begins, and even the new James Bond does 'James Bond Begins' in the guise of Casino Royale. Sulky teenagers with cool superpowers does not cut it anymore.

76,gigan-92,A Decent Film,7,11 April 2009,"I actually thought ""Jumper"" was all right, despite more than a few negative reviews. I think Hayden Christensen portrayed the character well enough to hold our attention. He's a great actor really and his performance isn't the problem here. Samuel L. Jackson also provided some great acting and he does good as a villain. The story was a decent but fun one that will entertain you at the most. It gives us Hayden's character's history and all that so it's good plot-hole wise. However, it doesn't deliver emotionally and the film kind of relies on our amazement of all these different locations to thrill us. Not enough I'll say, as we could of used more character development and albeit more time to elaborate on his relationship with his mother. The action is decent here and there are a few worthwhile money shots I guess. His father's death is a 'sad' moment, but the film could of used a better composer to pull us in, you know. A decent flick all in all. A sequel. If so, I'll see it probably.",Jumper

See Back To The Future and see what a real story is.86 million dollars to work with, an entire world to utilize and the stil put out a pretty shitty movie...wow...I hope that this story was really written by a 15 year old...because that is what it really plays like...and is geared for.",Jumper
78,LoneWolfAndCub,Interesting idea that is very poorly executed.,4,19 April 2008,"Doug Liman's 'Jumper' had a promising concept that could have been an intelligent and exciting action flick. A genetic mutation allows David Rice (Hayden Christensen) to teleport himself anywhere. Consequently, David is living the ""high-life,"" a nice house and loads of money. This is changed when he meets his old crush Millie (Rachel Bilson) and takes her to Rome. In Rome, he meets Griffin (Jamie Bell) and discovers that this mutations has been around for centuries and anyone who has it is known as a ""Jumper."" Soon enough, he as at war with ""Paladins"" a group of people who have sworn to rid the world of ""Jumpers."" Leading this group is Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) and what follows is a battle between David and Roland with Millie getting caught up in the middle of it.Sound predictable? Well, full marks for you. Instead of an interesting idea becoming a great movie, we get a shallow, short and dumb little movie with barely anything to offer apart from flashy effects and action. The acting is pitiful from almost everyone (I stand by the fact that Hayden Christensen cannot act). Samuel L. Jackson was good, but incredibly corny and his hairdo was shocking! Michael Rooker and Diane Lane deserve better than this, as they try to deal with a terrible script. None of the characters were likable, either and as previously mentioned, the script was awful (with such outstanding lines as ""Only God should have this power"") and the ending was so abrupt that it was ridiculous. And one thing that really bugged me to point of just wanting to storm out of the cinema was when David jumps he busts up the walls or floors and generates a lot of dust or water damage (sometimes he doesn't). But, either way, nobody pays any attention. It's frightening really. David can pop into a multitude of people anywhere in the world - the streets of Tokyo or a London pub - and except for this one kid at the Detroit airport, not one head turns. And if it doesn't matter to them, why should it to us? Also, as mentioned earlier, the story could have become unique and thought-provoking film. Unfortunately, this idea is not explored with any depth, most of the sub-plots are mentioned briefly then forgotten about for the rest of the movie's pitiful running time of 80 minutes. If the lazy screenwriters had bothered to expand the history of Jumpers and go in more depth about how they originated and how the war between them and Paladins started ""Jumper"" could have had some intrigue. Maybe if they developed the characters a little more so we could actually care about them, possible emotional connections could be made. Sadly, this tale is wasted due to complete shallowness and completely unlike-able characters. Admittedly, the action scenes were well shot and the special effects were very good. But action does not make a movie and cannot cover the fact that everything else is just shoddy.So, how can I sum up Liman's ""Jumper:"" with no one to root for and no adequate story development, ""Jumper"" is a lost cause.I am being generous in awarding this movie 2/5.",Jumper

It's intelligent, snappy, sexy, unpredictable, visually appealing and technically well executed. I see this movie as a metaphor for the internet and what it's become for many young people. And also a metaphor for the quest of young people to discover what the purpose of their life is really about.Rice (well played by Hayden Christensen) has these powers to transport around the world. But what does he use it for? Getting closer to the remote, amassing wealth, living high, having fun, chasing his high school sweetheart. He's a sullen, shallow, self-absorbed average young person. A couple of scenes illustrate this cleverly: ruining the library, trashing the Coliseum, casually blowing off horrors of a flood. He doesn't learn about things; he experiences them superficially. He likes going to the top of things. This is no thinker, no superhero.But then come Griffin, Roland and his mother Mary (!), to remind him that this power has a larger context and that there is more to life and to the universe than himself. Griffin shows him he is not alone and there is a noble purpose. Roland (played by Samuel Jackson, of course) is right: no one should have such powers. This is especially true if you're going to waste them. His mother shows him that some people do believe in things.There are a few downsides, but they didn't ruin the film for me.",Jumper

Then just before The Grim Reaper gets him he finds himself in the local library.After a conflict with his deadbeat dad he leaves home and starts using his ability to rob banks to allow himself to live in New York.

As he falls through it and is in danger of dying under the ice his story seems to be a rather short one. But, that would make the film a rather short one too. So, in some obscure way, the guy teleports from under the ice to a place where he has been spending time in the past - a library. Unable to understand what happened he goes ""under the radar"" and tries to find out what did happen and how it did.As a precondition to a film this isn't a bad one. You need to start somewhere, might as well start here. The next condition of the film is that there is someone that isn't happy with these special abilities. Not entirely unbelievable - who wouldn't want to be able to jump around the entire globe in a blink of an eye? Quite naturally some of the people that are unable to do it are a bit jealous. Jealous enough to kill even.So far the film meets these two conditions and works. But why oh why does it let itself derail so enormously badly by pulling in a religious angle? That angle doesn't belong in there, feels out of touch and isn't backed by anything except the few times it is mentioned. There's quite a few angles that would have worked a lot better.

With this pedigree, is it any wonder that his latest addition to the family tree is also lacklustre and drab? Basically your teen movie masquerading as science fiction with a cheep gimmick, maybe the book fairs better, but as a movie, it is beyond the pale to be calling this sci-fi.Starring Hayden Christensen, who played young teen Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars franchise, this transgression from the Dark Side to the capacity to be able to jump vast distance and across the other side of the world is his most unchallenging script and role to date. Breaking new boundaries with this project has left him with his feet landing firmly back to square one. Jumper has its future very well mapped out, and seeing over the fence before one jumps is all too painful, the plot here is extremely all too easy to predict and with no train of thought at play it can very quickly turn into stumble and fall rather than a jump for joy.Sadly, the lush locations here cannot save this limping animal, with shots of Rome's Coliseum, Egypt's Sphinx and Pyramids and London's Big Ben they alone cannot add texture, depth or personality to this film. It is simply a flat liner that needs a heart resuscitation. To use these marvels in this manner smacks of insult and embarrassment toward them.With its lack of depth comes what seems too many lacking answers, with gaping holes in the narrative, not plot holes I may add, this then leaves the players and their lives feeling and looking more than empty shells which a good script would see them quickly coming out of.If you like you sci-fi, no, action movie cum sci-fi, simple, easy going and all too plain, then Jumper will foot the bill.

Director Doug Liman has the Bourne identity and Mr &Mrs Smith under his belt as big budget action movies, so in theory, with a good premise to work from, all should have been well. But it isn't.David Rice (Hayden Christensen) is a shy, young man, who at the moment of mortal jeopardy discovers an ability to teleport himself. Quickly, he establishes that this is an excellent way to make vast sums of money, and for a while the film has fun as he enjoys himself. But the potential of this strand of the plot is barely exploited when his nemesis is introduced, bad guys whose mission is o destroy the jumpers led by career bad-ass guy, Samuel L Jackson.From this point onwards the film degenerates into a fatally flawed fight film. Rice is not a particularly engaging or charismatic soul. We don't really care if harm comes to him. Jackson is just bad, but for no coherent reason, if he wins we will not cheer, but if he loses, we are not that bothered.A romantic sub-plot is weak and underdeveloped despite it being the context for the stand out scene, a showdown in Rome's Collisseum. Although the running time is only 84 minutes, the film feels long, mainly due to the unwillingness of Liman to pick up and run with a strand of the plot rather than introduce another fight.Some have labelled this a teen film, which if I was a teenager I would feel pretty insulted by, so careless is the treatment of this story.

94,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"Could have been better in a lot of ways, but cool effects and Jamie Bell save it from disaster",6,14 February 2008,"Doug Liman's 'Jumper' is a decent, above average action flick. It's going to satisfy the action fan's desires with some 'ooh' and 'ahh' moments, particularly the climactic sequence involving the film's two jumpers and the antagonist.'Jumper' has a very straightforward story: David (Christiensen) discovers he has the ability to teleport after an altercation with a classmate in high school. Years later, he has robbed banks of enough money to afford a Manhattan suite, a life wherever he chooses, and the ability to never work or go to school. Everything is going great...until the Paladins (led by Samuel L. Jackson), who have sworn to destroy these jumpers (also including Jamie Bell), as they believe ""only God should have the power to be in all places at all times"", come after him.Let's start with the first and biggest problem: the casting of the male and female leads Hayden Christiensen and Rachel Bilson. Christiensen is not really miscast...he's an actor with experience in this type of role, but the fact that he's more wooden than an oak tree is inexcusable. He could have done a lot more with the character, and the fact that he continually shows a lack of commitment to his character should make him the poster boy for who NOT to cast in films. There are so many struggling actors who deserve their chance, and people like Christiensen continually waste theirs. As for Rachel Bilson, she was nowhere near as bad as Christiensen, but I think she could have been better. At the very least, you do care for her character, and she has her moments, but overall it's a mediocre performance.Now, the best parts of the film: the original and awesome action, and Jamie Bell. When you're handling something like teleporting, it's easy to be very creative and show off your imagination as a director and writer. Simon Kinberg, who is mostly responsible for the action scenes, did a great job. Most of the scenes take place over a span of locations and feature a lot of cool camera angles and styles that help 'Jumper' forge an identity of its own. Jamie Bell is the main supporting role in the film as the second jumper Griffin, and in my opinion, he should have been the lead role. Not just Bell, but his character. Christiensen's David Rice was very bland and not at all engaging, but Bell's Griffin is far and away the best character in the movie and is a joy to watch and laugh at throughout the film (he provides most of the comic relief). Bell is outstanding, proving my long time saying that he is one of the best young actors working today. It also would have been nice to see Griffin as the main character because of how different he is from David. It really could show how being a jumper has impacted his life. He could start out with a personality like David's (which the audience never gets to know because Christiensen doesn't feel like telling us), then evolve into the charismatic, rebel without a cause, fiery personality that is Griffin. Also enjoyable is Samuel L. Jackson as the main antagonist Roland in the film. It's always fun to see Jackson be overly serious in a movie that really doesn't require it.Another problem is the bland dialog outside of Griffin's character. Whoever wrote that character really liked him. Kinberg's action sequences are brilliant, but David S. Goyer and Jim Uhls fail on their part of the screenplay, and as action isn't everything, it really brings the film down. There was so much wasted potential. There could have been more Jumpers than just Bell and Christiensen. Though Griffin was an engaging character, he was totally random and came out of nowhere, and the plot jumps around a lot (much like the camera, as the film is poorly edited).However, despite the glaring weaknesses of the script and Hayden Christiensen, 'Jumper' still manages to fit the bill of action/sci-fi thriller well, and I recommend it to a viewer who is willing to sit back and watch this popcorn flick.",Jumper
95,Jay_Exiomo,"Zippy visuals, inert storytelling",6,12 February 2008,"For a film that's zippy in nature, ""Jumper"" feels strangely inert.Post-Anakin Hayden Christensen plays David Rice, a young man who accidentally finds he can teleport anywhere following an accident that nearly killed him. Eventually getting the hang of his newfound ""superpower"", David whooshes himself into a bank and out of it with the safe's contents, providing him a high-class New York life.Based from Steven Gould's novel, ""Jumper"" then follows David as he zips from his posh apartment to Irish bars, Tokyo streets, Fijian waves, Egyptian pyramids, or wherever his whims take him. But such privilege doesn't come without a cost. And the price comes in the form of a white-haired Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a member of a secret organization known as Paladin. Their job is to kill all ""jumpers"" because ""only God can be in all places at the same time."" Or something like that.Doug Liman, director of adrenaline-pumping movies such as ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", brings his zing forth to ""Jumper"", a peripatetic film that while visually impresses, suffers from shallow characters and bland storytelling. It seems there's mythology here somewhere, but they are abandoned for whooshing from one place to another. It's all fine at first but it becomes repetitive; one senses that all the filmmakers were after was to extend an obligatory prologue of a potential franchise into an hour-and-a-half full length feature.Christensen doesn't have much acting to do for his role and he's fine, although he doesn't have enough pull to his character for you to full sympathize with him either. It's hard to blame him entirely as screenwriters David Goyer, Jim Uhls and Simon Kinberg don't as much provide dynamic characters as templates for the plot to tread upon through its running time. Same goes to Rachel Bilson, whose character exists solely to be the damsel in distress. Jackson, he's seen worse roles. Here, he's just having fun hamming it up as Diane Lane and Kristen Stewart also appear in cameos.At its best, ""Jumper"" is a fine time-waster that could have been a notch higher with better characters and storytelling. To its credit, it makes you want to grab your passport and hop onto the next flight to Rome. But it further affirms its similarity to a travel brochure: it visually whets your travel appetite but when you're done with it, you forget about it.",Jumper
96,Rcwilkinson123,"Not perfect, but very cool",6,17 February 2008,"While there are a variety of factors that may hold 'Jumper' back from being at the same level of an action movie as, say, 'The Bourne Ultimatum' or 'Casino Royale,' or at the same level as a sci-fi flick such as the first two X-Men films or 'Transformers,' it is far better than most critics are giving it credit for, and fulfills my wish to see a decent film in between the holiday season of 'National Treasure' and the summer season of 'Indiana Jones.' The premise is very basic: David Rice (Hayden Christensen of 'Star Wars' lore) learns at the age of 15 that he can teleport. However, unlike certain superheroes seen on screen in the last eight years, he uses the ability to steal and enjoy life on his terms. However, he faces a problem when he begins to get hunted down by Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) and his group of Christian extremists known as the Palidans.Rice's problematic situation is compounded when his longtime crush Millie gets involved, when Rice takes her to Rome. From that point, the movie picks up in action tremendously, particularly at the end of the movie.The biggest problem I had with the film was not the much-complained-about Hayden Christensen's acting, which while not great is certainly better than critics are giving him credit for and is improved since 'Star Wars,' but the swearing. Parts that could have been way better if left silent or said differently were ruined by profanity.Sam Jackson does an excellent job as the villainous, yet understandable in his approach, Roland. However, the same cannot be said for the actress who played Millie, a relative newcomer to the silver screen.Exciting, with a good premise but not complete in explaining important backstory, 'Jumper' is flawed, but very cool, and I would strongly consider seeing a sequel if one were to be released. 3 stars/4",Jumper
97,gregeichelberger,"Pointless, ridiculous tripe",3,12 February 2008,"It¹s still very early in the cinematic season, but already ­ within the last week ­ I have been witness to possibly a pair of the worst movies of the year. First, there was the abysmal, horrid garbage heap of a picture called ""Fool's Gold"" (in that only a fool would like it); and now, ""Jumper,"" the newest 20th Century-Fox release starring Hayden Christensen and Samuel L. Jackson (both of ""Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith"").""Jumper,"" a cross between ""The Butterfly Effect"" and the TV series ""Quantum Leap,"" is the closest thing to an example of attention deficit disorder anyone, anywhere has ever tried to put on film; and is so badly written, acted and directed one would have thought a camera was just turned on and whatever took place in front of it was duly shown on the screen.Another analogy is that a group of first-graders each wrote down a thought or idea, they were all put into a hat, drawn out at random and filmed in the order they were picked out.It's a completely hopeless, pointless, ridiculous piece of tripe.I did not think much of the cast or the premise, but I expected much more from Doug Liman, the man who directed ""The Bourne Identity"" and Mr. and ""Mrs. Smith."" This movie made no sense, was all over the map thematically and none of the characters were even remotely likable.The plot has David Rice (Christensen) as a bumbling loser who somehow has the power to teleport himself through various wormholes. In other words, if he is in trouble in Ann Arbor, Mich., he can think of Rome and instantly zoom to the Eternal City.Thrown into a freezing Detroit lake (which is where all copies of this movie should be tossed, by the way) as a teenager, he teleports himself to a library. And while some startled patrons are visibly aghast at a young man appearing right before their eyes followed by a ton of water, no investigation into the phenomena is initiated.This happens throughout the film, however. Jumpers - as Rice's ilk are called - continually appear and disappear in public places, but no one ever asked them what in the Sam Hill is going on.Anyway, with this new-found power to transport himself anywhere he desires, does Rice use it to benefit Mankind? Not on your life. Instead, he takes advantage of instantaneous travel to steal money, pick up chicks and beat people up.There¹s even a scene where Rice is watching a news report of people caught in a flash flood. He rises and we think he¹s going to help ­ but he doesn't; he simply flies through a wormhole to hit on a British woman.So much for heroism here.There¹s also an awful lot wasting of the power in this movie. For instance, I understand Rice teleporting himself to Tokyo, Antarctica, Fiji, Great Britain, Egypt and other exotic, faraway places, but teleporting himself from his couch to his refrigerator is totally ridiculous.After the lake incident, everyone in his hometown thinks he¹s dead, but he shows up on the doorstep of an old flame, Millie (Rachel Billson, TV series ""Chuck""), and whisks her away to Rome with little or no explanation on how he can afford the impromptu journey.Meanwhile, Roland (played by the perpetually ticked-off Jackson, with snow-white hair, for some reason), a government agent of some sort (think of the bad guys in the ""Matrix"" films), is trailing the couple. Roland evidently wants nothing more than to shock Rice, wrap him up in electrical cords and disembowel him (hey, that was my goal, too).More unlikable characters come on screen as Rice meets fellow jumper, Griffin (Jamie Bell, ""Flags Of Our Fathers,"" ""King Kong""), a cross between Sid Vicious and the guy on ""Drop Dead Fred."" Griffin, who is supposed to sort of protect Rice, is as annoying as Bart Simpson and Tom (of ""Tom & Jerry"") put together, but cannot out-act either fictional character.We then muddle through to the conclusion where Rice, Griffin and Roland battle it out in various locations and things end up almost exactly the way they were in the beginning.If this film were any worse, it would have a Surgeon General¹s warning attached to it.",Jumper
98,mistoppi,Unoriginal action mess,4,12 September 2015,"I always appreciate superhero movies that aren't made by DC and Marvel. While DC and Marvel just tend to take turns on stealing ideas from each other and using same plot lines over and over, other superhero movies tend to bring some creativity and originality to the table, for example, Kick-Ass. To my disappointment, Jumper doesn't bring much originality the table. Sure, the viewpoint is different, since it's not tragic story about a boy who loses everything and starts to protect the city / neighbourhood / few blocks, etcetera. But in terms of the plot, Jumper is just like any other action movie. The structure of the story, the events, the characters, dialogue and relationships... it all has been experienced before, and it will be experienced again, and there are better writers to do this. Jumper just seems to be another mindless action hodgepodge.Even if the movie is good, it should be longer. The explanation for so many important plot points was half-assed. We know nothing except what David knows - and he doesn't know much. Griffin sure explained him shortly what he needed to know. That's realistic though, would people in that kind of situation have the time to sit down and go through everything? Even if it was realistic, it still isn't very friendly to the viewers.Jumper is a decent action movie, but it gets tiring after the first view. It is boring, unoriginal and too fast. There had to be better action films, and thankfully there are. What should you watch instead of Jumper? Kingsman and Wanted are a good start.",Jumper

However, he's a capable actor and the support of Samuel Jackson, Rachel Bilson, Jamie Bell, and other cameos gave this movie a solid cast. As I said, the plot was pretty interesting and original as well. The only real problem I had with the film is that it was only 88 minutes, which didn't really give it time to fully develop the concept of ""jumping"" and the relationship because them and the Paladins, an organization that hunts down jumpers.

And until that part of the teleport is well resolved, with good action scenes using the powers, with very good and convincing effects. That part, in fact, isn't the problem.The problem certainly is the script, at the end of the story (very short by the way) several tips become loose, and even key concepts that are played during the film go unexplained. What happened to the character of Jamie Bell? What is the real fight between Jumpers and Paladins?Not to mention the ""mother factor"" in the middle of it all, I definitely did not buy it, the fact that she was from this crazy cult who wants to kill people with powers, and still in the end say ""I'll give you a few minutes advantage, son"" .. . F#CK! NO!Anyway, it's a cool movie, it's not big (80 minutes) and it certainly provides good fun.

And the tussle scenes. . .I won't call them battles. . .it was really teen mutants trying to escape adult hunters, they weren't really fighting.. .the tussle scenes were snappy.The fall off was the lack of a backstory. WHY, WHATFOR, HOW and HOW MANY Paladins are there? How does one become a Paladin? What do the governments know about Jumpers? All of this was left begging for explanation.I got the clear message at the end that screamed SEQUEL! SEQUEL! except that I really won't care when it comes. I agree with a lot of other posters here. The Producers missed the ball by casting Jamie Bell's Griffin as a sidekick to David and his romantic whatever with whatshername.Griffin had personality, grit, wit and he was WAY more roguishly likable than David. I'm sorry-- but Christensen isn't so much acting as he is just doing the 'I'm a Cute, Lovable Guy' thing in front of the camera. When he brought his girlfriend BACK to Griffin's hideout with the Paladins in pursuit, I wanted to smack him myself for being so stupid. During the fight between him and Griffin, I was rooting for the little guy!If there's a sequel, Griffin should have a bigger slice of the screen-- That Guy Can ACT!

102,jemps918,"Ambitious, cocky, but leaves you empty",5,19 February 2008,"An ambitious movie about teleporting twentysomethings, Jumper stars Hayden Christensen (Star Wars prequels) and Jamie Bell (Billy Elliot) as 'jumpers', a rare breed of superhumans who can jump through space, anywhere in the world. It's the movie that tried, given the brilliant concept, but painfully disappointed as the terrible writing and acting leaves you empty. Director Doug Liman should just go back to doing the Bourne series or Mr. & Mrs. Smith types of flicks which at least don't pretend to have any depth.The film takes us through the life of how David Rice, a spoiled but shy fifteen-year old (Christensen), discovers his ability and what he chooses to do with his power. He pretty much chooses the selfish path of what a regular youngling would do: rob banks, buy distractions and carelessly apparate and disapparate whenever he pleases. It seems like the perfect cure for ADHD but he quickly learns the consequences of his actions. A religious fanatic cult led by Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) believes only God should be omnipresent, and so has been hunting down jumpers and killing them, apparently, since the medieval ages. David's flashy ways gets him found out, and suddenly, the boy who could be anywhere he wants, instantly, finds himself looking for some sense of permanence in the form of his childhood sweetheart Millie (Rachel Bilson, The OC). He fulfills her fantasy by whisking her off to Rome--via normal transport and tries to stay incognito but meets fellow jumper Griffin (Bell). Somehow, Roland gets to Millie and David is forced to ask for Griffin's help to team up and save her. A lot of flashy fight scenes ensue as they jump from Tokyo to Egypt to China to Afghanistan to the Ann Arbor Michigan library but no matter how fantastic the situations may be, it is difficult to emotionally connect with the characters and the thin plot. There is no message or saving grace. At one point, when David flips through TV channels, he stops at one showing a terrible flood, with the newscaster saying, ""if only someone could get to them on time"". David shakes his head and goes to his vault and grabs a wad of money, which you think he'd at least donate or use his powers to help people but what he decides to do instead is discouraging.Diane Lane has a small role as David's mother who mysteriously left their home when he was five. A lot is left unsaid at the end, which leaves room for a possible sequel given the box office draw, but it would be painful to sustain this.

It is the same director who made rubbish films like The Bourne Identity and Mr & Mrs Smith so Jumper has made that terrible list even longer.The film isn't even original because the idea is an awful rip off of a character of the X-men called Night crawler who is able to teleport himself anywhere. The main problem of the movie is that there just wasn't enough there to make a full length feature film so it was better off as a short story on paper. They did not even explain properly that why these teleporters known as Jumpers are able to jump and why Samuel L. Jackson is wiping out all these Jumpers so there are more plot holes than a sieve.If I was a Jumper then I would've jumped to Hollywood and grabbed the director and jumped to the top of Mount Everest with him and left him there so he won't make any more rubbish films.

106,Someguysomwhere,The joy of jumping.,5,17 March 2008,"This movie confirms a long held belief of mine which is that most people would commit a crime if they were absolutely sure they could get away with it. And that sadly, the only difference between some so-called ""law abiding citizens"" and criminals is that the latter doesn't mind sticking their necks out. You don't need super powers to prove this. All you need is to look at what happens during a riot. Most of the people you see running around holding appliances are -or were- law abiding citizens until the chance came for a free TV.Anyway, let's get to this movie.This movie is about a young man who discovers that he has the ability to jump from one point in time to another. One of the first thing he does is rob a bank (Surprise!). After a period of self-indulgence he discovers that he's not the only one with his power. He learns that people with his abilities have been around for over a century or so and that their are those dedicated to exterminating his kind. So now his uneventful indulgent life style turns into a fight for survival as he is hotly pursued by a dedicated Jumper killer in the form of Samuel Jackson. (Turns out that if he had robbed banks the old-fashioned way he wouldn't have given himself away. Haa-ha! As the bully on the Simpsons would say.) Personally I could take this movie or leave it. So I'll give it a middle score of 5 out of 10 stars. It's one of those movies that in the end boils down to personal taste since it's not clearly a good or bad movie. If someone gives it a higher score I won't fault them as long as it's not above 7. And anything below my 5 is, I believe, unfair. So basically it's not a total waste of your time to see it, but on the other hand you won't be missing anything great if you decide to skip it. It was a good idea with it's moments but it could have been better; say, perhaps with a hot female lead as the Jumper instead, 25 or older, wearing a form-fitting, black leather Jumpsuit. And her love interest would be the other Jumper she discovers. They clash at first but wind up working together in the end to defeat their common enemy. Then they find sweet love. Isn't that nice?

108,joestank15,Didn't like it. Didn't hate it. Shoddy considering some of the talent behind it.,4,22 November 2008,"Jumper - David Rice (Hayden Christiansen) has the ability to teleport. He is what the film refers to as a ""Jumper"". Rice is chased by people who want to taser him because...well I suppose because they saw the Star Wars prequels. No it turns out they are what is called Paladins. Why do they hate the Jumpers? That's not really delved into. Who funds this worldwide elimination of Jumpers? We just don't know, and by the end, don't care.The film just has no time to spare for much of anything besides the effects, which are, admittedly, cool. It's a shame. The idea of a character who can teleport is a cool concept. The idea of a middle of the road superman is a bad concept. Why? Because it's interesting to watch an everyman pick up the mantle of hero or fall into darkness. What is not is to see a average guy do mildly criminal acts but pretty much stay on the middle of the road purely out of self interest and not learn a damn thing on the way.Hayden Christiansen gives a completely bland performance as David Rice to the surprise of none. Can we close the books on this one? He isn't given a lot with the dialog, I'll give you that, but he's bordering soporific. He just plain lacks charisma, and every time he gets that half baked grin on his face (far too often) you want to slug him. David Rice ignores news reports of people stranded in hideous places so he can go surfing. Peter Parker would whale on this sob. And I'm supposed to care about David's plight, why? I mentioned the writing. It's even crummier when you find out who did it. I would've expected better from David S. Goyer (The Dark Knight) Jim Uhls (Fight Club) and Simon Kinberg (xXx: State of the Union). Okay maybe not that last one, but still. Far too much mileage is gotten out of David's 'mystery' in his courtship of Millie Harris (Rachel Bilson). It's about half of the dialog between the two, who have pretty mediocre chemistry. The writing and story are lazy.Some plot-holes among many that vexed me: How does David stay so damn thin if he hardly ever walks around? He even teleports to different spots on the couch, for God's sake. Also, why does he need a passport? And the whole jump spot thing is vexing and never explained. These Jumpers can go anywhere, but have several ""jump-spots"" that they have to aim for. I guess it's like weblinks or something.Everything is far too easy in this film, even considering it's about teleportation. The end result is hollow and flat. It's got some pretty visuals (minus Rachel Bilson's lips. Sorry but I couldn't get over them) and it's fun to see Mace Windu taser Anakin. Also the pointless teleport fight at the end was pretty cool. Aside from that, the film is a pass.I didn't like it. Didn't hate it. Jumper gets a C-",Jumper

Good actions scenes and visual effects. The romance is a simplistic one between characters who aren't quite mature, but the story doesn't pretend that its characters are anything but immature, so that's fine. Story wastes no time with exposition at all, doesn't bother explaining everything in detail and instead prefers to thrust you right into the action at all times. I actually liked this minimalistic story telling style. Yes, it doesn't even bother detailing where the ""jumping"" power even comes from or explaining much back story behind the villains; but the main character doesn't even know these things - he's just blindly thrust into it all, like we are - so it's fine if we, the audience, doesn't get a clear explanation either.",Jumper

It doesn't take a genius to notice the giant gaps between scenes, maybe one day we'll get to see an extended cut. Like Spider-Man 3, you can clearly feel a director's cut would be an infinitely great improvement.The story (actually based on a novel, believe it or not) entails an in all ways selfish protagonist, with NO redeeming qualities, furthermore there's a bag of undealt issues from the past, which of course (as in any cliché-ridden screenplay) affect his present state of mind. That's as far as the audience gets to a rounding of characters, 'Jumper' bored the hell out of me except for a couple of scenes in the second half of the movie.How did they go wrong??

Oddly, Liman comments that he didn't want this film to be just about effects and he wanted people to watch it not realising they saw an effect. Well, thats the complete opposite of what happened Doug!, The movie's only real redeeming features are these very effects and even with movie technology at this very high level, you can't hide the fact that you just saw a special effect. I didn't read the book this was based on but the premise here is outstanding, there is so much potential here and I'm not going to can the producers of this quite yet as there are apparently two more films in the pipeline.

113,paul_3-960-896774,A slightly underrated entertaining movie,7,19 February 2015,"Jumper is a decent movie, I might be a little bias because I've always liked this movie. The premise alone sounds amazing, the way its set up, how the characters are introduced, the action sequences, and the special effects are simply good. The film has elements of a superhero movie but is - more so than actual superhero movies these days - grounded in reality. There are very few futuristic looking gadgets, the locations and the weapons are all realistic, making the Jumpers feel like a secret part of society that could actually exist.The characters in Jumpers seem like regular people. Millie (Rachel Bilson) acts and reacts like a normal girl whose not a comic book fan or someone who doesn't entertain the idea that teleportation is possibility. Griffin (Jamie Bell) is a bit a dick and David Rice (Hayden Christensen) doesn't even seem to realize what's happening to him, he lives in his bubble and doing his own thing - like most people would in his case.The film does have its faults and for me there two main problems: The first, I've never read the book but from what I understand in the movie, a Jumper can withstand a large amount of electricity - higher than normal people do. But some of the hits David got in the action sequences should have killed him if he's physically like any human, which seem to be the case and would have been a great weakness to have for the character, a regular guy who can teleport. The second problems is the ending of the film, it's not the best, I could have come up with something better.Anyway, I liked Jumper when it came out, even though I always knew that there wouldn't be a sequel. It's an entertaining movie and over the years, whenever I watched it back I found those little pop culture references that I hadn't notice before. For example this time around I noticed a Marvel Team up reference that is kind of overused but is still cool.@wornoutspines",Jumper
114,RCWjr,Jumper jumps too much,6,7 March 2008,"The cast isn't the problem here, everyone involved does a good job. Wooden acting claims aside, Christiansen delivers exactly what is needed by him in this film. Samuel Jackson is, well, Sam. No problems there. The locales are great, lots of fun places visited. Premise is cool, having the ability to jump to where ever you want.However, all those positive things aside, there are two huge problems with this film. First of all is the pacing/editing. The film literally jumps from scene to scene in a manic pace that continuity is totally lost. In loosing the continuity there is so much not explained adequately (mostly why and how persons are able to ""jump"") that you are left a bit dizzy by everything because you are trying to figure out what is going on. Not to say the film is confusing, it just lacks any coherent pacing and as I mentioned, the editing is horrible and contributes to the dull ache you have coming out of the film.I saw this in a digital theater, so it sure looked and sounded pretty. But beyond that and the good performances, if you must see this film in the theater I would say go to the matinée or wait for it to hit the bargain theater if you have one. Otherwise, make this a rental on DVD.",Jumper

But then again maybe its because I have always been a fan of time traveling, teleportation shows and the like. Still, it was for the most part, a great film that I have no trouble recommending to everyone. But as the title states, its problem is that it was too short. This could have easily been a solid 10 for me if only they fleshed out the romance and the story between the mother son pair. It really feels like the film was unnecessarily and overly short.",Jumper

A bell could ring or light could flash for a second to remind the patrons of a last call for a refund! If a system like this was in place in the United States, I guarantee you - rotten, boring trash like Jumper would never, ever be made! Half the theater would have emptied out in a heartbeat! This film is so incredibly vapid and mind-numbingly dull it genuinely insults the intelligence of the movie going audience!!I realize movies actors need to make a living! But big stars like Hayden Christensen and Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of themselves - they can pick and choose their projects. Memo to Their Hollywood Agents: You are ruining their careers! If dreary, campy films is all you can find for them to work on then maybe you shouldn't be in the movie star agent business!There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this godforsaken, awful story! The good guys teleport (A mutant power rip-off from the X-men). The bad guys are religious nuts that kill the teleporters in cold blood because ""only God should have this power."" Simple as that! Each group tries to kill the other. The good guys are all really sexy looking guys and gals in there 20's! All the bad guys are about 20 years older and could be the good guys parents! And in one case, the bad guy is a parent! One of the most memorable lines: ""When you were five years old I had to either kill you or leave you. You shouldn't have come here (parent's home), but I will give you a head start."" What a pal! When I heard this line I thought to myself, ""how inspiring!"" Parents are all defective or crazy religious zealots or non-existent. Religious people are all fanatical killers going back to the ""Inquisition."" Only narcissistic 20-Somethings are the heroes in the world of Jumper. But even they are so narcissistic, that when the Christmas Eve Tsunami hits the Indian Ocean nations of the world, does our hero, Hayden Christensen, go and use his incredible teleporting powers to save those drowning before his eyes on the T.V. news? Nope! He grabs a surf board and teleports to some Pacific Island country to surf those extra powerful waves! How disgusting and shocking! What are the writers of this story trying to tell us? That 20-30 year olds are so gross they only care about themselves? So, in a real sense, there are absolutely no good guys in this pathetic film! Now that the writer's strike is over I hope those responsible for crafting this depressing trash get kicked out of the Writers Union! I'm sure there are plenty of talented writers in the world who can churn out a decent story, and would give their eye-teeth to break into show business! One can only hope!",Jumper

I have a lot of free time though, so I watched this film to see if I could be surprised and/or entertained in any way. I have been. I'm glad to say that I have finally found a movie worth watching after swallowing a lot of rubbish that, funny enough, get higher scores here. I guess I'm better off watching films before reading any reviews. The plot is somehow original, interesting and intense. It doesn't really go through that ""twilight"" road full of troubled teenagers in love trying to hide a shallow and childish script. Jumper is presented in an appropriate way for adults. Excellent special effects and action that will keep you stuck to your seat until the end. Somehow, the ending is a bit rushy (I wonder what happened to the other Jumper), but it's not bad. Overall a nice, entertaining film. Recommended (even if you don't like the black Nick Fury).",Jumper
118,thomvic,If I had the ability to jump - jump away from this while watching!,1,22 July 2011,"Jumper has an interesting premise but absolutely horrible execution in what could have been an appealing superhero/adventure/science fiction type film but fails to explore anything remotely interesting.David (Hayden Christianson) has the power to 'jump' (aka: teleport) into thin air to places. He falls for the young girl of his teen years, meets up with her later then realises some bad guys who are out to kill the jumpers are after him. Then he meets another jumper and they team up - ta da! There's your plot.....lame.Yes the plot isn't lame in the fact that this is something so familiar that we have seen before, but it is lame in the fact that the characters are pretty much cardboard cut outs. The spunky looking guy who sort of lives by his own rules and is one dimensional, the naive girl who is the damsel in distress and for some weird reason just whisks off to Rome with David just after she is asked.What is even more disappointing is that the film does not attempt to explain the mystery phenomenon of how David gets his powers in the first place - it just came to him like that out of nowhere I suppose because he came from a bad family? Then it pretty much whisks you off into random parts of the world - yes I know the scenery is nice but I'm sorry it's just a load of nonsense.There is no develpoment in this film - it's all spectacle and coolness with no meaning behind it. That is what makes other films more interesting - Spiderman, X men for example give attempts at least to have a deeper meaning to them than just random teleporting.What I found most interesting is that in the beginning, David is watching a news coverage on TV of a flood that impacted people in a country who are dying and he takes one glance then goes about his daily life. Were the makers aiming for an unsympathetic sort of superhero? Well it worked. I suppose not everyone with these abilities will want to be noble but it is hard to care about someone who pretty much wants everything for himself only.Samuel L Jackson is ridiculous in this role and is wasted in here big time. Overall, this is not a satisfying movie with dull performances -Jamie Bell just looked terrible in this film and out of place. The editing was done way too fast and was all over the place with the camera moving everywhere making me a bit dizzy.So do yourself a favour - try to jump away from this film and save yourself 85 minutes of nonsense.",Jumper

They must be blind and not very smart people.This movie was great. Pretty cool premise and backstory, thanks to Steven Gould who wrote the original novel Jumper (1992) from which the film is loosely based on. The novel was followed by Reflex (2004), Impulse (2013), and Exo (2014). Impulse got a two-season show made by YouTube from 2018-2019 which I will check out after writing this review.Anyway, the story is based on a cool superpower we all wish we had and the protagonist is a young guy who has fun with it. There are some fighting scenes that I thought were fun to watch. The protagonist Hayden Christensen did a fine job as well as Rachel Bilson, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jamie Bell. Not really sure why Kristen Stewart was in this movie for 20-seconds? The rest of the cast were immediately forgettable.The cinematography, directing, screenplay - all were fine. No complaints from me.Conclusion: overall this is a fun movie to watch. It is a cool movie. Has good enough acting. There is some nice fight scenes. Unfortunately, the movie has a sort of open-ended ending, which makes sense since the author of the novel wrote many more novels on this universe after.8/10 - a movie that can be enjoyed by males from teens to their 40s.",Jumper
120,robertallenandersonjr,Jumper was surprisingly a really good movie,9,10 April 2008,"Jumper was a really great, and exciting movie. I didn't expect a lot going into this movie because the idea of a guy having the power to jump from place to place without walking. It seemed a little bit weird and cheesy to me. It was really amazing though and it caught my attention really quick. The first ten minutes of this movie were so cool. I loved the idea of having Hayden Christensen playing the main character who is a jumper. I thought that he nailed the part. The girl that he liked through the whole movie was very cute and did a great job as well. I also liked the idea of throwing a love story into the mix of the story. One thing that I didn't like about the movie was Samuel L. Jackson being in this kind of movie. I didn't think they needed to have him play the part of the man who tries to kill all the jumpers in the world. The action scenes in this movie were very cool to watch. This movie was very entertaining as well and is worth every penny you pay to see it. The visual effects were very sweet and thought that it could win an award. In conclusion this movie was very exciting and is worth seeing, you will be entertained the whole movie. Trust me you will not want to miss out on this movie. You wont want to get up out of your seat at all for anything. Just go see it especially teens you will mostly enjoy it.",Jumper
121,simonparker1990,A very mixed bag to be honest...,5,14 February 2008,"I was really looking forward to Jumper, the initial idea very much intrigued me, the trailer looked brilliant in my opinion, the fact Doug Liman was directing it excited me, then of course there was the small matter of Samuel L Jackson being in the movie! The fact Hayden Christenson, the man who ruined Star Wars Episode II because of his cheesy acting, was the lead actor did not initially scare me. In fact as I sat down in the cinema today I expect Jumper to be a brilliant, enjoyable, sci-fi romp that would leave me feeling fulfilled and happy. I suppose my expectations were far to high, as when I left Jumper I felt nothing but emptiness. Sure it was moderately entertaining, and Jamie Bell was absolutely brilliant, but for a movie that last 90 minutes so little seemed to happen. I knew as much about the characters at the end as I did at the beginning. Its essentially an extremely dumb movie designed to lure in crowds, this would be fine if the action came thick and fast, unfortunately it doesn't. In fact there are extremely long stretches where the action completely dries up. The movie is also way too short, everything feels just so rushed that you forget what is going on. Thankfully the movie does entertain, it is quite fun to watch and you won't be bored in the film.So let me start on the performances. Hayden Christenson, OK I expected him to suck if I'm honest. He wasn't that great in the trailer and memories of Episode II lingered in my mind. I suppose I am too harsh on him as he did do a decent job in Revenge of the Sith, not brilliant but he was tolerable. Here however he surprised me, I actually saw potential in the actor for the first time. He isn't going to go and win an Oscar, but he does put on a good performance, his character is generally likable, and at the end of it all you feel like you could spend a bit longer watching Christenson. Nevertheless, Christenson is completely overshadowed by the brilliant Jamie Bell. Bell was brilliant in Billy Elliot, and thanks to his performance here I think we might be seeing a future A-lister on our hands. Bell is brilliant, he's funny, charismatic, dark yet brilliant. He steals absolutely every scene he is in and has all the dialogue. When he walks into the movie the entire thing lights up and you start to enjoy yourself a little bit more. And then I come to Samuel L Jackson as the villain. Jackson is an amazing actor and the coolest person on earth. So what a shame to say that he has so little to do, he does well in his scenes and has some good lines, but generally he has little to do but look evil, and slightly ridiculous with that white wig. Rachel Bilson is a revelation as the love interest Millie, her character is particularly well rounded and you do find yourself caring for her. Its a shame then that she gets bogged down occasionally with some pointless scenes.Jumper works best when the action sequences kick in, a shame then that the first one doesn't occur until roughly the half way mark, and then there is a long absence of them until the ending. A scene in Rome is possibly the most memorable, although one involving Bell and a flame thrower (don't ask) is close behind. The jump effects themselves look magnificent and are a nice touch. The beginning as well is extremely well done. Sure its a bit of obligatory back story, but it work very well and is directed to perfection. The film only first gets a bit muddled when it hits the middle section, the focus is slightly blurred and the movie seems to be going nowhere at a very fast pace. Once an ending is in site the film picks up, but once again at the end it feels a bit rushed. The ending is my biggest criticism and something I have saved to last, it is to be quite honest terrible. A plot twist, that I didn't even think was a twist, occurs, and then we are left on a semi-cliffhanger with many characters fates left in the dark. Sure there is obviously going to be a sequel, I wouldn't mine one to be honest, but the ending of this movie just feels stupid and is something that I am really angry about.Jumper overall is an entertaining if unfortunately forgettable movie. Doug Liman has kicked off another franchise but by the looks of it it has a long way to go to beat the Bourne movies. Wasted characters and a muddle focus make this a disappointing movie. But if you want a moderate entertaining then this might do the trick.",Jumper

But when the action kicked in everything went so bad that the dream became a nightmare.Sure, if the story was only about a guy using teleport powers to live large then the movie would transform into a travelling tv show for a big screen. But the villains introduced to the plot were extremely raw. Judging by the explanation they have been around for quite a bit and should have known better how to deal with their jobs.It comes to my understanding that the film was targeting teenagers as the innocent love story was prevailing and the anger about this was rising all the time. Come on! The idea was so good, why would you spoil logical moves by a ""call of the heart""?The action didn't save the face of the picture either. Quick cuts and messy shots were confusing, to grasp what is happening you have to stop and disassemble every scene. And even then you will not get it.So what left in the tank? Acting? Incredibly the answer is no. Nothing there too. Maybe first ten minutes gave a hope, but everything was a lie. I believe that the characters themselves were bad, so maybe actors couldn't simply improve the thing they saw on paper, or they just didn't care.The verdict is simple for me: a great concept bombed because of the teenage soap ambitions that engulfed poorly written script.

Many, many times I walked in and out of the theater door, saying to myself ''Is this a good idea, or will I just lose 9$ for the fun of it?''. So, after thinking a lot of times, I took 10$ out of my wallet and I finally decided myself (my friend was decided long ago).Was it such a bad idea? Well, no. I really liked that movie. Well, I must say that I sometimes don't really care about the movie synopsis. Well, not sometimes, usually. As long as I understand the story, I don't mind. The young actors are really convincing (Well, Hayden Christensen was a lot more convincing than Rachel Bilson, but at least I spent a good evening because of both of them), action scenes every minute and a really great bad guy (Samuel L.

The film contains many beautiful locations, but because of the bad editing the sight we get of them is barely a glimpse of their beauty, as we repetitively just get quick shots, making far too fast a pace for it's own good as well. The characters feel unrealistic, they mostly seem to be cliché teenagers with no spark of originality, and the antagonist doesn't have a good, logical drive to kill the jumpers. I think the main reason why I wasn't fond of this film is because of it's style, though. The typical, average blockbuster that has no sense to calm down.I didn't like it, but I can see the audience that would like this. An action film, one that makes you smell the scent of popcorn around, and one to have a chuckle at with your friends. The theme song is brilliant, one you may find yourself humming to yourself at work on a rainy day.

Instead they seemed like two-year-olds squabbling. This ruined the whole thing.

But it seems to come with a lack of pretension that's actually quite refreshing when most films dealing with a topic like this would usually be swamped with back story and earnest meaning.

Liman reinvented the spy movie with The Bourne Identity, shame he can't do the same for this highly grounded an unimpressive sci-fi drama.

Of course a two star movie still has its good points. A truly memorable performance from Billie Elliot's (Jamie Bell) who has a worryingly strong British accent. The same praise for acting can also go to The O.C (Rachel Bilson) who proves to be far more sophisticated than your average girl next door. Shame that our lead can conjure up enough Charisma to even become noticeable, to even become noticeable, he has virtually no on screen chemistry with Bilson meaning their relationship status is never really fully exercised.

132,TimBoHannon,Jump Into an Intriguing World of Action,7,21 July 2008,"In 2002, director Doug Liman gave cinematic life to literary hero Jason Bourne and established a franchise in the process. With ""Jumper,"" he is attempting to do it again. Like ""The Bourne Identity,"" ""Jumper"" stars a man with extraordinary abilities who carries the burden of being pursued for reasons he cannot understand. The involvement of a woman who becomes the villains' next target is another parallel. As in ""The Bourne Identity,"" Liman films the unusually skillful action clearly. Although the writers prevent it from equaling the previous movie, he still fathers a quality product.The main character is David Rice (Hayden Christiansen), a ""jumper"" who can instantaneously transport himself anywhere in the world. Conventional superheroes use their powers to fight justice; David only employs it for his selfish desires. ""Jumper"" is not afraid to explore the question, ""If you had this power, how would you use it?"" Rice sees television news coverage of people dying in a flood and, instead of helping, changes the channel. He jumps into foreign countries so he can have sex with beautiful women one moment and pilfer their banks the next.We learn that Jumpers have existed for centuries. All that time, they have been pursued by Paladins, fanatical killers sworn to make jumpers extinct. It seems logical that the jumpers, with their superhuman powers of mobility, have the advantage. They do not. The Paladins' advanced weapons and efficient methods make them the more powerful faction. Every time David encounters some, they quickly gain the upper hand.The story opens in Ann Arbor while David is still young. He gives a beautiful gift to his crush, Millie (AnnaSophia Robb), but falls under a frozen river while trying to save it. Apparently certain to drown, he ""jumps"" to the local library instead. Seeing a road to freedom from his abusive dad (Michael Rooker), he runs away before his survival can be discovered. Many years later, David reunites with Millie (Rachel Bilson) and meets Griffin (Jamie Bell), a jumper who informs him of the threat to their lives.His antics of stealing from banks without using an entrance interests Roland (Samuel L. Jackson, becoming quite an action icon lately), the worldwide leader of the Paladins. A real life thief emptied a vault by placing his tools in the ceiling and waiting in a corner hidden by converging rows of safety deposit boxes. Anyway, back to the movie.""Jumper"" is only 88 minutes long, which is the problem. Including fifteen extra minutes would have markedly improved the movie. Its hero does not have a large built-in following or an A-List lead, so its short length may have been an attempt to keep the budget low. That solution was probably not necessary. The sets were already built, the actors salaries were not going to change, and there is already enough action. Despite an uneven performance by Christiansen and an underemphasized one by Bilson, David and Rachel are genuine characters struggling to blossom in a script that cheats them.Christensen masterfully projects sadness and panic, but cannot avoid flatness in more normal emotional states. It feels like he is holding back. Anakin Skywalker, especially in ""The Revenge of the Sith,"" fits his strengths. His performance here more resembles a seismograph with more valleys than peaks. Bilson also falls just short of showing true emotion. She also appears to be holding back. Perhaps that is the limit of her capabilities; I never watched ""The O.C."" Bell gives the best performance as the deadly jumper, but I have trouble understanding some of his lines (I have minor hearing loss). As a compatriot, he wants to help David, but fears his ignorance and disagrees with his decisions.The King of Cool (Jackson) gives another example of how great he is as focused, passionate men of action. He has never failed to inhabit a character's antagonism towards his enemies and channel it towards the audience with the force of an artillery cannon. The look on his face as he sprays an aerosol can into the air is priceless.As all of the story lines are left unresolved, the story depends on a sequel. For a time, it looked like there would not be one. That would be a pity since what we see and hear is so good. ""Jumper"" exceeded its budget worldwide, and judging by how many copies my local Blockbuster stocks, it will make a tidy profit. Now that enough interest has been generated for Fox to approve ""Jumper 2,"" it is time to give David Rice and company a more detailed story with a beginning, middle and end. They were able to get away with it once, but they need to do better next time to reach the same level of artistic success.",Jumper
133,Bungle-9,"Poor, should have jumped from the cinema",5,17 February 2008,"I'm going to make it quick so you can make a quick decision when deciding to see this or not.What has it got going for it? Great effects, interesting exploitation of the teleportation idea, a decent performance from Jamie Bell, a good score, a good soundtrack and Samuel L. Jackson, the US equivalent of Michael Caine.What's it got against it? Unclear shaky cam action, poor dialogue between the male and female leads, little characterisation, irritating editing, wooden performance from Christiensen, wooden performance from Bilson, no chemistry between the two, poor pacing and no sense of passage of time. Also Samuel L. Jackson doesn't swear.So there you have it. I'm sure you can decide by weighing up those lists. If you like eye candy or any of the people starring in it in the hope that one day they may be waiting for you for real instead of a wall poster when you arrive home some day, then perhaps you'll get something out of it.

134,powerfull_jedi,The plots makes it's fair share of jumps,6,15 February 2008,"I didn't read the book, but from what I've seen Jumper is an average action movie based solely on a great concept. Young David Rice discovers that he has the power to teleport to any desired location, that happens when he falls through an ice cap in the river near his school, with his new found ability Rice flees from his father and seeks a new life for himself in the big city.Normally in a superhero fashion, David should only use his powers for good, but his only chance to make it big is make one simple heist, that indeed gets him by, but when a mysterious man known as Roland(played by Samuel Jackson) enters his life 8 years later, he's thrown into a secret war between people who have the ability to teleport and those hell bent on hunting them down,and that's pretty much where the plot begins to show it's most glaring flaws.Rice apparently walks away with millions of dollars and nobody notices a young man suddenly making it big with a deluxe apartment affording it all with stolen bills which were likely marked and what is his occupation exactly? I'm sure somebody in the IRS would raise an eyebrow, not some Paladins(the people who hunt down Jumpers)...And would they mind filling us in on how exactly is this secret war going on(all we know is that it's been around since ancient times). Also some things aren't very clever, the hero who just gets exposed wants to take his long time girlfriend on a trip, even though some shadowy group will likely harm his relatives and close friends? How reckless...There's just too many unanswered questions in Jumper...Acting-wise, Samuel L. Jackson just does his same routine, the difference is that he sports white hair and stabs Jumpers with a knife that's for some reason always concealed before each kill. Hayden Christensen has sorta matured since his Star Wars years, playing a somewhat grey but well intented anti-hero, but often times he just seems bored. The actor playing Griffin ends up being far more interesting then the main hero, occasionally stealing the hero's thunder.We also have great action scenes and good special effects, but in itself, Jumper is an average at best action movie, that's not going to be remembered much.",Jumper
135,markymark70,Great premise - poor story - 5/10.,5,13 November 2009,"What can I say about this film? The premise is a really original one - a guy who can teleport from one spot to another by the power of his mind. And not only that - but he doesn't go down the tried and trusted (and to be honest clichéd) route of super-herodom, saving all manners of unfortunates along the way and battling against a stereo-typical baddie. Spider-Man has been done - and quite enjoyably too - but this film does not go down that route. I commend it for that.However, the plaudits stop rolling here.The prequel scenes showing David Rice (our Jumper of the title) are better than the main scenes with the lead actor. That's gotta hurt. To me Christensen (who I have never seen in a movie before btw) is as wooden as a 2x4. The young actor playing his character was able to portray more emotion in a second's linger on his face than Christensen did for the remainder of the film. I heard he put in a good acting shift in 'Shattered Glass' but here he is terrible.But he is not the main problem here. The main glaring issue with this movie is the bad guys. Samuel L Jackson is playing Samuel L Jackson at this stage - but his motives are quite unclear and never fully resolved or explained. He is a member of some strange organisation - the Paladins - who track down and kill the Jumpers. Why? Because apparently these Jumpers all turn bad eventually. Not much of a reason is it? Apparently they have been chasing Jumpers for 100's of years. That is the story! Really. There is nothing else under the surface - no real emotional pow, no impact, nothing. The Jump scenes are okay if a little distracting at times (or downright silly and badly done like the car chase in Tokyo) but the reasoning behind the chase is not fully explored. Also the Jumpers seem to teleport anywhere they like - and be seen by loads of people - yet they never become national news. A small boy sees both Jumpers disappear before his eyes in a busy airport - but nothing becomes of it? Come on - Lindsay Lohan changes her hair colour and it is splashed on the newspapers and TV for days. Surely, disappearing people would warrant a mention at least.Jamie Bell's character - Griffin - is a strange one too. He is a good actor and plays his part well - but the part itself makes no sense. He is on the trail of the head Paladin - Jackson - for 10 years with no luck in killing him, yet when Christensen comes on the scene with an offer to help - he turns him down flat. Why? No idea. Christensen then ends up fighting with Griffin - ridiculous. The last 20 minutes of the film descend into downright farce - and it ain't a particularly long film either - clocking in at a trim 88 minutes. Too many stupid things happen in the film - and I got the sense the whole way through that the makers were simply treating this movie as a first instalment of what they hoped would be a franchise ala Spider-Man or X-men. It won't be.Great premise - poor story - 5/10.",Jumper

137,rbsjrx,An OK movie,6,15 June 2008,"I've read the comments and the ones who got it right are those who observe that this is a good way to spend of couple of hours of your life with your brain in neutral. With minimal expectations and open to its entertainment value, you won't want those two hours back.I didn't particularly like Hayden Christensen in Star Wars and he wasn't any better here. Fortunately, the rest of the cast took up the slack. OTOH, the effects are generally good and the director exhibits both a good eye and some wit. The plot, although derivative, has a refreshingly original spin to it. Better yet, no effort is made to explain cause of the phenomenon, only its effect on the people who intersect it.Still, that does leave some gaping plot holes that you could drive a truck through, but that gets back to the point of leaving your brain in neural for the duration. This is not SF, it is fantasy, so you shouldn't necessarily expect the rules of physics (or logic) to apply.The greatest criticism I could level at this film is that there was no character with whom I felt any particular empathy. Hayden Christensen's protagonist is self-centered and cares for little more than his own minute-to-minute gratification. How can you care about what happens to a character who doesn't care about any one else? I suspect the villains are as two-dimensional as they are because if they weren't, you'd care more about them than the ""hero"".As I said, entertaining enough, but devoting more than the minimum required number of brains cells to it is to quickly reach a point of diminishing returns.",Jumper

139,Chiller7,Interesting exploration of the classic theme: What would you do with superpowers?,10,9 January 2016,"General comments: I enjoyed it. Clever creative use of the teleportation powers. Good actions scenes and visual effects. The romance is a simplistic one between characters who aren't quite mature, but the story doesn't pretend that its characters are anything but immature, so that's fine. Story wastes no time with exposition at all, doesn't bother explaining everything in detail and instead prefers to thrust you right into the action at all times. I actually liked this minimalistic story telling style. Yes, it doesn't even bother detailing where the ""jumping"" power even comes from or explaining much backstory behind the villains; but the main character doesn't even know these things - he's just blindly thrust into it all, like we are - so it's fine if we, the audience, doesn't get a clear explanation either.Themes: I see people complaining that this movie's main character is not a hero and they're right. Hayden Christensen's Jumper character is immature and selfish and doesn't use his powers to protect people or save the world. It's a superpower story, but the main guy is no superhero - but that's actually what I think makes this story interesting.Jumper's story is an interesting exploration of an idea we've all thought of: What would you do if you had superpowers - use them for altruistic or selfish purposes? Most of us would probably like to imagine ourselves as heroes. If we had superpowers, we'd all try to save the world, right? No, I think that's just an unrealistic fantasy. The truth is, most of us would probably be just like Hayden Christensen's Jumper character and use our powers for selfish gain. I am Hayden Christensen and so are you! That's the truth! This idea dates back to Greek philosophy and Plato's Ring of Gyges. If there are no consequences to your actions, could you resist doing bad things? This is deep stuff, not just simple ""popcorn-flick"" material!I've been a fan of superhero stories since forever ago, but I always find myself wondering, why don't more super powered characters use their powers for their own personal fun and profit. If you had super strength, would you rather risk life and limb fighting street muggers, or would you rather earn mega-millions as a superstar athlete? If you could read minds, could you resist flying straight to Las Vegas and raking in cash by beating everyone at poker? Even beyond imaginary scenarios, look at the real world we live in: we have computers and the Internet, technology of the future that allow us abilities, essentially superpowers, that people of the past couldn't have even imagined. Do we use these ""superpowers"" for saving the world? No, most of us are on our computers for personal entertainment and enjoyment! When so many of us don't mind illegally downloading music/movies/software, because we know we can't get caught online, can we criticize Hayden Christensen for using his ""jumping"" ability to rob banks? If you could teleport, you'd rob banks too! Don't deny it!But then, here's another idea I've thought about long before ever seeing this movie: If you had superpowers, do you simply assume that you're the only one, or could there be others out there with powers to match your own? Could the use of your superpowers attract unwanted attention from hostile forces? Jumper explores this idea too, with the emergence of Sam Jackson and Jamie Bell's characters. They represent the other people out who might not like you and your powers, people who have powers of their own. What do you do when you suddenly get caught for crimes you thought you could get away with? To refer back to the computer/internet analogy again, it's like if you've been downloading pirated copyrighted content for years and then suddenly the FBI confronts you at your door. You'd think you don't deserve punishment because you were never really hurting anyone, right? But as Sam Jackson says in the film, ""There are always consequences!""Conclusion: Anyway, I think this is an underrated movie with deeper themes than some people realize.",Jumper

142,shiftyeyeddog,Getting ahead of themselves - assuming audiences will be hungry for more,6,1 March 2008,"To sum it up quickly: Too much setup. This entire film should have been the first half-hour of a bigger story. They try to make this just a first chapter, like an ""origin"" story in a superhero film, but if you're gonna spend the whole film setting up a story, and leave an ending wide open for sequels, you better be damn sure the public will actually care enough to see more. I don't think that will be the case here. Perhaps if it had been filmed and marketed as a teen flick as the book was, the series could have a longer life; but as an adult franchise I'd be surprised if there are further installments.It wasn't a bad flick. It was a fun distraction for an hour or two, with some good action and visuals, but it was certainly nothing special. I think much of that is due to the cast. Diane Lane is always good, but she was barely in it, and Samuel L. Jackson was just distracting - partly because of the pointless white hair, and partly because pairing him with Hayden Christiansen constantly reminded you of Star Wars and took you out of the movie. The main stars, Christensen himself and Rachel Bilson, were just so...blah. I actually would have preferred if Jamie Bell had been the star instead of just a supporting role.",Jumper

However, I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the film from the start. For what it is, Jumper is well made and has no glaring weak points. The acting is credible, Samuel Jackson actually bothers to turn in something of a performance, and some of the action scenes are absolutely terrific. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER!!! The flamethrower part was a brilliant touch :o) Since it is a pretty straightforward action movie, character development is pretty thin, but if you want that, watch TV series such as the incredible Battlestar Galactica. It's hard to have electric fast-paced action and character development in a 2-hour flick. While Jumper is not groundbreaking, it is certainly better than an awful lot of SF/fantasy movies out there.

There. I saved you $12.00 and 100 minutes of your time, energy, and hopefully, taste in films. Bland Jumper is just as bland her as he was as Anakin Skywalker.

If I hear ""David"" ""David, what's going on?"" or anything with David in the sentence one more time, I'm gonna scream. Euro Jumper would've made a better lead if given the chance.

146,tendobear,Frustrating,6,8 November 2012,"Another example of a fantastic idea ruined by the execution. That's one of the most annoying things about Doug Liman's movies - his movies have this great concept at the core, but more often than not, these concepts and ideas are direly under-cooked or muddled. For me, the teleportation aspect was sorely under-used and under-explored. What's even worse is the idea that a secret society of Paladins are out to hunt down these teleporters because they are abominations to God. So far, so clichéd! More time could've been spent on the Paladins, explaining a little more about their background and mandate, but instead, they were more like a side-note or afterthought just so Hayden Christensen has baddies to fight. Oh, that brings me to the leads - Christensen has to be one of the worse actors ever, he's not so much as wooden as leaden! Possibly worst choice ever to play a guy who's conflicted about his powers, leaving his father all alone and having a mother who's a Paladin. For some reason, I just don't like Rachel Bilson, it may just be her character in this movie, but she was irritating, which has caused me to avoid all of Bilson's other movies. Jamie Bell was brilliant though, unashamed of his powers, but street-wise enough to avoid Paladin detection, you can tell he had fun playing his role.

Hayden Skywalker and his on screen love interest have no chemistry (even less than he had with Natalie Portman in Star Wars if that's possible)...The film starts out by establishing our characters, a teenage geek who gets made fun of by all his peers except his life-long friend and crush Millie. David, our main character, finds out he can teleport while narrating unnecessarily A LOT. Then suddenly David switches actors and becomes Hayden Christensen, who looks nothing like the kid they got to play his younger self (completely different facial structure, etc)... Not only does he change actors but so does his love interest Millie, and again the new actress doesn't look like her... Oh, how it confounds me...So David teleports around, robbing banks and having fun, until Samuel L. Jackson (made to look like Dennis Rodman, remember him) shows up. Jackson is apparently a ""paladin"" though very little about them is established.

It turned out to be reasonably good, and pretty much on par for this type of movie. To say much more than that would be to make a mountain out of a mole hill. There just wasn't a whole lot to it.I did not like the casting of Samual Jackson in this movie. His character should have been evil and menacing, and Samual Jackson just isn't evil and menacing. He is also too familiar. The movie would have been much better if they had used a lesser known actor capable of coming across as truly menacing.It was interesting to see Diane Lane, but she was sort of wasted on a part that was barely even there. Given how small that part was, it would have made little difference who was cast in that part, so it is sort of surprising to see Diane Lane.The ending seemed a setup for a sequel, but if there is a sequel, it will likely be direct-to-video, and probably not very much worth watching.

152,Sweet_Ophelia,A good idea poorly executed,2,18 February 2008,"Based on the 1992 novel by Steven Gould, 'Jumper' is a story of 'Jumpers' - genetic oddities. Human-beings with the ability to somehow cause a rip through space and time and 'jump' to any destination in the world. Their only restrictions are that they have to be able to visualize their destination  so either they have to have been there before, or seen pictures of the place. The jumper protagonist of Doug Liman's (The Bourne Identity) movie is David Rice (Hayden Christensen) who discovered his genetic talents as a teenager and promptly left home to live it up robbing banks and traipsing all over the world in his down time. Eight years later from when we first see David realize his potential and leave behind his hopeless single-parent father, a mysterious man by the name of Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) is hot on his trail and seems to know about his abilities. Armed with tricky gadgetry and a holier-than-though attitude toward Jumpers like David, Roland explains that he is a Paladin, from an organization that track down and kill Jumpers for the good of the Universe, implying that their jumping has some adverse affects on the natural world? Now on the run from these Paladin's, David returns to his home town and to his childhood sweetheart, Millie (Rachel Bilson) whom he whisks away to Rome for some inexplicable reason. While on the run from the Paladin's David meets Griffin (Jamie Bell), a fellow jumper who has a personal vendetta against all Paladins.The premise was interesting. The trailer was okay. The film was based on a fairly well- received science fiction book. So how bad could this big blockbuster flick be?Bad.What you see in the trailer is the best of the film. You can't really pin-point the faults to one specific area. Yes, the writing is bad. Not awful, but tweaks were definitely needed  dialogue was flat and there was little to no characterization. The cast don't quite work. Hayden Christensen, widely despised by Star Wars fans everywhere seems to be a supporting actor in a leading mans clothes. He just doesn't have the charisma, likability, that 'it' factor to carry such a role. Rachel Bilson  presumably cast for being Rachel Bilson  seems to be thrown into the mix as a love interest after-thought and her presence throughout is puzzling. She is bland, but you can't really blame her (well you could... she is just playing a slightly less Californian version of Summer Roberts), her character really was just thrown into the film for the seeming romantic hell of it? Samuel L. Jackson isn't really making any stretches with the role of ambiguous bad guy. Jamie Bell was underused and underdeveloped. Mostly it's all a bit too all over the place (literally and figuratively). The 'jumps' are pretty cool. An impressive special effect that looks almost like a mini- hurricane when the characters jump. The locations are incredible  the Colosseum, Egypt, Big Ben. But the actual plot is all over the place. Why did David return to his home town? Why did he come back for Millie after eight years of letting people think he was dead? Who are the Paladins, apart from an organization who hate jumpers? What is it that allows these jumpers to jump? How many jumpers are there in the world? How did Griffin get out of that sticky situation? Part of the faults of the plot are to do with the fact that so much is left wide open for a sequel. So many unanswered questions intended to keep us guessing until the second movie just leave great big gaping holes in the film that irritate. In the end the movie is utterly dissatisfying, verging on frustrating. This is most definitely one of the worst movie's of 2008. And it's only February.

153,Merklin,"A great idea, shame about the execution.",6,24 February 2008,"What would happen if you could teleport ANYWHERE in the world in the blink of an eye? Thats the question explored in Jumper, a film thats as fast and action packed as it is hollow and underdeveloped.The films theme of individuals who can vanish and reappear anywhere they choose is a great idea but its execution is a little weak in Jumper. Why? The blame rest squarely on the films instance on being the start of a series. Instead of taking time to develop anything in the movie, Jumper just whizzes by at an incredible speed, setting up characters, ideas and plot points without expanding or resolving or developing them. The whole thing is made to kick start a franchise of films where the story would be explained in more detail, but come on man, when you pay to see a film, you expect to see a clearly defined beginning, a middle and a satisfying end- something that Jumper isn't too concerned with.Another problem that ties in with the films lack of depth, are the actors. While Hayden Christensen is as bland as usual, the cast (including the usually electrifying Sam Jackson) just sleep walk their way through the superficial script. Only Jamie Bell gives it some effort- his cynical Irish jumper would have made a much better lead character than Anakin.However, while the film is pretty shallow there are some glimmers of goodness. The action sequences are fun, fast and frequent, the visual effects are cool and there's never a dull moment due to the films super fast pace.It might sound like Im being too harsh on the film but its hard not to be when the movies concept is so great and the end product is as underdeveloped as this.

154,zerogirl42,Great Popcorn Flick,7,25 February 2008,"Wow, I'm surprised Jumper got such a low rating. It's much better than the National Treasure sequel.There's plenty of action, a cohesive story, and fun special-effects. The fight scenes are extremely creative too. I was on the edge of my seat, awestruck by some of the chase scenes.It's not an academy award winner, but it's definitely an enjoyable film. Bell is the perfect, comedic foil to balance Christensen's sadness in the film. Their interaction reminds me of the dynamic between Spike and Angel in the Joss Whedon TV shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel.The film focuses on Christensen's character and how his superpower effects his life. Jumper begins with some of the lead characters in high school and the casting is excellent for the younger versions of the stars. They actually look like they're in high school too. Their interactions are believable and set up situations that become important later in the film.Superpowers seem to be popular these days with the success of shows like Heroes and The 4400. Basically, Jumper explores one superpower that is shared by a select few. There's also another group of people called Paladins who view jumping as an abomination of God. Jackson plays the typical villain, but excels in the ""worst hair"" category (the whole audience laughed and snickered when he came on screen).I won't give away too much. If you enjoy shows like Heroes and The 4400, you might really like Jumper. The acting is decent. The script does a good job of adding comedy when needed and mostly avoids clichéd dialog. I say mostly because it's not perfect, but there are definitely some original jokes in Jumper. It had much better dialog than something like Star Wars Episode 1.If you're looking for a fun time at the movies that won't break your brain, this is a good choice. It would probably work well as a first date movie too. It's been a long time since I saw a good, popcorn flick. I almost forgot to mention, the film takes place in amazing settings like Rome, Tokyo, Egypt, London, and the Mojave Desert, . I felt like I took a mini trip around the world.",Jumper
155,petsteph1,Great idea but the script really sucked...,5,25 February 2008,"I went with my teen-aged kids. We ate popcorn. I like Science Fiction. We all nodded happily after the first ten minutes but by the time we walked out at the end we were agreeing that something sucked and it wasn't the popcorn.Some great ideas, teleportation and all that. A very interesting plot development of enemies who are tracking down Jumpers and killing them because they are abominations. Interesting scenes all over the planet. What could go wrong? First crack was the truly mind-numbing love interest. Every time I see a 20s-something American couple doing the mating ritual according to Hollywood I just cringe in my seat and grind my teeth. My kids just groan and start sending text messages to their friends. Does anyone actually talk or behave like that? And if they really do do we have to be shown it? And if we have to be shown it can't it just happen once and be over quick? Unfortunately, Doug Liman, or someone, decided we needed to experience the tender, brave, sensitive, sardonic, cloyingly naive but sophisticated guff again and again.The second crack was the middle act where the hero meets and teams up with another, more experienced jumper. Great! Now we can have some more interesting teleportation stuff. Unfortunately, their scenes together were slammed through in fast motion, including some really neat effects - but so fast that it was almost impossible to follow what was happening. And then we were back to the love-interest sub-plot and I started to look at my empty popcorn container with thoughts of jamming it over my head.The third crack was the scary innocent-bystander death toll. This was what offended my kids the most. At the start of the movie the hero finances his career by robbing banks. We were prepared to overlook this moral lapse until the body count started rising. Innocent bus passengers and Mexican farmers die while our hero and his buddy do their superfast teleportation stuff. Hmmph.The complete disintegration occurred when the hero left his well-meaning buddy trapped in a cage of high-voltage conductors - yes, so he could go rescue the girl. We were saying: ""No! No! Forget the girl. She sucks! Save your buddy - he's a much better character and much more likable!"" but the script writer didn't hear us and so the whole thing shattered and we left disgruntled.Don't see this movie if you like popcorn, SF or are young at heart. It'll just make you feel sad....",Jumper
156,Neenee-b,Jumps just short of being a great movie,6,17 February 2008,"I went to see Jumper for one reason and one reason only - teleportation. I loved Nightcrawler as a kid and because of this if I ever have the chance to chose a superpower teleportation would be my choice.Even though Doug Liman was directing I wasn't expecting much as it is a film whose lead star is Hayden Christensen an actor totally devoid of showing charisma or leading man qualities.The plot focuses on David (Christensen), who discovers he can teleport at the age of fifteen when he is drowning in a frozen lake. He leaves his father, robs a bank and for the next eight years lives in a life of luxury in a swanky new apartment Jumping around the world to various holiday spots, and lets face it who wouldn't do this? It doesn't seem to bother him at all that he is apparently the only person this earth who has this ability..It is not long before we meet Roland, an NSA agent played by Samuel L Jackson, who hunts the Jumpers, not because they are all criminals but only ""because God should have the power to be at all places at the one time"". Roland was called in to capture David after the bank robbery and has been searching for him for eight years and after he finally tracks David down in this swanky apartment David escapes, but instead of going into hiding heads straight back home, to take his high school sweetheart Millie, acted extremely badly by the extremely beautiful Rachel Bilson, to Rome.It all gets a bit predictable from there with Roland capturing Millie in order to get to David.There was one stand out character in the whole of the movie - Griffin played by the excellent Jamie Bell, who was more watchable and entertaining that the two leads put together. His character should have had much more screen time and Jamie's mother will be proud that he has the accolade of taking the movies one and only ""F"" word away from Samuel L Jackson and I believe that it was the shock of this that turned Jacksons hair the most unnatural shade of white in movie history.The Jumping action itself was over used slightly in Davids apartment, for example, he Jumps just to reach the remote and Jumps to the fridge but then again I suppose I probably would too.The best Jump fight would have to be between David and Griffin as they Jumped to and from various countries and situations it just look fantastic and was very fast paced. The final confrontation between Roland and David was a little underwhelming and the subplot involving Davids mother was a bit pointless and unnecessary.Overall I would give it a 6/10. I think that some more detail and exploration was needed into the Jumping ability - what makes people able to Jump and why - and who decided, apart from Roland, that Jumpers must be stopped and who invented the technology to do stop them? Jumper is a good, solid, entertaining movie but you cant help feel that there was a better one waiting to get out. It is one of those movies that you actually want to have a sequel to flesh out a good premise properly.",Jumper
157,stewiefan201,Jumper is basically an action movie trailer dragged out to a dull 88 minutes.,4,23 February 2008,"Jumper is the new movie from Doug Liman, the director of The Bourne Identity. It is about a boy named David (Hayden Christenson) who discovers he has the power to teleport to different places, after he has an accident and falls through the ice into a frozen lake. He quickly realizes his new powers can turn his life around. David soon leaves his abusive father behind, and lives life on his own living off money he robs from banks by just teleporting into the money vaults without opening the doors. Around a decade later he is about 25 years old and living an enjoyable, albeit selfish, life. He can teleport anywhere whether it be the top of a skyscraper in the rain, or the head of the Sphinx in Egypt. However trouble occurs when a man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) finds him and attempts to kill him for being a jumper. David goes back to his hometown to escape the trouble and while there finds Millie (Rachel Bilson), the girl he loved as a kid. Very quickly David runs away with to Rome, and while there he is being hunted by Roland's people. Eventually he meets another jumper Griffin (Jamie Bell) who tells him that there is a war going on between jumpers and paladins (Roland's people). From there on in a war ensues as David, Millie, and Griffin try to survive the vicious paladins.At 88 minutes Jumper is a short movie, but a sloppy and lazy one at that. When I see a movie trailer I can usually predict whether that movie will be good or bad. When I saw the trailer for Jumper I predicted it to be high on CGI, but shallow overall. That is exactly what I got with this movie. First off I do not like Hayden Christenson as an actor, on screen he displays wooden emotion and comes off boring. Samuel L. Jackson seems to try his hardest, but he really needs to go back to normal movies and stop making ridiculous films that involve snakes, planes, and teleportation. Recently Jackson never delves into a character in his movies, you always know that that's Samuel L. Jackson, and although I think he's a cool actor he shouldn't be doing that. As for the rest of the bunch, Rachel Bilson also gives a mostly stale performance while Jamie Bell steals the show by far. I also do not buy the whole ridiculous character twist, having Millie see David for the first time in a decade for 5 minutes, and suddenly running off to Rome with him. I don't buy that at all and it's just a way to work for the movie to get it running. Surprisingly Diane Lane also shows up for about 3 or 4 minutes so I can't really comment on her too much.However the problems with Jumper do not really lie within the actors. It is the story and the way the plot plays out that is both lazy and uninteresting. The character griffin explains to David that there is a war that has been going on between jumpers and paladins for centuries. Yet other than that there really is no explanation. We never find out how big this war is, how the government keeps this under wraps, or very much else about anything the plot is about. The reason the film gets lazy in explanation is because it obviously relies on the impending sequel(s). Jumper takes the easy way out and procrastinates, making it obvious the filmmakers said ""We'll explain the plot in part 2 if there is one"". The part of Jumper that did interest me however was that it answers an interesting question. What would a normal person do if they received superpowers such as teleportation? Jumper shows that a person may easily turn into a self absorbed jerk just like David in film.Even the effects don't really dazzle or amaze me. When David teleports to the top of a skyscraper in the rain it should look awesome, instead it looks like he's standing in front of a green screen with expensive CGI splattered behind him. The teleportation plot sounds cool and original, and is for a while but eventually it gets annoying and the ""cool"" wears off. With an 85 million dollar budget I expect special effects that look a lot less fake and superficial. In fact that's kind of what Jumper is, a superficially hollow action thriller.Overall Jumper is so far 2008's idol friendly neighborhood Hollywood movie. By that I mean high on special effects, budget, and big name actors but low on an interesting plot, run-time, and excitement. I give Jumper a 1.5 out of 4. It's basically a high octane 88 minute movie trailer that is both lazy and unexciting.",Jumper
158,TheUnseenMovieLover,"A Fun Blockbuster, But Lacking In Human Interest",5,29 March 2008,"Over the last couple of years, 20th Century Fox has produced films which not only let down their fan base, but also people who were entirely new to the films premise (anyone who has seen Eragon and/or The Dark Is Rising will know what I'm talking about). Of course, not all of the films which they have released in the last few years are terrible (Revenge of the Sith, Die Hard 4.0 and The Simpsons were all terrifically enjoyable), but with every reasonably good film from the studio, there is always a sneaking suspicion that a bad one will zoom around the corner and smack you hard in the face. Jumper falls somewhere in between the two camps. It is nowhere near the horror of The Dark Is Rising, or the (for me, anyway) crushing disappointment of Eragon, but it isn't likely to be remembered as a pinnacle for the action-adventure genre either (although director Doug Liman's The Bourne Identity came pretty close). This is largely due to the fact that, despite energetic and character-building turns from the excellent Jamie Bell and Rachel Bilson, the storyline and characters are extremely thin. Also, whilst Samuel L. Jackson manfully struggles to make an interesting character out of the villainous Roland, Hayden Christensen is at times crushingly dull as the film's hero. It is criminal for any member of the cast or crew to simply cruise through the process of making a movie. For the lead to do this, it almost entirely ruins the fun of the film and the effort that other people have put into making it. As the young David, Max Thieriot is only on screen for the first ten to fifteen minutes, yet delivers a much more human and layered performance then Christensen in the role. Also, Christensen isn't really likable, which is not a good quality for a hero to have. Although Christensen has his moments (the moment where he finds his father (an effective turn from Michael Rooker) after he has suffered Roland's fury is convincing enough to satisfy most viewers), his performance is largely dull and devoid of fun, two qualities which aren't good for a lead character. However, the movie does have its good points. After directing The Bourne Identity and Mr. And Mrs. Smith, Doug Liman has shown that he knows how to direct an action scene. This film may not be as action packed as people are hoping for, but there are several impressive pieces of action nonetheless. Sequences such as the first encounter between David and Roland have a grittiness which, despite the fact that they are in different genres, reminded me of the organic danger which pulsed through The Bourne Identity, whereas sequences such as the chase between David and Griffin (Jamie Bell) as they battle for control of a detonator show that Liman is perfectly capable of successfully orchestrating action with the aid of big budget special effects. All of the action set pieces (except the final confrontation, which is neither spectacular nor satisfying) are thrilling to watch, and prove that Liman is at his best whilst orchestrating mayhem and destruction.The visual effects are also satisfying, if not tremendous. The ""Jumping"" effect is handled efficiently, and there are several clever touches which are deprived from it (David teleports his high school bully into a bank vault before abandoning him there, David and Griffin avoid traffic in Tokyo by teleporting themselves along with their car etc). The locations are also impressive, ranging from New York to London, Tokyo, Egypt and Rome.As mentioned before, the cast acquits themselves admirably. Apart from Christensen, all of the other cast members seem to be making an effort. As Millie (the love interest), both AnnaSophia Robb and Rachel Bilson craft a charming, beautiful yet smart romantic interest. They makes the character their own, and we actually come to care about her. Meanwhile, Samuel L. Jackson makes a potentially boring villain menacing and deadly, and Max Thieriot lets us know, for all Christensen's laziness, that David is a human character. However, the real standout is Jamie Bell. Delving into his character and coming up with a great deal of complexity and sympathy, Bell also brings an anarchic charm to the proceedings. His scenes with David are involving and sometimes funny, (when asked what happened to one of the men hunting him and David, Griffin casually replies, ""He went swimming""). He is pure talent, and the makers of the film must have been half-asleep when they chose Christensen over Bell for the lead role.Overall, Jumper is a bit of a mess, due to an underdeveloped script and one huge dud of a lead character. But it is saved from being a total disaster by thrilling action, clever touches surrounding its main premise, a wide variety of locations and some spirited turns from its cast, most notably Jamie Bell and Rachel Bilson.",Jumper
159,k-dhesi,Jumper not the one to Amaze..........But the one to Entertain!,8,9 May 2009,"Firstly, let me explain why the score for the movie is so low. The hype before it came out made all the critics Jump up and down and had all of them excited and looking forward to a amazing stunning sci-fi action. But obviously that's wrong, the movie was not Amazing, but it was very entertaining very unique and different, a tightly made film. I also agree it could have been a lot better but you can't change that now, but saying all that it's still a very good movie. Here's why.It's a very different storyline, an a very interesting one at that, think about it Jumpers. Do you believe in them? The action fighting scenes were stunning and very cool, and what made it so cool was the special effects and visual effects of the movie. The movie again does not amaze but keeps you entertain for a good hour a two. It's simple. Jumper was Interesting,fun & cool. I guess you wouldn't find out until you watch. So take my advice and go and see it.",Jumper
160,Staymetal8390,"Visually awesome, story not so much",5,3 June 2008,"The effects these days in film is so extraordinary. There's no more animation, all CGI. In ""Jumper"", it relies on the effects, which are amazing on the big screen.Of course, Samuel L. Jackson is in it...(I personally think he's overrated. He's been in too much in such a short time) as the bad guy out to get the ""Jumpers"" that Hayden Christensen and Jamie Bell play. One of the main flaws was the relationship between Hayden and Rachel (I think that's her name). It didn't seem natural. This was a fun movie to see visually, but the horrible relationship ruined it however the effects covered it up. Nothing more than a decent rental or a one time in the theater.",Jumper
161,luke-346,Young teenage boys will love this movie!!,3,11 March 2008,"Jumper is a film that panders unashamedly and meretriciously to the adolescent male, it is a technique in film-making that can often be found in poor Hollywood action pictures. It is also an approach that has been employed in some of the director's (Doug Liman's) previous work (The Bourne Identity, Mr & Mrs Smith). Jumper follows a young man called David (Hayden Christenson) and the discovery of his power to jump to any given space on the planet instantly. Throughout the film, or rather after eight years of ""Jumping"", he discovers that he is not the only Jumper and that there are an elite group of people hunting him.In reaching out to it's largely pre-pubescent audience the film throws in the usual clichés, from a hot chick to stylish CGI and excessively edited action sequences. Audience members that pined for a change of identity after seeing Bourne (hoping that maybe they we're a really a 30 billion dollar investment) will probably find Jumper fraternally appealing, they will also relish the more outlandish aspects of the film.Annoyingly the opening scene makes the arrogant assumption that everyone watching is a ""chump"" (unless you're a Jumper) and then proceeds to show David zipping about his pad and jumping a matter of feet to open the fridge, reach the remote or even venture outdoors. This use of dialogue and the manner in which his apartment has been constructed (it contains a motorbike) will probably have every 13 year old boy drooling. The film even attempts to signal its appeal to this age group through the narrative as in a flashback scene David robs a bank and then explains away his wrong doing by stating ""I was 15, what would you have done?"" To further this notion, the link the film tries to make with history being littered with examples of Jumpers being pilloried and murdered by notorious sects and groups over the centuries, is frivolous and childish.Gearing itself at such an audience is not a problem, if executed well. However, in Jumper too many drawn out scenes punctuate the pace of the film to such an extent that the attention span of the desired viewer is likely to be tested to its limit. Some people will enjoy the film, providing you are able to switch off, become one dimensional, ignore the plot holes and buy into the characters. If this is not possible then you will find the film annoying, immature and an exercise in decadence.At its very height the film exhibits levels of action that might invite the viewer to lean closer to the screen or pause on their pop corn chewing. The main example being the Double-Decker bus that ploughs into the desert, but if you've seen the trailer – you've already witnessed the best bit. Jamie Bells presence was the highlight of the performances on show, and he is actor that should go on to do better things. Samuel L Jackson reverts to type and offers nothing new and Hayden Christenson must have a pretty face, because his acting here is wooden to say the least. The direction is mediocre given its premise although Bourne fans will notice the frantic camera-work, rapid editing and the slow arching tracking shots (from a distance). To finish, Jumper is a film that should not have been made as it would have been far better suited to a television show.",Jumper
162,mjhalta,"Superhero Movie, ""Not""",5,20 May 2008,"The action and special effects are quite good but beyond that the movie falls far short of it's potential. This is not a superhero movie folks, the so called good guy is not really good he just gets more lines than the so called bad guy. I don't really understand the purpose in making this movie, it accomplishes nothing, it doesn't even drum up enough interest in audiences for a sequel. I too wondered at the message being sent by the television sequence where innocent lives could have been saved but our so called hero ignored his chance to do good. Instead he puts IOU's in bank vaults that he's cleaned out. Reminds me of Dumb and Dumber but at least that was funny, and I have no doubt that they would have put the money back if they had it. The potential here was incredible to make a movie that was memorable and compelling, but it was not to be. Movies about people with superpowers are supposed to be about the eternal struggle between good and evil, good guys with superpowers battling bad guys with superpowers, that's why Marvel has been so successful for all those decades. Why screw around with that formula! These guys decided to do just that and what do we have to show for it, a mediocre movie. Nuff said!!!",Jumper

I kept getting the feeling he was auditioning for some ultra-sensitive date movie instead of playing the part he was given.

Why do people keep making movies where the main character continuously tries to hide a gigantic secret beyond the point where any normal person would. Slight Spoiler- Immediately upon becoming discovered for what he really is he immediately goes back to the girl he hasn't stopped thinking about for the past 8 years. why would you leave the place where someone tracked you to and attacked you, and go directly back to that which you apparently love the most?

Anyone who's read much SF (especially THE STARS MY DESTINATION by Alfred Bester), or played Second Life, will be familiar with the concept. This might explain why so little is ever explained in the film. The main character, played by Hayden Christensen is a ""Jumper"", or someone who has this as a natural ability.He uses it in a way that most teenagers might - he steels things. There are complications, in the form of a group called paladins, who hunter and kill jumpers. But you can deduce most of this from the trailer. There's little more to the plot, other than some love interest.Bottom line is that this is a ""B"" movie - you can't really take it seriously. Just as well as there's very little depth in any of the acting in this film - Hayden Christensen is even more wooden than when he plays Anakin!

I could put up with him in the Star Wars films, because there was enough in the rest of the movies to be entertaining. But this is not the case here. bad actor in a bad movie. Samuel L. Jackson has given a couple of less than stellar performances over the years but this is probably his worst effort to date. Jar Jar Binks would have been more interesting.

Then he meets Samuel L. Jackson who is hunting ""Jumpers"" because they are ""abominations"". And supposedly this ""war"" has been going on for thousands of years. And in all that time it's all been kept so secret that nobody ever noticed anything. And they apparently control governments enough that they can do whatever they want while hunting jumpers.What a load of crap! I could understand rival jumper clans or some such thing but this premise is just plain stupid.I might have missed some salient plot points because I spent a lot of time fast-forwarding.

169,cathie454,Sure to be a sequel,7,17 February 2008,"I heard some of the audience commenting, as we left the theatre last night, that there wasn't enough story to it, not enough background to the story. I think this was done on purpose, so that the sequel(s) can fill in the gaps. This was a very well done movie, with great special effects. The car-rocketing-through-traffic-scene was, IMO, the best of the special-effects scenes. There was humor along with an interesting story line. Rachel Bilson (who I'd never seen before) was very good as Millie, having to deal with the disbelief of learning that David (Hayden Christensen) is capable of teleportation, and all that means for their relationship (past and present). Christensen was great in this, proving that when you get him away from George Lucas' less-than-stellar directing, he's a fine actor. He'd proved that in ""Life as a House"" and ""Shattered Glass"", but IMO, Episode III of Star Wars almost ruined his career. Jamie Bell was fantastic; I hope that he shows up in the sequel, having managed to escape David's trap. The one thing that truly bothered me in this movie was Roland's (Sam Jackson) hair-- it looked so ridiculous-- what was the point of the color? Why not a realistic gray? And the wig was poorly done-- you could see the wig line at the neckline in the back. The color and the way it made him look took away from his character; I was aware of how he looked all the time. I do think that, in the sequel, we'll hear more about his lunatic organization. And I'm hoping that Diane Lane has a bigger part; the brevity of her story line is one of the reasons I'm convinced there will be at least one sequel. And of course, the biggest selling point of the movie is the teleportation-- who wouldn't want that ability? The movie made a point of that, emphasizing the fantasies we all have about what we'd do if we could Jump.",Jumper

Does that mean the devil made jumpers? Um ... riiiight.The plot should have stayed closer to the book, and not brought on this religious stuff and made the film more vapid with that plot. Outside of the stupidity of the plot, of course, I wish I was born a jumper, just like people wish they were born to be vampires (have no idea why). Why films have to have fight scenes to make them interesting. A plot where a jumper can save the world would be more realistic. Everyone knows it needs some saving. :)",Jumper

I was always a fan of teleportation and so far this is the only movie to make it its running theme. I'll admit that Hayden Christensen is very nice to look at but not the best of actors around to hold this type of movie. I wanted to like the character David Rice but found myself not caring for him at all. His selfish actions were horrible (robbing banks, not using his ability to save drowning victims). He is no hero and I'm not sure if the point was to make him un-likable. I enjoyed the scenes with Griffin and agree with many here who say he stole the screen every time he appeared. My favorite was the fight with Roland and that highly mentioned car racing scene in Hong Kong. This is the first time seeing Sam L. Jackson in a flat out villainous role. He does it well. I won't be watching it again for the faulty plot but so far it's the most interesting movie in the theater.",Jumper

In real life, I don't think that would be all that interesting of an endeavour.The main character finds a lot of time to teleport and to rob banks, yet he really has no need for a lot of money because he can teleport anywhere he wants and get anything he needs at pretty much any time he feels like it.He ignores news reports of people stranded in storms and needing help - when he could do that in between commercials on the news report!The ending of the movie is especially disappointing because basically nothing happens and its over...Sorry to say this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time, and it really had no conscience or soul to it at all.",Jumper
178,james.p.taylor,Hayden is the weakest link.,7,18 February 2008,"This is a film about a boy who discovers, after an accident, that he can transport himself anywhere as long as he has some idea about the place he wants to land. After running away from home (on a bus mind) he breaks into a bank and after stealing piles of money sets himself up with a new life in New York (and just about everywhere else in the world). He then comes to discover that everything isn't as he thought it was and there's a war going on between the Jumpers and a group of religious fanatics called the Paladins.Hayden Christensen takes the lead as David Rice. His arch enemy Roland is played by Samuel L. Jackson. Here's the thing with that casting; Jackson has a tonne of personality where Christensen has almost zero. He spends the short run time of this film delivering lines in a monotone, a pained look on his face that's probably supposed to be emotion. When they're on screen together Jackson blows Hayden out of the water.Then throw in a love interest for David Rice, the girl he fancied so much at school before he scrams. Millie (Rachel Bilson) is a good looking girl, but there's also no chemistry between her and her leading man. When Rice just turns up in her life she decides to go away to Italy with him after a conversation lasting all of about twenty minutes. We don't even see her go home to pack and pick up her passport.So, the two most interesting characters are the bad guy (Jackson) and the Jumper sidekick Griffin (Jamie Bell). Bell does a great job with the action and his slightly world weary view of things is a nice counterpoint to Rice's naive view.The action is well choreographed and directed. The effects are top notch and the locations are brilliant. It's a shame that it all doesn't hang together just when it needs it. I'm sure they'll iron out the problems for the undoubted sequel.",Jumper

But he is not aloneYou'll love Jumper if: You love a relatively good superhero movie with great special effects or a nice ""chase"" flick. I don't like US comics and most of the movies based in them, however I liked this one. It starts good and a bit more ""realistic"" than most similar movies. By realistic I mean various things the way the boy realizes his powers, the things he does afterwards, or the way people react when watching him teleport are some of the things that pop into my mind not to mention that NO ONE is wearing latex, capes or red underwear over his pants!!! Finally it is a fast paced chase movie and has very good special effects without being ""too much"". I particularly loved the way the teleporting affects its surroundings.You'll hate Jumper if: You expected something better, both in terms of plot, acting and overall execution. The movie looks as a demo for something quite bigger and not a complete product. There are many questions that will be left unanswered and Jumper is a movie that begs for more details. Some mystery is OK with me but I finished watching Jumper and all I knew was ""There are some Jumpers and some people want to kill them"", aaaaaand that's it. The movie is generally a bad guys chasing the good guys kind of action flick and nothing more. There is no real character development and interaction, not to mention the inevitable US superhero movie clichés, (the typical lovey dovey hero stuff). Finally the acting the main actor is pretty dry, but at least not annoying, the girl is just another ""pretty"" chick and Samuel L. Jackson plays ""himself"" for the thousandth time!!! The only thing that saved the movie was Jamie Bell who not only was great, but also portrayed a more realistic and likable characterFINAL VERDICT: Superhero Flick With Lost Potential (5.3/10)[+] Good superhero movie without heroes. Great SFX.[-] Could be much better. Zero plot\character development. Dull actingAlso Check: Iron Man (2008) – The Dark Knight (2008) – The Matrix (1999) – X-Men (2000)P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say ""I like\don't like this movie"" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...",Jumper

182,supramaxx,Jumper Movie Review by Supra,7,3 July 2008,"JUMPER Movie ReviewI saw Jumper the night it debuted, I have to say, I saw the previews and thought it was going to be a hip CGI infested action fest, with little story, well it was action infested but the storyline and character development was actually pretty decent. Here goes the reviewThe Good: The strongest qualities of the film was the international imagery and settings used throughout the film, it made me really want to be a ""Jumper"" as well. There are awesome shots of Rome, Egypt, New York, Tokyo, London and even Ann Arbor, Michigan. Hayden Christiansen is a remarkable young actor as evidenced in the Star Wars movie, and Sam Jackson well he is the same bad ass he always is. The contrasting ""good guy"" characters are well done, the bad guy characters led by Sam Jackson, are well done as well. The action sequences were amazing, especially transportation of moving cars. The ubiquitous love story that doesn't really need to be there is also present. But in this case is needed if they ever want to make a sequel.The Bad: Don't expect the best storyline, but it was actually pretty good considering its a sci-fi action movie. One aspect of the storyline was very confusing and I found that it detracted from my enjoyment of the movie, but I am not going to reveal it here. People who don't like flashy hip action films should avoid.The Ugly: An angry white haired Sam Jackson torturing the poor protagonist with a million volt whip and taser.Overall: A very entertaining sci-fi action flick, don't know if I would buy it, but the action sequences are amazing and unique as well as the settings and scenery, really makes u want to be a jumper without the consequences of being pursued by the Paladins!Supra Score: 7.5/10",Jumper
183,Rosettes,"Someone's ideal, unrealistic life that was filmed",2,4 December 2009,"Well, a few things ...... none of them particularly favorable to the movie.First of all, if one understands the concept of 'tween (Dragon riders of Pern), then they under stand the workings of this film. With that, a lot of the excitement of this movie quickly vanishes.Secondly, one is struck with the image of Reeve and Kidder in flight of the first two Superman movies.......and once that image is there, it is not only very hard to shake but it also predicts scenes to come. Curiously, though, I wasn't struck with the image of Piper and Leo from Charmed even though there is something of a (another) direct story copy from there, too! These two items take a lot out of the movie because one is very quickly left with the feeling that they've seen it all before.Third, the greed, selfishness, and lack of love of the characters really doesn't say much for the young generation. If one sits back and thinks about it for a moment, it is possible to see something of a story of a kid in the candy store.....or someone doing their life on a holodeck.When one realizes that they are watching someone who steals the money of other people, defaces ancient wonders for their own pleasure, leaves people in potential death traps ............. they are seeing a spoiled miserable brat. They may not be rooting for the 'hero' but for the villain to put him out of their misery.Fourth, it's a bureaucratic, forensic, and greedy world, but these conditions have been conveniently left out so the 'hero' can have his fun.....and believability suffers because of it. It is very hard to move in the normal world without ID. The 'hero' removed himself from the bureaucratic world but still manages to exist it it, have the necessary papers. He has no problem with cash ..... and the minor people around him accept that without question, without suspicion. It may be true that money can buy anything, but have too much of it somewhere at one time and others will want it, will want to steal it. The 'hero' really isn't smart enough to realize this, to take defensive measures to hide his wealth.As one goes through the movie, they expect for these things to show up, such as using the wrong currency in a country, but they never do. It especially stings when the villains do have ID, when the movie ""states"" that it is a bureaucratic world.Now, one might say that he ""Jumped"" and solved any such problem, but that produces at least two serious backlashes. First of all, it creates a plot hole by contradicting a major principle of the movie. Secondly, to do so, one is left with the feeling ""just making it up as they go along"".Which is what this movie will basically be remembered as. A near perfect fantasy of someone who made it up as they went along.Near perfect since we do have a villain but here again, how it is done resembles so many things before, such as ""Highlander"" or The Key concept in ""Buffy"". Further, the villains are professional and dangerous only when the story needs them to be but rather incompetent otherwise, such as having vital data at one point and then conveniently forgetting about it at another.It's an okay movie for an empty evening for someone who has never seen it, never heard of it. On that, it may even be worth its 99 cents. Its flaws should not stop someone from getting thru its short length but after wards, one is struck with its emptiness.",Jumper

The jump effects were amazing and the effect sounds that follow it were incredible. The special effects were outstanding and are probably the best thing in the movie. The little comedy scenes were pretty funny too. Jumper doesn't have non-action scenes, but the normal action that Jumper had were very exciting.A lot of fans said the acting was crappy, but I thought it was good. The best performance in the movie was by Jamie Bell. He was just amazing as Griffin.After the film was over, there was one question that didn't have an answer. Why David (Hayden Christensen) and Griffin?s parents are are paladins and they aren't? Or they are just supposed to be born with that religion. The scene were David and Griffin are talking in a silver car kind of left me thinking that might be the answer to my question.Overall, Jumper was an average movie that was entertaining and enjoyable.

It had some great action scenes and was entertaining, but the end left me with questions, as well as the beginning. For example, I didn't really understand how he was able to teleport to the library in the first place. And what I got from the end was that Diane Lane, who plays his mother, was basically telling him that sooner or later she would be back with the others again trying to rid the world of all of its ""abominations,"" even though she just risked her life the entire time to save him. Who would want her as a mother? I also thought that some parts were really hard to believe, especially when David returns after years and blindly asks Millie to go away with him all the way to Rome. As if any sensible girl would comply. However, with Hayden Christensen's good looks it would be quite hard to resist. I did think that he and Rachel Bilson both gave descent performances. I don't care much for Samuel L. Jackson but he played an okay villain. However, I found some parts to be quite humorous. All in all, ""Jumper"" did have its moments. It would be pretty thrilling if we all possessed such a talent- to be able to teleport into different worlds in the blink of an eye.

You may think that, yes, David has done what is necessary to survive in a psychotically twisted society. Steal money from a bank to raise your status in society. Visit all the so called ""Must See"" tourist attractions around the world, but what about humanity. SAVE A LIFE. Is it that hard when you have these powers, not at all. I am only halfway through the film and so far I can see Doug's blatant attack on how most people in our pathetic system of status and survival would utilise these powers to make their own pointless life more commercially successful. Who cares about the life existing under the materialism we endure on a daily basis. What about the life that continues after our physical vehicle expires. This is the life we should cherish, not the life that People Magazine expects us to achieve, high flying, multi-millionaire status. BS. You need to express your life in the way that improves the lives of others that don't have what you take for granted.

I was excited about the plot very much. However, when I completely saw the movie. It had a big mistake which the seriously movie fan will not accept this movie and the acceptance of it will be in the bad way.I didn't have any problem with the cast. Samuel L. Jackson was very good in his villain role. He can prove everyone that he is one of the biggest Hollywood star because he could play in any role either leader role or villain role. Hayden Christensen looked very weak in his role due to he is not actually fighter, so it was very freak that the main leader actor was not the great fighter and usually be caught by the villain. Nevertheless, I had to against the role of Jamie Bell in the end of the movie, that was unreasonable. He should have some role in the end of the movie rather than get left behind and forget him. Not Only Bell but also Diane Lane's Mary Rice role too. She had the few obvious scene to participate.

193,ablebravo,Still Bourne,4,12 October 2010,"I meant my title as somewhat of a sarcastic pun. I've only seen one other piece of work which Doug Liman has done - specifically THE BOURNE IDENTITY. That wasn't too bad, story wise, and casting was well-done too. Now, when the trailers came out for JUMPER on TV, I thought to myself, ""Hey! They made one of my favorite books into a... awww HELL! Hayden Christensen is in it! Oh, well. It could have been good..."" Well, I finally decided to bite the bullet and rent it. I was right. HC was just as awful in JUMPER as he was in the Star Wars abortions I saw him in. That dude really cannot act. As a result, JUMPER was an even weaker film than the ham-handed directing, jarring editing, preposterously close closeup shots and overall poor handling made it. Even with all of that said, I didn't totally hate it. I mean, I didn't turn it off before it was over, but it certainly isn't a film I'll be renting again. I'll admit that it has been close to 10 years since I read the book so many of the plot details are fuzzy but I DO recall there not being some sort of modern day hi-tech Knights chasing the Jumpers around. That (to me, at least) was a poorly-designed plot tool to add jeopardy to the story.Besides Hayden's wooden non-acting, I was also less than impressed with poor Rachel Bilson's acting. I don't know if it was Liman's fault or not, but all of her actions (and REactions) were, at best, unconvincing and at worst, positively cringe-worthy. I haven't seen her in anything else so I don't know if she's as bad an actor as Hayden is or if it was just cruddy directing... No, now that I think a bit more on it, I blame Liman because I don't recall Samuel T Jackson ever disappointing me in any other role I've seen him play but his chops were pretty lame here. The over-used cliché, ""He was pretty much phoning in his part"" is applicable here but his stunts looked good. That idiotic hair color, though! Who came up with that? It sure didn't help me believe his role. Out of all of the primary roles, I think Jamie Bell carried his Griffin character best of all.Really, I guess what I liked most about the film was the location sequences. Jumping to places like Tokyo and Rome along with several other cities gave the film an almost James Bond-ish feel to it - well, not *really* but you know what I mean, I think... just a cosmopolitan, open feel to the work.Not nearly as terrible as, say, a Michael Bay film (TRANSFORMERS *LEAPS* to mind here) and not nearly as good as the (weak, but enjoyable) Indiana Jones Crystal Skull outing, JUMPER is a film which I don't totally regret having spent a couple of bucks rental and 90-odd minutes on but I guarantee I would have been a lot more upset had I opened my wallet at the theater for this one.I give it 44/100.",Jumper

Really??"" I felt the movie had great potential, especially with Samuel L. Jackson in the villain role. And with Diane Lane on board, how could this movie miss the mark? Unfortunately, Jackson's character Roland (that's the best name they could come up with?) is pretty static. There's no depth to him. There's no reason why he hates jumpers. He just hates them. And wants to kill them. The character isn't sufficiently fleshed out, except for a flash-in-the-pan comment about some sort of religious zealotry, so essentially what you have is a soulless Samuel L. Jackson as a bounty hunter. And Diane Lane's role pretty much isn't more than a glorified walk-on, as she gets little more than five minutes of actual screen time.And I just couldn't get involved with the characters. Our hero/anti-hero, as portrayed by Hayden Christenson, goes from being a lovable loser to a loathsome lothario within the first ten minutes of the movie. I found myself expecting him, as he watched the news reports about drowning people to teleport and help those people. Instead, he goes back to counting the money he has stolen. Basically, any love I had for him from before was squandered.And Rachel Bilson's Millie is pretty much a braindead set piece, there for Hayden to have sex with and then develop some minor moralistic complex which requires him to save her. I can suspend my disbelief to a degree, but after Hayden's been thought to be dead for seven years, he just walks up to her in a bar, and the only question she's really concerned about is if he is or is not actually a banker. No ""hey where've ya been for the past six years?"" No ""hey, wow, thought you drowned!"" Not to mention he gets her goodies after less than 24 hours.) I know this movie is set up for a sequel, since the finale managed not to tie up any of the loose ends at all, up to and including the well-being of the other jumper.

He quickly learns how to harness his power and control it, and then before long he as robbed a bank and is on his way to the ""good life"". Fast-forward till he is older, he now has a dream apartment in New York and spends his days trotting the globebreakfast in Paris, surfing in Fiji, lunch on top of the Sphinx, one night stand in London, etc.you get the picture.He returns home wanting to find his high school crush, Millie (played by Rachel Bilson). He finds her working at the local bar and obviously wants to share his dream-existence with her. There lies a big problem as she quickly suspects something, and before he has time to explain everything to her his ""perfect"" existence is suddenly threatened. It is threatened by a detective Roland (played by Samuel L. Jackson) who is investing the first bank robbery, and slowly starts tracking David. Roland knows about these ""jumpers"", and tracks them down to kill them reminding each one repeatedly ""Only God should have the power."" As he gets closer to David and his loved ones, the film accelerates into a blinding pace of ""jumping"" action until the end which neatly setup a new franchise.Because of its' poor script, direction, and editing, the special effects and settings are what make this film good. Yes we have seen other superheroes teleport, but I do not remember ever seeing Night-crawler lounging in a beach chair on top of the Sphinx's head or riding thirty-foot waves in Fiji. Watching him do everything you could ever want with this new power is what makes it entertaining, as you anticipate the next destination you will be whisked off to.Hayden Christensen proves he really can act after, and he gives a solid performance, although Jamie Bell (playing another jumper) steals any and all scenes he appears in with his intense, energetic, comic-relief presence. Diane Lane's cameo is a pleasant surprise, and Rachel Bilson's performance as the girlfriend is sincere.My main complaint was the ending, which is so happily clique and a blatant setup for a sequel it leaves you with the feeling ""that's it?"" I still liked it. Overall this is a pure popcorn, eye-candy thriller that is entertaining enough if you do not try to think about it to hard, and can hold you over till this Summer's ""real"" blockbusters!",Jumper
196,vlaukin,It's a shallow twist on a great book...,7,17 March 2008,"I did enjoy this movie and it was worth the night out to the Theater. A lot of the negative comments are justified, which I will comment on later. But for an entertaining movie that is a bit different than the norm, I would say it delivers. The teleport theme was handled very well and I especially liked the way the ""Rift"" could be tracked for a short period of time after a jump. I also liked all the characters in the film, so the casting was great for me anyways.Here are a few negatives I found in the film:-the tight in close action scenes are way to hard to follow, like ""Batman Begins"", which was also almost ruined with poorly done tight fighting action scenes. After the success of movies like ""Matrix"", you would think this would be easy to get right...Hopefully next time around. -I think the ""Roland"" character was to much and definitely over the top. Who gave this guy the free ticket to slaughter ? Not the actors fault by any means.There are several major points that are done different, compared to the book. I think the twist with Davie's mom will work and it could keep the franchise alive, if not in the theaters, maybe on prime time.I'm not sure why the big shift with Davie's dad cause in the book I felt it was done really well and it sets up the Jumper's character very well unlike the movie depiction. In the book, you could feel his (dad's) torment. In the book, Davie wasn't selfish. His part in the high jacking's was excellent and graphic and to have omitted this in place of a non responsible individual with a special gift and not use it to help others...Thats just cold and was probably the biggest injustice to the book. I'm not sure about this whole ""Paladin"" theme as it makes the movie seem to unreal. Where as the whole government agency thing done in the book was very well done and believable. It was a journey for Davie to find an ally and eventually he did just that. The movie has these jumpers fleeing from crazed assassins with some high tech, worm whole creating tech and it just takes the movie to just beyond believable.Ultimately, this could have been better, but it also has cast some new possibilities into future developments. I hope this isn't the last we see of the Jumper(s) !!!",Jumper
197,pioneerlythere37,"Unoriginal, But Still An Entertaining Action Flick.",8,18 September 2015,"Hayden Christensen will never be as good as he was in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. Many critics and even viewers disagree with me, saying that in the final installment of the Star Wars saga he mistook an evil, meaningful performance for ""pouty faces and mumbled lines"". Or something like that. I must agree that he had an interesting selection of evil faces; they looked like evil was totally warping his face into a wide-eyed, hate-filled glare. I just think that it worked for him.In Jumper, though, I would fully understand--and possibly agree with--anyone maligning his performance. It wasn't the worst acting; maybe it was just the fact that he was cast for the role, considering that his interesting character and voice inflection definitely doesn't fit with most roles that can be provided for him. Jumper was a good action movie, with good directing, cinematography, and editing. The jumping was handled well, and the fight scenes likewise provided exciting entertainment. Considering the storyline, though, I believe that the movie had a lot more potential, and could easily have been a great movie. But the writing is unoriginal, as is the dialogue, and the characterization could have been done much better. Also, it was completely unnecessary to bring along a white-haired Mace Windu, with a reconstructed lightsaber, and then make him into some sort of ""religious nutjob"" serial killer, trying to kill off all of the Jumpers because, ""Only God should have this power."" I've heard of men like this in jokes, not movies.The movie starts with teenage David Rice, discovering that he can jump (teleport) through time and space to different locations...simple enough. He keeps jumping to the Ann Arbor Library (Did it have to be Ann Arbor, Mr. Goyer?) on accident, and after his first jump, of course he wants to try it again. Most people probably would have needed a manual, like ""Teleporting 101"", but to make the movie work, he just practices it and...Voila! He finally gets it down--sort of. Just like every superhero, he decides to keep his talents a secret...but not for very heroic reasons. For whatever reasons, he figures his skills would be best put to use robbing a bank. ""Hey, I was a kid. What would you have done?"" I dunno, but I definitely wouldn't have robbed a bank. Oh well, we're all raised differently.Fast forward a few years, David's all grown up, and he's living in a mansion, with a closet full of dough. Maybe it's not a mansion, but it's quite a house, that's for sure. I forgot to mention, ever since his first jump, everyone has thought he was dead...how could you be living in a mansion if everyone thinks you're dead? He gets by somehow, until Mace Windu shows up, no longer a Jedi; instead he's a Paladin. It's quite a shock to David, after convincing himself after all these years that he's safe, to have someone invade his house and try to kill him. So he goes on the run, meets up with his childhood crush, and offers to take her on a vacation to Rome. She asks what job he has. ""I'm a banker."" L. O. L. So they take off for Rome. Very smart, David, while you're being chased by evil villains--what other kinds of villains are there?--why don't you bring along your clueless girlfriend. Forgive my sarcasm; turns out bringing his girlfriend along wasn't a very good idea, considering he once again gets attacked (Surprise, Surprise!) in the Coliseum, meets another, more experienced Jumper, and follows his ""jump scar"" to his lair. The other jumper turns out to be someone named Griffin, a smart-alek, rather unattractive person played by Jamie Bell, who has been jumping and living alone longer than even David has. David Rice follows him around everywhere, asking questions and irritating him, but perhaps he's not as irritated as he should be. ""Paladins kill Jumpers. I kill Paladins. Class dismissed,"" says Griffin. The chemistry between the two continues to be interesting and humorous.Despite the ridiculousness of the movie, Jumper still manages to be an entertaining, if disappointing, action film, and although Hayden Christensen has lost the touch he had in 2003, he's still a good actor. David S. Goyer will never again create a film as good as the Batman trilogy, which he and Christopher Nolan collaborated on together, but this movie proves that he still has his writing touch. The movie keeps you excited and entertained throughout, providing good imagery and clever dialogue and characterization.My Official Score: 84/100",Jumper
198,buny101,I watched it for free and still feel cheated...,1,19 January 2009,"When the movie started, I liked the main character, Rice. I thought Hayden was doing a pretty good job acting. Not being a Hayden fan, and seeing this awhile after it was released, I did not realize right away that young Rice was not Hayden, but an actual actor. When Hayden did show up, the movie went downhill (quick). Hayden looks just like James Franco sans the acting talent (in my opinion). Of course, because of the horrible writing, this movie was going downhill quick no matter who the actor was. One of the first scenes has the TV playing in the background, and the reporter is saying, ""These poor people, nothing but a miracle can save them."" Does Rice use his teleporting power to pop over there and save them? Nope. Okay, we have established that Rice has no empathy. Okay. So...why should we care about what happens to him? As you probably know, the story is about a Jumpers (teleporters) and their main enemy, the Paladins. The Paladins are trying to kill the teleporters for no other reason than the fact that they can teleport. Samuel Jackson, the head Paladin, states that all Jumpers go bad. Hmm. If Rice had been saving people, maybe it would have proved he was good? Maybe Samuel was right. Okay, rooting for the paladins. Rice abandons his father, not caring about the pain he is putting him through. He misses his mother, who abandoned him when he was five. Could he not see the parallel? No. Self centered ego. Narcissistic. Just like most psychopaths. And we are to root for him? We follow Rice through a few fun filled location shot adventures, he teams up with another Jumper (sort of). Together, they take on the Paladins. Won't bother explaining anymore of this junk. It would be too painful to think about. But, you know, I can't help but think it would have been a better movie if Rice was a ""Good Jumper"", fighting against ""Bad Jumpers"", and trying to avoid the Paladins. I thought during the fight with the other Jumper (Griffin, played by Jamie Bell, to me the only bright spot of the film), I thought that Rice was going to ""jump"" back behind himself, Griffin would follow through the wormhole, and be stuck in a loop...would have been interesting...but that is just my opinion... Anyway, didn't even spend money to watch it. And still thought that the director should send me $5-8 dollars for wasting my time...",Jumper
199,Vanyel,A good pilot...,6,18 February 2008,"Except for the stellar chase sequence, this movie is just a teaser for what could be a really good series. None of the real issues this capability bring up are given more than the briefest of attention. If Journeyman's really been canceled, give *them* charge of this, and something real might come of it. As for the movie, go at economy hour or wait to rent it. Oh good grief, apparently IMDb's been taken over by modern media which thinks you have to be verbose to get your point across. OK, Jamie Bell got short shrift here, he's very good, but only gets limited time to show it in this movie. People seem to like to ding Hayden Christensen, but he and his character are a decent match, though as lazy as they make him out to be in the movie, he'd be a blimp in no time.",Jumper
200,brendon-kenny,Jumper - as many plot holes as there are wormholes...,4,19 May 2008,"This Review was originally written for South Yorkshire Newspapers and featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds and York - It doesn't take much of a leap of faith to see the potential in a special effects laden blockbuster starring former Jedi's Hayden Christensen and Samuel L. Jackson does it? Enter Jumper, the latest from director Doug Liman who has already proved his action credentials with past hits the Bourne Identity (2002) and Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). Like his previous efforts, Jumper's premise is a simple one; after accidentally falling into a frozen river, David Rice (Christensen) discovers that he can teleport by force of will. If you've seen Nightcrawler's assassination attempt in the opening scenes of X-men2 (2003), you'll already have a good idea of what Jumper is all about. Being able to teleport to any location that he can visualise, Rice soon casts aside his family, friends, and morals, and helps himself to sacks of loot from the federal bank before visiting the wonders of the world and living a playboy lifestyle.All well and good you may think  until the silver haired 'Paladin', Roland (Jackson) turns up to spoil the fun. He may not be wielding a light saber this time round, but Samuel L. Jackson's villain of the piece means business, he's tooled up and exhibits the usual badass persona for which the actor is so well renowned. Stating that 'only God should have that kind of power' may stop short of the religious zeal (and wit) that he had as Jules in Pulp Fiction, but it goes some way to explaining his motives for capturing and killing Jumpers. Apparently, Paladins have been hunting down Jumpers for centuries, but the history isn't elaborated on any more than that. Unfortunately, this is typical of many aspects of the film, the plot; back story and character development aren't fleshed out or given any kind of depth, leaving the actors with little to work with.Hayden Christensen has yet to prove himself as a strong lead in a movie. He has shown time and time again that he can do anger and intensity, his speciality is sulky, spoilt teenagers, but his range of emotions don't seem to extend beyond that. In Jumper it's difficult to empathise with his character as he lazes in front of the television watching news footage of people trapped in floods, knowing that he can rescue them with little or no risk to himself, yet he chooses to eat breakfast on the head of the sphinx or woo easy English girls in the shadow of Big Ben instead. To justify his selfish attitude the audience is subjected to the tried and tested 'from a broken home/bullied in school' formula, traditionally used as a pre-cursor to super-heroic ambitions, here it's just an excuse for Rice's smug apathy. Similarly his moral ambiguity is supposedly vindicated with the throwaway comment 'I was young, what would you do?' as an explanation for his bank robbing exploits, and a series of I.O.U. notes - yet he expresses no real sign of regret.Any hopes of Rice becoming more endearing with the introduction of his love interest Millie, (played by the O.C.'s Rachel Bilson) are also quickly dashed. Quite possibly the most unconvincing romance in film history ensues when Rice sweeps his former teenage crush off to Rome, and refuses to engage in any kind of conversation - let alone explain his whereabouts for the preceding eight years! Bilson works hard in her under-written role, but being saddled with a wafer-thin script and a character that jumps into bed with a bloke just because he takes her to Rome means that the odds were always stacked against her. Fortunately Jamie Bell injects some much needed charisma as experienced fellow Jumper, Griffin. Even during his limited screen time he manages to invoke more personality than Christensen's lead builds through the duration of the movie, and some much needed comic relief to boot. Without spoiling too much, one of the stand out scenes in the film involve Griffin's novel combination of Joy-riding and Jumping (Jump-riding?) in a sparkling new Mercedes Benz.The film is based on a novel by Steven Gould, the screenplay adapted by David Goyer, who's generally regarded as the Hollywood go-to for comic book adaptations. His record is somewhat hit and miss, with Ghost Rider (2007), Batman Begins (2005) and the Blade trilogy on his CV. However, it's difficult to pin the deficiencies in the Jumper story on Goyer alone, especially as reports suggest that the studio were unhappy with his original screenplay, drafting in additional writers to ramp up the action. It's impossible to imagine what the film was like before this, as it consists of little else other than action - perhaps Goyer's original actually included some character development...Doug Liman compensates for the one dimensional characters and plot by focusing us on visual spectacle instead. The breakneck pace, special effects and action packed Jumper vs. Paladin battle scenes mean that if you disengage your brain you can be swept along for the brief running time. Jumper has a lot of potential; it's a strong concept but a real shame that there are as many plot holes as there are wormholes in the movie. Like many casualties of Hollywood it's pretty to look at, and there's fun to be had for a while but ultimately it's shallow and unsatisfying.",Jumper
201,TwoCrude,Don't waste your money,3,20 February 2008,"Too often, the special effects are the star of some movies. That is definitely the case here. The script seems as if a 14 year old wrote it on a weekend caffeine bender. Compared to this, Brett Ratner's X-Men film is Citizen Kane.Spoilers follow: The mother of the protagonist is portrayed in a ridiculous way. It's beneath Diane Lane. Truth be told, the role is beneath any of the silicon enhanced bimbos from ""Rock of Love"".The movie's concept is worthy of a big budget and a name screenwriter. With a better script, this could have been very good sci fi. It's too bad the studio pushed this tripe at us. It's no better than ""Ultraviolet"", ""Silent Hill"" or ""Resident Evil"". Only a true hack like Paul W S Anderson could have done worse.",Jumper

203,nsterjo,"No Bourne, no Matrix, but still a good movie!",7,15 February 2008,"I went to see this movie having lowered my expectations after reading so many bad reviews around. I gotta say they don't really do justice to it. Sure, it's not a big movie, it's not huge, great; it could have been bigger, better, deeper and more meaningful, but it was a good movie nonetheless.Following the story wasn't difficult, it was a simple one without many complications, which is probably where most ""critics"" were disappointed, but you have to keep in mind that is is usually the case with superhero movies. It just comes with the genre. Also, it wasn't difficult to realize that this is just the first of e very possible trilogy. I mean, (spoilers here) the fact that Roland wasn't killed, and the relationship with mom basically just started is a dead give-away. In this light, I believe the story will make more sense and will be more complete after watching the sequel and probably the threquel.The script wasn't great but not bad either. I wasn't left with a bad taste at any time during the movie. The acting was good too, no matter what people keep saying. Just when did everyone become an expert on acting I wonder? It's so easy to blame the guy hated by the critics; it makes us feel like we know what we're talking about. I don't like Christensen either, but while watching very attentively his acting, I failed to see anything wrong with it or out of place. Sure he's not the most warm and expressive person, but that doesn't diminish his acting. Another actor would have probably brought a different feel to the role, but I feel he was good enough. So was Bilson. No need to comment on Jackson, but the real star of the movie, it is indeed Bell. He was simply awesome and I'm sure he is a star on the rise.To conclude, would I go to see this movie again or the sequel? That's a definite YES.",Jumper
204,Tippy_Cup,Wow this movie was bad.,1,3 July 2008,"I got this out on DVD today, hoping for some mind numbingly bad (but in that (sometimes) enjoyable way)) movie that'd have some good action sequences in it, along with all the usual visually impressive sweeping shots and overblown CGI effects.So going into not expecting anything GREAT. But also not in the negative mindset of 'Oh this movie is going to suckkkk'. It'd have to be pretty damn bad to make me hate it.It was definitely that bad.From the unrealistic reactions people had to certain situations. Rachel Bilsons' character just going 'oh hi, so was that why you where watching me for 45 minutes' or whatever she said. When her friend who went missing under strange circumstances, comes back to town wearing expensive designer clothes, someone who most people thought had died. Even though I thought her reaction from when she first saw him jump in her apartment was well done.To the part when the protagonist is a kid at the start, and he gets back home. Many people saw him fall into the ice, his friend who grows up to be Bilson, is crying in bed, people think he died, but no one went to tell his dad?? To the shoe string plot. Pretty much, guy realises he has powers, uses powers for personal gain, a guy from (an unexplained or elaborated upon) Govt. Agency chase him around the place. Guy goes back to home town, to get girl. That's pretty much all.The development with the other jumper could've been done so much better. The only good bit was the mention of 'marvel team ups'.Pretty much the plot went nowhere...A lot of people have been saying it's good because it shows what you'd do if you really had those powers. Use it only for personal gain, and that you wouldn't help people. The scene where he's watching the news report of the flood, kind of thinks about saving the people on top of the floating bus, then quickly decides not to. Isn't particularly original, think about most comic type villains, and even how many heroes have used their powers for gain. Even in something like Groundhog Day off the top of my head the protagonist uses his (not really) 'powers' for personal gain.God I suck at writing reviews on here(ramble ramble).

206,svetlastoyanova,What did you expect !?!,6,17 June 2008,"This movie is a blockbuster by the book. A good looking guy, a very good looking girl, super cool teleporting ability and bad guy Samuel L Jackson kicking some jumpers ass. I have to admit that Hayden Christensen is not one of the best actors there is, and his acting flexibility could be compared only with wood. But then all the fancy locations he teleports himself to and the lavish life he lives makes his character quite likable (and enviable for that matter).The scene where he just flips the channel over, totally indifferent at the sight of the drowning people apparently has stirred some people's conscience. Let's be realists. Put yourself in his position what would you do? Leave your perfect luxurious high life and go save people. I don't think so...Besides, he is not the only one, are there any other Jumpers saving peoples lives? Well...NO, because they are too busy trying to save their own ones from the Paladins. Who kill Jumpers, as we find out, but (a major plot hole) the fact that ""only God can be all places at all times"" is not that good a reason to go around slaughtering them people. Hopefully the sequel will shed some light on that.Then, there is Jamie Bell, the best performance in the movie. Although some of his actions weren't quite reasonable, his character has a personality and credibility to it. The scene with the Mercedes-unbelievable, yet what was the point of it. Next to that Rachel Bilson's little high school sweetheart looked like a poorer version of the O.C's Summer. High morals, deep love, I don't want to know; no; I want to know... Sounds familiar?

208,ForCenturies,"Enjoyable sci-fi fluff, but could have been so much more.",7,22 February 2008,"THERE IS ONLY ONE SPOILER IN THIS REVIEW AND I DEEM IT VERY MILD.The main problem with this film is there are so many ends not tied up. I'll say that first and foremost. I will not say what they are as just about all of them are relevant to the plot, and are apart of the end.Hayden Christensen was miscast in this, but I think he has improved from Star Wars, however, he's still a wooden actor. He cannot handle emotional scenes well. I will go on to say, and anyone may quote me on this as I truly believe in it: Hayden and Rachel (Millie) had more chemistry than Hayden and Natalie Portman in Star Wars. Hayden is still miscast in this however he has improved somewhat in his acting.Rachel Bilson is a breath of fresh air to the film scene, I am a huge fan of The O.C. and Rachel made her character believable and I really enjoyed watching her, and I think she actually tried to make her character have some chemistry with Hayden's character, i.e. she put more effort into her acting than Hayden did. I absolutely loved watching her and she's definitely one to keep an eye on, I think she's very talented. And she handles comedy well.However, that's another weakness of this film: all the jokes are either badly written, or poorly executed. As I said, Rachel is great with comedy (see The OC) however she said some jokes that were flat, same with Jamie Bell and his character Griffin, and I'm not saying the actors said them poorly, I believe they are just bad jokes.Jamie Bell is another breath of fresh air. He's not plastered all over film posters and city billboards like your Lindsay Lohans or whatever and he is a genuinely fine actor. Ever since King Kong he's really building himself up as a dramatic actor. Loved his character as well.Samuel L Jackson was bad-arse in this, complete bad-arse. However, you could tell he was wearing a wig throughout the film as right at the bottom of his hair on his neck, you could see his real hair. But that's okay, he still looked bad-arse. I also viewed this film similar to that of the witch trials hundreds of years ago. Jumpers are ""witches"" and the Paladin and Jackson's character are ""the church"". Roland also says just as he is about to kill a jumper that ""God should be the only one to be in all places at all times"". Even Griffin (Bell) says that they have been hunting jumpers since ""medieval times, the witch trials, all that, that WAS THEM!"" So I thought that was a strong point, and I mean no offence to anyone devoutly religious by saying this, that is just something I took from the film.Diane Lane and Annasophia Robb were surprises in the cast. Especially Lane, she's fantastic as usual. Robb was great as usual also but I felt she looked too young to be in high school, but then again, they do not say what grade she and David are in, so it's all good.The snow globe should have had a more prominent role in the film, and that's all I'll say about that (I see this sentence as a spoiler, hence the spoiler warning).The special effects are great in this, especially the ""jump scars"". However, the blue/green screen effects are very poor for a big-budget commercial film like this, they stick out like a sore thumb.This has potential for a sequel, and I would genuinely like to see a sequel, as long as the same team is back and they improve upon themselves and see where they went wrong, and Jumper 2 (or would it be ""Jumpers""?) could be a fantastic film.It is popcorn sci-fi fluff but go into this film to have a good time, nitpick it later. I enjoyed it immensely despite its many flaws. Seven out of ten (3.5/5).Calum Sanderson",Jumper

211,macduff50,unjustly maligned film,8,18 June 2008,"Not an epic for the ages, but a very good film, creatively put together and exciting to watch. Director Doug Liman does an excellent job of putting the audience in the same position as his young hero, that is, he knows he has an ability, but is completely ignorant of the larger context of that ability or power. The film shows his discovery of that context, and his coming to terms with it. A lot of the negativity of the reviews I've read really only highlight that the reviewers were not looking at the movie Liman made, but the movie they expected to see, and no film could survive such a comparison. The actors do well enough, given that their job is to basically react to things, and the real surprise here is that Jamie Bell is equally the star of the show along with Hayden Christensen. My advice for watching is simply to let the story unfold in front of you, let it take you along. Now for the SPOILER, which isn't about the film as such, but about the concept. The DVD extras contain several big hints that in future episodes of the Jumper franchise, jumpers will be revealed (under some circumstances; but those are undisclosed) to be able to jump time, that is, go back and forth in time. As well, several minutes of a pre-viz for a future film show a fight that takes jumpers into outer space looks stunning, and involves jumpers fighting each other. My guess is (another SPOILER) that some of the Paladins are themselves jumpers, that is, they are hiding in plain sight.

212,Paul-Corio,All flash but no thunder,6,17 February 2008,"**MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS** The premise of the story is that a teenage boy called David Rice (Christiansen) discovers he has the ability to teleport himself anywhere in the world at any time. He runs away to escape his abusive father (Rooker) and a hum drum average life in middle America and uses his power to 'borrow' large sums of money from bank vaults undetected, thus being able to afford a worry free and privileged life.Fast forward several years later and David begins to realise there is more going on than meets the eye when he finds himself confronted by Roland (Jackson), a Paladin who have been responsible for hunting and killing Jumpers in a war that has raged for hundreds of years.Caught up in the middle of this war are David's old high school crush Millie (Bilson), another Jumper called Griffin (Bell) and David's estranged mother Mary (Lane) Indeed, it looks good....slick and stylish with great visual effects, but that's sadly one of the few things that impressed me about this movie as it turns out to be all style and little substance.The pace of the film is slow to build as the threadbare plot is so transparent it doesn't allow for any kind of suspense and the story itself is laboured with no real character or timeline development. This means that by the time any real adrenalin kicks in and things start to happen, you're still none the wiser as to why everything is happening and to be honest I nearly got past caring.Although looking good and brooding all the way through the film (which i'm sure will be popular with teenage girls all around the world) Hayden Christiansen fails to really get under the skin of his character, staying sadly wooden and one dimensional in a part which is supposed to chart the course of a young man who starts off as a self absorbed, arrogant loner who realises there are things and people in the world worth risking his own life to protect. Likewise Samuel L Jackson has little to work with script wise and does his best to look menacing throughout, but that's about it.The same is true of Rachel Bilson who again struggles to find anything worthwhile and meaningful to say or do and ends up as little more than eye candy. The star of the show for me was Jamie Bell who as Griffin the other Jumper gets the lion's share of the best lines and dialogue, so much so that the screen is an empty place when he's not on it.The film ends raising more questions than it answers and many people will argue that the film has massive plot holes and is incomplete, however I suspect that that is entirely what it was designed for and speculate that Jumper 2 will be in cinemas before long to finish off the story, hopefully ending a lot more satisfactorily than the first.OK, so this movie was never going to be a serious contender for a truck load of Oscars or some visionary piece of epop making cinema that will influence generations to come......it simply is what it is peaking at just above average. Like so many recent Sci-Fi/Action adventures, Jumper has all the hall marks of a middle of the road movie that would surely entertained and killed a couple of hours, but never really packs to much of a punch to leave a lasting impression.",Jumper
213,mcgill_j,Well.. it's no Bourne Identity... or even Mr. and Mrs. Smith,6,10 June 2008,"I'd say... as far as movies go today.. I'd say.. a 6 or 7 is as high as I'd give it.. sadly Jumper falls flat in a lot of areas.. yeah its diverting.. Rachel Bilson is GORGEOUS.. and say what you will. but Hayden Christnsen isn't all that bad of an actor.. then again.. what kind of ""chops"" do you really need for a movie like this anyway? While.. I found the action ""fun"".. unlike Lyman's previous ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" which.. I thought.. wow.. there's a hell of an idea.. but.. its like at the end of the movie.. Lyman just gor BORED with it.. and said.. let's just END this thing.. ""Jumper"" sadly.. goes the other way at a very BRISK running time of 88 minutes.. there's the almost super hero origin which takes up a good 5 or 10 minutes.. but, like the rest of the film it is very TIGHT and effectively told.. the problem is, as others have pointed out.. what are we being told? There are soooo many plot lines.. and as others have also said.. this one just feels like you're at the MIDPOINT of the movie when it fades to black. Sadly I don't see sequels blinking into existence.. although if they do, I'd definitely check them out to see where the story goes.. maybe the idea of ""jumping"", the Paladins that have tracked down the Jumpers through thousands of years.. the character of the mother.. and even see if Rooker returns.. but it was to me.. kind of like Unbreakable which to me was a very very very slow to go film.. which just ends at its HIGH POINT.. ""nooooooooooo.. that's the story I want to see!!"".Jumper has a lot of set up.. but.. we never get to see that story, although there are a series of books (although the movie series is just based on the ""concept"" and not the characters in the film). I kind of wish it had had more time to really.. flesh characters out.. Diane Lane was in the movie.. maybe all of 3 minutes.. PERIOS.. I was actually kind of interested to see her in the film when I read her name on the box.. ditto with Rooker who is rather one dimensional for most of his time, but acquits himself nicely I thought.. and again its like other people said.. the end.. it felt a lot like.. the end of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" 'he's out there'.. and he's running from the bad guys.. I can't really disagree with any of the reviews in terms of content.. although.. when I watched the film.. it oddly.. felt ALL there.. and very complete for its very brief running time, 88 minutes.Still this is nowhere near the return to form for Lyman as with Bourne.. or Go, a vastly underrated and so far under-sequelized film (I think they could have at LEAST milked those characters for another movie, even jokingly hinted at in its closing credits).as.. for an eye candy film.. you really can't do much better.. big fx.. big stunts and action.. the acting isn't Oscar quality.. and.. like I said.. the whole film just felt like a mad rush to get wrapped up.. and in only frustrating that it feels more like it was meant to be a back door for a sequel, that will more than likely never materialize..still for just a silly no-brainer action.. sci-fi film. you could do a lot worse.. but, you could also do a lot better too.. still its a fun lil ride.. I know its really hard to say if I RECOMMEND this film.. and I really can't. It's just OK.. and if you want a lil mindless action that's sadly paper thin.. something you'll see.. and go hey.. that stunt was cool.. Jumper would be for you.. but for most people, I'd have to say pass.. unless they fill out a more complete ""series"" that makes the film feel a bit more ""whole"" which it doesn't in its first foray onto the screen..",Jumper

Unfortunate kid has magic powers he suddenly discovers, he uses said powers to get anything he wants, he falls for old school crush, wins her then saves her from a super secret group of FBI/NSA/CIA (whatever) thugs who's sole mission in life is to hunt ""jumpers"" like him.There's almost no backstory as to why Jumpers can jump or why these super secret voodoo government guys want to kill the jumpers. The dialogue and scenarios are fairly predictable, and more often than not I found myself watching this thing and saying ""wait...what just happened? Why did the guy do that?"" But I never got an answer cause the protagonist was jumping into something else.The mother/father relationships are important in the film but never developed, the love relationship is cliché, and the only other jumper in the film seems to not do much but try to make clever quips and jump around real fast.The ending is less than thrilling and it really feels like Doug Liman was on crack or had ADD while making this - cause it starts off solid and then just spastically goes all over the place before coming to a quick end.Avoid this one if at all possible, its not worth ten bucks.",Jumper
215,dragonmysterious,Unexpectedly fun.,7,28 April 2013,"Initially, I thought Jumper would be just another wannabe-superhero film. However, it was far from that. A person who suddenly found out he had the power to teleport or 'jump' in this context when he was trapped in the water under ice. It is a very interesting story to me. Not surprising though, as David Goyer (writer of Man of Steel, and the Dark Knight Trilogy, and more) was one-third of its screenplay writers.Samuel L Jackson was pretty cool in the film. I kept guessing what would happen in the film. The flow was pretty good. I like how David brought the problems to himself. Putting a man he was fighting against into a bank which he previously robbed. (Did he not think he would get implicated?) However, the ending was too open. Leaving his friend on the electrical stand, Samuel L Jackson stranded in the desert, and talking to his Mum (who is a Paladin). It would be a pity if a second film is not done (Though it probably will be done).However, I would much rather see a Nightcrawler Origins film.

This idea of teleporting or translocation for a movie has been around a long time and could have looked at the immense ramifications, consequences, insights the use of a power like this might have. In short, it could have examined the benefits and spiritual dimensions and possibilities of our Universe. In fact, it addressed none of these things. There was no story, no explanations,no identification with anybody, (except Millie) and no arc. Who these people were was never explained, why they were being chased and hunted wasn't either other than the fact these advanced beings who could be anywhere whenever they chose to be had the social enlightenment and humanity of a flea. So if they weren't gods, demons...what were they? Could a mother act as coldly as his did? Very bad storyline, a cascade of cgi and an argument between two guys that was thrown in for no purpose.

220,SeussMeTub,A Waste Of Potentially Good Material,2,13 February 2008,"Ever since BOURNE IDENTITY I have always been a Doug Liman fan and so I decided to head over and watch his latest film JUMPER, starring Hayden Christiensen; I figured that a talented director like Liman could make even a horrible actor like Christiensen good by the sheer ""force"" of skill boy was I wrong.The plot is about a young man named David Rice who happens to discover that he has a teleportation superpower which allows him to travel instantaneously anywhere around the world. The first twenty minutes of the film focuses on David as an even younger nobody (played by Max Theriot) in high school as he puts up with a bully and trying to hitch up with his crush as he accidentally discovers his superpower. Now if this sounds like Raimi's SPIDERMAN it pretty much is- except that you can obviously tell its been done before and Raimi had a better script and more talented actors to work with. The plot then shifts to an older David doing whatever he pleases until he realizes that not only are there other jumpers like him, there also happens to be a group of fanatics (led by Samuel L Jackson in white bleached hair, no less) that are out to kill him and his kind.So where did this film go wrong? Well, there could have been a number of intriguing possibilities with regards to storytelling about a group of people who can teleport but unfortunately the movie focuses on Hayden Christiensen- his character is pretty much a spoiled brat who only uses his power to indulge in very basic stuff (chicks, money and TVs) and then when confronted by his enemies he makes a lot of mistakes that makes it easy for them to consistently find him. The other characters, including Jaime Bell as a vengeful and witty teleporter, are barely given anything as far as background for their characters which doesn't endear them much to the audience with regards to sympathy. Samuel L Jackson is likewise wasted as a leader of the Paladins, a cult of normal people who feel that it is their religious duty to kill jumpers- there are no revelations as to what motivates him or even how the whole conflict between jumpers and paladins got started in the first place. By the end of the movie there are at least three separate unresolved plot lines.Rumor has it that Eminem was offered the lead role but turned it down. In light of this turd I applaud him for making a smart move.",Jumper

They are angry because the protagonist, despite having super power, not helping people in trouble like those submerged by flood. Man.... people die everyday you know, from flood, drought, disease, murder, accident, etc, etc. You can't expect him to save everyone, right? And let's make it clear, He (David) is not a good guy, even less a hero, he is just a protagonist with super power, which is teleportation. You all make a mistake if you think that in every movie that depicts super power there must be a hero, actually, someone would be extremely stupid or brain dead to be a hero.Maybe if you got super power you might save several people at first, but you will get tired of it so fast, I guaranteed.Anyway, this movie is extremely fun, especially if u just watched some tear jerking movie, it'll cool you down and re-energized you :D The jumping scenes felt very real, and the battle part were awesome, , it's like a world tour in 60 seconds or something, and while you're at that, u can take a car from somewhere, drop bus in the lake, or even bringing your room with you in your trip.",Jumper
223,foxx_1,Hollywood hits a new low mark,1,29 May 2008,"The film is so awful - I don't know where to start... First of all, Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson are such terrible actors: looking good in nice clothes doesn't make you an actor but Hollywood begs to differ I guess! It is just painful to watch these two moving around: Christensen with an emotionless ""I-am-so-cool"" face and Bilson acting like a 5-year old girlie at a Nativity play!! What makes them look even worse is the presence of talented actors like Samuel L. Jackson and the less famous Jamie Bell. Diane Lane is totally underused here and seems to be kind of embarrassed by her mini-role... But even if they had cast better actors for the lead roles, it wouldn't have saved the film simply because the script is astonishingly bad. It is not following any internal logic and plausibility: guy suddenly discovers his supernatural powers when he is 15 although his mother knew about them since he was 5 (?!?), then decides to rob banks which don't seem to have any surveillance cameras and just leaves his father behind not caring about him anymore. What he cares about is living a shallow and materialistic life in his penthouse, ""jumping"" around postcard locations, screwing horny chicks in Britain after watching people drown on the TV news etc. The script does not even try to imply that this is wrong - Christensen's character is portrayed as the main protagonist i.e. the ""good guy"" and all these actions and behaviour as being just a normal part of his life! The twisted message to all the adolescent viewers is that it's quite cool to steal money from banks as long as you don't get caught and then live it up - it is as simple as that! Our hero shows of course no remorse for his actions whatsoever: even the slightest concept of guilt, responsibility and conscience would have been beyond the scope of this tripe. The final redeeming quality of his character is supposed to be the fact that he did not kill the ""villain"" but left him stuck in the middle of nowhere instead?!? Wow, how noble and imaginative...

I read bad reviews of the original X-Men movie and Return of the King before I saw them, and I loved both of them, so I should know not to pay attention to critics. Enough about that.The movie starts a bit slowly with David's back story. He's had a pretty sad life since age 10. I felt sad for him and with him yearned for more. Then he started ""jumping"", moving from place to place in a very cool blink of an eye, at first involuntarily. When he learns to control his powers, things start to pick up. I loved the jumps! When he meets another jumper named Griffin, the fun starts for real. Just hold onto your seats and enjoy the ride! Griffin and David have one of the best, most fun car rides ever! And the fights with all the jumping are just so much fun to watch. I have to admit that the opening scene in X2 with Nightcrawler fighting was one of my all time movie favorites, so this movie was like that scene times 100. There wasn't a ton of plot, but there was definitely enough to keep my interest and move the story along. I thought it flowed pretty well and pretty quickly, and I really enjoyed the little tie-up at the end that answered some questions from the beginning.All-in-all I would say this is a very entertaining evening at the movies.

Jumper, on the other hand, turns light saber expert Hayden Christensen into a teleporting maestro. Most superhero flicks such as Batman or Spiderman portray people like Tobey McGuire as selfless and epic heroes. The truth is, if anyone was to suddenly wake up with super powers, they probably wouldn't turn into selfless heroes overnight. Jumper tells the story of a boy who later learns he has the power to teleport. As he grows into his powers, he lives a very carefree life until he realizes that he nd many others like him are caught in a war. Though Christensen has the power to teleport, he does not use it to save the world, but in finding ways to amuse himself. Its nice, because it does not play on the old story of Superman or Batman, but on a regular guy with the ability to teleport and his attempts to find love and survive the war. I thought Christensen did a good job in portraying an everyday jumper. Rachel Bilson acting was okay, but I thought she was sometimes in the way when it came to the action scenes. Jamie Bell did nice work in portraying a devil may care attitude and adding much comic relief. Samuel Jackson does a good job as always being the slightly aggressive and often times intimidating enemy. Overall I gave this movie an 8, because I thought it was something worth watching and action scenes were amazing.

Jackson isn't bad either, so those two actors really lifts up this film without them it would be easily under 5 in a rating. It's a very cool concept but a very poor execution.

Not to mention Christensen leading whose turn as a certain 'one to restore balance to the Force' bought about the downfall of the myth and brilliance of one of cinema's most iconic villains. From the get go this didn't look utterly thrilling or enticing. But I must protest. Nay sayers beware, this is an interesting and, admittedly, surprising little picture. Granted, Christensen cannot act. But we can get over that. And once we do, Jumper is just what to be expected from a Liman picture, creator of The Bourne Identity which set a new benchmark for the spy flick and the (albeit hollow) thoroughly entertaining comedic Mr. & Mrs. Smith.I'm sure you all know by now but let's recap: young man realises he has the ability to teleport and so goes about living his life as he pleases. He robs banks, steals cars and bikes and countless other valuables. Knock, knock. Who is it? Convention? Who're you? Get outta here! I say, our protagonist appears to be no more than a thief who manipulates his supernatural gifts for use to his own ends. Gone are the ways of Spiderman, Superman, Daredevil and the X-men who use theirs for justice. This guy's in it for himself. What, ho?! It's little wonder then, that a group of Paladins wanna take this guy down along with his peers. Jackson  despite looking a bit daft with that hair  is actually quite disturbing as the man after Christensen. He has a coldness about him which lets you know he ain't much of the talking type. He shows a brutality which, I must admit, scares you if you're used to Jackson's more heroic roles. And the way he likes to taunt his victims with unreasonable, non negotiable preachings before plunging a knife into them is well hard as.Of course, being a product of today's cinema there are twists and turns galore and an opening left for a follow up (which will undoubtedly then go on to trilogy-dom) and although most people say it's the originals that are always the best, I must declare that the successors will probably be so. This is just the set up. It gives us the back story, ties it in to historical events (witch hunting) but keeps enough cards close enough to its chest to still hold an air of mystery about it. It lays the brickwork for a small time battle finale but nothing spectacular and Jumper 2 will no doubt up the ante. In the mean time, whack this in your DVD player, switch your brain to 'off' and enjoy.Read the full review and more at www.wrawreviews.co.uk",Jumper

237,miketigas25,An amazing film that will definitely stand out.,10,13 February 2008,"I know what you're thinking, ""A 10 is probably a bit too much don't you think?"" Well, probably yes. However, I'm basing my rating on the movie's entertainment value; not on its other aspects (i.e. acting). Speaking of acting, hmmm.... Hayden isn't actually that bad as most people think. But I do have to admit that there are times when he's just... ugh.Anyway, as stated, the movie has a really high entertainment value. You just never get tired of all the ""jumping"". In fact, whenever an action scene opens up, you can't help but wonder in advance where the action will take place or what they'll all do next.The effects were just amazing. Each ""jump"" delivers a thrill down your spine. And no, it doesn't look overly edited. The ""jumps"" do look genuine. I do believe that if this film deserves any sort of award, it could be for special effects or cinematography. Ah, speaking of cinematography, you won't believe how many places are featured here (without the annoying computer text/audio showing at the lower left of the screen; indicating what country they are in).I really like to congratulate Jamie Bell for being enormous (figuratively) in the entire film. He, as the cool jumper Griffin, has the most amazing jumps featured in the film. On the other hand, Hayden, as the emotional David, does not necessarily stand out. BUT, he doesn't suck either. His character is quite reminiscent of both Neo of the first Matrix (the guy who's new at everything and is just learning) and - you guessed it - Anakin (It's a Hayden thing, I believe). So I think we really shouldn't demand much from him. Samuel, as the jumper hunter Roland, does a great job too. Seeing him with his new shiny hair kind of made me forget ""Snakes on a Plane"" for an hour or two.Jumper is an incredible film that you SHOULD definitely watch. There's absolutely no reason why you should hate it (unless if you rode the hype a bit too much). Watch it and you'll end up wanting more. Indeed, a sequel is in order.",Jumper
238,tenacious_david,WOW!!! is all i can say,10,15 February 2008,"Well when i first ever saw the trailer for this movie i was so very excited i couldn't wait but then all the reviewers were giving it not so good reviews but i thought the best reviewer is your self (and thats so true as i found out with this movie.I actually saw it on Valentines day the first day it was released here in the UK, and my god was i in for a treat. I am sick and tired af all this arty type films like the Valley Of Ellah etc and i just wanted to watch a good simple film and this sure delivered. You have action, love, humour, death, drama, sci-fi, excellent special effects and what more do you need, Hayden Christensen played spectacular and so did Samuel L. Jackson and surprising of all Jamie Bell was excellent so much different to when he was in Billy Elliot.And its not going to surprise you that this is being made into a Trilogy and my god its gonna be a good one, all i can say is i cant wait for the next JUMPER!!!",Jumper
239,vamplad79,I wanted to jump out of this film !,4,16 February 2008,"Prob the first film i have seen in a cinema where about half way through i wanted to leave. Just a very empty film with a really unlikeable lead. I can see clearly that the director was pushing the whole hedonistic type character but this was just a plain old mistake on his part and i'm surprised the studio let him go through with it. I had no sympathy for the lead and thus no connection or feeling to the outcomes.This guy was a complete yuppie, egocentric arsehole irrelevant that of that fact he had powers or not and i found myself rooting for Jackson's character to nail his arse. He completely screws over everyone he come in contact with including another jumper that had a real moral motive to do what he did.The film would have been a lot better if we had had Jamie Bell's character more at the fore front and i was far more interested in his story and motives.To add insult, actions scenes, dialogue and overall production was trite. There was nothing amazing or special and personally i found the direction of the film to be dull. No build up, no connection, just a shallow film that doesn't even entertain on any level besides the concept of 'jumpers' but even then they screw this up by adding more and more to the concept to a point it becomes stupid. Yeah we jump, oh we leave a trail when we jump too, oh and then we can jump through another jumper trails and just to be more awesome we can jump objects and building - eck ! This would fine if there was a more natural flow and reason to it but here it simply seems to be added to explain and assist the next plot set up or a way to escape. It's not that other films don't do this but here the direction is too obvious and it seems hammered.To end this rant on any positives, i will say the production seems high and it was great to see so many location set-ups. i, unlike some, like Jacksons presence in the film and still think the guy can play an ultimate badarse. At an hour and a half the film didn't drag and some of the action sequences, though badly directed, added some excitement to the proceedings.Good concept - bad film and horrid lead !",Jumper

I have watched thousands of movies of all genre's and I must say, lately this is one of the better one's. There is a lot of Sci - Fi garbage out there but believe me this is not one of them.

The storyline is so bland I can only picture a bunch of 14yo Beavis and Butthead teenagers writing this on a clownpointed Saturday detention assignment. The characters are weak and predictable. The so called 'great' life David has is boring beyond words and looks like a mere cliché of a pure teenage fantasy. The way the story goes turns him into a little unappealing selfish spoiled boring knucklehead. Oh lord, prevent me from cringing. CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE!

244,jjoseph202,Disappointing execution of fascinating premise,1,10 June 2008,"*** SPOILERS *** The basic premise of this film is that there are naturally-occurring mutants (ala X-Men) that can jump -- teleport themselves -- via thought-impulse alone to other locations on Earth. These people are called Jumpers. Because they have seemingly supernatural powers, a gang of Christian assassins organized since the Middle Ages pursue and execute Jumpers because ""only God should have such powers"". These assassins are called Paladins, apparently after the collective name of the knights in Charlemagne's court.So now we have X-men, being pursued and assassinated by Opus Dei. Get it? The movie concerns itself with a Paladin (Samuel Jackson) who gets on the trail of a Jumper because a large amount of cash has disappeared from a number of bank vaults where there was no forced entry, and the thief apparently left notes apologizing for the theft.This Jumper is apparently an emo-angst dysfunction case because his mother left him when he was five and his father is a drunken dullard. But around the age of 15 he gets in a tussle with the high school bully and learns he can, by mental-impulse, cause himself to teleport to other locations.The emo-angst bleeds through into everything this jumper does. This, complicated with his low I.Q. (""you did flunk algebra""), leads him into stupidity after stupidity.This is the disappointment in the film for me. We have a Jumper who's been stealing money from bank vaults for 8 years but somehow (in an emotionally immature way) thinks that no one will come looking for him or try to recover their money.This is similar to the emo-angst dysfunction in the film version of Lost in Space. Also very similar to the emo-angst dysfunction at the end of the first Superman film. And let's not forget the emo-angst portrayed in the Spider-Man films.These films all could have (should have) been made without the emo-angst dysfunction.When I see films like this, I want to ask myself ""what would I do if I had power 'X'?"" The reason this film leaves people cold, empty and dry inside is because they (like me) want to think that they would use the power more wisely than the emo-angst lead in this film. Or at least with a little insight and forethought. Not hesitantly and neurotically.I think that the parts of the film about getting the girl, fighting the Paladins, and figuring out what mommy was all about could have been explored without all the mellerdrammer.And, frankly, the premise could have left room for a Jumper-II (or, in Alien parlance, ""Jumpers""). But the poor execution and over-emo application of the premise leaves room only for a sequel if someone has the stomach to suggest it for a Sci-Fi channel Memorial Day special premiere. And maybe not even then.I want to take my Jumper DVD back to the store, demand my $16 be returned, and demand another $16 for the time I wasted watching this.",Jumper

247,jess-154,Such potential but disappointing!,5,12 February 2008,"A disappointing adaption of the Jumper novel by Steven Gould. The creative team behind the 2005 action hit Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which brought Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie together to the tune of $186 million. Director Doug Liman, who started out doing indies like Swingers and Go, made waves in 2002 with his update of Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity. Jumper is an exciting concept of rich young man with unimaginable possibilities, known as a jumper he has powers of teleportation. Yes! It sounds exciting but unfortunately felt more like a television episode with a large budget rather than a feature film with a beginning, middle and end. One thing I can't complain about are the special effects, they're indeed very well done.Jumper isn't the type of action film that relies on its stars, none of them are really mentioned in the trailer and it becomes more evident when you realise that a major star like Diane Lane, who usually headlines a film, is taking a smaller secondary role. Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson produce some-what adequate performances but it's Jamie Bell that brings along a refreshing welcome of madness. One might think that Samuel Jackson's track record might help get people to see it, since he's starred in a lot of big film, yet he still has to prove himself as a box office draw on his own, as recent high-profile attempts like Snakes on a Plane and Black Snake Moan have failed to bring in the audiences expected. I felt this film had such potential but unfortunately the final piece just didn't come together as well as I'm sure everyone involved would have hoped. The competition is high this week with the release of There Will Be Blood and National Treasure: Book of Secrets still playing. I will be keen to see how well the film does. No doubt it will draw in some younger fans thanks to its ultra-cutie Rachel Bilson and the surprisingly sexy Hayden Christensen. It's not all bad, but I was expecting something better.",Jumper

Had I been watching Jumper on DVD, I would have switched off after about 25 minutes... Can I have those 88 minutes back, please? It was awful! It was glossy and empty, and the only saving grace was Jamie Bell's presence in it. I could only muster any interest in the ""film"" when he was on screen. Hayden Christensen was bad, and so was the girlfriend... Even Samuel Jackson wasn't any good in this - and what was with the white hair??? I am quite happy to watch a film and switch my brain off and be entertained, but when the acting is *this* bad, I can't let it go. Bad dialogue, bad acting, overuse of CGI to cover the holes (that you could literally drive a bus through)!

And so did my two teenage kids (and boy and a girl who would both be the first to complain if it was boring or confusing).OK it's not a *great* film (in the sense of truly great destined to be a classic) but there are plenty of worse ways to pass 90 minutes. Sure, it won't be winning any awards. Yes, it could have been done so much better.But if you've enjoyed X-Men, Spiderman, Deja Vu, Back to the Future and Heroes (TV), then I think you'll enjoy this too. Certainly better than the Fantastic Four! So ignore the detractors, leave your brain and the critical reviews at home and go and enjoy. You can thank me later!!In retort to a few of the specific criticisms on here (no spoilers) I think Hayden Christensen got the part right (in my opinion his character is supposed to be lacking in emotion - he's been emotionally damaged). The brief narration at the start enables us to cut to the action as far as the rest of the movie is concerned. I also thought Samuel L did a fair job as the bad guy.

Sadly, that sentence sounds even more interesting than the movie actually is. It is clogged with clichés like lost love, lost parents, kid hanging around, weak kid growing strong, strong kid being suddenly confused and in pain etc. ad nauseam. Main protagonist has no charisma, perhaps unsurprisingly, because he's played by Christensen. His love interest has no charisma. His allies are bland. His enemies have no personality and no redeeming qualities. The story has no drive, the twists are predictable, the action doesn't compensate for the sluggish tempo, the writing is boring and humourless.This is a very poor movie, positively less entertaining than any of the the Divergents and Labyrinths. It certainly has both worse acting and worse action.",Jumper
251,corozin,A good idea wasted,4,4 March 2008,"I went to see this film without having much idea beforehand of what it was about and came out afterward with a very mixed opinion.The premise of individuals being able to teleport to anywhere they could visualise was at least halfway original and the movie does make an attempt to develop the idea in terms of how it would affect the life (and lifestyle) of anyone with such a power. It wasn't until I thought about it afterwards that I realised that (of course) the concept had been executed with more skill with Alan Cumming's similarly translocational mutant in X-Men 2, but it's still an interesting idea.Despite the (seemingly usual) stunning effects, fast moving action and a few notable performances the movie overall fails to deliver in almost every other respect. Special mentions in particular to Jamie Bell and Michael Rooker for excellent performances in the circumstances without layering the cheese on.You would have thought that ruining two Star Wars movies would have been enough to seal the fate of almost any actor's career and yet Hayden Christiansen manages to keep getting roles despite seemingly having only two expressions and no ability to express any kind of emotion in his repertoire. But my particular Razzle award for this film goes to Samuel L Jackson, who in my view wastes the enormous talent so clearly visible in films like Black Snake Moan with autopiloting, cheque-paying appearances like the one he almost turns up to deliver in this movie. Despite the mandatory doe-eyes Rachel Bilson is as utterly cardboard and forgettable as Kate whass-er-name was in Superman Returns.The film seems constrained by the requirement to keep it's running time under the teen-attention span limit of 90 minutes and as a result fails to take the time to properly develop what could have been a really interesting concept in terms of it's affects on those it affects. Small glimpses of this are offered in the early parts of the movie but then cheaply discarded in favour of endless action sequences. The movie also in my view falls for the obvious formulaic plot-device (seemingly copied straight from films like Underworld and Highlander) of introducing mysterious feuding master-races so late into the film that it actually drowns what little compassion you have left for the movie.The plot-holes almost defy counting, and as is often the case these days what starts out as an interesting story is quickly sacrificed to simply create a vehicle for the special effects. In this case that is a shame, because with a better script, longer running time and without Christiansen & Bilson in the lead roles this could have possibly been something memeorable. As delivered, this movie will be on the £3.99 DVD shelf within six months if it's lucky.",Jumper

Not all movies that I seen were actually interesting and groundbreaking than this. Movies like this are aimed at teens and sci-fi fans so don't go complainin to me if you don't like it. Saw Samuel L Jackson in it which was really funny like what was his point in being in it. A villain of some sort.

253,Chris Brown,didn't reach its potential,6,28 April 2008,"This movie was far from perfect. The characters were very static; I don't think anybody matured or learned a lesson. The writers didn't make Hayden Christensen's character as likable as they could/should have. The one really fun character was Griffin (played by Jamie Bell). He was a scene-stealing foil. As for the plot, many parts of the story will make you scratch your head and ask yourself, ""Why would this character do something so stupid?"" People who are easily bothered by such script issues might hate this film. However, people who can overlook these problems might find the film to be a fun, fantastic ride. What did I like? The action and special effects were great overall, although there were a couple action scenes where unsteady camera-work made it annoyingly difficult to process what was happening. I really enjoyed how this film spent some time answering the question ""What would you do if you suddenly discovered you had superpowers?"" We see David Rice's initial shock, his awkward experiments with his abilities, his first kooky ideas of how to take advantage of his powers, and ultimately the many ways he learns to have as much fun as possible with his powers. The Spider-Man movie took a similar approach, but most other super-hero movies (e.g. The Fantastic Four) don't leave the viewer saying, ""Wow, how fun! That's exactly what I would want to do!"" Kudos to the writer for making teleportation look more fun than perhaps any other movie ever has. In conclusion, the characters (and their relationships with each other) are poorly developed. But the fantasy elements (exploration of the use of super powers) are wonderful.",Jumper
254,Ant_Lan,Great potential left unfulfilled,4,15 March 2008,"If Jumper succeeds in one area, it will be to make viewers want to read the book, since it is unquestionably a very intriguing twist on a recycled-yet-cool concept. But as far as the movie goes, it's a great concept that tripped at the finish line. Well, actually, tripped all through the race track.Although the visual F/X were bashed by many critics, they provide jaw-dropping sceneries and actions scenes, which is almost enough to make a good movie. The viewer truly feels swept along with the hero when he jumps, dizziness and all.What makes it veer into lousy-movie territory though is ""Manakin"" Skywalker (hopefully about to drop out of sight) as the lead, and very poor narrative development. Interesting characters are showcased with walking-tree performances to support them, save for Jamie Bell who literally explodes with charisma in each of his scenes; Sam Jackson phones-in one of his rare bad guy roles, Micheal Rooker is given nothing to work with and Diane Lane shows up for little else but to pick up her monthly paycheck.Along those lines, mysterious elements are introduced to great viewer-interest only to be left unexplained or unused - A ritual knifed wielded by Sam Jackson which we never learn anything about, David's mother who could have been the next Darth Vader, the anti-hero Griffin who's storyline is left literally ""hanging"", a mention of centuries-old conflicts that are never exposed and the origin of the power itself which is never explained. The story (and film) ends abruptly with no resolution and VERY little satisfaction, as if it was only the pilot of a yet un-produced TV show.Still an entertaining film, Jumper should be seen with low expectations and with a focus on the few strengths, which are the awesome visuals and the always-amazing Jamie Bell as bad-ass jumper Griffin - who most definitely should've been the true star of this movie.",Jumper

Back to the Future was a blatantly 'not possible' movie but it explained everything and gave it some weight. jumper floated around in kiddie's movie territory. diane lane's role was significantly under-explained. half the stories were left hanging at the end. they should have made the movie twenty minutes longer and explained a lot of the things.the other thing that annoyed me was the utter stupidity of hayden christensen's character. highlighted in this - he's lived happily jumping for 8 years. one night he's attacked by someone who knows who he is and what jumping is - that doesn't trigger questions in him, or a need to lie low...he seemingly forgets about it immediately and goes home and goes back to the girl of his dreams, who forgets that he's disappeared for 8 years and takes him back (almost) no questions asked. then he does the silliest thing of all - he takes her to rome - no trail to follow there!!! AND THEN break into the Colosseum. there was a lot of this in the movie - things that just weren't logical and then they weren't explained to make them logical. made me want to scream.the script, like i said, was terrible. at times i laughed almost apologetically, as if to say, well you're trying. hayden christensen did not let me down and i still believe him to be one of the worst actors i've ever seen. dull, wooden and facial expressions that seem to always be out of place.the one saving grace in the film (and i really had to look for it) was Jamie Bell and even he couldn't fight the terrible script. Rachel Bilson's character was all over the place. and it wasn't good. wasn't good at all. samuel l jackson? anybody could have played the role in a santa claus outfit and it wouldn't have made an ounce of difference to the outcome.the fight scenes were sad. absolutely pointless drivel.Terrible, terrible, terrible....but at least it wasn't slow (and i only had to sit through 90 minutes of it!)",Jumper
256,supersabref100,Jumpers entertains despite weak performances from Hayden and Bell,6,19 February 2008,"First off Jumper is entertaining, diverting, popcorn film. The special effects are the highlight of film along with the exotic locals. Doug Liman of Swingers, Go, Mr. and Mrs. Smith and the great Bourne Identity which I consider one of the great action, spy movies of the last 30 years (imho better than Bourne 2 & 3 -no shaky cam, much better story and better character development than the entertaining Paul Greengrass sequels). Liman tries to tell the story in personal yet involving way rather than strictly rely on special effects. He seems to know it all comes down to it's about love and survival.Rachl Bilson and the blonde (why?) haired Samuel L. Jackson give serviceable performances. Diane Lane is bareley in the movie but is the most interesting character. But Hayden Christensen is wooden and Jamie Bell is annoying. Does having the ability to teleport make one either boring or annoying. I can't believe people have been saying that they wish the movie had been about Griffith. Jamie Bell's acting is so annoying in this film. You have the ability to teleport. But all he does is whine. I hated his character. Christensen is like a block of ice, cold and stiff but at least he doesn't annoy the audience like Jamie Bell's Griffith.It sounds like I didn't like the movie but I truly did. Liman pulls it off despite the weak casting of the two teleports. Overall a good action film that could have been even better. I haven't read the Jumper novels so i can't comment on how they compare to the source material. I rate it a 6 out of 10. I'm pretty hard greater so you might like it even more. PS I saw Liman doing an interview with Charlie Rose saying he might move to doing more meaningful films. DON'T. He does one film every three years. I'd hate to lose the entertainment of movies like Bourne, Smith and Jumpers for some depressing social relevant, boring films. imho.",Jumper

We are told by Roland, played by Samuel L Jackson, that ""only God should be in two places at the same time"".Rachel Bilson, obviously capable of much more, played the stereotypical bimbo.

His performance adds to the frantic energy of the film and every scene without him is the poorer for it.While the pacing and energy of the film keeps you glued to your seat, it is only on reflection that I realised how unsatisfying the story ultimately was - leaving me with an ""is that all?"" kind of feeling. The answer, of course, will probably be 'No' as this film seems to have been made with the idea of sequels firmly in sight.All in all - a tightly made film, with the scenes inside the Colosseum worth the price of admission alone - if only they'd cast someone else in the lead role!",Jumper
260,terrywdhs,If Only The Movie Had Concentrated On Griffin,7,16 February 2008,As I sat and watched this movie I realised the fundamental flaw with it and that was the fact that Griffin was a far better character than Davey which is a pity as Davey is the main character. Jamie Bell is wonderful as Griffin and the movie comes to life whenever he is on screen. Pity about the two main leads though. Special effects and action sequences are fine but the whole thing could have been so much better.The climax is worth seeing though at times confusing. Liman presents us with a great looking movie but one that is empty of emotion thanks in part to a boring lead actor.Just lower your expectations and you will enjoy this movie only to think about what might have been with a movie centred on the Jamie Bell character. Maybe if there is a sequel they might rectify matters.,Jumper

The storyline was awful, it was basically a cops and robbers superhero film, with no actual story.The only reason this film didn't get 1/10 is because of rachel bilson, and it did show the colosseum in a lot of its glory.The love story between the two characters was pretty poor, i think the director didn't know whether to make this a romantic film, an action film, or a superhero movie, none of which it did well.To some up jumper it was basically one group of people trying to stop another group of people from just teleporting around the world... why?

However, the concept is basically all that is built in this movie, as it became just another film that relies on action and special effects too much and provides very little story. Further, in what little story was told the film raises far more questions than it answers and leaves the viewers to wonder why??? We are told there is a battle between two groups in this movie and other than the answer ""that there has always been a battle"" nothing more is explained. This is troublesome because it is the essential factor that is driving the film.If you don't mind a movie that lacks any substance but provides mindless action and some cool effects, than JUMPER is for you.

264,arwel,Quite a disappointment,4,17 February 2008,"Well, that's another hour and a half I won't see again. This is a pity, because the trailers looked good, and the basic idea can give excellent stories - see the early 1970's British kids' TV show ""The Tomorrow People"" for example. Unfortunately, the money spent on this movie seems to have gone on the special effects and filming around the world, rather than on a plot. The dizzying ""jump"" effect is pretty good, but after 2 minutes I was waiting for the plot to begin, and I was still waiting when the credits rolled 85 minutes later. Any movie which depends on a sequel for its plot and background is severely lacking, and I much doubt that this movie will get a sequel, unless it gets a TV series like ""Highlander"" did. It's unexplained WHY the Paladins hate the Jumpers, and it's not explained how Samuel L. Jackson's hair is white and his beard isn't!The basic problems are: 1. Hayden Christensen is an actor of very limited range 2. There's nothing in the plot to make us like the lead character - he's a self-centred idiot who learns nothing from Griffin's warnings 3. Jamie Bell, who plays Griffin, is a FAR better actor and steals all the scenes he's in. 4. In the UK it has a ""12A"" certificate. This is a pity as I think it should be ""PG"" - any 12 year old who goes to see it will be able to spot plot holes you could drive a bus through (and indeed at one point a bus does get driven through a wormhole!).If you want to see this, I recommend you wait until you can rent the DVD.",Jumper
265,sattaravy,Don't miss the point,7,14 February 2008,"For all haters.To me, there's an important message hidden in this film. I feel that the makers of this film wanted to deliver a message. In this genre of film, almost all the ""gifted"" individuals turned out to be some superhero or saviour of mankind. Like Superman, Spiderman, Batman, Daredevil, X-men, Fantastic 4.. just to name a few.But the question is, if we really got these super-human powers, who will actually sacrifice it all for the good of man kind? This is the message the makers of Jumper is trying deliver to the audiences. The guy in this film, without giving too much away, is nothing but a selfish prick. All the things he does with his power is for himself, no one else.To me, the most meaningful scene in this film, is the few seconds when he watched the News of TV, saw a bunch of people get caught in flood, and then emotionlessly turned it off.He could have gone and saved those people, and become a stereo-type hero. But he didn't. He got superpower, he use it to enjoy life. It's that simple.But isn't it what we would all do, if we got his power? This ain't an Oscar winning film, but it got a clear and simple message. Which I believe allows it to beat all superhero films, simply because it's more realistic.""With greater power, comes greater responsibility""? Bullocks. Get real. We're all selfish animals.",Jumper

Don't say ""No, I don't"" because everyone has thought about it at least once, so don't make yourself a liar. Jumper is the story of David Rice (Christensen) who learns he has the ability to ""Jump"" (teleport) anywhere in the world. But when a murderous religious group called the ""Paladins"" start hunting them down one by one, David, along with Millie (Bilson) and fellow jumper Griffin (Bell) must fight against head Paladin Roland (Jackson).Here's the breakdown, the short breakdown actually; great story, good acting, nice action, superb effects.

The story line could have been a lot better, but the graphics were really good. Sort of like what a lot of movies are these days, good graphics, bad overall story. When I first saw the previews, I was stoked. I thought OK, we've got another type of comic book character, instead of being the hero, he's the type of guy who does whatever he wants. Very similar powers to the Night Crawler in X-Men. The acting was pretty bad, I don't understand how Hayden Christenson can still do movies after the horrible job he did in Star Wars episode II and III.

268,mygreatness321,Decent Premise but not well executed.,3,17 February 2008,"The idea of a character who can teleport around the world to all the places he has been before and use this for personal gain is a good one and makes sense.What did not make sense is exactly why 'Roland' (Samuel L Jackson) and his 'Paladins' were trying to kill him. There was the briefest of explanations about it being a group of religious people, and upon murdering jumpers Roland would say things like ""Only God should have these powers"" but it was so flimsy. We never even saw them praying or communing to give us any sense that they were a religious cult. They could have done this much better like saying; ""We have to stop you because every time you jump it causes minor earthquakes that kill people in other parts of the world."" Or they could be trying to recruit him for their own gains, hell they could even work for the banks he was robbing from and be trying to get their money back, anything would have been better. So the villains were very weak.The love story was rubbish also. 'Milly' (Rachel Bilson) didn't seem to care too much about David (Hayden Christensen) when they were kids, so why would she go to Rome with him right away when she hadn't seem him in 8 years? He then continually messes with her head, life, and not least her apartment and she doesn't really care, she makes limp attempts to get him to leave her alone but for the most part just accepts the whole thing without question quite happily.Then Davids relationship with his parents, his Mum leaves when he's 5 to become a Paladin, but she still helps him out even though she sort of threatens him at the end, again making the religious fanaticism a joke. His father is nearly killed by Roland, David jumps him to the hospital and we never find out if he survives or not, whats the point in him other than 'everybody has a Dad so we've got to explain him'.The next problem was that they were so concerned with leaving everything open for a sequel that they never bothered to finish this movie. Jamie Bell (who steals all the scenes he is in) is just left dangling on an electricity pylon asking for help. Again, why doesn't this kill him? I get the point that small electrical current inhibits the ability to jump but surely being a jumper doesn't prevent you from being killed by any and all electrical currents? If it does then this wasn't explained.On the plus side the special effects are really good but thats not really a good enough reason for a sequel, if they do a sequel they need somebody who can write a whole movie plot and not just a basic idea of people who can teleport because that is all this is.",Jumper

So he is not your average run of the mill kid, nobody knows what he can do and he can basically do and go where he wants, creating an aloof type of character, so under these circumstance i think his performance was okay, maybe not worthy of an academy award but totally interesting to watch, I enjoyed his intensity. Overall i thought it was a great film for what it was, special effects are great, and the story holds together in most aspects. The concept of Jumping is something we have all thought about at one time or another, just like time travel. I think that a lot of people who comment on IMDb have no idea of what goes into making a movie, but just like to be critical as possible.

First off, this movie could have been a lot better (Acting-wise) if they didn't choose Hayden Christensen as the lead role. As charming as he looks, he is definitely not Hollywoods greatest actor. Jamie bell saved it though with his witty humor, and funny lines. The humor was strong, but some jokes we have heard and seen before. However they are delivered very well I think. Also, we all love a good superhero movie, however we have seen this power before in Xmen and in several other movies. Teleportation is a very common ability in movies, they just decided to call it ""Jumping"" to make sure it didn't come across as unoriginal. The storyline itself is not so good, again nothing original or fascinating. It was cheesy, and cliché at the same time the entire way through. I would say it was worth the money but I would not see it again. Acting-wise it is horrible, storyline isn't so hot, not very original, comedy stays strong.

276,depaulbeatkuHA,dumb,4,16 February 2008,"this movie is dumb on every level known to mankind. The Movie starts off with a 15 year old kid giving some girl a snow globe he gets from a garage sale. For no reason, everybody hates the kid. One of the ""bad guys"" takes the snow globe and hurls it 30 yards away onto a frozen river. the snow globe doesn't break! are you being serious????? how can you hurl a flimsy piece of glass 90 feet onto solid ice and not have it break. The kid then walks over to it and of course falls through the ice and reappears in a library. Dumb right? Anyway, the kid then goes home to a drunk father where we first learn of the kids situation. His mother left when he was a little kid and his dad sucked. So the kid runs away with his new power and robs banks and gets extremely rich. The movie is good until now, when we learn of a group of people led by Samuel L. Jackson who aren't the jumpers' biggest fans. Turns out they try to kill jumpers! Who knew?So the rest of the movie is filled with lame chase scenes and stupidity. For example, Samuel L. kidnaps the protagonist's girlfriend. Didn't see that coming. The kid goes after her (shocker) and gets in a big fight, but of course no guns are used.I saved the stupidest thing for last. Turns out the mom left the kid when he was five when she learns he's a jumper! what kind of mom ditches her kid when she learns he's from a rival gang? then she informs him that she's gonna have to kill him! she leaves us with the line ""I love you. That's why I'm giving you a head start."" (Because she has to kill him.)Overall, there's no character depth, a stupid plot, and they never even really explain the power! how did he get it? how many people have it? can the make other people jump? and the only explanation we get for the people trying to kill the jumpers is Samuel L.'s quote,""Only God should have the power to be all places.""Well, only people hated by God should be forced to watch this movie.

But, someone in charge of making money decided that they would end the movie right as it should be taking off... presumably so that they can have a sequel. The movie did not tie up ANY loose end; all it did was leave them all hanging.They have a chance to make a franchise out of this because the hero is really an anti-hero, looking out only for himself, and that is unique.

The narrative is very very slow from the off-start and you aren't sure what's happening.As the film progresses, the narrative is reasonable but is very weak. If someone demanded that i back up such an 'offensive comment' then I would merely point out how you get people with an ability to teleport...and nothing else. They're teleporting, yet at the same time they are being chased by professionals. Answer me this, how do you chase someone who can teleport anywhere in the world and have they heard of wanted posters? However on the flip side of the coin, i was very impressed by the performance of one Jamie Bell.

Very entertaining to watch, but that's all that's good about this flick.Hayden Christiensen (ohnoes!) When I discovered he was the soul given the epic task of wielding this ""film"" upon his scrawny shoulders I thought ""Anakin Skywalker"" and had instant misgivings. But I decided to give this movie a chance and hired it on DVD.Mr Christiensen... I'm really sorry to say this. But your acting sucks.I'm not sure what the director and writers were telling us. Did they want the audience to connect with this self prick of a character, and root for his every exploit? He uses his powers merely to further his own gain. I'm not even sure if the message this movie was putting across is ""If I really did have powers like this, would I even bother using it for good? Nah, I jus' wanna hav fun!""So many things don't make sense. Why are the people hunting these Jumpers normal like you and me? They can't teleport. Instead they use ridiculous gadgets to catch and do in the Jumpers. I kept expecting to see Mr Jackson teleport and kick Mr Christiensen's arse... but he doesn't! Instead, he's a normal guy kicking ass-hat on a guy who can teleport. Apparently, being a Jumper makes you invincible, just like the Highlanders in Highlander. You can be electrocuted by thousands of volts of electricity and still survive. And like Highlander, there's been a war going on between these norms called Paladins and Jumpers since medieval times. Also, it appears that the kids born to Paladins have this teleporting ability... or I could be wrong, and Jumper kids just randomly appear in the general populace. Are only male children born with teleporting abilities? Does anyone really care?Blah. It's fairly cliché these questions will be answered in the ghodawful sequel lurking on the horizon. This movie was totally dull, with empty characters whose motives were unknown and whose purpose was meaningless. It even lagged in the entertainment department.

281,johanncats,Jump in and enjoy,8,28 January 2011,"Every now and then, when I want to watch a film just to be entertained, I turn to Jumper. It's fast, it looks good, the story is not too awful (and based on a great idea) and the leading characters are not too inhuman. At least they're young, hip and hot. Of course, if you look deeper into the story, there is the usual Hollywood trash. The broken family blah-blah, some childhood trauma, yearning for everlasting love, a (very) far-fetched good versus bad eternal war, a mix-up of hyper modernity and medieval weaponry that makes your toes cringe and generally a vacuum of morality.It's also true that the lead can't act very well and looks wooden, like Daniel Craig in that painful love scene in Casino Royale, when he says 'I've got no walls left, you've taken them all away' (or something like that), and manages to show no emotion at all, just a wooden, blank face. The female lead is not very much my type and comes across as a phony. I wouldn't know what the guy sees in her. At some point in the film he picks up a gorgeous blonde with never ending legs, who seemed really nice. But he leaves her to go surfing in Fiji, or wherever. What a waste.This does not at all make a bad film. The first good thing in Jumper is the basic idea. A guy in high school finds out he has the ability to teleport himself, ie he can think himself from one place to another (yes, his clothes move along with him). This idea is stolen/taken from the science fiction writer Alfred Bester. In 1956 he wrote a book called 'The Stars My Destination' (also known as 'Tiger! Tiger!'), and that's one of the greatest books ever written. In the book, basically everybody teleports, or 'jaunts', as it called there. Only the main character can jump through space. I read they might turn that one into a film as well. Should be great. Anyhow, that's another story. Steven Gould wrote a book called 'Jumper' in 1992, and he readily admits to have been 'inspired' by Alfred Bester. That's a nice example of how people think if they admit to something bad, it magically turns into something good. I'll never read 'Jumper'. Others did, and decided to turn that into a film.In 'Jumper', we are swiftly introduced to the idea of 'jumping' The film then develops rapidly into a 'good guy chased by the bad guys' story with various subplots concerning the nature of the struggle between good and evil, a love story and a nice 'friendship' between the lead and an English bloke who helps him out of his naive world, reluctantly gives him a hand in the battle and is a great, funny character that the film badly needs, wooden lead and all.There are some great scenes involving the advantages of jumping, also some great fight scenes and the final fight sequence is original and well done. Mostly these finales are just boring, with the sound turned up to full and the orchestra in full swing and really not very much happening while you can't see a thing, due to the 'shaky camera disease', that has such a firm grip on Hollywood. Here you can pretty much follow the action and see the effort. Sure it's pretty loud, but not too much pyrotechnics and it actually has a nice circular effect, as it brings the film right back to its beginning.I understand there will be a sequel of 'Jumper' out in 2013. I hope they don't spoil the fun, though it's kind of hard to see how they could introduce something genuinely new into the concept. We'll see about that. So far, eight stars, for its entertainment value and endurance. It keeps up well on repeated viewings.",Jumper
282,TomServo23,Jumper,5,19 February 2008,"Starring: Hayden Christensen, Jamie Bell, Samuel L. Jackson, Rachel Bilson, Michael Rooker, AnnaSophia Robb, Max Thieriot, and Diane Lane.The movie is about an ordinary guy who you feel sorry for at first, who learns he has power all to himself. However, he uses the power in a bad way, and faces the consequences that come his way.Not much of a review is it? Part of me doesn't want to spoil it for those who have not seen it, part of me didn't understand the movie 100%, and part me felt that that's pretty much the plot right their.Perhaps my hopes were set a little to high from not seeing a movie in ages, I just wanted to see something. So maybe instead of just letting my mind go blank and just watching it like that, maybe I expected a little to much.The director Doug Liman, is known for films that I have not seen, it feels like he was teasing us the whole time, like just giving us this movie as an appetizer, and giving us the full meal for Jumper 2, which by the end, you pretty much get the feeling their will be a sequel. In another words, I guess you can say we were given enough, but were still left hungry for more.The good things about the movie are that's it's short (Granted, to short), the action scenes are pretty good (The movie begins to pick up once Cox is fights Davey), and the Locations/photography is great.But the bad, where to start? The plot just seemed to complicated for me, and seemed to ""Jump"" all over the place. The script, is mediocre at best, there's is no real memorable quotes in this film, if you ask me. The pacing was way to fast, you didn't have enough time to really understand the character's (Poor character development). But the thing that got me the most was all the pauses in between where actor's are supposed to speak. Hard to explain, really noticeable between David and Millie when they meet for the first time. They say a few things, then there's nothing for like 10-20 seconds, and then finally the scene ends or they finally speak. It's as if they are waiting for the director to yell ""Cut"". It doesn't happen the whole film, but when it does, you want to shout ""Say Something, anything"". But it seems the actor's where reading from a blank script, even a ""Strange Weather Were Having This Time A Year"" would have been something to break the silence. But again maybe I am being a little to hard on the film.Now for the performances. It's said by everyone else that Jamie Bell stole the film. I would not go as far to say that, but he seems to be the only one in the cast having fun. You watch the movie and you can tell the he clearly is enjoying himself, and I'm sure better movie roles are in his future. But granted, Jamie is given all the good lines, and the focuses to much on his character, and not enough on anyone else's. So everyone else suffers from underdeveloped characters and dialog that they are given. Hayden, Samuel, and Diane, all household names in their own way aren't given much to do, so the movie does not do them justice.More on Hayden Christensen. What can I say? I really feel sorry for the guy because all the crap he's been dealt from people. As a fan of his, that's what brought me to seeing movie. Considering what he was given, he did alright, but the film didn't offer anything new for him. Didn't challenge him. But this is one where he doesn't show off his Abs for the camera. He needs to work with director's that say ""Okay, Hayden, I Want You To Lose Yourself, And Be One With Your Character."" And not director's that go ""Okay, Hayden Lose The Shirt, And Smile For The Camera"". The man is more than just a pretty face, something a lot of people disagree on. Not his best performance by any means, not the best actor of our generation, but again he gave another performance where he dragged you in, and makes you wonder what he will do next.Guess that's enough of a review. Overall, not bad, not good, just okay. Action movie fans probably won't be disappointed, just see the movie with an open mind.

I saw four movies, if I remember them all correctly it was Unstoppable with Denzel Washington I think. The American adaptation of horror movie The Eye with Jessica Alba. The creature feature Cloverfield, which honestly was incredible and probably the best flick of the day though much less magic upon rewatch without theater. As well Jumper which I immediately loved.It's not the greatest movie, but it is though. A 10 star rating i feel means a movie was life changing so why would I rate this movie just 2 stars shy of that? It's fast paced, but not too fast which somehow worked for it. Cast did well, Christian gets hackled for boring acting but that's just cause people have StarWars opinions.Sometimes people ARE boring. That's the character, while I didn't find it boring I could call it... I don't know maybe, soft? Overall though I liked the protagonist, and felt his character worked right in. The goorrregeous Rachel Bilson did great, and who isn't happy to see Samuel L. Jackson?It was good fun, had its flaws but that's how some movies get better ratings. Being such good fun or exciting and welcoming they make you forgive the mistakes. I didn't learn until a few times watching the movie that certain parts characters had teleported through time. That is not a spoiler, it's literally a meaningless moment, time-travel has no bearing in the film whatsoever.I just pretend it wasn't really time-travel, since it's so meaningless I often forget about it. A bit silly though to barely tease time travel in 1-2 shots of a movie that wouldn't have ever needed to happen IF THEY COULD TIME TRAVEL xD This movie is a classic for me, I rewatched it countless times and might do it again right now.Also forgot to specifically mention Jaime Bells performance, everyone loves his character. In fact I watch for Bell in coming soon movies because of how much I liked him here. If you get a chance, watch Jaime Bell in the film Chumscrubber. It's sooooo great, kinda Donnie Darko vibe but instead it's actually good.",Jumper

Like other comments, it's an interesting premise, but poorly executed. One thing in particular that is bad are the emotions. If it's love, surprise, anger, astonishment, or anything else, the actors failed to do it well. Even the great Samuel L Jackson played a rather 1 dimensional character. I was disappointed in him. The action scenes are dull and fairly predictable, the only one that is somewhat intense is a car race through the Japanese capital. The locations are nice, but a lot of it is digital. The overall story seems a bit slow and predictable, and you'll be making comments in your head the whole time about what could have been done better and how. Anyways, don't see it in the theater, it's nothing great. If anything, get it on DVD when it comes out.Overall 5.5 out of Ten",Jumper

It is a shame he doesn't seem to have more in his repertoire, but perhaps I'm being unfair.The premise of the story - that a person can jump to anywhere - is simple but surprisingly unexciting. He robs banks, but never finds himself in the showers at the Playboy mansion. He likes to stay anonymous, but suddenly appears in the middle of crowds. It just didn't ring true and even fantasy films should be believable.Jamie Bell shone and his character could have been explored to a greater extent, as could the history of the Paladins - enemies of the Jumpers.

I was surprised by how cool the effects were and how I really enjoyed the movie. Hayden could have done a better job, but on the other hand I think he did good with his immature selfish character. He grew up basically by himself and does almost everything by ""jumping"" and you really see his true self in the first scene of his adult life when he is relaxing in his room. He turns on the TV and sees a disaster happening, knows he can help by using his ""jumping"" ability, and just turns off the TV like nothing even happened and later goes off to ""jump"" in the sack with some chick in London.

289,lordofthefries-1,Just read the book. Seriously.,2,29 August 2009,"The book titled Jumper is a highly engaging, highly introspective book about a young man who has suffered a lifetime of abuse at the hands of his father before discovering at the age of nineteen that he has the ability to 'jump,' or teleport, and subsequently running away from home. The book combines the best of psychological storytelling with elements of science fiction, drawing the reader in as Davy Rice finds his way in the world with the help of Millie, a twenty-two-year-old psychology student he meets along the way. There are, of course, elements of an action story present, as seems almost inevitable in a novel about a young man with the ability to teleport, but they are in service to the overall story and character development.The movie titled Jumper, on the other hand, is a shallow, vapid tale about a much less interesting version of Davy, dumbed down and made politically correct. Gone is the actual trauma that in the book led to Davy's stunted emotional growth, leaving the Davy of the movie nothing more than a brat with little or no reason for his selfish behavior. Gone are his struggles to establish himself in New York--that which provided the meat of the story for the novel is now compressed into the first act, thrown away in favor of playing up what the filmmakers no doubt thought was the more 'exciting' portion of the story. Even this is completely botched, with all subtlety thrown out the window, and some nonsense about 'paladins' and other jumpers inserted where there was previously a much more interesting contest of wills between Davy and certain agents of the NSA. This movie is what happens when someone decides to make a movie out of a book, but doesn't bother to actually carry over any of the things that made that book work. For those who have only seen the movie without reading the book, this version of Jumper is most likely no worse than mind-numbingly boring and badly disjointed. For those who have read the books, however, the movie goes beyond dull and into the realm of the offensively bad.",Jumper
290,Taigan,A better TV series than a movie?,4,17 February 2008,"First off, I think we can all agree now that Hayden Christiensen's lackluster performance in Star Wars was not just a result of Lucas's ham-handed directing. His wooden, unbelievable performance in this movie almost tips it from poor to unwatchable. But even with that aside the movie never overcomes its fundamental flaws. Its pacing is horrendous, the exposition is confusing, and the action sequences are jumping around so much they are impossible to follow. The movie starts out well, with the boy's discovery of his abilities and learning to control them. But once Hayden and Samuel Jackson meet, things shift into another gear and leave the audience behind. We are not supposed to understand, merely be enchanted by the pretty pictures. The motivations behind Jamie Bell's character are thrown away over the shoulder and cheapen him. The function of the Paladins' weapons is unclear. (If he just jumps from place to place, how did the cable get buried in the wall that one time?) The Jumpers' fighting is clearly designed to show off the special effect rather than to win the fight. The parts where they try to space out the information (notably the truth about David's mother) fail miserably. Yet, I still found the *idea* of the movie interesting and might try reading the book it is based off of. I found myself wondering if this wouldn't have worked better as a ""Fugitive""- style TV series, rather than a movie. The we could have had information parse out to us over weeks rather than trying to cram it into a ridiculously short movie.",Jumper
291,dedalus626,hedonistic superhero,5,15 February 2008,"Jumper was entertaining, but it was difficult to make myself care about any of the characters. There's no development, so you really don't understand the motives of either the bad guys or the good guys. And what really bothered me was that the ""good guy"" is completely hedonistic. He doesn't use his powers to help people (the best scene in the movie was when he disinterestedly walks away from a television news report about people in drowning in a flood); he just travels the world and robs banks. At times, he even endangers the public by using his powers irresponsibly. Although this could have been an interesting take on the superhero story, the film doesn't do enough to turn it into that; the writers hardly seem to realize just how self-involved the hero is. It was almost enough to make me pull for Samuel L. Jackson's character if only he hadn't been so one-dimensional.

292,wuzzadaly,"Good idea, but poorly executed",6,14 February 2008,"I'm a big science fiction fan, and was very intrigued by the idea for ""Jumper"". Samuel L. Jackson always lends credibility and I was interested to see Hayden Christensen for the first time since Star Wars ( I haven't seen ""Awake"" yet). I persuaded a friend to come with me based on the special effects in the trailer. The plot goes much like this; Boy discovers he has the power to teleport himself. Boy learns to control his powers. Boy lives idyllic life of leisure and travel until he discovers that people are chasing him, and that he is caught up in a war between people who can teleport, and those who hunt them. Unfortunately, ""Jumper"" isn't much more than a geography tour. The story is well laid out, and the main character behaves in a believable way. if you've ever imagined having the power of teleportation, you will buy into this premise big time. Sadly, the movie fails to build on that premise, and action sequences aside is quite boring. My friend fell asleep! There is no chemistry whatsoever between David and Milly, and their romantic relationship is unrealistic. Jackson plays the same character he always does, Rooker is under-utilized although Jamie Bell adds some much-needed momentum when he arrives. All-in all if you want to leave your brain at home for a night, Jumper might be for you, but I would recommend waiting for the DVD.",Jumper

I rented it today and really enjoyed it! The movie is only an hour and twenty minutes. The movie never gets boring, but it needed to be much longer and explain more about the ""Jumping"". The CGI jumping scenes were really cool, the story wasn't anything completely new, but never bored me. The plot moved along at a nice pace. The acting was good, especially Samuel L Jackson, playing the bad guy.I really liked how they really went to a lot of these locations he jumps to instead of just green screen. Today i heard that they will be making a trilogy out of it. That will be good, but now its a trilogy the second one can make up for a lot of things unexplained.

I felt that the other main actors were lacking, Rachel Bilson especially was so whiny that all I wished to do was just whack her one.The script was just plain boring.

296,wdashton43,Wasted Potential...,5,3 May 2008,"It is films like Jumper that have made me tired, weary, and downright frustrated with the enigma that is Hollywood. When a film provides an interesting plot, cool special effects, and an all-star cast I automatically have high expectations, as any self-respecting movie goer should. When these films fail, as often happens, it really disappoints me. In fact, it makes me want to ""jump"" off a cliff into some jagged rocks. You catch that? I used the word ""jump"" because it ties in to the title. I knowI'm good. As I was saying, when all the right ingredients are thrown into the mix we expect something delicious, something sublime. Not something that tastes like it got pulled out of a crack addict's trashcan. Jumper, unfortunately, falls under the later.Walking into the movie theatre I was expecting Jumper to provide me with full blown, ""jump"" out of your seat action. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I couldn't resistI'm done now. Seriously though, the previews for Jumper looked pretty cool. Teleportation, lightening ray guns, and Samuel L. Jackson beating fools were merely a few of the images on the preview that sucked me in. Unfortunately, after the credits rolled, I realized I had not seen much more than what I saw on the preview.Hayden Christensen (Star Wars Episodes II and III) plays David Rice, a high school loner with no mother and drunk father. His one friend is a girl at school named Millie (Rachel Bilson of The O.C.). David has a little crush on Millie so one day he gives her a small gift to display his affection. Of course, Millie's angry boyfriend grabs the gift and, like Roger Clemmons with roid rage, throws it out into the middle of a frozen lake. David walks out onto the lake to retrieve the item and falls through (frickin' global warming). Fighting for his life under the water, he unintentionally teleports out of the water and into the local library. With his new found teleportation power to use at his will, he decides to leave his miserable home life behind. So, with everyone in town assuming he had died in the lake, he mysteriously disappears.David moves to NYC and experiments with his usual ability. In no short time he realizes he can travel anywhere in the world in a matter of seconds, even a bank vault. That's right, he's a thief. Not only that, but he doesn't use his power for good like Spiderman. He watches a live news report showing helpless people trapped in a flood. Does he save them? Nope. Even worse, he doesn't even have a cool nickname like Spiderman. He could have been Teleport Man, or Ghost Boy or something. I mean, I have a super hero name and my only super power is driving my car with my left hand.Everything is biscuits and gravy for young David. That is until Roland arrives. Roland, played by Samuel L. Jackson, is an assassin. His job is to travel the globe and kill ""Jumpers"" like David because quote ""only God should have his power."" Granted, Roland's silver hair makes him look like a larger version of Sisqo, he makes up for it by carrying a large knife.Now, at this point, I was pretty excited for the direction this film was going in. We have a hedonistic superhero with potential for good, a God-fearing assassin hunting him down, and a romantic relationship with a girl from his past. Pus, there is a back-story involving the truth about what happened to his Mother. However, despite a strong start, the film quickly runs off track.The story turns out average at best, there is no character development whatsoever, the on screen romance of Christensen and Bilson is far fetched, and a few of the scenes were so incredibly stupid it was laughable. For instance, early in the story David reunites with Millie after not seeing her for eight years. Everyone had thought him to be dead. Imagine if you thought one of your best friends had died and then they suddenly appear after 8 years. You would probably be jumping up and down, hugging and shouting in joy. Shoot, I would throw a parade with dancing and balloon animals. What does Millie do when she sees him? She walks up to him like its no big deal and says ""I saw you sitting at the table for 45 minutes. Why didn't you come over and talk to me?"" Is that what you would say to you friend who you thought was dead? How about, ""I thought you were dead!"" I guess she was playing hard to get or something.The worst part of the movie was the ending. It was truly horrible. And the disappointing part is that the story structure was perfect for a huge finale. Instead, I left the theatre feeling like I got ripped off by a blind man in a wheel chair. What unsettles me the most about this film, above all my other disappointments, is that I see the potential it could have had. A better script and that potential may have been realized, but instead I am left standing in thought like a father with a 7'0'' son who wants to quit basketball to be a horse jockey: just a perfect waste of something that could have been great.",Jumper
297,pk_pulak_kmr,"Worth watching, but too simplistic",7,9 July 2010,"Jumper is yet another film that was a box-office success despite a poor critical reception. To its credit, it is pretty well-made in parts, and is worth watching on the whole, although it's not exactly one the best films of the year.The film is essentially about a guy David, who after falling in a frozen river, saves his life by teleporting to the school library. He therefore discovers his ability to 'jump' to anywhere he wants, anytime, and uses these skills to run away from home (his dad's an alcoholic, and his mother disappeared when he was five), and successfully robs a bank, leaving 'I owe you' notes in place of all the stolen money. Soon, he grows up and lives the most luxurious and fun lifestyle I've ever seen a screen hero live. His bliss is rudely interrupted when a mysterious Roland Cox (Samuel L. Jackson) breaks into his apartment, and attacks him, thus putting him on the run. He goes back to his hometown and reconnects with childhood friend Millie. Following an attack at the Colosseum, where he takes her despite it being closed, he meets fellow Jumper Griffith, who tells him about the Paladins, a secret group dedicated to hunting down and destroying the jumpers. The rest of the film involves him fighting Roland, while losing his father and trying to protect Millie.The film suffers from an overly simplistic plot line and inconsistent pacing. After watching the movie, I wished they'd added more depth to the characters, and revealed something more about the Jumper-Paladin conflict. As for the pacing, despite an interesting start, the film slags towards the middle, and finally picks up at the climax. However, the action sequences are very well done, despite the low level of violence (most of them involve David jumping his way out of sticky situations), and the actors live up to their roles well enough. Overall, Jumper is fairly entertaining, and worth a shot, though they could have done a better job. Hopefully the sequels will have more in store for us.",Jumper

The film is quite clearly meant to be simple entertainment, something to watch while killing time when you just want to be entertained and it did that job for me.

But really - the film makers have been listening to us.In recent previous Science fiction movies, many reviewers complained that the story took too long to developed and wasted time with the back character histories getting to the meat of the movie.OK, so here they decided to move forward into the action by doing a little back story shorthand and used very abbreviated information to give us a picture of the characters motivations and histories.For some, this was too little and confused them - I appreciated that they seldom moved from action to exposition, giving a faster paced experience. For example, Davy the main character, seems shallow and self-centered, but later begins to redeem himself as his feelings for Millie deepen and he decides to risk everything to save her.I think this movie has a little of everything. A love story, cool special effects and super powers, questions of morality and faith.I felt that the Paladins, were possibly the good guys although the antagonists to the main characters protagonist. They reasonably believe the Jumpers are evil, given that they tend to rob banks and not conform to society's rules. From Paladins point of view they are doing Gods work - the Jumpers not only do evil things but by some freak of nature have abilities that they believe only God should possess.Anyway, try to ignore the reviews that dismiss this movie.

I wasn't gonna see it, but then changed my mind.In spite of the fact that they only used a few elements of the original story, it wasn't as bad as I expected. However, I think if they had stuck with the story as written, they would have had a better movie. However, in some ways, the movie did have some of the ""spirit"" of the book.In the book...there is only ONE jumper. There is no war. There is only this kid with this power, and he decides to use it to help people. The opposition is the government, which, surprise, wants to control him.There is also a sequel to the book, entitled Reflex, in which his girlfriend suddenly discovers that somehow, with all the jumps she has made with him, his power has ""rubbed off"" on her and she is able to jump as well. It comes in handy when he disappears and it appears that someone has kidnapped him.Which...by the way, is another gripe I had with the movie. In the book, he couldn't jump if he was physically connected to something. I.e., if he is handcuffed to a light pole, he can't just jump out of the cuffs.

Nothing about who was lets say the first jumper or how he gained the ability to jump wherever he pleased. I was under the impression that jumpers originated from ancient Egypt because of the movies poster at the box office, but that was a dead end. Another disappointment was the actors. Everybody was acting as if it is completely normal to see jumpers, nobody even asked them how they could do it. The movie didn't even explain if there is some special physics behind it, lets say wormholes or something (except when Samuel Jackson constructed a wormhole to follow a certain jumper). Actors didn't catch my attention either. I almost fell asleep during the flick.

The acting was fine, storyline was really mediocre, the special effects were really good, and the directing was alright. If this movie was 30 minutes longer and dug deep into the characters, also explain the beginning of the ""jumper"" rather than putting us into the story like here you go know it from here, then maybe be it could've been better. Also the other part of the movie I was wondering about was they were jumping around in the open public and no one seemed to notice that often kind of weird.",Jumper

(How many times did you see the little jumper character appear during the Superbowl?) I liked the special effects. They were pretty awesome, actually. I just wish the plot was as good. It seems the producers put a lot of money into effects and found scriptwriters at the lowest bidder. I left the movie theatre with so many questions about the characters and their motives, not to mention the origin of the Palidin company which chased down the Jumpers. When we found out that the movie was actually a derivative of a book, we immediately planned to read the book to hopefully fill in the holes.

The problem with jumper is that to many stupid things happen, to many inactions. It is just one cliché after another and you never really care about the characters.Why would a 23 year old act like some 12 year old nerdie kid? Jamie Bell is good, Samual L Jackson is not, my guess is he has to act down not to blow christensen of the screen and his haircut.... its just a bad xmen joke. Is he related to storm or something??

Did we get there when even in the movies the people who win are the good looking, rich, and supernatural ones, even though they have quite a questionable morality? While I personally enjoyed the movie, I wouldn't recommend it to those who have a weak or developing moral foundation. The 'hero' of this movie is not a role model.

I'm a fan of Doug Liman's action packed movies like Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Bourne Identity, this one was sure a stinker...

I was so hopelessly wrong No, there are a few awesome and memorable action scenes. And Jaime Bell is pure charm all the way. But it's not enough to make a good movie.It starts out slowly, promising a deep and detailed storyline, providing a list of clichés instead and horribly dull acting by Christensen and Bilson, so you start to pray silently for *something* essential and surprising to happen. When events finally start to build up, you think you are saved and that here, at least here Doug can do no wrong oh well. The culmination lasts for about a minute to be followed by a pointless final scene and credits.It feels like the movie was initially much longer, but then someone forced Liman to reduce it to 88 minutes, so he started to cut scenes out randomly. Characters disappear just like that, important scenes end before you start to get the point Damn, it was like watching ""Eragon"" again",Jumper

318,jonathanjameskelly,Read a lot of bad reviews before I saw this. I disagree with almost all of them.,7,21 February 2008,"Maybe it's because I went in to it with low expectations but I enjoyed the hell out of this movie! Is it a perfect movie? No, far from it. However I had just come off an early morning shift at work, I was tired as hell and just wanted to see a nice movie that didn't require too much thought so I could wind down. As it was a Thursday and a 3:45pm show I was the only one in the cinema! Absolute heaven, I can pretend I'm famous or something and have booked the whole place out so I can have some privacy! So I sit down with my Ben and Jerry's and the movie starts. There's a sequence that lasts maybe 15 minutes that gives some back story to the main character, David, from when he was 15 and started 'jumping'. Lovely special effects follow and David does things we'd all do if we could teleport or 'jump', rob a bank, go to exotic locations, etc. And then we're into the present day. David has a nice apartment, nice stuff, fancies a trip to London. All is going well until Sam Jackson shows up and ruins it for him. There's a bit of lovey dovey stuff and then there's plenty of frantic 'jump' escapes, some 'jump' fights and the movie ends on a relatively satisfying note.All in all it was better than I expected and exactly what I was looking for.But this movie could be so much better. It has a short running time, 88 minutes. Almost surely because of the size of the budget. It must have been astronomical as almost every scene has a 'jump' effect. Add to that the multiple locations and I'd say they could only afford 88 minutes. Because of these everything feels rushed. There is a lot more that could have been touched on. How do the Jumpers 'jump'? Do they need to have visited the place first or would just a picture do? What is physically different about them? Why do they have sworn enemies that have stayed enemies for hundreds of years? Where did the bad guys get their cool weapons? How are Jumpers made? Is it passed down through generations? But with the time constraint these questions can't be addressed. What the movie does do is go out of its way to set up a sequel. Painfully so in fact as the ending feels like the end of an act rather than the end of a movie. But this could have franchise potential. 'Jumping' is a cool power. He could be a modern superhero with the ready made sworn enemies. The effects are great. I even felt Hayden Skywalker was quite good in the part contrary to what others seem to think.If it does go to a sequel I'd like to see much more background into the whole 'jumping' thing and a good storyline. Make the running time longer and cut down on some of the action shots to stay within budget.So in conclusion Jumper is a fun, action packed, special effects heavy movie that will entertain you if you don't have too high hopes for it. It's not going to win any Oscars but that doesn't matter and it has potential for some good sequels.Recommended for days when you just want to be entertained.",Jumper
319,daydreamer1,I found the reality terribly disappointing,3,14 March 2008,"I tried to follow this movie but, I'm afraid, without success. All the way through I kept asking myself the same question - ""Why?"". Firstly, with a talent such as the ability to ""jump"" to play with why couldn't the scriptwriter have made an interesting story? Why, with such superhuman powers, didn't Hayden Christensen and Jamie Bell just kill Samuel L Jackson straight out or did they forfeit their intellect when they gained superhuman powers? Why couldn't Jamie Bell decide on which accent to adopt ranging from Coronation Street to Dallas and all stations in between in any one sentence? Why did Hayden's mother only have two choices when he reached the age of five - both of which didn't include him? Why did Hayden never lose his sack full of money even when arrested by the police and why didn't anyone even search the bag (he could have got money any time he wanted by using his powers without having to drag it around with him)? Why did I sit and watch it for the full duration?I was really looking forward to Jumper as the concept intrigued me, but, I have to say that I found the reality terribly disappointing. The act of jumping was performed far too frequently to the point of it being almost like watching the story being played out under strobe lights. To stress the power of jumping I feel it should have been portrayed as something special and not something used casually every couple of minutes.I'm afraid that this came over as nothing more than a poor cinema production of a pilot for (if it ever becomes one) a very poor TV series or a string of ""sequels"".",Jumper

Smart women are practical and not completely impervious to shocking news...no matter how bizarre. And exactly what religion were these killers? Obviously the writers and/or producers didn't want to have to deal with religious backlash from any particular group. I guess I just don't understand how these seemingly educated people could allow themselves to continue to view these beings as something evil. But then again, I did see that documentary about the Mormans in Utah trying to keep Michael Moore from speaking at a local University.

There is SO LITTLE of what makes the books great in this movie that it makes me sad and angry. The books would work very well as a screen play. Changing them so much that they ended up with this stinker of a movie is a crime. Yea, the special effects are good. But the acting was either soggy toast or over the top. The movie plot was totally devoid of everything in the book that made David a lovable protagonist. He ends up being the bratty evil twin of the David in the books. You get the feeling the director has never read the books. You KNOW the actors have not.It really is a pity because it COULD have been an amazing movie. It's actually hard to believe how bad it ended up being. I was actually having trouble believing what I was seeing was made.I would put this very close to Battlefield Earth in terms of entirely failing to do justice to the source book. And, like Battlefield Earth, even if you know nothing about the story from the book you end up leaving the theater (like my wife did) wondering why you just wasted almost 10$.",Jumper
322,GYTrekker,A COMPLETE letdown from the novel....,5,30 March 2008,"I thought this movie was mildly entertaining.... Obviously Hayden Christensen is not one of the world's most gifted actors, but he's easy on the eyes, so being a sci-fi fan anyway, I went to the movie. I enjoyed the location shots and the effects.... But then I bought the novel... HUGE difference in experience! The novel is actually intriguing, with interesting, multi- layered characters... David is a MUCH more multi-dimensional character in the novel, with character strengths and weaknesses, much like real people. In the movie he just comes across as a nerdy kid who discovers he has a unique talent, and proceeds to become a total narcissist. The book is so much more interesting than this film.... For example it's a whole lot more interesting to have the U.S. government as the antagonist as in the novel, rather than some stupid organization of religious fanatics left over from the INQUISITION, of all things!! In the novel David's relationships with his parents are heart-wrenching and complex... in this movie his dad is just an annoying lush and his mother is reduced to a cameo walk-on part for Diane Lane. In the novel Millie is not the stereotypical high school crush who grows up to be a cute young thing to dangle attractively from the hero's arm, as in most Hollywood films, including this one.... she's an intelligent, thoughtful college student whom David meets in NYC... she actively challenges him to think about his actions and his choices in life. In the movie there are Jumpers all over the world, pursued by the shadowy and ill-defined/motivated ""Paladins"".... in the original novel David is actively searching for others like him, while also trying to avoid exposure, outrun the NSA, AND find the terrorist who killed his mother....It's astonishing to me how Hollywood can either illuminate or completely bastardize a novel when transferring it to the screen... I guess it all depends on the combination of screenwriter & director... Anthony Minghella took Patricia Highsmith's excellent novel ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", and made it an even better movie. I just wish the producers of ""Jumper"" would have found someone to do the same for Stephen Gould's intriguing novel.... It's pretty obvious this screenwriter and director were only trying to set up a base for a sequel....",Jumper

He blames his actions on being a teenager, but lets be honest, the path he follows it roughly what I would do and I'm in my mid 30's. The presmise, action, and effects are all good. The place where the story falls apart is the inability for these guys to deal with pretty basic villains. I understand that they need to have some way of threatening these superpowered people, but their approach is not good. The two jumpers just teleport around and hide. Why not just jump to a military base, grab some body armour and a MK46 then jump about 20 feet from Samuel L Jackson and blast away? The bad guys are holding open your portal? No problem, plant some claymores in front of the portal and when they come through blast them into meat dust. I know, it takes too much common sense, but when dealing with people who have made a living of being able to go anywhere and do anything the idea that they would just run and hide is utterly ridiculous.",Jumper
324,tnsareddy,Good entertaining movie........I wish I can JUMP!!!!,9,19 March 2008,"I really liked this movie a lot.I was entertained from the beginning to the end.The most refreshing new thing in this movie is that though the jumper has supernatural powers,he doesn't try to be a super hero to save the world. This guy is selfish. He enjoys his life in his own way with his superpowers. ""Coffee in Paris,surfed in Maldives,took a little nap on Mt.Kilimanjaro and I stand on the top of the world"" the jumper says at the beginning of the movie.Well, the movie starts off with a young boy,David Rice, who accidentally finds that he can Teleport himself anywhere, to any part of the world. So,he starts off to lead a luxurious life robbing banks. As always, police are back of him and in addition, 'paladins' to kill him. David then meets another guy,Griffin, who is also a JUMPER. And they both fight against the paladins to make their way out.The plot is good.The director carried off the Jumper's character well. But he neglected other characters,specially Rachel Bilson.She was terrible in the movie. I wonder What the director has seen in her to cast her in a movie like this!!!There were rumors about Eminem declining the role of JUMPER. I guess the movie would have done much better at the box-office with Eminem. Anyways,Hayden Christensen also did a good job. And I think these movies should be R-Rated with more violence and action.Th character of JUMPER reminds me the character of NIGHT CRAWLER in X-2. Both are similar but a JUMPER can go off long and unlimited but night crawler's reach is limited. The VFX should have been made better in the movie.The producers would definitely like to thank the director for putting in only a few JUMP SITES for the jumpers. Otherwise, if there were more JUMP SITES, the whole crew would have to make a world tour.Waiting for a sequel to this movie. Hoping that it would include more powerful jumpers with more action.I give 9 out of 10 to this movie.",Jumper

Although there are occasional fights which go for ten minutes in the movie, The only time which has any sort of action that lasts is in the last 20 minutes of the movie.Animation wise it looks great. sound wise its clear.

The original idea from Jumper the novel was interesting, but film makers have transformed it into such a boring thriller. The main problem is that it was to SHORT. With such a plot it needs 30 minutes more. As a result, the ending came too unexpectedly. This movie has ended without reaching the climax! This leads to my questioning if the movie makers had to shorten it due to financial shortage. The actors are terrible. Samuel L. Jackson should never play villain again, or I'd have no choice other than turning down every movie he'd play, because (simply) his face doesn't suit for villain roles. Watching him in Jumper makes me feel like watching an action movie without villains! Rachel Bilson's character does nothing other than screaming and questioning, which is rather stupid while they're running and fighting! About Hayden, my friend and I both agree that he's handsome, and no more. My favorite character in Jumper is Griffin, obviously because he's the only one left. Unfortunately, he has never played a main role and ended up got hung on Chechnya. In summary I would recommend this movie for those who feel bored and wanna watch gorgeous fighting scenes.

327,majorfilmlover,"Okay, but definitely not great.",4,16 June 2008,"I loved the idea of this movie and some scenes were really fantastic. The acting was okay, but only from the secondary actors. I would divide this movie into 2 different parts  the first part and the second part.First part: You get to find out that this kid has a unique talent, which is good since his personal life seems suck in every other way. His mom left him when he was young, his dad seems like a jerk, and he's bullied in school. The ice pond incident helps to pull out of him this unique gift that he then harnesses to be everywhere he wants to be and do whatever he wants to do. Special effects are cool and you get to live vicariously through this dude, racking up infinite air miles without ever stepping on a plane.Second part: The main protagonist becomes an annoying ass. He pulls his love interest into a crappy situation and then whines about it to another jumper that wants nothing to do with him because he's, well, an annoying pain in the ass. Whatever you tell him to do, he'll do the opposite and so will his whiny girlfriend you wish he would leave in the desert. The whole mother side story is so grossly underdeveloped it makes you wonder if Diane Lane lost a bet to do this movie.

I kept hoping that the hero would, you know, do some GOOD with his abilities. The only good thing he does is save his girlfriend - noble, sure, but with all that potential, I would have been more satisfied if he'd gone and helped with the flood. In short, a barely heroic hero does not an enjoyable movie make.Side notes. Hayden Christensen is no Robert DeNiro, but he came close in ""Life As A House"".

336,kuckunniwi,Just a thought for all the parents out there,1,6 March 2011,"I'm not going to be critical of the movie in terms of the making, quality, plot, etc., mostly because it doesn't seem relevant, but also because I don't fit into its targeted audience, so it wouldn't make much sense. What I would like to leave an opinion on, however, is the message being put through to today's teenagers and youth.Characters in such films are built based on what story writers and filmmakers believe the audience will be able to relate to. They depict the general concept they have of today's youth: in this case, shallow, naive, selfish, egocentric, alienated, quick-gratification-seeking drones. Moreover, given the rate of kids and young adults who read books nowadays, movies are one of their main sources of fictional role models, and the characters whose stories they engulf are ones they (should be able to) look up at.In this case, one of the most troublesome elements I found (and I'm a guy, so I don't want to know how much all the women out there must be fuming) is the depiction of male and female characters, which perpetuates the stereotypes and roles of each sex that 21st century societies (supposedly) struggle to leave behind: The main character's ""prize girl"" is the ultimate damsel in distress: shallow, ignorant, submissive, lacking ambition and serving as a passive prize for the main character, who, throughout the whole movie, is dishonest and insensitive towards her and completely unable to show any transparency or express his emotions, treating her with a stereotypically chauvinistic disregard, as no more than an object to be attained, and when the time calls for it, protected (and nothing else).SPOILER ALERTThe worst is that this attitude is not shown to be wrong. His behaviour pushes her away from him, and when he decides to try and get her back, still failing to tell her the truth, he brings danger her way, and sets her right in the middle of the conflict with his pursuers. ""Stay away, hide, run"" is all he says to her, leaving her in the background while he battles the enemy. She gets kidnapped, waiting to be rescued, and our protagonist embarks in a fight with his only ""ally"", in a wonderful display of self-interest, lack of dialogue and misunderstanding.After rescuing the girl, our boy is happily reunited with his prize-girl, without even the timid apology the viewer may have expected for lying to her throughout the whole movie and putting her in danger's way. She accepts him back by her side, of course, without a single question or hint of doubt.As a side note, the main character's father is a drunk who pays no attention whatsoever to his son (who flees home), and his mother, who had abandoned him at age five, turns out to be an enemy force, who when sought by her son at the end of the movie, concedes him so much as a hug, gives him a head start and wishes him luck in his escape (from her...). This is the world depicted by Jumper, one where there is no friendship, no parental love, and no actual bonding or real empathy between any two characters.If the screenplay had been written by a 15-year-old with abusive parents, it would make perfect sense. But the writers are adults (just in the legal sense, it seems), writing for productions the will be viewed by millions of malleable-minded teenagers. There should be some sense of responsibility, some care put into the ideas fed to these young masses, but this is far from the case. Why depict such a self-centred, shallow, empty, individualistic world and characters? Why perpetuate and stress only the worst of our society rather than offering hope, alternatives, substances or food for the brain? Aside from the obvious scruple-lacking dollar-God that dictates Hollywood's movie-making, this seems like the result of either profoundly disturbed writers with trust issues and traumatic childhoods, or part of an agenda to feed our teenagers the idea that this is in fact the cold, cruel, hopeless world that at that age they believe it to be, so they keep on walking in circles with their heads down, bugging their parents every now and then for the money to go to the movies so they can see something they can relate to.Shameless.It's when you see things like this that you close your eyes and hope parents are doing their job, transmitting some real values and ideals to their children, and preparing them to think for themselves – and do so critically. I understand many people go to the movies just to be entertained for a couple of hours, and seek nothing else, but all the same, certain ideas are unconsciously registering in young people's brain at a very delicate age. Some of these preconceived ideas, subliminally and repeatedly planted in their minds, may fade away with time, but others may grow deep roots, condition their world view, and in some cases, stay with them for a lifetime. We're putting money, short-term profit and gratification, and passive compliance before the best interest of our children. That ought to give us something to think about...",Jumper

It's nothing that is meant to change the world of movies, and is definitely nothing if you're expecting the most realistic film ever made. This film is good, but is nowhere near as good as the trailers made it look. I thought it would be an amazing film, but I saw it, hoping that it would at least be half decent. I did get one of my wishes out of the two fulfilled.Hayden Christensen did indeed do a good job in the role, but I have seen better acting. The writing was alright, but nothing great. I have seen better from the stars, and don't expect to see too much worse I suppose, although it could get worse than this was. All in all, I'd give the acting alone a 5, 6, or 7, although I'm not 100% on what I would rate it right this second.The length wasn't bad for the film, and I didn't find myself trying to remain awake or doing something else, with the attention span that I have. That's saying something. So yeah, it wasn't dull enough to bore me at all, but like I said, could have been better.I liked it, I'd watch it again, but I wouldn't hurry to get to it, if you know what I mean.

All I can say is that the movie lacked proper action sequences such as hand to hand combat, shoot-outs and a climax. I mean you would expect this kind of movie to have terrific action sequences such as hand to hand combat but it kind of fails to do that.

Right when you fall in love with a character, or sink your teeth into a plot line, or try and figure out why this happened, BOOM, you are off to an entirely different scene and what happened before, is almost always, never mentioned again.Like I said, this was a great plot with legit actors, but it's a movie meant for the pro-high speed train addicts, the (former) Concorde fliers.

If you go in expecting the best movie ever, sure, you'll be disappointed, but if you go in with realistic expectations, you shouldn't be too disappointed. Overall, it's a good, effective film. It works. It could work better if they'd have done some things.The showdown with Samuel L. Jackson could've been better. He doesn't kill Jackson's character, but leaves him to stand on the side of a cliff. I felt this was a mistake because Jackson's character doesn't have a redemption moment where he decides to not kill all the Jumpers, so he's the same guy. Killing him is the only answer, unless you're hoping for a sequel. Since it's Jackson, a huge star that you might not get to return, kill him. If they want him back, they could do a Jumper prequel, which I would personally enjoy, if done correctly.Another person pointed it out that one big message of the film is if someone actually got a super power, they'd use it for their own personal gains. That's usually the bad guy in a super hero movie.I would certainly use super powers for my own means, but I wouldn't kill anybody without justification or hurt anybody that's innocent. I would not steal. Maybe that makes me a sucker. I would use my powers for good. If I saw someone in trouble and I could easily help, I definitely would do so. I do so now, so I certainly would if I had super powers. What one would do just varies from person to person, I think. But, this movie sparks a debate inside oneself and among people, what would you do if you had God-like powers? You don't judge a society by how it treats it's strong. You judge it by how it treats it's weakest and the innocent. The same could be said for an individual in society.",Jumper

Jackson and Diane Lane for a couple of the parts. -Nice, are they in the lead. -Actually, we thought we'd put Hayden Christensen in the lead. -...What?Or... at least that's how it SHOULD have gone...The concept of this movie might have had a chance of saving itself from Hayden's spectacularly bad acting, but alas, it was not to be so. The camera work was sub-par at best, and apparently some of Hayden's charm wore off on the screenplay writers as well, as there were more holes in the plot than were jumped through in the movie. Characters moved quickly, and inexplicably through the plot, with little more than a creative nod in their general direction. Nothing about the secret organization hunting the jumpers was ever explained to any extent, and to tell the truth, if it were explained it wouldn't have been as exciting as the movie being over. It even lacked the stereotypical action movie comedic relief.Sadly enough, with the sheer number of locations, and big names in the movie, they must have spent a bundle of this piece of crap.Seriously, don't go see this movie.",Jumper

But hey, to each his own. For me, however, I enjoyed this film simply because I love sci-fi films that toy with superhuman abilities. I have a wild imagination and I look at films as fuel for inspiration.The film starts off pretty well by comparing you (the audience) with the character David. David does something daring in the beginning of the film (as a teen) and says, ""Come on! What would you have done?"" The movie then picks up as David begins to meet Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) and Griffin. The relationship between David and Griffin is pretty similar to that of the relationship between me and my close friend. The action in this film is pretty creative. After all, with that kind of power, you would do the things these Jumpers did in the film. I just wish they took it even further since the action was left towards the end.The only downside to this film is perhaps the fact that we're left in the dark about questionable facts such as the abilities of Jumpers (what they can and can't do) and about the past...about Griffin, about Roland etc. We know little to nothing about this ""war"" between Paladins and Jumpers. We also don't know much about the thoughts of Jumpers and Paladins towards each other.I do hope that the next sequel to this film ""Reflex"" will cover most, if not all, the facts that needed to be covered.

352,magicwings,Take a deep breath.... even though you probably won't need it,6,15 February 2008,"OK, so I might get slated for calling a film about teleportation implausible, but here goes. Jumper is a film about David Rice who, while trying to impress his high-school crush Millie, falls through ice into a river and, in panic, manages to transport himself in the blink of an eye to the local library. Thinking that he can use this talent to live large, he deserts his father, his friends and everyone else in search of the high life. Basically meaning robbing banks and having lunch on top of the Sphynx.8 years later and he decides to go after his crush Millie, who after a tiny amount of persuasion agrees to travel with him to Rome, just because. Wait a second... my plausibility-sense is tingling. Without any question of his history, she agrees to travel the world with someone everyone thought was dead.Just at the right moment, Samuel L Jackson appears wearing a white wig and bearing the spine-tingling name Roland. Right. To be fair, Jackson is the only actor in the movie who shines - Hayden Christensen plays his character more wooden than... a plank of wood, and Rachel Bilson playing Millie is distinctly unabashed when she not only finds her dead friend on her doorstep but when she finds out he can teleport across the globe.So, more fights, the Sphynx, brief historical backplot about 'Jumpers' and 'Paladins' supplied by a very energetic Jamie Bell who carries the movie into more of a frenzy, which is a good thing, because there is never any real sense of danger at all. Jamie Bell speaking very fast in a Northern accent definitely adds to the excitement, but again we only get more questions and less answers.Jumper finishes very open-ended and many will feel cheated by the time the credits come up. It all seems like you've been spending 86 minutes gearing up for a final showdown... then the names roll.However, on an entertainment level it doesn't disappoint.

Why does Millie go off to Rome with David the same day they re-unite, ten years later? TOO many unanswered questions for a film of this genre. Its visually pleasing, and the film takes you to places some people only dream of. What was the point in Diane Lane's character as Haydens mother? WHY WHY WHY.

However, was quite good I thought, but thats mainly due to the fact that it was pretty short meaning it was a pacey action movie with terrible dialogue.Hayden Christensen wasn't as bad here as he was in Star Wars movies as had a fun, cheekiness to his character that was immediately likable despite his flaw filled character. However, he still hasn't turned into ""good actor"" yet as some delivery of lines were painful and I never really believed he loved Rachel Bilson's character.Speaking of The OC famed star. She was much better than Christensen, giving her character a feisty spirit with some great one-liners. There was time when she was given poor dialogue but she managed (which only she & Bell managed) to make it work. Despite some slippery occasions. Bilson was fairly solid throughout.Jamie Bell is the only actor in this who gives an almost faultless performance. The movie picks up when he is introduced and his one liners are far better than what any other cast member had to deliver. He was effectively unbelievable as who in their right mind would want to fight back against the Paladins. Despite of this, Bell pulled a great performance.The final performance I will mention is that of Mr Jackson. Basically, he sucked. He didn't even try to make the script work unlike the other characters. He basically looked bored throughout and his performance had no effort whatsoever in it, I would say it's nearing his worst performance yet.The effects in this movie were brilliant. Showing the glories of Rome to the wetness of London, the movie really broadened it's locations here and I will never forget the bus through the desert scene which is worth a ticket alone. The jumping was impressive without verging on showing off, even though the final act seemed a little bit too effect filled, as if it was trying to show off.The script, as mentioned, was dreadful. So much potential in the idea yet they couldn't bring the right dialogue to execute it. The cast despite my fairly good reviews had such trouble in using this that their were times where I felt sorry for them as they must've known what they were saying was cack.I don't understand why they did make it so short, despite it meaning it went very quickly, it meant that the scene where there could've been some character development were cut short meaning it was 4/5 lines of dialogue then a cut to an explosion or some sort of fight. There were so many Bilson/Christensen scenes that could've been vastly improved had they lengthened the running time by 20 minutes or so. However, seeing the script that might not have benefited the film at all.So, to sum up. The film has great effects and great action with a terrible script and some ropey acting, a typical blockbuster.

""Relevant moral issues"" are delved into for but a mere second before being smothered by the story's messy route and contrary ending.

The only exceptions that may not like it are those that can't get over their obsession of 'old classics', the ones that get paid to make contrasting reviews and the ones that tend to 'herd' with the first rating or opinion that they encounter... oh and not the forget the category that look for every question in the film to be answered as they lack capacity to make reasonable assumptions.9/10",Jumper

For two, his mom is a paladin and she said to him that she's going to give him a head start (so depressing and so happy in many ways). And the final reason is Sophie, his sister. There is a lot of mystery shrouding her. Could she be a jumper, a paladin who's destined to either slay or help her brother, or a normal girl caught in the crossfire? I've been skimming through the comments and I've seen words similar to this ""Main character being narcissistic"". Now, I can be just a normal fan girl and totally disagree with this, but I have mixed feelings about this. He could be a superhero like Superman: kind and stands for justice. But nooooooo, he had to be selfish. But the thing is...he really cares for Millie, otherwise if he didn't, he would leave her to die. He practically sacrificed himself to go in the apartment-by himself! Just to save Millie. Summary: This movie is awesome, just a little weird...

368,antonio_tanti,Entertaining.... and that's about it.,5,17 March 2008,"No.. this movie isn't a total failure nor is it totally pointless. There's method in the madness.... I hope.I've seen this movie 3 times now trying to find something, anything that I've missed. Something that will justify it. I liked this movie very much but I really didn't know why. There is not much to like about it. The plot is as loose as it can be, the acting isn't good, the characters are pointless and I've traveled enough and been to nearly all the film locations to not be impressed with the scenery. Once you've seen it in real life, a photo or a video never live up to the experience.So why then, do I like this movie? Why do I come back for more and watch it over and over again? The point (I Think) is this. This isn't a movie so much as it is a trailer of the movie it should have been. You sit through 80 minutes of it and finish wanting to see the finished product. I feel like i'm waiting for the announcement at any moment.... ""Finally in your local theaters.... JUMPER"" As a trailer it is awesome, you can watch it time and time again in anticipation of what is to come.By that standard I'll comment (not review) Jumper (the trailer).First. What's with the cloth covered knife that Roland (Sam L Jackson) carries with him to kill the ""abominations""? A 38 cal between the eyes would be quicker and cleaner, and wouldn't give the jumper time to whisk away into the ether, with or without the apartment.Second. The girlfriend is totally unrealistic. She wanted to travel so much but never left her home town. Never married or got pregnant. Works at a bar and her mother is healthy.... There is NO excuse to hang around. Seems that time has stood still for the whole town for 8 years. Sorry, I don't buy it.Third. There's the drunk nemesis of the protagonist. Also a total looser. Hitting on the main babe only after 8 long years of supposedly living in the same town and drinking at the same bar. Was he waiting for jumper boy to come along all that time? Oh come on!!! Fourth. The father... also affected by the lapse in the town that time forgot. Typically drinking beer and fixing up his old pickup truck. Does he die at the end? Do we really care? Nope! We care about him as much as we do for his mother. The passionate bounty hunter, secretly living a new life with a new daughter but is actually a blood lusting religious fanatical killer. Did she marry again? Is she a sinner herself, married twice or committing adultery with another man? Hmmm, we wonder.Five. And this is the big one... What a Hateful loathsome prick of a main character. Why does he rob banks and then, instead of buying anything, he steals everything else. He stole that surf board and wet suit. For the sake of the economy, BUY SOMETHING with all that hard stolen cash. I bet he stole that umbrella. And I bet he robbed the camera that he took all the photos with too. People are dying in a flood and the SOB just laughs and decides its a good time to go surfing. And what is with the little IOU notes he leaves behind? Why? Are you just stupid or retarded? I hate him at an atomic level.The griffin character is good... I liked him a lot... although I also think he's an idiot. ""Hey, heads up, i'm going to fry you with this flame thrower. Move away, 3, 2, 1 here I go."" Just grab a machine gun and blast the baddies. He can drive and jump, set up explosives, argue all the time that everyone is dead and everything is pointless. That there's a war on and he's the one fighting it and hunting the enemy down. But he can't find another bomb when the only one he has is stolen by the love-struck jumper boy. Must be all the cocaine and video games that make him jittery and are dumbing him down.Anyway... as a trailer, it's great entertainment. Just don't try to convince me it's a movie. Because it simply isn't. It's a concept, a shape of things to come. I want everyone to spend the money and watch it because I would like to see the finished product eventually. I want to be taken to this fantasy world where people can do what we all would love to do. Be absolutely free and go anywhere we want.It is the concept that makes me watch time and time again.

The main character, ""David"" was so easy to hate, what a pig! Seriously, the ""hero"" should have some redeeming qualities, like for instance, a personality. I really wanted to like this show, but I felt ripped off, and I saw it on TV! The one thing that _really_ bothers me about shows like this, is where the main character is so stupid that you actually want him to die so he can't breed. The kid knows he being hunted by a very sophisticated adversary, but in every single situation, goes out of his way to attract attention to himself. The best, and this is the spoiler, was when he goes to his girlfriend's house to prevent her from being killed by Sam Jackson. He knows Jackson's character has gadgets to kill him, but he ends up dicking around for five minutes, (""gee, I can't really tell you about myself"", it was painful) and only transports the two of them when Jackson is busting down the front door.All in all, so much promise, so horrible a film.",Jumper
370,StopPorkBills,Sequel needed,10,28 December 2010,"The movie was excellent if the audience took out some distractions such as the wooden acting of adult David, Hayden Christensen, and adult Millie, Rachel Bilson. I don't know what it is about Chrstensen but it seems as though his face has Botox when it comes to expressing himself except when he's angry. As much as I like the beauty of Rachel Bilson, I think this movie wasn't a good platform for her acting skills. However, as far as the movie, a sequel made with different lead actors would help a great deal. The other actors were more believable in their parts like Jamie Bell and Samuel Jackson, Max Thieriot, and AnnaSophia Robb. There were a lot of questions that still need to be answered for the audience, such as who funds the Paladins and who are the other Jumpers. Why is David's mother a Paladin? How do the Jumpers get their ability? Will David's step-sister be a Paladin as well? Is a full scale war possible between the Paladins and Jumpers? What other weapons do the Paladins have?

Even Hannibal is more endearing than this main character, and he EATS PEOPLE, for crying out loud.The only bright spot in this film is Jamie Bell, who delivers a fantastic, scene-stealing performance as the deranged and somewhat neurotic Griffin.

It is a funny movie which I can watch over and over again but they had to stick Kirsten Stewart in there who is rubbish but thank god she had a tiny part! I would have much rather seen Jumper: Griffins story as Jamie bell really gives the character that quirky edge which you can't help but love!

Once the main character learns of his new found abilities and the enemies that are searching for him, the entire movie devolves into a series of scenes where he always tends to stay too long because he was taking too long to explain something to somebody. The rest of the characters seem to get irked by the hero just as much as me. His love interest almost pulls herself free of this neurotic man before not being allowed to leave by the writers.

The mystifying bit is that the whole thing comes across as a first episode for a TV series, barely fleshing out the characters motivations and leaving so much room for a sequel that it could just as well have ended 20 minutes earlier or 20 minutes later. Diane Lane's character should have been edited out, except as a set-up to future storyline. Jamie Bell, as adorable and charming as he is, needs a dialect coach. I couldn't believe that Christensen's character wasn't tapping him on the shoulder and asking ""WHAT did you say?""

379,mksmith,Three reasonably good novels = One disappointing film,3,30 July 2008,"In 1992, Steven Gould published his first novel, called _Jumper,_ which was an immediate success and has remained popular since. In 2004, he published a sequel, _Reflex,_ which, like many sequels, wasn't nearly as good -- though it wasn't really bad. Then, in 2007, as the long-awaited film version was underway, Gould rewrote the story more cinematically and published it as _Jumper: Griffin's Story._ You would think at least one of those would be the basis for the movie, right? Nope. Only a few points are carried over from the page to the screen: From the first book, it's the character's name and the fact that he robs a bank. (In the book, it was done in desperation because he was too young to get a job in the big city; in the film, he does it almost as a lark, just because he can.) From the sequel comes the notion that there exists a secret society of teleport-hunters who will stop at nothing to exterminate them. (In the book, no real reason is given for their murderous crusade; in the film, it's merely attributed to ""religious fanaticism,"" with no explanation of what's ""religious"" about it.) The plot, you should excuse the expression, jumps all over the place, painting David Rice as a not very sympathetic slacker with too much money and too much time on his hands. Hayden Christensen isn't very believable, being much too old for the role, and Samuel L. Jackson as the white-haired Bad Guy is simply painful to watch. Jamie Bell is somewhat better as the rather nihilistic Brit, Griffin, taken (sort of) from the third novel. And the character of David's mother, played by Diane Lane, makes no sense at all: She's a committed teleport-killer, but she's protecting her teleport son? But she still hasn't changed her mind about the necessity of wiping them out -- so she just wishes him luck? Gimme a break. This could have been a really good film, and it apparently took three screenwriters to ruin it. Watch it (if at all) only for the SFX.",Jumper

So I was pleasantly surprised, it had some great action sequences, I thought the acting was convincing enough, Jamie Bell was especially good and it had a cool premise of 'jumping' which we had briefly previously seen in The Matrix but had not pushed the boundaries of. The problem was that it was lacking some substance and although this is difficult in a 90 minute movie, I was particularly emotionless at the end of this movie. I was beginning to get tiresome of the action sequences by the end as well, the concept of 'jumping' seemed very cool at the beginning of the movie and it was done in a very effective way but by the end it needed something extra.

A boy/man who can teleport himself to anywhere he wants, certainly sounds like a good night at the movies.Ultimately, I felt like this flick was rushed through production, maybe because the costs had ballooned, and they had to bring in new actors to star. The idea behind this movie is a promising and original one, but it fails to deliver on almost every level. The pace of the film is way to quick, and the characters never have time to develop properly. Relationship issues with both family and girlfriend should have been given more attention, and all we get is a very shallow insight.OK, the visual effects are great, and the choice of locations is genius, but we never stay in one spot long enough to really get a feel for any of them.

384,rawr_its_mary,"Somewhere Between Mediocre and Great (a little closer to the mediocre side, though...)",6,15 February 2008,"I was so excited to see Jumper, but it fell kind of short of my expectations. First of all, I thought it was kinda short - I believe they could have tacked on a total of 15 minutes or so extra throughout the movie just devoted to more character development. I was terribly disappointed over Griffin's depth. I loved Bell's acting, and I loved Griffin's character - his lines, his sarcasm, his borderline insanity, and his mysteriousness... but some of that mysteriousness was due to a lack of the writers' effort instead of the character's personality. Griffin was by far, in my opinion, the most developed character. I thought that Bilson's acting and Christiansen's acting were good - not great - but for being two of the main protagonists, their characters were severely underdeveloped. Not the actors' faults. However, back to their acting, both were good in their respective roles, and their chemistry was OK, but it, too, fell a little bit short. Samuel L. Jackson? An excellent job acting, as always, but I thought his character suffered from the same underdeveloped-neosis that all the other characters suffered from. In all honesty, though, I REALLY wasn't feeling the white hair. I was pointing this out to my friend, and I accidentally referred to Jackson as Morgan Freeman (I'm thinking of his white hair in The Bucket List and in - if I remember correctly - Evan Almighty). I really enjoyed the action - all of it - especially the car ride through Tokyo. That was really cool. The ending irritated me, but I guess they were setting the stage for a sequel (which I will go see if it comes). The plot also irritated me. If nothing else, they could have beefed it up a bit by at least explaining more about the enmity of the Paladins and the Jumpers... some kind of history along those lines would have added depth and meaning to the entire movie (besides Roland's repeated belief that only God should be able to jump around... and that's hardly an explanation. The writers could have expanded on that and sent it in about 100 directions, but they didn't. That's just laziness on their part). All in all, it was entertaining, it did have some suspenseful moments, and there were amazing action sequences. Those were really the only things that kept the movie going. The acting was mediocre to very good. Bell kept much of the movie going, and he had the perfect amount of screen time. Christiansen did a very good job portraying the ignorant, rash, inexperienced young man suddenly thrown into a life or death situation, and dragging others with him. Bilson was slightly annoying, but she did a good job for her part. The kids at the beginning, Max Theirot and AnnaSophia Robb, I thought did an excellent job. I wish that there had been a way to give them more screen time, but I think that if the flashback had gone on any longer it would have been a little too boring/redundant. Jackson is Jackson. There's nothing else to say. Those were the only noteworthy performances, though. The plot had a lot of potential, but it left me disappointed. So, in conclusion, if you have nothing better to do some night soon, and you've exhausted all the other movie options (such as Atonement or Juno), this is a good one to see. Don't put it at the very top of your list, but don't put it at the bottom either. You can probably wait until it's out on DVD.",Jumper

The teleporting from once place to another was fascinating and could have been so much better in the hands of better actors, writers, and directors.There is no doubt that Hayden Christensen is a bad actor. He is extremely wooden and emotionless. He definitely drags the movie down.

390,onelifecrisis,"Entertaining enough, but too many loose ends.",5,25 September 2008,"I've marked this as ""containing spoilers"" but I'll keep them to a minimum.This film starts with a teenage boy discovering he has the power to teleport anywhere in the world - provided he's been there before. He learns how to use his power and promptly runs away from his miserable one-parent home. And then he robs a bank.To the film's credit this is all dealt with swiftly (but quite elegantly) so that by the time the credits have finished rolling we see him eight years later (now being played by Hayden Christensen) living an ill-gotten life of luxury. It's made clear that he's not really interested in using his powers to save the world or anyone in it. Instead, he's just enjoying the good life.Next he discovers that he is not the only ""jumper"" and that ""paladins"" (religious zealots without any special powers) are out to kill all jumpers because they consider them unholy, or something like that.Samuel L. Jackson seems to be a leader of these paladins (and the only one with any dialogue at all) and you learn from him that ""only God should have this power"" ... and that's that. The paladins are evidently well trained, well armed, well funded and well informed, but you are given no explanation of where any of their money/information/instruction comes from. Are they funded by the church? Do they work with (or for) the government? Jackson seems more like a chief assassin than a CEO, so someone higher up must be calling the shots, but who? Why? None of these questions are even asked, let alone answered. What we do find out, eventually, is that this ""war"" has been going on for centuries. End of back-story.Rachel Bilson plays... a girl. She plays her part well enough, such as it is, but this is a boy film so her purpose is basically to look good. The reluctance of Christensen's character to explain things to her is dragged out further than his acting abilities can handle, and neither of them manage to get any chemistry going, but things remain within bearable limits (you won't be forced to cringe).Jamie Bell plays another jumper who becomes a sort of teacher/sidekick to Christensen. His dialogue is no better than anyone else's but he plays his part with such zest that the whole film gets lifted a notch by his presence.Now I have to say that none of the problems I've mentioned so far were really issues for me, and I enjoyed the beginning and middle of the film in spite of them. I had been shown a believable antihero, a superb and highly entertaining sidekick, a pretty girl, some bad guys, and a really cool (but brief) fight scene. The film had been well paced (though not particularly well edited) and had enough plot to stop me getting bored. The stage was set for a promising action-ending with some great special effects. I crunched my popcorn and waited patiently.Unfortunately I was disappointed. The end of the film was just a setup for a sequel. Instead of tying up existing loose ends, the film actually went out of it's way to create new ones.

The SFX are convincing and inventive, and the film uses locations really well. Bell is breath of fresh air as usual, but the leads are bland.I prefer my action movies to not bother with a plot at all if they're not going to put a decent script together, but this one tries in fits and bursts and fails miserably. The film shows many signs of post-development tinkering. Good actors show up in strangely small roles (the talented Kristen Stewart has literally 4 words the whole film). At barely 80 minutes they could have fleshed things out a bit.After watching the heavy trifecta of The Mist, Diving Bell and There Will Be Blood, i kind of enjoyed leaving my brain at the door with this one.

The plot doesn't need much summarising beyond boy discovers powers, boy uses/abuses powers, other people get angry about his power and thus try to kill him and others like him - the ""Jumpers"" vs. the ""Paladins"".The storyline is overall coherent but this is really one of the film's few merits. Apart from the gratuitous scenery (yes, he can jump anywhere he wants but in the end it just becomes boring, like the rest of it). Jackson's motives throughout the film, through somewhat understandable, remain vague and without any real emotion to them; the only real reason you ever get is that he believes that ""Only God should have this power"" and it doesn't get anymore intense than that. Jamie Bell's 'Griffin' is the only character which any real punch to him but the limp relationship and motive that should be fuelling the film, namely that of David and Milly, fails to give the film any driving force. What you have in the end is a reasonable but incredibly boring story filled with characters you only half believe in - if that.I've seen worse and more frustrating films than this, but if you're honestly looking for gripping entertainment and a sci-fi film that will thrill you then Jumper is the wrong place to be looking for it.",Jumper

The fact is the movie had no back-story into Jumping other than a quick rap up saying it happens, they hunt us run like hell boyo.

It COULD have been, but it wasn't.The movie doesn't tell you how jumping is achieved (wormholes) until maybe 70 minutes in, and even then you have to look for it to catch it. And how do people create wormholes? Well, if you read the description of the movie, you'd learn that its a genetic anomaly, but not only does this not make sense, but it's not mentioned in the movie.And how do you jump? Well, you have to have a picture of it. Or do you need a memory of it? Or do you just sorta choose where you want to go, and you're there? By the end, the best answer you'll have is ""you go where the script tells you.""The antagonist is just strung full of holes. It's some guy who wants to kill jumpers. No, wait, it's a team of people. No, it's just one. No, it's a team. OK, it's a team, but only one person on that team is really important, and the rest are just along for the ride or something. And his/their reason is about as vague as how many there are. They want to kill jumpers because they think jumpers are evil. Why are jumpers evil? Well, because they're evil. Good luck breaking it down any further than that.There is the occasional action scene, but for an idea as cool as ""jumping,"" the scenes are incredibly mundane. Punches, kicking, fire, explosions. Some sorta wire that stops people from jumping, but only if the plot allows for it. Even without plot, the action scenes could have been phenomenal.

There is absolutely no chemistry between Christensen and Rachel Bilson, and their make-up lines and implied ""happily ever after"" were wholly unrealistic.

How do you know it's a mysterious secret society? Because Sam Jackson has got silver hair of course! So it's a little bit Matrix with a little bit of the Da Vinci code thrown in for good measure. To me this seems like a case of a movie designed my committee, maybe studio pressure, who knows. But the outcome is total mediocrity, middle of the road, 5 out of 10.Hayden Christensen is OK at times, which for him could be considered a triumph. I can't help but think that when you have Jamie Bell for what looks like pretty much the whole shoot, why not cast him the lead? Christensen surely is not that much of a box office draw, the main problem is that because I found him so unlikable on screen, I really didn't care what happened to him at any point of the movie, and the final twist is so dumb and irrelevant that it adds insult to injury.On the up side the special effects are very good and it's quite short.

The acting wasn't fantastic but bearable enough to want the good guys to win and the bad guys to fail. There were times when I couldn't help but smirk a little at some of the delivery but on the whole the leads gave great performances that, at times, were a little let down by a shaky script. The script again on the whole wasn't bad but it's weaknesses lay in the one liners. They fell far short of the mysterious or intimidating mark they were settings themselves at times however I was willing to look past them. The special effects I can't really fault. They weren't nearly as 'in your face' as they could have been and that I appreciated. Perhaps had they have been put under more strain weaknesses would have been exposed however the extent to the effects didn't waver much beyond the standard wisps of particles or distorted images that resulted from the character ""jumping"". They did their job, and that was all they really needed to do. It seemed to be the whole ideology behind this film. ""We finish at 5, let's get this done and we can all go home!"". Nothing wrong with that, it still made for a good film, just nothing spectacular.Really, the only reason I can logically give this film as low as a 6 was because of the story. It was simple enough to follow and very formulated which in itself isn't a bad thing. However a lot of it seemed highly contrived. I won't go into the details of what and when as I don't wish to spoil the film for anyone it was just there were a good few events that left me questioning just how logical these characters were being. Choices were made and problems were encountered that seemed to be there simply to allow the story to progress rather than to deepen it. As such you're left with a somewhat bad taste in your mouth as a new scene begins and, despite your best efforts, you cannot justify the events of the last one to yourself. It's a popcorn movie. The kind of film you'd whack in the DVD player late one night when you've got some friends round and enjoy while it's on but leave to collect dust once it's finished. It won't go down in history as anything spectacular, but clearly it didn't expect itself to be. There was no pretence of a deep plot or particularly unique twists and as such it's very easy just to sit back and enjoy it while it lasts.

He wears a variety of ill-fitting clothes that perverted teenage girls will fully enjoy watching. (Creepy teenage boys will also like Rachel Bilson, because she's in it too.) Hmmm...

It's too bad because the premise was good and the special effects and the scenery in some of the far away places was beautiful. Too many unanswered questions and the movie breaks it's own established rules, for example jumpers can be hurt by knives but can walk in the middle of a war zone with bullets flying and not be concerned about being harmed in any way. The characters are weakly developed and the viewer is left with more questions than answers and a feeling of ""that's it?"" when the credits finally roll. It's one of those movies that seems to be thrown together with no regard to continuity, story telling, or closure.",Jumper

Yet, I was still disappointed at how awful it really was. There is absolutely no excitement to this movie. The action scenes are very bland and not entertaining in the least. The special effects look like they could have been done on a basic laptop at a very low cost. The actors looked like they could have been pulled off the street and filmed without any rehearsals. Sadly the only decent actors aren't seen throughout most of the movie. Samuel L Jackson's talents were completely wasted, and Diane Lane is in the movie for a total of about 2 minutes. The plot was very linear without any twists or turns or mystery to it.The only redeeming factors of this movie were the 2 seconds of the show, ""Family Guy,"" and there were some good shots of Egypt.

The script appeared written by 10 year olds with H.C spending a lot of his time either looking petulant and mute or at times when urgent communication was needed he'd just look around like a startled chimp!!Adding to this I found the film just sped through his life and they lost a lot of good opportunities to give some ideas of jumping from the past ala highlander and the like..and regarding the whole trapping process..what did they do before electricity????

Without giving away too much, I am going to make a prediction that sometime in the next few years, this movie will be made into a TV series. It just has that ""feel"" to it. I hope that, if they do, they get actors that can carry it off. The premise is an interesting one and it would probably be enjoyable to watch each week to see how things unfold, etc. The story line is primed for that to happen. It reminded me of the Highlander series with the Immortals and the Watchers and the ""rogue"" watchers after them. If you see the movie, you will see what I mean.

His character and organization (which were not even found in the book) felt thrown together and with no explanation. Why was he so mad at Jumpers to begin with? What had they done to him? Why does he say incredibly stupid lines that make no sense? And the main character's mom--what the heck is wrong with this character? She was in all of three scenes and yet was give a massive story arc that came to no conclusion. The camera shots seemed inexperienced and crude; a poor companion to amazing visual effects.

432,tremolobob,Doug Liman is still a genius.,6,22 February 2008,"I am a huge Doug Liman fan, and his directing genius shines through. His hands-on style produces cinematography in Jumper that exceeds any of his other movies to date. Some action scenes border on complexity that will be lost to the viewer (like extreme close-ups of action shots in Mr./Mrs. Smith), while others echo the simplicity of Bourne Identity. Every panorama and establishing shot is vast and the movie's color is brilliant, especially night shots in Hong Kong. The effects are also powerful, deliberate, and alone tell much of the story. The film does suffer a little from a weak score and minimal sound effects. Other than the amazing visuals, there is little else to thrill most action-loving, technocratic viewers.Jumper contains a very simple and short storyline. That a sequel is hoped for seems very evident by how little of the story is told. Because of that, Jumper walks a fine line between under-developing the characters versus boring the viewer with unnecessary detail. Hayden Christensen's occasionally-plastic demeanor actually works well for the David Rice character, and when given the opportunity, Christensen avoids obvious opportunities to over-act as he did in his best-known role. Rachel Bilson's character (Millie) is one that is not developed nearly enough given the amount of screen-time she shares with Christensen. While her presence adds little to the storyline, her cuteness and femininity is still welcome given that Diane Lane makes little more than a cameo appearance in the movie. Samuel Jackson's star-power is barely noticeable, but his character is not nearly interesting enough to have warranted any more time on screen.Like most other February releases, studios are hoping for a diamond in the rough that can be franchised. Whether Jumper comes close to that standard is not immediately evident. Ultimately, Jumper is worth taking the time to see on the big-screen because of the visuals alone. However, poor character development and a weak score will cause this to seem more like an introduction to a franchise that may never happen.I liked Jumper enough to buy the DVD later and will root for the sequel, but I won't be holding my breath.",Jumper

The Colosseum is something to look at while they're there, as well as the sphinx. The ending definitely was put there for a sequel, they weren't very subtle about that. I am a Christensen fan, but his acting was not his best this time, although it wasn't horrid as most are saying. Jamie Bell stole the show for sure, although his character did seem a bit odd at times. Rachel Bilson was nothing to look at really, her acting was mediocre and boring to say in the least.

All in all I was very disappointed with the plot line they decided to go with. It was weak on several levels, and I really would have expected more out of an accomplished director.

The scenes of the places Hayden Christensen's character jumps to are amazing, but apart from that I think a lot was left undeveloped. I was expecting at least another half hour in the movie when all of a sudden the film cuts to credits, it's only a little over 80 minutes long. It leaves the viewer with a feeling of like ""that's it?"", or they were thinking sequel because they set it up perfectly and right when the movie should cut to another scene, credits.

The predictable storyline depends heavily on action sequences to move forward. Sure watching the characters teleport around the world is great, but even that gets stale after a while. The characters themselves are very one dimensional: David has just discovered the dangers of being a jumper, Griffin is trying to set things right(and get revenge), and Millie is the clueless damsel in distress. Haven't we seen this before? occasional hints are given about their backgrounds, but so little information is given that instead of wondering what will happen next, you're left either frustrated or uninterested. Although this movie is obviously the first in a series, not much progress is made in terms of character arc.

The teleport effect was amazingly realistic and believable. This is like a realistic superhero movie, a regular guy find out he have the ability to teleport anywhere in the world.I'm a great fan of super hero comic book movies and I've been waiting a long time for this kind of movie, and was hoping for some spin off sequels of X-men movie and hoped it to be made realistic and more focus only on a few of the characters story and ability, but most of the spin off is not so good and not as realistic or original (except for catwoman I think it was great). I don't know why not many production studios made this kind of spin off, probably cos there's a license they have to pay to the comic studio and they don't have enough freedom to change the character or storyline and Jumper is based on a novel so maybe the producers don't have to pay too much to the writer...This movie has all the excitement and energy. It's fun to watch Hayden missuses his power, like most young people would. The character is great although I still don't understand the mother (Lane) character. Hayden plays a basically good guy but with a bad childhood that makes him kinda angry to the world and selfish (kinda like Anakin or his Life as a House character). Jackson's character is a mean-bad-ass smart motherf****r kinda like Julianne Moore in Next but uglier. Bell as an experienced jumper who is a product of the Jumper vs Paladin war.For those of you who are a fan of sci fi or realistic-super hero movie will be wanting this movie for more, I don't know why people called it lame..... but you really have to see this in a good theater.

Lets let them down on this one.(minor spoiler in next stanza).As far as the various comments I have read saying that the main character is very selfish and citing the fact that he does not respond to a news story about trapped flood victims, I believe that it is an intentional setup to make him look this way and show character development in later stories. He's not evil. He's just young and living his life the way many of in our teens and 20s would if suddenly we came into this power. (end of minor spoiler). The original story was written as a novel at least 10 years ago. Having read the books I have some guesses about which way it may go. However, I'm not 100% certain as Steven Gould (the author) reworked this story significantly. There are three books. They are Jumper, Reflex and most recently Jumper:Griffin's Story (I haven't read this last one yet it was published simultaneously with the movie).Clearly there will be sequel movies.No, its not high-art.

I didn't really go into this one with high expectations because of the reviews I read, so I guess I was pleasantly surprised. So, we know that Hayden Christanson isn't a good actor. We've known that since Starwars. I enjoyed the film in spite of him. The movie explores some interesting ideas of what people would do with no consequences...if they could just take anything and everything they wanted, go anywhere they wanted, and escape any situation they wanted to. Would they inherently become monsters, taking advantage of all those around them. Religious fanaticism is touched upon, though not explored as extensively as I would have liked. Honestly, I would have liked about another half hour to the movie. I would have liked to have seen more of the Paladins, who they are, how they became what they are. Why they feel they must hunt Jumpers. Where do they get their money to create the technology that they use.I'd have liked to have seen more of Griffen, who I found far more interesting than David or Millie. I just finished reading Jumper: Griffen's Story, and really enjoyed the book. Griffen feels like a far more complex character than David.On a side note, I read the book after I'd seen the movie...and while some things are explained (the baseball bat), I'm interested in watching the movie again to pay closer attention to his wall of sketches, to see if they match what is described in the books.All in all, a good concept and an entertaining movie that was somewhat dampened by lack of depth and some shoddy acting.",Jumper
448,yoalysd,"A great idea, but no plot.",5,2 March 2008,"In my opinion, this film has great ideas, but the plot isn't well developed.The events are casual and not causal. Everything happens because David (Hayden Christensen), the main character, was born with the ability to jump. That means that he can teleport himself to any point in the planet. The paladins (jumper hunters) chase him simply because he's a jumper. David never takes any action that triggers the main events in the movie, and that weakens the story a lot. The characters are not as attractive. Griffin (Jamie Bell), the paladin chaser, is the only character that stands by himself. His character is more interesting than any other in the movie, and that includes the main character. Another flaw is that the characters motivations aren't strong enough. For example: What motivates the paladin (Samuel L. Jackson)to chase David? That he believes only God should have that kind of power. That sound's silly to me. What I liked about the movie? Even with those flaws, the movie can be fun. The action scenes are well done. The idea of being able to appear anywhere you want just by thinking of it is dazzling. Is delightful to see the characters jumping from one place to another even when they're fighting. To me, the film is not as terrific as it could have been, but it can be entertaining.",Jumper

Realized his ability, saw it as a way out of his old self. Reinvented himself with his newfound ability. Girl loves him despite his using his ability to rob banks (and just plain having it at all). Dad is a loser and wants to know more (especially that he isn't crazy when his son just disappears). He's a ""jumper"" mom is a Paladin, left him when he was 5 ---or else kill him.

I crossed my fingers hoping he had left behind his awful portrayal of Anakin Skywalker.

456,lisa-1191,He should have passed Algebra 1,6,18 February 2008,"Good pacing - the tension was sustained once Roland confronted David the first time. The cinematography was beautiful - if anything, this made a good travelogue for people who have never made use of a passport.Good premise.But ... the flaws ...1. I agree with the majority of previous reviewers that a major flaw was the hedonism of the protagonist, David. Ones assumes that when he leaves the apartment complex with an umbrella, he is off to save the hurricane victims. But no, he went surfing. (And why did he need to leave the building anyway? Couldn't he have teleported from his living room?) I find it hard to believe that not a single person involved in pre-production brought this up with the producer.2. Apparently self-centeredness runs in the family. David had the world's worst mother. If I gave birth to a jumper or a troll or whatever, I would renounce any previous vows I had made to annihilate all jumpers, trolls, etc. And then I would stick around and raise the kid. When he visited her in the end, you'd think she would realize that he was truly ""different"", like he said. To give him a ""headstart"" means she is not very good at being either a paladin or a mother.3. Speaking of parents, at least the dad stuck around and raised David. Compared to the mom - who wanted to kill him - the worst thing the dad wanted to do was smack him around a little.4. Someone like Diane Lane would not have been married to someone like Michael Rooker in a million years. This required more willing suspension of disbelief than any of the physics.5. Exactly how was David planning to pay back all the money he stole? He had no education, no career, and little potential considering he failed high school Algebra. Come to think of it - he never graduated high school, did he? He left home when he was 15.6. The ""rolling in money"" scene - this is the most overused scene in American cinema. The trailer for 21 that preceded Jumper also involved a rolling in money scene. As did Alvin & the Chipmunks.7. What happened to Roland? Was he left to die in the Grand Canyon? (understandable - he was the antagonist) Or did David presume he would be rescued (understandable - Roland probably had a cell phone or some other sinister Paladin communication device)? If the latter, what kind of resolution do we have at the ending? Or is this a blatant rollover into an unwanted sequel? 8. When David returned home after 5 years (or was it 7?), why was the chain on the inside of his bedroom door still locked? Dad couldn't figure out how to unlock it? 9. The other Jumper, Jamie, hits David with a baseball bat in the coliseum. Why did he do that? All subsequent behavior indicated that Jamie was apathetic toward him. Why the brutal overture? 10. Jamie was the more sympathetic of the two Jumpers. His parents were murdered when he was five, and he lived in a modest hovel (as opposed to David who robbed banks and lived the life of Riley). True, he would have sacrificed Millie (and what girl in the last half century is named Millie?) to get at Roland - but come on, it's for the greater good.11. The scene in which Roland kills the South American Jumper involves a level of violent detail that is not consistent with the rest of the action in the movie. I realize we need to reveal Roland as a brutal murderer, but this scene was a bit much.12. Why is it that David returned to both his father's house and Millie's house, without any kind of weapon, knowing Roland would also show up? Come on, idiot, get a gun. Even Jamie had a super-sized ghostbuster gun. David traveled around the world with absolutely no plan or forethought ... again, as contrasted to Jamie, who had set up an elaborate mechanism to kill paladins.13. After falling through the ice at age 15, was David declared dead or not? The local bully's surprise at seeing him years later indicated that it was an established fact in the hometown that David was dead. Even though there was no body found. Did the Dad ever attempt to persuade the police that his son was still alive? 14. And did the Dad die after David left him in the hospital? Suddenly David has fond feelings for the Dad he ran away from?15. With all the banks that David robbed over the years, how come the FBI hadn't caught up to him? 16. Warning flag when deciding whether to leave the country impulsively with a guy - you haven't seen him in 5 years, at which point he was presumed dead by the rest of the town, and he hasn't bothered to explain how that happened. He also did not bother to greet you while he was in the bar, until you called his name.",Jumper

Then he realize that he has a power and try mastering it. The he fought his enemy with no super human ability at all, just high voltage stick and ropes.

It's a sci-fi action thriller.It was fast paced and entertaining, The acting was OK, with few standouts.Jamie Bell was amusing and gave the film energy.The part that makes it almost unwatchable is the camera work. I know it's the cool thing but for just once could we back the camera up a hair, hold it steady and PLEASE focus on SOMETHING? Anything? I certainly hope this fad is short lived, because I miss good action movies.I understand the idea is to make you feel like part of the action but I think it goes way too far and makes the film unwatchable.Someone needs to show Doug Liman how to shoot smooth at least some of the time.",Jumper

By the time the film finished the only thing i was thinking is why think up a great idea like this and to then make a film this bad. Don't get me wrong there are some aspects that i enjoyed, Jamie Bell is great and was the reason i did not walk out as his acting and role made the film watchable. However Samuel L Jackson and Hayden were awful, not because of their acting ability but because the script was so terrible. I was angry at the writers who made this because these are the people who just finished striking because they are going to get paid more to produced this rubbish. The film could have been so much more, so better thought out and so better finished. Oh and who keeps giving the lead girl parts, she cannot act!! stick with television, its safer!! The special effects are great, though this and Jamie Bell do little to save the film and i was not the only person who walked out saying this. I could easily go into great depths of where the film could have been improved but in all honestly it would have been easier to rewrite the whole script than to try and plug all the holes in this film. No doubt the film itself will make lots of money and the filmmakers will be happy, its just a shame the audiences in general will not.",Jumper
461,hupii3,Poor,6,16 February 2008,"Is it just me or did this title remind you of the TV-Series Heroes, 2 characters with the ability to teleport. If you think this concept on itself is pretty weak, and you need to add a whole lot more to make it interesting, then you're right. Something Jumper didn't do. Stayed with a basic storyline, that was only capable of filling 1.5 hours of film. Samuel L. Jackson... Where did you get yourself into? It's not the first time he took a role that just wasn't worthy of playing (Snakes on a Plane anyone?). When you got a CV of Star Wars and Pulp Fiction. His acting was poor, and his character didn't look real. The motives of why he did what he did didn't became clear. Did anyone by the way notice how unreal his dyed hairs looked?Hayden Christensen did a decent job in acting. That at least was, when he had to act like a normal guy. He looked confident and at the same time so unconfident, in my opinion very good in some scenes in the movie. The sounds he made in the fighting scenes on the other hand were not worth sharing. He got a lot of potential, we'll just have to wait and see if he'll ever make a really good movie fitted to his style. Some realistic dramatic role, playing a nerdy type of guy who will make it big. Also a dump concept, but we'll work on it. Rachel Bilson did decent, candy for the eye. Jamie Bell did decent, his accent made me giggle some times. The ending was terrible. Very likely to get a sequel, even though I do not recommend it.

The plot had obvious holes like the history behind Jumpers and Paladins and the significance of Diane Lane's character.

467,sass-chris,JUMPER is simply AWFUL,1,8 February 2008,"I feel obligated to report that I saw the Premiere Screening in Cairo, Egypt as part of the press hype-machine that you may have saw parts of on TV. Don't buy the hype! The film is absolutely Awful! From the opening scene of voice over dialogue which painstakingly introduces us to the ""character"", to the horrible subplots with his mother and love interest, the movie fails on every attempt to suspend disbelief or entertain.The opening shot of Christensen on the Sphynx with the voice over is something like, ""This morning I saw the sun rise over the pyramids, had breakfast in Paris, then caught some waves in Australia, all before lunch. But I wasn't always like this..."" This incredibly cliché and unoriginal way to introduce a movie and character is an appropriate introduction only because the rest of the movie is similarly cliché and uninteresting.Both Christensen and Bilson's characters are two dimensional caricatures who's delivery and acting seem like they fit more in a cartoon than a live-action film. Granted, this flaw seems like it should be pinned to the director who was apparently more interested with credible special effects than with credible performance.The writing provides the biggest problem that should have been flagged before production even began. Props and plants are used as heavily as lead, including a Rome sticker in the teenage Bilson character's locker, a snow-globe she receives, the magical age of 5 years old, and Christensen's character's mother which proves as the most idiotic of the story's lines. The dialogue is so abhorrible, it is surprising that the actors could choke out the lines believing that it was possible to deliver them genuinely.The biggest flaw of the film is that it just generally fails to convince the audience to care about anything that is going on. Scenes are full of pseudo-emotion - about ""love"", about ""anger"", about ""fear"", but NONE of it is believable and you just wish the actors would just shut up and the painful movie would end. Granted, the special effects were not bad, but the trauma from watching the rest of the film blurs my memory of any satisfaction or enjoyment from them.Unfortunately I can't express exactly how bad this movie is in writing so the only way you will fully understand would be to see it. If you do choose to waste your $10, be prepared for one of the worst films you will ever see. I recommend you to do ANYTHING with your $10 other than see this movie and revel in the fact that you aren't consumed with the feeling that you want to gouge your own eyes out.",Jumper

There are important questions unanswered and several separate story lines left unfinished and unexplained. There were some neat and funny jump scenes, but not much else that warrants attending the theater for this film.

Other businesses would be shut down and the executives jailed for perpetrating such a sham.But in the movie business, anything that separates the innocent movie fan from his hard-earned dollar is considered fair game.The first hour of the movie is tremendous.It includes action, suspense, a love interest, heroism, fantasy, and an intelligent foundation.No need for a spoiler alert here, because there is no ending.In the last 10 minutes, you learn that there will be no resolution, no climactic wrap-up.There is just an introduction of all the players for the next edition of ""Jumper"" to be released.Diane Lane and Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of themselves for being a part of something so devious and crooked.After clicking along with what appeared to be a brilliant concept, a young man's ability to ""jump"" from one spot on the globe to another in the blink of an eye, it appeared that ""Jumper"" had the potential to be something truly special.Instead, it was just the opening act for a string of movies that will require you to pay over and over again for each installment, each time promising some sort of ""resolution"" that won't be forthcoming.In the final 10 minutes of this installment, the ""Jumper"" learns that the mother who abandoned him is actually one of the ""Paladins"" who hunt the jumpers, and she tells her abandoned son that she loves him, which is why she's going to give him a head start before she comes after him.The ""hero"" then ""jumps"" with his girlfriend, who survives the attack by Jackson as the Paladin (yes, The Phantom is spoiling this larcenous rip-off on purpose), which is where the movie ends, setting up the next segment to hit theatres in the next 18 months in which Jackson, Lane, and all of the Paladins will be back, the Jumper who helped the hero will be back, the girlfriend will be back, and the plot will continue on for at least one and most likely another four installments with plenty of action but without a conclusion.While there have been other sci-fi or fantasy tales which required multiple films to tell the entire story, including ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and the first ""Lord of the Rings,"" those movies at least made a half-hearted attempt at an explanation and an ending.""Jumper"" leaves all of the major questions unanswered, such as the physics of how the jumps are possible, why the hero has the power, how the Paladins came into being, and dozens of other gaping holes in the plot that are sure to eventually be answered if you are willing to plop down the price of another ticket a few more times.While The Phantom has made no secret of his disdain for all sequels, and is not generally a movie activist, he STRONGLY recommends a boycott of this and any future editions of ""Jumper"" for its brazen, outrageous fraud against unwitting film fans who thought they were buying entrance to a legitimate and complete movie.Obviously, The Phantom grades this one a big fat ZERO out of four masks, with the strong warning NOT to waste your money unless you happen to suffer from an obsessive-compulsive disorder with addictive tendencies that would lead you to want a movie experience that requires repeated doses to satisfy what most movies provide in one sitting.",Jumper

I also wasn't to sure on the cliffhanger typed ending. I though that it was very bizarre in some areas of the movie.Nevertheless, I though that it was pretty good.

Probably he hadn't much say in the final result but I would have removed my name from the credits! And although the acting and the plot is bad, it's not what this movie makes afwul. It's the complete lack of a explanation whatsoever. Who are the people in this movie, why are they doing what they are doing, what motivates them? What is a paladin and why is he after a jumper? How do you become a jumper? etc.etc. etc. A good actionscript makes you feel for the characters, you identify with the hero in his/her struggle to overcome whatever problems he/she has. But I felt nothing, except maybe the urge to write this review and warn everybody to not go see this movie. Something I've never felt before.

Ann Arbor, MI - lived there for 25 years and never realized it was that boring. As far as entertainment value goes, it might have been worth half of the $2 I paid to get in. A good film gives you something to take home with you, to savor or discuss with companions afterwards. This one sends you home with something less than a wad of flavorless, overchewed gum that would be better left in the trash basket at the theater. Think that's too harsh?

This movie could've been another 'Lord of the Rings', so to speak! Unfortunately, it fell short.Before I pick out the bad, lets say what was good in the movie. Well Samuel L. Jackson delivered quite a performance, as expected. Hayden could've done better (although he wasn't bad at all) and I wish Rachel DID do better. Jamie, in my opinion, did quite well (better than Hayden). The effects were AWESOME and the idea itself deserves an Oscar. Now... the bad.For one thing, the movie was too short for its own good. 1h and 28min? Come ON. For such a grand idea, the movie could've easily surpassed 2hrs. The directors could've spent more time fleshing out the characters. We barely got to know David and lets not even start on Millie. There could've been much more with the incredibly ironic relationship between David and his mother. Instead, she appeared randomly in the middle of the movie and very briefly at the end. There could've been more about Griffin, another seemingly random character with no explanation.All in all, this movie had enormous potential to be something great. Close, but no cigar.

I purposely looked for a replay and have watched with interest the subtleties that really do explain how certain scenes are introduced and played out. The film only took a few of the major concepts from the 3 books. I would suggest that a person wanting a better prospective really should go back and read. David Rice is exclusive the main character in Jumper and its sequel Reflex. While Griffin O'Conner holds the spotlight and is the main character in his story.

I found myself rooting for the bad guy to kill his character.And Rachel Bilson's performance was worse than awful. I read that Bilson aspires to do feature films and is over with television. I think this performance killed any feature film career possibilities for her. I would not expect to see Rachel Bilson in any major movie in the future.

Hayden Christensen proves that his performance in Star Wars was no fluke, Jamie Bell is also right on his tail for acting prowess, with Rachel Bilson completing the acting trio. Unfortunately Samuel L Jackson is not given enough screen time or decent script to save it. The script is bad at best, the storyline half baked but written begging for a series of painful sequels, and with visuals which are on the surface quite impressive, the characters do not make you really care what happens to them; and as a result; your butt will most likely remain firmly planted well back in the depths of your seat.",Jumper

He doesn't know much about good emotion, he just goes out and takes what he needs. He didn't have a solid upbringing so it stands to reason he'd not care what he did as long as he got what he wanted.This power gave him freedom from that world that left him clueless about what is right and what is wrong. The end seemed more like a beginning to me that he was able finally to come to grips with his purpose.I think they picked the right people for the parts, it was certainly believable to me and seemed more like a preview of what is yet to come, perhaps if there is a sequel to come, more of the why's will shine through and will give a clearer definition, but this movie as is, certainly was not what many would expect but it did make a point of what happens when you just go out there and live without a care.",Jumper

The Fifth Element. Aliens. 300. All excellent.But this? I am still reeling 6 days after being stuck in the cinema for 80 minutes (I left once the credits rolled). It is astonishingly bad. Thank goodness it was a free preview pass.The premise was promising enough. A boy (Hayden Christensen, who should just give up acting) discovers in a near-death situation that he can teleport to anywhere he wants. So he grows up to become a rich globe trotter (where is the IRS when you need them), courtesy of bank vaults he can enter undetected, ""jumping"" from one end of the Earth to another, living the high life. Maybe because he was bored (I knew I was bored out of my mind by then), he goes back to his hometown to look for his teenage crush (Rachel Bilson, who is painful to watch). Interestingly, no one bats an eyelid to see him come back from the dead, the girl doesn't question where he has been, and agrees to fly across the globe with him to Rome. There he bumps into a fellow ""jumper"" (Jamie Bell, the sole glimmer in this abysmal mess), who warns him that there are ""Paladins"", lead by Samuel L. Jackson (sleepwalking through the role) who are out to get them. Right. Who ARE the ""Paladins""? Why the vehemence? No one knows. And by now, I am sure no one cares. Lots of destruction ensues as our hero tries to save the girl and beat the ""bad guys"". Oh and there is the mom (Diane Lane in a thankless bit part), a Paladin, who is conflicted about having a son who can ""jump"", and abandoned him to save him. Whatever.But the thing that clued me in as to how bad a movie I was about to sit through was the voice-over at the beginning. Note to the writers: Narration should ADD to what is on the screen, not TELL US EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING. It reminded me of annoying people in the cinema who comment on every action played out on the screen. You just want to find the remote and hit ""Mute"".The ho-hum ending points to future sequels and prequels.

The main character isn't a ""Hero"", he's just a guy with a power who uses it the way any misguided youth would. Not once in the movie, even before he discovers his powers, does he make himself out to be a courageous, heroic, archetypal figure. Yet people get upset and hurt that he's not acting heroic? The movie isn't good because he isn't acting like superman? He's a kid with a power who never had anything, how else is he supposed to act? In my opinion he does exactly what anyone in his situation would have done. ""Jumper"" leaves subtle hints about the plot that leave the viewers to decide what means what. I understand that this isn't the most attractive thing for a movie boasting action to do, since the majority of action movies reveal everything in the plot bluntly so the action can continue. This movie was too real for people to enjoy. I loved it BECAUSE of that realism, but I can understand why that wouldn't appeal to a lot of people. They want in your face stories that have an ending and no loose ends, thats what action movies are built for, or at least for a sequel. This movie had the realism I wanted, the action I enjoyed, and a story I could follow, and think about rather than have it explained to me as if I weren't paying attention. If you want a clever, real movie with a main character that breaks the mold for ""heros"" as a broken, deluded human being with a powerful gift, this is a great movie for you.

It lacks that certain smack of profundity that many people equate with great cinema; don't expect The Shawshank Redemption. But that is not to say that it doesn't have its own special quality, and deliver on it's own terms.Director Doug Liman has a subtly different take on the action movie. Fans will recognise it from The Bourne Identity and Mr and Mrs Smith. It's pacey and kinetic, but has a lightness of touch that helps it avoid the worst excesses of machine-gun editing. The cuts come thick and fast, but careful pacing and clever use of music smooth away any jolts. Exposition scenes never drag, and action set pieces clip along in a way that's both exhilarating and effortless. There are no extraneous shots or lines in the script. Everything is lean, fresh and essential.Over the course of this and the two other films I've mentioned, I've developed quite a taste for Liman's artistic agenda. I get it.

It doesn't help that Hayden Christensen plays a tongue-tied dimwit so well, mumbling his way through the interminable scene where he doesn't know what to tell his love interest, rocking on his heels to-and-fro, only to eventually run out of the time that he wastes. Having seen his performance as Anakin Skywalker, I'm afraid this is a case of good casting rather than good acting.On the other hand, Jamie Bell does a bang up job on his role. Smart, cocky, so much more alive when playing opposite Christensen. Samuel L. Jackson turns in an inferior performance. Playing a one-dimensional lumbering, determined antagonist just does not do him justice. Diane Lane's appearances are best termed cameos. Her role's contribution to the story line was only marginal. Perhaps it is a set up for a sequel. Regardless, Christensen's role, or performance, will have sunk the film and no sequel is likely.

511,forever18-now,This Movie = The Height of Narcissism,1,24 February 2008,"I don't normally ever write reviews for movies, (usually I am content with allowing others to draw their own personal opinions) but after witnessing this train wreck of a movie I felt strongly compelled to warn someoneanyone out there about this...this *insert loathsome adjective here* disaster of a movie.So to start, is jumper a bad movie? Well let's just say that about 1/3 the way through I found myself wholeheartedly rooting for the paper thin religious Zealot character played by Samuel Jackson oh and by the way I'm an Atheist-that's how bad this movie is! Really when a movie has you empathize with the stereotypical and underdeveloped 'bad guys' then you know it's complete and utter trash. The problem lies not in the movies overall concept, (which I will admit is somewhat interesting), but in its bland characters- out of the 3 'heroes' not one of them is likable in the least (and in fact the conceited main character David is almost unwatchable). Christensen's character David is just so narcissistic and self-absorbed I was dumbfounded by it all. From his first lines, ""This morning I saw the sun rise over the pyramids, had breakfast in Paris, and then caught some waves in Australia, all before lunch. But I wasn't always like this..."" to his very last, he remains nothing but an arrogant selfish prick. Also, he is a brat who lacks even an ounce of human compassion. I mean there is just so much wrong with his character and yet the movie barely seems to notice. Throughout the movie he never grows as a character, he never learns anything. Instead, he does everything for himself. Not only does David posses NO redeeming qualities, even worse,he robs banks and doesn't save innocent people from dieing (first in the Tsunami and then in Chechnya-he literally just lets some poor guy get run over by a tank- that's our hero for ya!). You really could not make his character more unlikable if you tried (well maybe if you had him murder puppies but still he is pretty close to the absolute worst).While the movie tries to get you to hate him, I couldn't bring myself to blame Jackson's character for wanting to kill Christensen, and in fact by the end of the film (I am using the term film here very loosely) I am sure most will find themselves rooting for Jackson against Christensen and his brain dead girlfriend! Throughout the movie, I saw Jackson's character as the only pathway to redemptionnamely my redemption; if he killed Christensen I would finally be allowed to leave the theater- Christensen would be dead and I would be free, everybody wins! The worst part of all of this is that the movie isn't even so bad its goodits just bad. Few movies have made me sick to my stomach but this one did- for 2 hours all it stands for is egotism and awful kindergarten acting. That said, can I say anything positive about this movie? Hmmm well the special effects were a bit above average (though they did little to make up for the fact that I had to spend time with the vapid Christensen). Please, please don't be fooled by the preview. While it looks a little like ""X-men"" it has much more in common with ""The Ugly American"" (As a side note the director either hates Americans or, more likely, is a self-absorbed SOB). There is just so much MORE wrong with this movie (Rachel Bilson, did they lobotomize you before shooting?)- Just don't see it. Take my word for it, your time and money are better spent elsewhereto say the least. I knew little about this movie before going into the theater to see itnever again.",Jumper
512,betogoode,Pretty much what I expected,3,18 February 2008,"From the hole-ridden script to the terrible acting, this movie gave me pretty much what I expected from it. Fortunately, I didn't expect much more than a way to kill about an hour and a half.Christensen's acting was about as horrible as you would expect. I think a house plant with a really nice pot could probably portray human emotions in a more realistic way. Bilson's acting was stellar in comparison, but still really really bad. There was no chemistry between them at all and every scene gave you the sense that they had never even spoken to one another prior to that particular moment. Samuel Jackson gave his pretty standard performance...nothing particularly breathtaking but far superior to everyone else in the film. There were none of his occasional flashes of absolute brilliance in this one, just more of the same. Jamie Bell gave an interesting, if a bit erratic, performance.Bad acting aside, the movie was barely better than being completely unwatchable. Christensen's character was at least somewhat realistic in how he dealt with and used his ""powers"". The plot was full of holes and poorly fleshed out motivations. The effects were nothing special, either, especially after the initial novelty wears thin. This is one of those movies that probably seemed great when it was a one page synopsis but got worse and worse as it got longer and longer. Unfortunately, what was actually a pretty decent concept failed miserably in execution.This is far from the worst movie that I've ever seen, but I won't be bothering with actually watching any part of it again, even during its inevitable late night cable onslaught 4-6 months from now. And this is coming from a guy who has seen ""The Core"" at least a dozen times simply because I was awake and it happened to be on.My advice is to wait until it comes on cable because it's not even really worth renting. You don't even have to catch it on HBO or Showtime. Just wait until it's on TNT 3 times a day and then you can watch it piecemeal while flipping during the commercials. If you come back a little late, you probably won't have missed anything that is vital to understanding the story and you can always catch that part again when its on in another couple of hours.",Jumper

We never really get to see the prick change into a good guy other than letting the bad guy live, we never get to see what happens to the bad ass, or the bad guy, or the war in general. If you'd have added an hour, add a bit more back story in the first 80 min, and Actually Finished The Movie you'd have a winner that I'd like as much as Mr. And Mrs. Smith and Edge of Tomorrow. Seriously man why would you just cut out in the middle of a movie? Are we just not doing plots anymore???",Jumper
515,ginnie-5,Not a great movie,4,3 March 2008,"Jumper is the kind of movie you would see if you wanted to waste your money. After this movie about somebody teleporting from place to place, I wanted not only my money back but two whole hours of my life back. I like the idea and they could have made a good movie with this idea, but this is not that kind of movie. I think some of the story was not very believable (do you really think people who can't teleport could catch people who can). I thought they could have done more about how jumpers came about. The acting was quite good but you would think it was the main character's first time on the big screen. This is just my opinion, for some people this may be their favorite movie ever. I think I would give it 4/10, let's hope there isn't going to be a jumper 2.By Zac Johnson",Jumper
516,camillusdelellis,Entertaining Action Movie,7,14 February 2008,"The movie's reviews have been rather mixed by both critic and audience member alike, from what I've seen. The plot seemed forced to me. I haven't read the book, but I'm guessing a lot of the character development was what was shaved, leaving the movie feeling drawn out at points to me, even though it was only 89 minutes long. The special effects were good, and the acting was decent.Lots of people have been pretty hard on Hayden Christensen. I think he's a young actor with a lot of potential for both talent and chemistry. A recent interview with Brad Pitt comes to mind when he said he wasn't overly happy with his early work because he wasn't very good in the roles, but without them, he wouldn't have grown as an actor. I think the onus of being Anakin Skywalker has put a lot of pressure and scrutiny on him that I, personally, don't think is fair or deserved. Is he a stellar actor? No, but he's getting better with each role, and to me, that's the most important part. I'm by no means saying he does a great job in this movie. He has sparks of real genius, but by far, he's ""okay."" Rachel Bilson seemed like she was trapped in another ""O.C."" episode, and Samuel L. Jackson was absolutely atrocious. I'd rather watch a 24-hour marathon of ""Snakes on a Plane"" before seeing him brutalize another character like this.Bit parts by Michael Rooker and Diane Lane seemed strained to me. Both deliver their usual competent performances, but in the scope of things, their contribution to the plot was marginal at best. Jamie (sp?) Bell was by far the standout in this film. I'm not overly familiar with his work, but he was extremely entertaining and brought some much-needed spark of upbeat into the film, likely saving it from an overall weak production.",Jumper
517,KenBuzz,"Nice concept, poor execution, awful acting",2,27 May 2012,"It was refreshing to see Hollywood actually release a movie with an original concept, but even with as much potential as this concept had, the movie itself fell short. It was boring and I failed to give a hoot about the main character. Didn't know if it was the writing or the gawd-awful acting, but then during the closing credits I saw that the lead was played by Hayden Christensen.And that explained it all.Frankly, I'm shocked that Mr. Christensen gets any work, and had I known he was the lead I probably wouldn't've invested my 90 minutes. I'm glad I did - I'd hate to have unfounded prejudices and am happy to confirm that he really DOES stink terribly as an actor.Poor acting trumps good writing, but poor acting and mediocre writing can pull even a brilliant concept down the crapper. Not recommended.",Jumper
518,kanederrickallen,Love The Concept,8,8 February 2016,"I really enjoyed this film the first time I watched it and continue to every time I've watched it since. It's a fun film and for me it was very interested all the way through. It left me wanting more but contemplating if more be done also...The acting was above acceptable and the difference character came together very well. The characters clearly stumble through a necessary emotional which in the end leads you to feel some compassion. I would suggest this film to a number of my friends but not all of them because I feel a more adventure-fantasy appreciation view is needed to completely enjoy this film. In conclusion , even though all my comments are positive. I do feel like a little bit more could of been and there is a need for imaginary improvement.",Jumper
519,kalel333,Great new franchise (hopefully),8,23 February 2008,"I really love this movie from beginning to end ! I think that David is a great character and hope that there will be more character development in the next movies,please make sequels :) . Jamie Bell is outstanding , not Oscar winning but really added a lot of bonus points to this movie. Hayden Christensen played really well i thought compared to what others say, much better then episode 3. I'll admit that the chemistry between him and the OC star was not really there but it did not make the movie suck. Samuel L Jackson...whats up with the wig??? The action in the movie is good but there isn't enough , the potential of the next movies are what I'm really looking forward to. More jumpers vs more paladins! David played by Hayden Christensen seems obviously a lot more powerful then other jumpers since he was able to teleport while being being electrocuted by 3 of those stick-thingies , and teleport half of the house with him :) (just too cool....) . I think the movies target audience is pretty clears TEENAGERS. So don't be surprised if you feel like it's high school love all over again... Btw the jacket that Hayden Christensen wears throughout the film , I need it ! It just looks perfect on him. SFX are amazing, can't tell its CGI really just awesome. I'm really excited with the potential of the Jumper movies ! This 1st one is good but you still feel it could have been so much better...and that's why I feel they need to make a second one or more. I'd recommend anyone who likes Sci-fi stuff or always wanted to have superpowers as a kid (or still does) to watch it. 8 /10 .Pros: SFX, Hayden Christen and Jamie Bell, Jumper are awesome, limitless possibilities, cool fight potentials, character development (in next movie hopefully much better) Cons: Felt like it needed to be a lot longer, the editing at the beginning of the movie is really sketchy... Did not feel right in my opinion, lacks scientific explanations (try to make it look that i could happen to me !) , history of jumpers please....But I can assure you that I'm a jumper fan now :)",Jumper
520,g_hobbs1,"Good movie, entertaining, nice eye candy",8,11 May 2008,"Now what is it with everyone who thinks that all movies should have people with guns going around shooting each other? Is that the only way we get entertained these days? There's bad people in my neighborhood, you don't see me wandering around shooting them (heck, I don't even own a gun). Relax and enjoy the show. If you don't like it, don't watch the sequel. Posting about how stupid it was just because they didn't shoot people serves no purpose. Myself, I like the idea behind the movie, who hasn't wished or dreamed that they could fly, teleport, etc? The characters did a good job in their parts, the effects were well done, and Rachel Bilson is totally hot. Could they have done some things better? Sure, but I find fault in every movie I watch (I've learned to accept that of myself and not whine about it). Personally, I'm hoping for a sequel, hope that helps you decide if you want to watch this movie or not.",Jumper
521,thor-85,My head still hurts,1,15 February 2008,"Worst direction, acting, script of the year. Gave me the same sick feeling I got after watching Battlefield Earth. I can't comment on the ending because I had to walk out 30 minutes early. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself, Christensen needs to take up community theater or anything else that keeps him out of big budget movies, and Jamie Bell needs to invest in better management because he honestly does have talent and should be steered away from scripts like these. Doug Liman better reserve a tux for the Razzies because there's no way they won't honor him with an award. Shame shame shame on everyone involved. I paid 170 Norwegian kroner for the tickets - taking into consideration the low value of the dollar - I think the studio owes me around $32.",Jumper

523,ragaskar,Big Budget B-Movie,5,6 June 2008,"I'm beginning to think Hayden Christensen can't act. Not so great in the Star Wars Prequels, not so great in Awake, not so great in Jumper. Is it entirely his fault? No, the screenwriters have handed him tiresome dialogue, clearly aching to 'sound real', but you can almost hear the typewriters tapping out these tossed off lines, in part because of the flat delivery of the actors. The only one here who shows some acting chops in this film is Samuel L. Jackson, and it's only because he's had plenty of practice: Jackson has been playing the same role ever since Pulp Fiction. Here the only notable difference is he has absurdly snow white hair.Dialogue isn't the only problem -- this hour and a half film tries to pack more plot in than it has time for, and thus has a tacked-on epilogue to clean up some plot points, almost as if it was forgotten that the . The ending is only that because it's the film directly before the credits roll: absolutely nothing is resolved. None of that is a particular surprise because the film has explained nothing, nor even hinted that there was anything to explain; instead we're treated to a short exposition of how the main character comes to find he has super powers, and then it's off to the races. Events seem to happen as a convenience for moving the plot forward; this means there's enough inconsistencies and plot holes that you spend half the movie thinking ""Why doesn't he just ...?"" (or, of course ""what's with the...?"" None of the questions are ever answered, by the way). Even the soundtrack is the dullest middle-of-the-road forgettable dreck I've heard in a long time.Here's the thing: I thought (like many others) that since the film had so much on-location shooting and an obviously large budget that it would be a fun action flick. Wrong -- in this case, even 85 million dollars, competent cinematography, and some big name actors can't make a boring story interesting. If you want to watch an interesting film about a 'normal' man thrust suddenly into a superhero role, watch Unbreakable.",Jumper
524,jef-rummens,Sooooo bad,1,21 March 2008,"I knew it was going to be a bumpy ride, but i wasn't prepared for this. It took me 3 full days to watch the whole movie. Hayden Christensen shouldn't be allowed on a set. I refuse to put acting (or any derivate of this verb) and his name in the same sentence. The guy has one facial expression. The wooden doll he ""plays"" (forgot the name, how's that for memorable)is incredibly unlikeable: it steals, it lies, it is egoistic and leaves ""real people"" to die in war zones. It only cares for the ""love interest"", a girl so moronic it actually stretches the imagination she was able to get a job as a waitress in a bar. (It came back to me: the doll was named David I think.) The only bright spot in this movie is Samuel Jackson: He doesn't even try, because he knows he's in a horrible movie.I dare you to see it in one go, without trying to jump to another theatre!",Jumper

My one suggestion is that it be re-released with a cast consisting of only alan smithys.The acting is, well, non-existent i would say - excepting friend of the box office Samuel L. It seems he has become the poster child for ill-conceived plots with a producer who decides early he needs to make some money back at least. I'd would suggest you watch it yourself, and prepare to be disappointed - if you are not then you may well be perfectly suited to watching this nonsense.As envy all those who enjoy this movie like a coma patient would hate to have a cramp in his leg.

526,chris-3340,Appalling film,1,6 March 2008,"The pacing is off. There is no build up of plot, emotion or suspense. The characters have almost no relationship with each other. The love interest is unconvincing and insipid. Hayden lacks any charm what so ever, in fact, he's almost sleazy. The supporting male character is more interesting but equally shallow. Neither Samuel Jackson can't save this train wreck of a film although there are two seconds of his unique style shining through. If this film was shot on location it was a complete waste of money. Every thing was a flash in the pan (too quick to appreciate) and noticeably touched up. It could have been filmed in a dingy basement with matte backdrops of scenery and some computer generated imagery. This film also breaks all the canonised rules about how a superpower story should unfold and disappoints because of it.",Jumper
