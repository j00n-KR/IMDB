0,TheLittleSongbird,Powerful and heartbreaking,8,15 October 2011,"Blue Valentine is not an easy film to watch and it drags at times. That said, it is very powerful and heart-breaking. Two things especially make it so. One is the script, which is full of genuine emotional credibility and never falls into the trap of being too clever. The other is the story, with the time-skipping structure proving interesting and the story itself is so well-observed. Blue Valentine is shot beautifully yet with a lot of grit, and the soundtrack is amazing, for one it is one of 2010's best soundtracks. The film is also sharply directed, and the film instead of straightforwardly tracing the rise and fall of their relationship actually contrasts the young couple's hopeful beginnings with their subsequent grinding domestic discord. Some mayn't like this approach, I found it incredibly interesting and thought it worked wonders, considering how much effort was made into making this approach credible. The performances from Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are simply wonderful, their characters are not the most sympathetic characters in the world, nor I don't think were they intended to be, but the performances themselves and the chemistry I couldn't fault. Overall, a very powerful and moving film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Blue Valentine
1,SnoopyStyle,Terrific performances,7,17 October 2014,"Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy Heller-Pereira (Michelle Williams) are a married couple. This movie jumps back and forth to show their relationship over time. They have a girl named Frankie. He works menial jobs and she works as a nurse. He's a slacker and she's the tired responsible one. They both come from dysfunctional families. She runs into Bobby Ontario at the liquor store which causes friction between the couple. It turns out that Bobby is her former boyfriend with a big secret between them.This is a great little indie about love that fades. By the end, it seems that their early flirtations are from another life. Gosling and Williams give subtle but profound performances. Most compelling is that they are about to give two slightly different versions of the same characters. The movie takes it slowly as it unravels this relationship.",Blue Valentine
2,Prismark10,Love and Marriage,5,11 November 2017,"Blue Valentine directed by Derek Cianfrance is a film about two people falling in love and then their relationship disintegrating a few years later.The film goes forward and back in time as we see Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) meet and fall in love. She is a pre med student and he is a delivery man, a high school dropout. Cindy becomes pregnant from her ex boyfriend a wrestling student who later beats up Dean but he still goes on to marry Cindy.Several years after their marriage, Dean is wearing glasses, losing his hair, maybe drinks too much and works as a painter and decorator. Cindy works as a nurse, still attractive and they have a young daughter.The marriage has lost its spark although as far as I can tell Dean still loves Cindy. Maybe it is Cindy who is bored, wants more, she met her ex in a bar which might had got her mind whirring or maybe her past has returned to haunt her as her parents has a dysfunctional marriage.This is a very adult, uncompromising film even bleak. Yet in some ways so real, maybe this is how marriages fall apart in real life.I did feel the movie was flawed, rather slow and uninvolving. It could be as we do not see their relationship in the middle as to what triggered the downward spiral. Is Dean a drunk or a bore or did Cindy never really love him but Dean was there for her when she was thinking of having an abortion?",Blue Valentine
3,claudio_carvalho,"A Simple and Heartbreaking Story, with Magnificent Screenplay, Performances and Soundtrack",8,17 September 2011,"The worker of the Steinway Moving & Storage Dean (Ryan Gosling) meets the medicine student Cindy (Michelle Williams) and falls in love with her. Cindy has a personal problem with her boyfriend and the sooner she gets married with Dean.Years later, the family man Dean has no ambitions and is satisfied with his simple life together with his wife and their daughter Frankie. Cindy works as a nurse in a medical clinic and believes that Dean has potential to be someone. They love their daughter but Cindy rejects Dean's affection; Dean invites Cindy to go to the motel expecting to rekindle their love. But their marriage has ended a long time ago.""Blue Valentine"" is a simple and heartbreaking story, with magnificent screenplay, performances and soundtrack that make the difference. The romance is developed at two periods, in the beginning and the end of the relationship of a couple that does not talk anymore to each other. Their relationship is disclosed in the present days, entwined with flashbacks of period of sweethearts. In Brazil, ""Blue Valentine"" was released in the movie theaters with the title ""Namorados para Sempre"" (""Valentine Forever""), misleading the viewers that expect a romantic comedy instead of a drama. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Namorados para Sempre"" (""Valentine Forever"")",Blue Valentine
4,kosmasp,Color me bad,10,10 January 2012,"While the movie states that it is a love story, I think it depends on your definition of ""love story"" or how far that term stretches. Let me put it this way: This ain't your typical Valentines movie. It is heavy drama and it does depict relationship(s) very harshly. And because it feels so real, you can get sucked into it.The movie got some heat over one scene (rating wise there was some problem in the USA), but if you see it in context, it does make sense. It does hurt, but it makes sense. You should also watch out for the time-line. Though it can be easily followed (hairline), but it might confuse you for a second there. Great movie with great actors!",Blue Valentine
5,classicsoncall,"""Pack your bags, baby. We're going to the future.""",8,3 December 2018,"Sad to say, but a lot of couples have been there. The conversation between Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) right after she ran into Bobby Ontario (Mike Vogel) in the liquor store was classic, with neither participant willing or able to come to grips with what was really bothering them. The entire story is so true to life it's scary, a virtual primer on how a once happily engaged couple falls into a dead end routine that ends in a shattering breakup. The flashback technique used by director Derek Cianfrance gets confusing at times, as the age difference of the characters over the time period involved doesn't always seem apparent, and I found myself more than once puzzling over when the story was taking place. But it's all brought back to the here and now in disappointingly tragic fashion for a marriage on the rocks with no chance of survival. Credit Gosling and Williams for making it work, both were commendable in their roles with Williams the more conflicted character with a wider emotional arc. First time date night couples beware, the word 'Valentine' in the title doesn't represent hearts and flowers; you'll only feel blue coming out of the picture.",Blue Valentine
6,gavin6942,Blue Valentine: Movie of the Year?,8,26 April 2011,"This is the tale of Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams), and how they have fallen in love, and eventually back out again. Through flashbacks, we learn how they met, how passionate they were, and what went wrong.This film is raw and true. This is the antidote to all the romantic comedies ever made: a true story of what happens when people fall in love, or perhaps picking up where the typical romantic comedy left off. The fact is that the romances shown in those films do not work, and this movie shows that.Both Gosling and Williams received praise for this film, with Williams getting an Oscar nomination. One could make some observations about why Williams received the nomination and not Gosling, but the fact is they were both great. Those who know Gosling from ""The Notebook"" will see a much more serious actor here. Williams has been on a steady rise ever since ""Dawson's Creek"" a decade ago. She may have stumbled here or there, but no one doubts she is capable of being in the top tier of actresses.How much is Ryan Gosling responsible for his musical ability and singing in this film? That alone deserves recognition, as actors in general do not seem to have the range they used to, with increased takes and CG backing them up. But there is no cover for talent, and Gosling shows it here. This film had scenes with up to ""fifty"" takes according to director Derek Cianfrance (an exaggeration), but it shows how serious they were about bringing out the perfect moments, especially with Frankie, the daughter character.Gosling also has to be given credit for actually helping a moving company (Steinway) for the day. The moving company is real, the employees are real, and Gosling is shown really helping a couple move. The house of the hoarder being cleaned out was real and was really cleaned out by Gosling and crew. He also actually decorated Walter's room. He really dug the grave for Megan. Again, the quest for authenticity. These are simple touches that the audience will not notice, but they subliminally add to the impact of the film and how much this reflects real life in a way few films do.The movie is rated R for ""strong graphic sexual content, language, and a beating."" This is true. I would like to take a moment to reflect on the sexual content, which truly was strong and graphic. For some reason, I was led to believe that Ryan Gosling would appear naked in this film. That is not the case. Despite Williams being fully nude repeatedly, and a sex scene that almost borders on rape, there is no male nudity in this film. So, if that is what attracted you to this film, I will advise you to keep moving on. Of course, if you are watching this for nudity in the first place, you are watching for the wrong reason -- you will get your nudity, but this is a serious, emotional picture, not ""Porkys"" or something you would catch at night on Cinemax.The film itself could have received a best picture nomination, perhaps replacing ""The Kids Are Alright"" or ""True Grit"". It really is a powerful, emotional story, with some beautiful cinematography. There is a scene with a rainbow... I was absolutely sure it was CG, because it was so perfect and the framing on that was glorious. The director insists it was just there, really in the sky and they caught it. Not CG. That blows my mind. Whoever decided to put that rainbow in the scene deserves applause, because it stands out as the most memorable moment in the film for me. And the presentation of violence intermixed with pleasure? Wow. Powerful. That is the only word that really sums it up.I am interested in how the balance of power worked for this production. Typically, the director has authority over the actors, and the producer has some level of authority over the director. But here, Gosling and Williams are executive producers... this, if I understand correctly, gives them a veto power over the director. How does that affect his ability to direct them? Based on the commentary, I get the impression that the director was able to do his job, as he was able to have the actors work harder than would typically be required.If Bobby Ontario is apparently single... what story explains the ""World's Greatest Dad"" hat? The commentary explains he was supposed to have a kid, but the kid hated the actor so much it could not be shot... but then, the question is: if there is no kid in the scene, is he still a dad? The hat says he is, but where is the kid? With its mother? This probably does not make anyone else wonder, but the strangest details always stick out for me.The DVD has a far amount of extras that any fan of the movie should appreciate. There is an audio commentary with director Derek Cianfrance and editor Jim Helton that adds a lot of behind the scenes and technical insight. There is also a making-of, deleted scenes, and ""home movies"". The film clearly stands on its own, but if you need more, this disc really delivers. Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News calls it ""the best movie of the year"", and I think he may be right.",Blue Valentine
7,lee_eisenberg,Rarely have I seen a movie...,10,6 February 2011,"...that hits you in the gut as much as Derek Cianfrance's ""Blue Valentine"". There have been some depressing movies out there, but this reaches the level of ""Mystic River"". The movie focuses on the collapse of a marriage. Years earlier, high-school dropout Dean Pereira (Ryan Gosling) and pre-med student Cindy Heller (Michelle Williams) met and struck up a relationship. In the present, Cindy is now a nurse while Dean paints houses, but their marriage is suffering. They spend the night in a hotel for one last shot at fixing things.""Blue Valentine"" pulls no punches in showing how the marriage falls apart, and how each person contributed to it. While it has some VERY ugly scenes, it's nothing gratuitous; everything that the movie shows is there for a reason. There was seriously no grounds for giving the movie an NC-17 rating, considering that there's not much that we haven't seen in other movies that deal with this topic.Anyway, you should definitely not go to see this expecting some light, romantic story. It's as far from that as can be. But I wholeheartedly recommend it.",Blue Valentine
8,moonspinner55,Scrapbook of a marriage...,6,7 January 2012,"Sneaky truths and verbal sucker-punches permeate this mostly brittle, sometimes sensitive and stylish depiction of a marriage between a charming ne'er-do-well who gets his first real job moving furniture and a troubled young woman who wants to study medicine. The screenplay (co-written by the director, Derek Cianfrance, with Joey Curtis and Cami Delavigne) aims to give us a past-and-present examination of how this couple met and where life eventually took them, but their early days of courtship is more interesting than the present-day our-marriage-is-dissolving melodrama (which doesn't have enough meat on its bones). A great deal of the picture's impact depends on the performances of Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams (both executive producers), and neither star disappoints. Gosling, who goes through an amusing visual transformation, falls back a little bit on his devilish good looks, yet he's a sly actor and he invests this mercurial role with heart. The middle portion of the movie (where the couple checks into a theme-motel) is suitably glum but doesn't give us our bearings, so that the emotional explosion which follows has an erratic tone--half-funny, half-pathetic. Glimmers of the film have undeniable power, and the bizarre, spiky music score by Grizzly Bear is a perfect companion-piece to the material, but more attention to the conversations the principal characters have (and the emotions they express) might have tightened up the narrative. **1/2 from ****",Blue Valentine
9,edwagreen,Blue Valentine-Where Love Has Gone? **,4,2 February 2011,"""Blue Valentine"" remains an enigma to me because the flashbacks here are confusing. You reach a point where you don't even realize that it's a flashback and this is a major problem with this film.Michelle Williams gives an Oscar calibrated performance. Of course, on Oscar night, she will not be called out as the winner. It is only in the doctor's office and beyond that that she shows any real depth in her performance. Gosling, as the man from the broken home, without ambition and who saw high school as not being for him, is wonderful here. He gives an emotionally draining performance and you really feel for him. Perhaps, with guidance and an incentive to achieve, he could have made it. Am very much surprised that he wasn't nominated along with Williams.An appropriate title for this film could also have been Where Love Has Gone. In the case, it evaporated. The Williams character had meaning to her life; whereas Gosling was going nowhere.The film's ending gives you an empty feeling. When you leave the theater, you feel as life you have been cheated out of life.",Blue Valentine
10,michaelRokeefe,Even good love can go bad.,8,31 October 2012,"This movie came highly recommended albeit depressing as hell. If you are not feeling down at the beginning of this drama, you will be by the end credits. Interesting, but seeming a bit disjointed through the use of flashbacks of a couple once madly in love of one another. Cindy(Michelle Williams)is driven by her job as a nurse at a medical clinic; while Dean(Ryan Gosling),an educational dropout and hopeless romantic, wallows in depression and his own emotional loneliness. Cindy has become bored and very disenchanted with her sexless and mundane married existence. Their small daughter Frankie(Faith Wadyka)becomes a pawn in the muddled once happy union. A trial of hearkening back the golden days fails miserably; all hopes of rekindled romance has already died. Also in the cast: John Doman, Carey Westbrook, Mike Vogel and Jan Jones. The myriad of flashbacks are held together with a soundtrack featuring Pat Benatar, Grizzly Bear, The Platters and a song that made the whole movie worthwhile... ""You and Me"" by Penny & The Quarters. Give this movie a chance even if your own mental health may be victimized.",Blue Valentine
11,preppy-3,Painful but powerful,8,15 April 2012,"This movie chronicles the breakup of a marriage between Cindy (Michelle Williams) and Dean (Ryan Gosling). It isn't done in linear fashion. It starts with their marriage falling apart with flashbacks to how they met, romanced and fell in love.Depressing and bleak but powerful. The script was supposedly improvised but it works--Dean and Cindy act and talk exactly like real people would. The film is pretty quiet which works because when Dean explodes at the end it's shocking. Never dull but hard to watch. Williams (understandably) was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance. She really has to lose it a few times and it looks far too real. Gosling's role isn't as showy--he plays a laid-back easy-going guy but he's still great. Great direction too and a perfect soundtrack. One problem with me is we see Cindy's ex-boyfriend Bob (Mike Vogel). He's tall, handsome and loves Cindy...but she dumps him for Dean. Seriously, more than once I wondered why? But the acting from Williams and Gosling is so good that I still cared for both characters.This originally got an NC-17 for a graphic oral sex scene. I can actually see why it was given that but it was (wisely) lowered to an R on appeal. Sure it's explicit but this movie is for adults, not kids.",Blue Valentine
12,CinemaSerf,Can't help loving for hating...,6,19 April 2020,"A really rather dreary depiction of two young people from pretty dysfunctional backgrounds who get together - with her baby from another relationship - and struggle through life. Ryan Gosling is ""Dean"" a working class man quite content to make his way as a handy man/painter; Michelle Williams ""Cindy"" a nurse who has (slightly) greater aspirations for both of them, and her little girl. The story is delivered in threads that try to reconcile their separate, rather depressing, routes to their current predicaments alongside their present issues. Certainly there was love, once, in their relationship but that has long been supplanted by resentment, frustration and even some jealousy before it all culminates with a rather disastrous ""romantic"" night in an hotel. The relentless inevitability of the story is writ large from the start, and although the film is well put together, it cannot elevate it from the realms of a rather drab, angry melodrama.",Blue Valentine
13,dbborroughs,Not quite great,6,9 January 2011,"It's a time tripping film about the end and the beginning of a relationship.A favorite at Cannes and other film festivals, the film is probably best known for the battle for its rating. Originally rated NC17 because of its sex scenes the film was re-rated R. (the scenes are not gratuitous) Well reviewed, with lots of Inde cred, the film is good, but I don't know why it's attracting all of the attention it has. Yes it's got several great performances, but in my mind the film is dramatically flawed. The concert of seeing only the beginning and the end but not the middle doesn't work. The problem is that too much as changed, particularly with the Ryan Gosling character that he seems to have been ported in from another movie. How did they get there?I don't know.Actually the film doesn't really know what to do with the Gosling character at all. In the early scenes he's a sweet but not not too bight guy. Then in the later scenes he's a gruff nasty guy as aimless as before but with a violent streak. Where did it come from? Short of one early scene- somewhere around when he climbs the fence- there is no indication of the character change. To me the film is all about Michelle Williams character and anything else only exists to help her arc. Since the Gosling Character as written in the early scenes would allow for it, they chopped the middle of the story out and changed him to what suited those purposes.It doesn't really work and it reminded me more of the mumblecore inde films that are popular for a a brief instant before fizzling. In all honesty had the Weinsteins not been pushing this, nor had it not had the rating controversy this film would have rolled over and sunk from view.Not bad, but it wasn't worth the time I put into it.",Blue Valentine
14,writers_reign,Two On A Match,7,17 January 2011,"This is a beautifully acted film but I wish the director - and given that Gosling and Williams are credited as co-producers they presumably had a voice, too - had not found it necessary to telegraph the denouement by having Gosling perform the song 'You Always Hurt The One You Love'. Apart from anything else the song, by Doris Fisher and Allan Roberts, was written in 1944 or 66 years ago whichever is the greater and it's unlikely in the extreme that the Gosling character would even have heard of it let alone know it by heart, but that to one side the film is too good to require this kind of crude signposting. Both leads are up to snuff but Michelle Williams is exceptional and I for one will not begrudge her any award she manages to win.",Blue Valentine
15,grantss,Good but not great,6,16 February 2017,"Good, but not great, movie. Reasonably moving portrayal of a marriage on the rocks. However, overly drawn out, and the marriage break-down hardly seems surprising, considering their characters and how they got together in the first place. You don't sympathise with the couple (I was actually glad for Michelle Williams' character in the end, that she was looking to escape it). It would have been a lot more impactful if they genuinely loved each other all along, and one of them (Ryan Gosling's character) was not so loathsome.Good performances from Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling. Williams deserved her Oscar nomination.",Blue Valentine
16,george.schmidt,Scenes from a marriage; Gosling & Williams give career high turns in this all-too real depiction of love & its pitfalls,8,22 February 2011,"BLUE VALENTINE (2010) *** Ryan Gosling, Michelle Williams, Faith Wladyka, John Doman, Mike Vogel, Marshall Johnson, Jen Jones, Ben Shenkman. Scenes from a marriage – pre & post break up – of a six year relationship and the all-too-real mélange with excellent top-of-their-game-performances by the leads – Gosling's goofy yet endearing man/child whose complacency only stymies the loving yet guarded and quite-frankly tired Williams – make an indelible impression. As does rookie filmmaker Derek Cianfrance, who has some fine moments depicted on screen particularly for me the cringe-inducing brew haha at Williams' workplace lingering a moment too long and for me, Gosling's impromptu make over of a senior citizen's new rest home environs – endears the audience even though his meet-cute with Williams in the simple fact that she never witnesses this (!)",Blue Valentine
17,evanston_dad,Move Aside George and Martha,8,17 February 2011,"Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams give two of the best and most heartbreaking performances of the year in this sad, sad story about a marriage's dissolution.They play a husband and wife who find that they're not able to cope with the boredom and disappointments of life after the initial flush of lust and passion have melted away. She realizes too late that her domineering dad might have been right and that she married beneath her in order to escape an oppressive home; he turns to alcohol and petulant behavior as a way of tuning out the knowledge that he's a failure in the eyes of his wife. As the movie opens, we sense that these two have been having problems for a long time; over the course of the film, we witness the actual disintegration, beginning with a painfully awkward night away at a sleazy sex hotel during which they try to rekindle nonexistent passion, then later at the wife's workplace, where the anger and resentment boiling under the surface finally erupts until things are said and done that can never be taken back.One of my biggest pet peeves about movies right now is their apparent inability to show examples of marriages that are both realistic and positive. As a happily married man with a terrific life partner, I'm sick and tired of seeing marriages portrayed as either punishing life torture or unattainable fairy tales with nothing in between (I can think of only one film released this year -- ""The Kids Are All Right"" --that bucked the trend). So I was pleased that ""Blue Valentine,"" though it is about a miserable union, managed to avoid suggesting that ALL marriages must end the way the one in this film does. I'm not sure how it does it, because you certainly don't see any other positive examples in the film, but it somehow suggests that the problems these two face in their marriage are a result of their limitations and choices, and are not necessarily inherent to the institution of marriage itself.Gosling and Williams are amazing, both creating complex characters that are impossible to categorize. They remind me of the younger and edgier Hollywood that emerged during the late 60s and flourished throughout the 70s -- the Robert De Niros and Jand Fondas and Faye Dunaways and Dustin Hoffmans -- who brought a new style to screen acting that made many of those who came before seem antiquated and inauthentic.Grade: A",Blue Valentine
18,ferguson-6,A Slow Dissolve,7,12 January 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. OK, so I was extremely surprised to be the only male in a theater with 30 plus viewers. I had not once previously thought of this as a chick flick. In fact, it is quite a weighty relationship expose' and that explains the lack of present men. What is surprising is that while the film is about the ever-so-slow crumbling of a marriage, there is no blame placed at the feet of any one person, as is so often the case in Hollywood.You might have already guessed that this is no upbeat, loosie-goosie rom-com. Rather, it is a bleak look at a marriage that starts with good intentions and fades into misery. On the plus, we witness an acting clinic by two of today's absolute best ... Ryan Gosling as Dean and Michelle Williams as Cindy. Dean is quite the oddball romantic as he strums his ukulele and quivers ""You Always Hurt the Ones You Love"" in a bit of foreshadowing. Cindy, on the other hand, is a bit more ambitious and has dreams of medical school.The two meet by happenstance in the hallway of a nursing home when Cindy is visiting her grandmother. Immediately, there are sparks and after Cindy's macho boyfriend proves his true rotten self to her, she becomes more enamored with Dean. When an unexpected pregnancy occurs, Dean is pretty quick to stand up for Cindy and they set off to build a life together.Flash forward 6 years and Dean has changed very little, while Cindy just seems totally beaten down. They both cherish their precious daughter Frankie (played by newcomer Faith Wladyka) but their relationship is nowhere, gone, kaput. Even an attempted one-night getaway to a themed hotel doesn't provide the relief they need. Instead, it's the final straw. When Cindy repeats ""I'm done"" ... we don't doubt her at all.Director and co-writer Derek Cianfrance does a tremendous job with the details and creating the personalities of these two people. Every relationship requires work and failure can be predicted when one gives up and the other pretends all is fine. This one probably won't save any marriages, but it is worth seeing just to watch Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams in action.",Blue Valentine
19,gradyharp,Autopsy of a Disintegrated Relationship,9,12 May 2011,"Nonlinear storytelling, whether in a novel or a film, challenges the reader/viewer with fragments of story scattered across time and coincidences in a way that can create disorientation: the payback is that this technique of relating a story allows an intimate examination of not only the characters of the tale but also an opportunity to turn the events inward, perhaps reviving memories, piecing together reasons for the present and the journey taken simultaneously with the development of the story. Director Derek Cianfrance (a young writer, cinematographer and director of remarkable skill) worked with Cami Delavigne and Joey Curtis to develop this examination of a dismembering relationship that probably should have never begun. And while the story per se takes place in a 24 hour period, it exposes all the cracks and interstices that have created the breaking point in their marriage by flashbacks that often seem to flow with the story at hand. Dean Pereira (Ryan Gosling) is a house painter whose motivation to work is to be married to Cindy Heller Pereira (Michelle Williams), an ultrasound technician for Dr. Feinberg (Ben Shenkman), and their daughter Frankie (Faith Waldyka). Dean was a high school dropout without a stable family history and therefore not interested in marriage or family: Cindy's family was also dysfunctional but she had a closeness to her grandmother who encouraged her dreams of becoming a doctor. Dean meets Cindy and his dreams change - he wants to to anything to be with her. Cindy's motivations altered when she became pregnant, not knowing whether the father was Dean or her other passionate flame Bobby (Mike Vogel). Dean is supportive and loves Cindy to the point that despite the paternity question he marries Cindy. With that much of a past given to us in snippets we begin the story on a routine day- Dean has grown scruffy and needs a drink to get his day going and would rather play with Frankie than work at his low paying job, while Cindy runs the motor that keeps the home afloat, dashing off to practice her craft. Two incidents occur: Cindy encounters Bobby at a liquor store and a flame simmers while Dean leaves a gate open a home that leads to the loss of heir pet animal. Both are tense and Dean makes a reservation to spend the night in a motel love nest - not Cindy's idea of romance. How the two make it through that night away form home and the altered 'home' they return to the next morning is the meat of the story. Both Ryan Gosling and Cindy Williams give informed and intuitive performances, creating characters out of these two people to whom we can relate and care about. The couple they portray is fragile and the manner in which each actor reveals the varying view of the other pulses with passion. The side stories that arise out of their past - especially the manner in which each of these two disparate characters relate to senile people restricted to extended care facilities - are models of fine writing married to fine acting. This is a dark movie and the cinematographer and director quite suggestively underline the title by shooting the night at the motel business in a cold blue light. It may not be a love story that the term valentine suggests, but it is a superb examination of how relationships can dismember with time. Grady Harp",Blue Valentine
20,zetes,"Very good in a lot of ways, but I feel 100% of my sympathy was with only one side of the equation",8,30 January 2011,"Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams play a young married couple whose relationship is starting to dissolve. The film quietly observes the dissolution, and soon flashback sequences are introduced showing their first meetings. It's an observant film, and honestly moving at times, but I have one huge problem with it that prevents me from calling it great: Gosling's character is at fault for 100% of the terribleness of their marriage. He's a jerk, and, in the present-day sequences, you just want to see poor Michelle Williams get away from this man. If you watch the film close enough, though, you'll see that the seeds of his prickishness existed in the flashback sequences, as well. Yes, Gosling does some very kind things for people, but when you observe his behavior toward Williams when they first start meeting, you'll see he's very controlling and manipulative. When you see the present-day sequences, he's just terrible with this crap. I don't blame Williams for not noticing his bad qualities early on - she's in a very vulnerable position when they first meet, just having been treated like complete garbage by her jock boyfriend. Gosling is most definitely charming. The thing is, I get the impression the filmmakers wanted our sympathies to be evenly divided between the two people, and that this break-up is a great tragedy instead of the triumph it should be for Michelle Williams. So I just can't buy into their premise in the end. That hurts the film a lot for me. However, it's undeniable how beautifully these characters were written. The film is also beautifully directed. Those who feel that hand-held cinematography can't be used to good effect need to see this one. It's incredibly intimate. And of course Michelle Williams. She's outrageously good. Gosling I wasn't as enamored with. To me, he comes off a little actorly, not unlike Christian Bale's overwrought performance in The Fighter. Too bad, because I really loved him in Half Nelson and was hoping he'd be on even footing with Williams.",Blue Valentine
21,siderite,Slow paced flaying of a relationship,8,2 June 2015,"The film is a merry-go-round between the start of a relationship in which the beautiful smart girl falls in love with the handsome rascal and the end of it, where life as a married couple and parents of a little kid has lost the magic induced by romance. The actors do a great job, the writing and directing is raw and emotionally scarring, by all accounts this should be a great film.However, it is not completely so. The pace is slow and it takes two hours to expose an otherwise simple story. Characters are not that consistent, starting as certain types of people and turning out completely different, without a trauma or clearly defined pressure to do so. In the end the film has to move from the ""then"" and ""now"" versions of the people, because this remains the only way to tell the story.In absence of the real story of their marriage, not just the beginning and the end, I cannot really call this a great achievement, but the film was good and it makes one think.

23,blanbrn,Raw and painful love drama that proves love and relationships are tough and complex.,7,22 May 2011,"Seen plenty of love movies and romantic dramas and all of them show that love and life is hard and complex full of anger and sometimes sorrow. And this film ""Blue Valentine"" told in mostly a flashback form captures those themes just fine. It's on top with the fine and heart and soul performances from the two leads Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling.All thru the film it's blended with past moments of love then it looks at the present state of the relationship that shows the whole picture of one Dean(Gosling) and Cindy(Williams). This is one married couple who have had their ups and downs as time, life, and work has grown them apart. Stuck in between them is one little beautiful daughter. This marriage is intense with passion and love and it's blended too with true complex doubts and strong heartfelt decisions of pain and loss.""Blue Valentine"" is one film that blends the good times and bad times of love and relationship together. It proves even though love is powerful it hurts and relationships are complex, in the end sometimes it's just best to let go.",Blue Valentine
24,lasttimeisaw,Blue Valentine,7,29 April 2011,"This melancholiac drama starts from a similar premise of a missing dog, unlike in WENDY AND LUCY (2008), instead of looking for her dog, Michelle Williams is unenthusiastically to make her last effort to rescue her almost-collapsing marriage with Ryan Gosling, this time, what is missing here is her flickering affection to him, which once literally existed. Close-up shots, the ochre-mustard-indigo palette, rookie director Derek Cianfrance upgrades his documentary backdrops and confidently spreads into relationship-kills-the- energy realm with an incisive assessment, the aspiration to stick/split polarity between the weary couple throbbingly causes anguish not only to the characters but also to the audience. The incessant before/after marriage texture turns out well operated, yet all the inconsequential conversations saps all my initial exuberant verve. In this case, I would rather prefer 500 DAYS OF SUMMER (2009) with my clarification that I am not trying to eschew from the innateness of life, but simply the latter suits me better both spiritually and mentally. The two-hander performance is unquestionably Oscar-worthy, especially Michelle, her intrepid interpretation of a mundane girl who is desperately to escape the marriage plight which is strangling her entire life. With regard to Ryan, selfishly I think he is some sort of too smug and appealing for his role as an ""underestimated"" mover. Both actors' transitions from lovers to couple were honed to near-perfection, their roles are trite but more visceral and earthly in an audience's eyes. The film is distressful for any lovebirds who are still in the head-over-feet status and once again evinces the complexities of human being's deep consciousness, we never know the exact moment when we lost or will lose that feeling, which makes me most dispirited, as anyhow I still bear a scientific heart inside.",Blue Valentine
25,KineticSeoul,Depressing relationship,7,27 February 2011,"This is basically sort of a artistic movie about the passionate flare of being in a relationship and struggles that come with it later. So basically it has a lot of real life aspect to it. The performance by Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams seem genuine and there portrayal of how relationships are not always sugars and rainbows is done really well. I expected the movie to have more of the romantic side of their relationship, but it has more to do with the struggles that come later on. While shifting back and forth from when they were dating to after their marriage. When reality hits it shows the imperfections of being in a relationship when some of romantic the flare they once had dies. I thought it was unique in a way since most movies just end after they bond and get married, but this shift to the later after marriage parts as well. I don't know why but while watching the struggles of this couple I couldn't help but think of the movie ""The Notebook"", the part where Ryan Gosling's character Noah gives a good amount of dialogue near the end of the movie before his love leaves. About how love also comes with struggles but he is willing to deal with it because he loves her. And also because Cindy Heller(Williams) isn't sure of what she wants from the relationship. Now I thought the realistic documentary style direction it was going is very well done, but I just didn't find myself enjoying this film. It just seemed to drag at times and despite the title this really isn't a date movie, but a depressing love story. It accomplished most of what it was trying to go for and for that I give it credit, but besides that it will just make the audience depressed when the credits start rolling. It just isn't a film I would be looking forward to seeing it again. I don't know why this movie got a NC-17 rating in the first place although it got changed to Rated R later on. I am not going to give this movie a really high score like other so called professional reviewers to be in the bandwagon or appear very intellectual. I give it a 7.2, because I can sort of see the artistic approach and realism which is mainly about the affairs but just wasn't a enjoyable film and not just because it's a depression movie about marriage. It also tries to make you feel sympathetic towards the couple, but they just obviously make some terrible decisions. But that also applies a lot in real life as well so it's passable. This movie basically sort of reminded me of ""Revolutionary Road"" except it takes place in modern time.7.2/10",Blue Valentine
26,sddavis63,The Beginning And The End,5,6 February 2011,"I have to give some credit to a movie that I found largely uninteresting for most of its runtime that nevertheless managed to draw me into the story in the last 20 minutes or so, making me glad (or at least almost glad, which is still an accomplishment) that I watched this. I enjoyed the performances from both Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams as Dean and Cindy. Both were strong, sympathetic and even interesting characters - both strong, while Cindy was perhaps more interesting and Dean was perhaps more sympathetic. The movie deals with both the beginning and the end of their relationship. They meet, and Dean immediately falls in love with her, and even though she's pregnant by another man who's now left her life, they get married. A few years later, we find that Dean is a loving father to Cindy's daughter and really seems to be trying to keep the relationship working, while Cindy seems ready to throw it all away. What was missing here was any real account of how the relationship evolved and why (from Cindy's point of view) it fell apart. Dean honestly seemed to be a good guy who deserved better than the treatment Cindy was giving him. For the most part, what ""Blue Valentine"" gave us was two essentially likable characters in a bit of a snoozefest. But then came the last twenty minutes or so.I really liked the ending of this movie, as it hit a number of buttons. Beginning with the confrontation in the doctor's office where Cindy worked, this actually ended on a very powerful note. Sure Dean confronts her at work (which was probably wrong) and he does go a bit out of control (but in the circumstances not entirely unreasonably) but he still ends up being the primary object of sympathy in this (with the possible exception of the daughter, who may have to face being separated from the man who loves her as his daughter and who she clearly loves as her father) which is a somewhat rare example of a broken relationship where the blame of the viewer isn't placed on the man! Dean does end up being the guy who gets the blame in the context of the story for the relationship's demise (Cindy's co-worker said as the two of them walked out of the office to continue their ""discussion"" - ""don't let him brainwash you!"") But in truth he didn't seem to be to blame. There's a real sympathy from me at least for Dean, and a sense of bewilderment about Cindy - here's a guy who took her in and who raised her daughter as his own and who genuinely seemed to love her, and it seems that she couldn't care less. The end of the movie, though, left me with a bit of hope - Dean reminds her of their marriage vows (""for better or worse"") and the last thing she says to him is ""I need some space."" Not a definite or necessarily permanent end. It was ambiguous enough to leave me wondering whether time might overcome whatever wounds or demons Cindy is afflicted with, and I truly appreciated what is certainly not a typical Hollywood decision to at least reflect on the content of traditional marriage vows.The strong ending doesn't completely overcome what was an essentially less than spell-binding movie, but it did leave me feeling that I had at least got something out of it.",Blue Valentine
27,Hellmant,Gosling and Williams highlight a very captivating and moving film!,9,26 January 2011,"'BLUE VALENTINE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams both give award worthy performances in this tale of modern love and marriage. Williams was just nominated today for an Academy Award for her work in the film, Gosling was unjustly snubbed. The two have previously both been nominated for Golden Globes as well as other top Award honors. The film is directed by Derek Cianfrance and written by Cianfrance, Cami Delavigne and Joey Curtis. It received a lot of publicity earlier this year when it was given a ridiculous and sexist NC-17 rating for a scene of 'cunnilingus' and then later appealed to the proper R rating without any cuts being made to the film.The film cuts back and forth between the early stages of a couple's meeting and falling in love and the possible ending of their marriage one horrible weekend years later. Gosling plays a high school dropout named Dean who gets a job working for a moving company in New York City when he meets Cindy (Williams), a med student, while she's helping her grandmother at an assisted living facility in Pennsylvania. The two fall in love very quickly and things are complicated when Cindy learns she's pregnant. This is cut with scenes from a weekend many years later when their daughter Frankie (Faith Wladyka) is now a grade school-er and the two are emotionally at wits end with each other.The film is beautifully directed and filmed on a budget of a mere $1 million! The dialogue is well written, very moving and believable. There's a nice and fitting score by the band Grizzly Bear and Gosling wrote a few of the songs he performs in the film. The film is a grade A production all around but it's Gosling and Williams who really make the film work, delivering two of the best performances of the year and their careers. I've long been a fan of Gosling and enjoy him in everything he does but have never particularly been impressed by Williams until now. They both give amazing performances and highlight a very captivating and moving film.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-EQyxAZ1ak",Blue Valentine
28,Buddy-51,impressionistic view of a crumbling relationship,7,1 June 2011,"Set in a rural, working-class area of Pennsylvania, Derek Cianfrance's ""Blue Valentine"" provides us with the anatomy of an unhappy marriage.Like Stanley Donen's far more scintillating 1967 film ""Two for the Road,"" ""Blue Valentine"" takes us back and forth to various stages in the couple's relationship. We see them in the present day as Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) struggle to hold it together, growing increasingly distant from one another both emotionally and romantically. We also see, in counterpoint, the earlier stages of their courtship, when their love was new and exciting and the future filled with infinite possibility and hope. This non-linear narrative structure serves only to underline and intensify the sadness of the present day.Perhaps the most audacious – and, for some viewers, no doubt, frustrating – aspect of the film is the characters' reluctance to articulate their thoughts and feelings about their relationship. We sense that they are angry, irritated and disappointed with their lives and each other, but we're rarely told why, although Dean's alcoholism appears to be a key factor in the couple's disintegration. The root of the problem appears to be a general state of ennui that afflicts many, if not most, couples after they've spent a certain amount of time together. Thus, ""Blue Valentine"" becomes an almost impressionistic look at a crumbling relationship, comprised of the little day-to-day moments and activities that, when added together, create a fully developed picture. Moreover, there is one beautifully executed, harrowing sequence in which a drunken Dean confronts Cindy at the hospital where she works that is a model of naturalistic filmmaking.Yet, the movie's greatest strength also happens to be its greatest weakness. For there are times when the film seems to want us to congratulate it for saying something incisive and profound when it really isn't saying anything at all.Still, Gosling and Williams have probably never been better than they are here, as they tackle their roles with absolute realism and conviction. Moreover, an eclectic score (by Grizzly Bear) that often plays against the mood of the scene and a bravely inconclusive ending counterbalance the movie's occasional lack of articulation and insight.",Blue Valentine
29,thesar-2,My Bloody Mistake,4,6 August 2021,"Yeah, my bad. I honestly mistook this for another Blue movie I haven't seen before: Blue Velvet. Two minutes in, I'm like: eh, what the hell.I've only heard of this title before. Nothing else until tonight and mere seconds before it began is when I learned who starred in this. So, since I went in cold and this immediately told me this was a HEAVY, SLOW drama, I assumed the worst.The movie begins with a married couple you know is off and their young daughter. I was certain, though prayed against, that daughter was about to die. Horrifically and by a car accident. And the Writer must've heard me as, right after my bad thoughts, they purposely pointed out a Pet Sematary-type road in front of their house.Well, a member of the family does die on the foreshadowed death drive, but mercifully, not the daughter.The rest of the story? Um, it's absolutely Ryan Gosling's forte: a SLOOOOW moving movie of different time-periods of this dysfunctional relationship. That's...it.I'm not really complaining - it was very well shot, acted and believable throughout. It's just predictable and miserable. This is NOT a feel-good movie and sadly, you'll add little to your life unless you just wish to believe misery-loves-company.Recommended for those wishing to break away from the Hallmark Channel.***Final Thoughts: Now, I really gotta find Blue Velvet.

What happens in between? Life, I guess. Both parts of the story are well-told, the beginning full of optimism, the ending full of bitterness, hate, and the memory of a love that has gone. What there isn't is a period where we the audience can realistically hope of a happy conclusion: to that extent, what we do see is slightly less engaging than it might have been if it was merely book-ending a more complete story.

31,MLDinTN,heavy drama,6,7 January 2012,"This was a pretty good film and good acting. Don't go in expecting a lot of action because you will be disappointed. The main criticism I have is that at times the movie is a little too slow and drags along. But for the most part, it was a good script. The movie takes place in 2 time periods. It jumps back and forth; however, it made sense. It follows a couple, Cindy and Dean, and shows how they fell in love and then how they've grown to dislike each other toward the end of their marriage. The major flaw is the movie never shows why Cindy hates Dean so much. We get the fact she's falling out of love, but why? Is it because Dean never got a good career like she did and drinks too much? Plus we learn they married for the wrong reasons. Cindy finds herself pregnant and it could be Dean's or another guy's, but they decide to marry any way.FINAL VERDICT: It was good and shows a more realistic look at the downfall of a marriage. The acting was good. I recommend it if you want a really dramatic movie.",Blue Valentine
32,secondtake,"Williams and Gosling are terrific, each along and as a couple...see this!",9,15 September 2014,"Blue Valentine (2010)You might notice when it's all over that the plot is a love story gone bad in the most common way. There are no great twists of plot, no surprises to wake you up. This is a hard driven story about two regular people who are making a go at a relationship. Period.And the superb acting will keep this simple story line going. Both Dean, played by Ryan Gosling, and Cindy, by Michelle Williams, are fully realized characters with flaws and charms and stubborn streaks that we all recognize. There is high romance here (the title is perfect in many ways) and there is sadness, too. And a child who of course gets both ends of that stick.The filming throughout shows how much a loose, cinema verite kind of realism with the camera has become normal, and it's quite beautiful and effective. This isn't a stately film with overwrought camera-work, but the production values are very high all the same, not falling into the hand-held zone of some indie films. Impressive. In the future, keep an eye on Andrij Parekh, the cinematographer.You may be the type to want something more in a movie. By chance I saw a similar movie a couple days ago where nothing really happens outside a slice of life showing the ups and downs in a relationship, and that one was truly slow and boring. ""Blue Valentine"" avoids this flaw most of all through the searing performances by Gosling and Williams. But I also think the writing, as much as it stayed within familiar boundaries, was sharp and believable, it didn't waste time, it had sincerity, and it fit the characters. All of this is hard to relay in a review, but when you experience it you'll see how it really works.This isn't a rom-com, or an innovative thrill, nor is it depending on crime and suspense to succeed. That is, this is just a drama about everyday, working class people. If that seems up your alley you'll really love it.",Blue Valentine

A couple tries one last time to save their marriage. This is a movie I cannot say enough about. There are so many love story movies that are released, but this is hands down the most realistic one I have ever seen.

This movie is shot in the style of ""Godfather 2"", told in a combination of flashbacks to see the beginning of the relationship, and present day story of the marriage trying to be saved. There are a few pretty graphic love scenes in the movie, but they help with the story and not just for the purpose of having these scenes. You are so engrossed in the lives of the two characters that you spend the movie hoping that they are able to work it out. The making of feature is very interesting and gives you a new view of the movie that makes you want to watch it again to watch the interaction again.

His use of hand-held camera and fondness for extreme closeups is distracting, but he also manages to capture some memorable images, such as the one where Williams does an impromptu dance while Gosling plays the ukulele and sings an off-key song.

37,Rodrigo_Amaro,Outstanding Reflections On Love And Relationships,10,18 May 2011,"I've never thought a film like ""Blue Valentine"" would capture my attention and emotions so much like it did without being the usual ""so cute"" story. It's more powerful than that, it's intelligent, quite real and truly impressive. This is a very mature and reflexive film with outstanding performances.Here's the heartbreaking story of Cindy and Dean (played by Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling) a couple living on the edge, raising a kid and with many relationship problems ahead. Like ""(500) Days of Summer"" this is as story depending exclusively of the flashback to tell its story where we as audience keep guessing if they'll be together at the ending, and these flashbacks tell us how they were without with each other and how they fell in love while the plot goes forward telling us they are running to a possible breakup.There's no heroes or villains, right or wrong in this marriage; there's no utility in trying to point fingers at each other blaming for what went wrong in the relationship. Things happen and we reach a point where we can't deal anymore with a partner; they simply lost their love and respect for each other. Some viewers complained about the film's failure in being realistic or not feeling deeply involved with the characters. This is a fictional work as a fiction tend to be written and projected they are invented, reflecting some (not totally) aspects of life. That's why we love motion pictures because they are mirrors for life, it's not the same image as life but it gets CLOSER to that. It's never the same thing. I was involved with the characters, their desperation, love and all. Dean even says something about being watching too many movies, so his notion of love was twisted after the films. Again, fiction working its way.Here's a little thing that might be overlooked by some, the scene where Dean chooses a motel room to spend some time with Cindy. His choices were: the 'Cupid Room' or the 'Futuristic Room'. Cindy doesn't want to go, and Dean chooses the futuristic room to spend some time with her. Meaning: or you decide yourself for love or for a future (might be better or don't); you can try to hold these two things but it's very hard to do it, and hard to sustain both things. Will love will be strong enough to resist the torments in the future? The love's flame will burn with the same intensity for both individuals all the time? This duality between love and future is present all the time in their lives; their colorful romance when younger; and the blue motel room, lifeless and distant from good times. We can't believe in coincidences when Dean sings to Cindy a song called ""You Always Hurt The Ones You Love"" way before they really start to date, then get married and all the blues appear. One of the most calculated moments ever presented in films (one of the most lovely too). The MPAA went way over their heads by changing the NC-17 rating for an inexcusable and unnecessary R rating because of two sex scenes (nothing so graphic), since sex has an important role in their relationship (specially concerning Cindy who had other partners). This is a movie for everyone involved in a relationship or who passed through something similar. There's drama, romance, a little bit of comedy and lovely moments yet it's a striking and philosophical film. Unforgettable! 10/10",Blue Valentine
38,Floated2,Quite gripping and intense,9,18 January 2019,"Blue Valentine is one of Derek Cianfrance's earlier directorial films, and we can see the potential within this film. Starring Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, playing a couple showing similarities and differences. This film is quite complex within its storytelling in its pacing as it first shows the present time where both character seem to be in their late 20's, then another storyline where we see the characters first meeting , possibly not much earlier within their early 20's.Blue Valentine delivers both great and raw natural performances from both leads as this film is carried by them. Michelle Williams was nominated for an Oscar for her role yet Ryan Gosling was not, which is a shame (possibly due to a strong year by male leads?)This film is intense yet somewhat more light hearted and fun loving than originally thought of. At times it is quite depressing but overall the tone is that in which is more on the light side. Also the dialogue (mainly by Gosling) is quite clever and intriguing, as we see the chemistry between him and Williams. Blue Valentine is one of the more realistic and thoughtful romantic love dramas having seen. Highly recommend.",Blue Valentine
39,Red-125,Bad decisions,7,3 March 2011,"Blue Valentine (2010) was written and directed by Derek Cianfrance. It stars Ryan Gosling as Dean and Michelle Williams as his wife Cindy. Their marriage is at the point of disintegration, and we learn why in a series of flashbacks.Like Francis Ford Coppola's ""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" this film starts in media res with an unhappy couple who are barely able to speak to each other. The flashbacks allow us to learn how they became a couple and what they saw in each other.Dean is a high school dropout who starts his day with a beer before work. When Cindy says that it's sad he has a job that makes him drink before he can go to work, he tells her--and he's serious--that the great thing about the work he does is that he can have a beer for breakfast and still get his job done. That interchange typifies the relationship. The same data are interpreted very differently by two very different people. The problem is that these two very different people are married to each other.Cindy came from a middle-class background and wanted to be a doctor. She's a health professional, but clearly not at the physician level. Dean came from a lower-class background. He started out working for a moving company, and now he's a house painter. They have a daughter whom they both love, but that's the extent of their common ground.Dean truly loves Cindy, and and he wants the marriage to work. The problem is that he has a tin ear for the subtleties of communication within a relationship. Moreover, if two choices are before him, Dean will make the wrong decision every time. By the time the movie begins, we can't imagine why Cindy would have married this loser.The fact is that Cindy was in a bad way when they met, while Dean was caring, respectful, and had a goofy, wacky kind of charm. He was gentle and loving, and she thought it could work. I could buy it--people make bad decisions. Sometimes they get away with them, and sometimes they end up like Cindy. They wake up one morning and think, ""What am I doing here? How did I get into this mess? Can I ever get out of it?""This is a serious movie obviously meant to reflect the reality of life for some couples. Unfortunately, the grimness and lack of options were pretty depressing. Still, it's a film worth seeing. We saw it in a theater, but it should work well on DVD.",Blue Valentine
40,howard.schumann,Offers no Food for Thought,6,16 February 2011,"If you are just starting out in a relationship and are looking for a primer on what doesn't work, you need not look any further than Derek Cianfrance's Blue Valentine, an intimate look at the disintegration of a marriage that often feels more like an artistic concept than an organic experience. Outstandingly performed by Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams as the challenged couple, the film bounces around from the happy beginning of their relationship to its bitter last stages, where instant oatmeal becomes a metaphor for childish rage and all the viewer is left to do is to pick raisins off the table.Dean is a working class guy whose career path has gone from helper at a moving company to house painting, while the more upwardly mobile Cindy is a nurse who has gone to medical school. They live with their 6-year old daughter, Frankie (Faith Wladyka), (a child that is not his) in an unimposing suburban house in Pennsylvania. When we first see them, tension boils to the surface when Cindy, a late arrival to Frankie's school recital, tells Dean that she has discovered the family dog lying dead on the roadside after he escaped and ran out into the street. Instead of comforting her and talking about how to break the news to their six-year-old, he chastises his wife for leaving the gate open, which brings on tears.While the film provides no information of what has transpired in the last six years of their marriage, we can surmise that his reaction is indicative of how small transgressions have been ballooned into major incidents. Shot with a hand-held camera, the only happy moments seem to have been when they first met in Brooklyn. Dean sees Cindy at the residence where she is visiting her grandmother and is immediately struck by her charm and her good looks. Though she does not call him after he leaves his card with her, they meet again on a bus a short time later and begin a relationship that at first is playful and spontaneous.He serenades her on a dark street with his ukulele as she dances to the music which is prophetically, ""You Always Hurt the One You Love"". She sees in him qualities of caring as shown by his willingness to raise the child that Cindy is pregnant with as his own. His good qualities become less endearing, however, when he begins to drink and fails to do anything creative with his life. In a futile effort to rekindle the spark, they leave Frankie with her grandparents and book a motel room just to get out of the house. Their hopes of a nice quiet evening of drinking and making love in the cheesy motel's blue ""Future Room"" are dashed when their lovemaking brings to the surface their fears and insecurities.Blue Valentine offers no message or food for thought and can be quite depressing. From what we can see and our information is often scanty, the warring couple seem to have no interests in common, never share their feelings with each other, and do not become involved with the world outside of themselves. More importantly, whining and complaining substitutes for empathy and understanding. They don't listen to each other and their communication has little nuance or attempt to break through the others defences. What is lacking is the understanding that though a relationship will have its ups and downs, if the ground of being is one of love and commitment, then beyond the thoughts and the feelings that come and go, that commitment will always be there, ready to be called upon when needed.In Sonnet #116, Shakespeare said, ""Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove: O, no! It is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken."" That experience is not automatically there, however, but is something that must be recreated every day. What is missing in Dean and Cindy's marriage is not only affection and gentle kindness, but that sense of commitment, the experience that the words ""for better or worse, till death do us part"" are not just an empty promise, but a solemn vow that remains ""the star to every wandering bark.""",Blue Valentine

It treats topics as work life, resentment, frustration, and the always polemic ""what would if...?"" relevant moments in someone's life. The chemistry between Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling is magnetic. Both actors demonstrate why they are amongst the best actors of their generation. You may relate to this movie so beware because the experience is not positive at all. However, it should be a wake up call for troubled couples.",Blue Valentine
42,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"It's difficult, but ""Blue Valentine"" is the rare gem that makes you feel for its characters",8,19 May 2011,"The love story takes many forms in film. Many would argue ""Blue Valentine"" takes the more ""realistic"" approach in that it depicts the fracturing of a relationship amidst a sea of flashbacks to more idealistic and happier times. ""Blue Valentine"" might not have a traditional happy ending, but that doesn't necessarily make it a depressing love story. Whereas many relationships happily succeed, others fail and others take less concrete and grayer directions. Derek Cianfrance simply paints a deep, complex and not-so-uplifting portrait of one such relationship.Perhaps ""honest"" would be more suitable a term than ""realistic"" in that marriages and relationships can take a variety of courses and the story of Cindy and Dean is one possible trajectory, even if it's one we wish didn't occur as often as it does.The film follows the present time line of Cindy (Michelle Williams) and Dean (Ryan Gosling) attempting to take a one-day vacation together amid an atmosphere of frustrations and some thick tension. They drop their daughter Frankie off with Cindy's father and travel to a hotel where they end up in an outer space-themed suite that sort of awkwardly sums up that they're in different places emotionally. Cindy has a lot on her mind and can't seem to relax, leading her to be sexually unresponsive, and Dean can't seem to approach her the right way about it, leading to his own frustrations. There seems to be a distinct effort being made to love each other, but there's an unquestionable hollowness or at least a disconnect.Peppered throughout but not in an obnoxiously non-linear way are flashbacks to when they first met and fell in love. Gosling's Dean shows some continuity between these two time lines, whereas earlier Cindy, despite being a bit standoffish consistently throughout, shows a completely different side, which is fitting for her character considering how out of love she really is in present day.Most impressively, the script creates empathy and sympathy for both characters; no one person is the victim or the enemy throughout. Both make mistakes, even if the scales tip heavily at certain points in the film. Unless you personally find your life to mirror one of these characters based on a past (or current, I suppose) relationship, there's no taking sides.The depth of Gosling and Williams' performances doesn't allow partiality either. Gosling certainly gives the more external performance with a quick temper yet a deep love that occasionally forces out his fragility. Cindy by nature bottles up her emotions and Williams manages to convey it all beautifully. Cianfrance effectively balances these two powerful acting forces entering their primes and lets you feel their relationship and their story. Successfully generating empathy proves here to be a valuable filmmaking skill. Cianfrance wields it properly and effectively in a film with just a few key events capable of commanding our attention otherwise. A gripping scene occurs when Cindy makes the determination to have her pregnancy aborted. The doctor (though kindly) describes what he's doing in vivid detail and you can't help but enter the mind of Cindy as she wrestles with whether she can go through with the procedure. It's potent stuff no matter what side of the debate you're on.Non-traditional love stories with un-Hollywood endings have a tendency to get preachy in the end, but ""Blue Valentine"" doesn't make any grand thematic statements. The inconclusive ending of the film suggests that we must find our own way to make peace with this ""honest"" outcome. The only obvious thing to take away is that it sucks; it sucks when these things happen and it's not necessarily any one person's fault — it's the relationship.Yet the film suggests it could be worse. A few other low-profile relationships in the film, such as the one between Cindy's mother and father, show how relationships often times continue when they shouldn't. Just because two disagreeing people stick it out together doesn't mean they did the right thing for their family. But no matter which lens you choose to look at the film through, Cianfrance and this talented group of writers and actors convinces you thoroughly to find that lens and use it.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Blue Valentine
43,jzappa,"Happiness, Flatlining",10,18 May 2011,"The notion that we get married for the reason that we long more for a spectator of our lives than a partner may give an insight into the distressed minds of the matrimonial pair in this so-close-it-hurts powerhouse, which tracks them throughout their first six years of spectatorship. Or was that Dean's requirement, and did Cindy elude the excitement of the view? Here's a film that sees quite clearly itself. Derek Cianfrance, the film's co-writer and director, studies with intense precision the beginning and decomposition of a passionate relationship. This film is vibrant in its particulars.Near the end of the six years, when Cindy can barely recall why she wanted to marry Dean, Cianfrance watches the bodily and psychological fatigue that has conquered her. And the way that Dean appears scarcely to notice, except provided that Cindy stays his wife and his spectator, which in his view was the contract. They're played by Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams as a Pennsylvania blue-collar pair with a daughter, Frankie. She was born right at the outset. Cindy is a nurse. Dean is a house painter. When they met, and for awhile after, work was barely focal to them. It was where they went and from where they came home.In successful physical changes, Williams and Gosling give us Dean and Cindy at two ages: Their age now, and at the beginning, when they were alive with that wistful knowledge that each other's touch causes immediate sensuality. It's less demanding to play the same character at ages thirty years apart than at six years apart. Though some physical modification happens, what actually occurs is a revolution of internal assurance. Williams plays a woman who sits within herself and no longer knows what she's for and what she wants to do with herself.All marriages have high points, times of staggering clearness. Dean is capable of luxurious foolish idealism, and Cindy is charmed by that. She hankers for it. They initially meet at her grandma's retirement home. Have you ever had one of those fortuitous encounters with a stranger in a place neither one of you fits in? A space apart from your lives, so that you begin fresh with your opening exchange and dive headlong into an unexpectedly new outlook? Before long they're indulging in this new plaything, their love. Then they get married and have the completely unintended but fully embraced Frankie, and the realities of paying the bills, work schedules, child-rearing, bona fide matrimony finds its feet. Dean appears at a complete loss, remaining inflexible at the first step. Can you see the distinction between ""He loves me as much as he always did,"" and ""He loves me exactly like he always did?"" Blue Valentine cuts between past and present as if struggling to hark back to what went awry. From Dean's standpoint, perhaps nothing did. He yearned to marry Cindy, and he still does and still is. Cindy can't bear that. He doesn't think the best is yet to come. He thinks it's perfect now. Williams plays Cindy as a woman who never had much self-esteem. He's the one who drinks too much. But that's not the issue. It's his maddening failure to nurture this Cindy, right here, this moment, because when she married him, she became precisely the Cindy he needed.I wonder how Cianfrance worked with his co-writers. They were writing about something indescribable, a hole. It's not a story with handy press-studs like, say, illness, death or other things stories are used to. It's about internal loss and the collapse of optimism. Can anybody really stay clear about what goes wrong from one point to the present?",Blue Valentine
44,Turfseer,Connect the dots tale of blue collar marriage dissolution,4,28 January 2011,"Watch out! Today's soap opera is all dressed up in documentary style replete with improvised dialogue, graphic sex scenes and a ton of angst hanging in the air. Don't despair however—like any traditional soap opera, rest assured that you will discover that the new soap opera will be just like the old—almost completely lacking in wit, humor or a modicum of 'ideas'.Blue Valentine chronicles the breakdown of a relationship, focusing on two blue collar characters, Dean and Cindy (played with an honest intensity by Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams). Director Derek Cianfrance constantly flashes back and forth between Dean and Cindy's early courtship and the eventual breakdown of their relationship, after they have a child together (played by an adorable five year old, Faith Wladyka).Dean is depicted as a high school dropout who begins working for a moving company and later as a painter. He courts Cindy by singing songs on a ukulele and is supportive of her even after she reveals she's pregnant by another man, Bobby, a sadistic jock who beats up the young Dean after he finds out that he's been dating Cindy.In her younger incarnation, Cindy is an aspiring medical student and is later seen as a nurse in a doctor's office. Cindy's character is even more sketchy. When we first meet her, she's emotionally needy but later when she's 'all grown up', she turns on Dean, simply because he lacks ambition. If Cindy wins no brownie points for her lack of warmth, Dean is positively repulsive after morphing into a love sick puppy dog with an acute alcohol problem. The film's climax takes place at Cindy's place of employment where Dean, completely soused, slugs Cindy's employer in the face, a physician, who promptly retaliates by firing Cindy, who returns home with her husband and demands a divorce.Blue Valentine features some long drawn-out scenes which in part could have been left on the cutting room floor. One such scene is Dean and Cindy's failed tryst at a tacky, futuristic motel room. Yes, we get the point pretty much right away that Cindy no longer has any sexual interest in Dean but we're forced to endure the gyrations until Cindy calls an end to the couple's uncomfortable session together.The contrast between the early joy of Dean and Cindy's relationship and the later dissolution is meant to be sad and no doubt it is. But do we and should we really care? There is nothing inherently dramatic in depicting a dissolution of a marriage unless there are some unique and compelling reasons behind it. Blue Valentine provides us with the most simplistic and sketchy of explanations (as previously mentioned, Cindy's perception that Dean lacks ambition and the brutal reality of his unbridled alcoholism).The Valentine scenarists try hard to provide a psychological context for Cindy's emotional neediness right before her marriage. The explanation is in the form of her churlish, hot-tempered Dad, who is probably the least realized characters in the entire script.If you're looking for a story of ideas, a la Ingmar Bergman, you will not find it here. Rather, all the plot points are one of the standard melodrama, now adorned in modern accouterments. Director Cianfrance is not without talent—he knows how to extract good performances from his actors and works well with his DP and special effects crew (dig those fantastic closing credits). But ultimately, a story about a depressed couple and dissolution of a marriage does not make for good drama. What's missing is the basic element that these characters lack: ego!",Blue Valentine
45,BeneCumb,"Mostly trivial, at times boring",5,23 January 2013,"Relationships and marriages have their ups and downs; relations with parents and ex-es are frequently cold, if not bad; persons with flexitime are often unavailable for their children; sex does not solve most of issues; different backgrounds get people gradually apart; the young cannot imagine themselves as oldies...Sounds like shallow reasoning?! Well, I just laid down the main themes in this movie, with the rating here significantly over 7 points... Of course, the leading roles are not badly performed, both Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are Academy Award nominees (the latter received the nomination for the movie in question as well), but I can hardly imagine that viewers could somehow experience something in common with them. When the credits appeared, I just felt indifference, shrugged my shoulders: well, that was it.

46,freemantle_uk,The unromantic film,8,25 August 2012,"Blue Valentine is a very, depressing and harsh look at the collapse of a relationship and impact it has one people's lives.Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) are a young married couple with a young daughter, Frankie (Faith Wladyka). It is clear their marriage is on the rocks as they argue constantly, Dean is constantly drinking and Cindy thinking of her career. As we follow them over the cause of their final 24 hours together, Blue Valentine looks back at their courtship and start of their relationship when Dean worked for a removal company and Cindy was a high school student.Blue Valentine is a tough watch with its hand-held, almost documentary style cinematography and raw powerful acting from the two leads. The natural dialogue and the use of long single shots actually makes you feel like you are watching a couple rise and fall. It gave the voyeuristic feel as you watch the pair.Gosling and Williams were terrific and they both show why they are two of the best actors of their generation. They were real, defined characters with their positive and negative attitudes and with the flashbacks it is very painful to watch what happens to them. They are some charming scenes in flashbacks when Dean tries to win over Cindy which leads to the two singing and dancing on the street. The deterioration in their relationship affects everyone and everything around them, it could even be argued that there relationship was doomed from the start considering how it started, that Cindy was dating another man and it leads to Cindy's pregnancy. Cindy was a character who wanted to avoid being like her parents, but ends up in an unhappy marriage. Dean is a romantic, a nice guy and a good father, but his character slowly worsen as the film progresses.I want to compare Blue Valentine to Another Year, another film that focuses on ordinary people in their ordinary lives. Both are terrifically acted films but Blue Valentine has much more of edge because there is actually drama, tension and conflict in the story compared to Another Year where it just felt like it meandered about, not knowing where to go.It would be hard to call Blue Valentine an entertaining film, but it is a very engaging film, a character piece lead by two great performance. It is an examination of an event that many people have gone through in its frank honesty.",Blue Valentine
47,dfranzen70,Slow and quite sad - but strikingly acted,6,25 January 2011,"Get off my lawn! Frothy RuminationsHomeAboutDo Not WatchMovies, A-CMovies, D-HMovies, I-NMovies, O-SMovies, T-ZMust SeesNumbered Reviews« 562 – Harry Brown (***)Your 2011 Oscars predictions – all 100% awesomely correct, you just watch »563 – Blue Valentine (**1/2)I guess you have to be in the mood to really get into Blue Valentine, a somber, hopeless foray into the land of the mistake marriage. Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling play a low-budget couple slowly discovering that the love in their relationship is not only gone, it was probably never there. So sad it's well, sad. It's just sad.Dean (Gosling) is an artistic type, the kind who can strum a ukulele and sing slightly off key in order to impress a girl. He can draw, too; so why is he stuck working for a moving company? Meanwhile Cindy (Williams) has studied medicine and now works in a doctor's office. The couple has a young daughter named Frankie (Faith Wladyka).The movie jumps back and forth in time to explain how Dean and Cindy got to where they are now: a listless marriage surviving only by attrition and inertia. We learn how they met (not cute), and we get to experience their misfortunes in an almost invasive manner. These are not perfect people, but each is endearing in his or her own way. The disintegration of their marriage seems probable even from the start, as they appear to be a bit of a mismatch. Then again, it does take all kinds, and opposites attract, and so on.As the movie progresses, we also learn what each really thinks of the other. Cindy feels that Dean is throwing his life away out of laziness and complete apathy, and she worries about the effect that will have on their tot. Dean feels his wife is edging away from him, at least psychologically, perhaps regretting a long-ago decision (which we, as viewer, must see for ourselves in gut-wrenching detail).I know what the movie was about. I get the point. But rather than feel like something was resolved or addressed, I felt emptier than I wanted to feel. I felt, in fact, as if I had sat through two hours of tension building to an unsatisfying climax. In the end, one must ask oneself: What have we really learned about these characters? Do we know more or less than when we started? Do we care about them? I'm not sure I sincerely cared about either of them, although it seemed pretty clear that one was meant to be seen in a much more favorable light than the other.Williams and Gosling are really outstanding. They had difficult, almost pedestrian material with which to work, and they made it sort of almost come together perfectly. It's not their fault that the script is so downbeat that there just seems to be no way out. In movies, it's okay to have a hopeless situation if there's at least some glimmer of hope somewhere (e.g., a terrible, crime-riddled school with one strong-willed teacher), but there has to be something. Otherwise, we're all just drifting along with the characters, and we wish they'd do something to end our torment.Undoubtedly, critics will rave about the deep honesty of the movie, how it expertly portrays a marriage on the rocks. And maybe it is, and maybe it does. But the sheer overwhelming depression and the endless tension, with hardly a letup of an off-kilter scene or some comic relief, doom it.",Blue Valentine
48,meeza,"True Blue, but a near masterpiece!",9,28 January 2011,"Derek Cianfrance's independent gem ""Blue Valentine"" is utterly disturbing, profoundly pessimistic, and intensely melancholy. Nevertheless, ""Blue Valentine won my cinematic heart and it could be my movie valentine any day of the year, because it is one of the best movies of 2010. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams star as Dean and Cindy, a married couple who are in the stage of the ritual daily motion after a few years of matrimony; and also at the same time are being mostly disengaged with one another. Dean is an unmotivated house painter who drinks too much, but does attempt to revitalize their marriage by renting a room in one of those semi-exquisite ""bangarama"" hotels. He even books the ""futurama"" room; even though in the back of his mind he knows the futurama of Dean and Cindy's relationship is an eventual divorce. Dean buys Cindy flowers, brings a recording of their ""romance song"", but of course has to bring way too much booze to the romantic outing. Cindy does not take the jaunt as an enchanted evening, probably due to so many Dean-dong disappointments she has encountered from Dean throughout their marriage. In other words, she is not elated at all for the romantic getaway. The beauty of ""Blue Valentine"" is Cianfrance's cerebral methods of intercutting between two time periods of their relationship. He also presents in the movie the time when Dean and Cindy first meet and couple it up, which was mostly refreshing and jovial; even though there were a few pitfalls along the way, but their true love at the time had the resiliency to overcome them. So overall what we get from Dean and Cindy's relationship is the better and the worse, but it all works out for the better of the narrative. Cianfrance's gut-wrenching direction and screenplay (which he co-wrote with Cami Delavigne) authentically presents how a marriage can easily deteriorate when domestic discord is left ongoing and unaddressed, and there is not a consummate effort in trying to resolve it. Ryan Gosling was probably left with a broken heart by being majorly snubbed for a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his courageous performance in ""Blue Valentine"". It's the best performance of his career, you can even write that on your ""notebook"". Michelle Williams did get her deserving Best Actress Oscar nod for her virtuoso performance, but is probably a bit brokenhearted herself because of the Ryan snub. Those two performances definitely compliment each other, and they both should have garnered Oscar nominations. Andrij Parekh's brilliant cinematography is like a character itself in the narrative and plays as a symbolic representation of Dean and Cindy's relationship. Aorta Warning: if you are in a troubled marriage or relationship, ""Blue Valentine"" might pull at the heartstrings way too tight for you to handle. But at the other end, ""Blue Valentine"" also presents a viable lesson on the eventual disintegration of a romance if both parties involved don't sacrifice and let the romantic spark extinguish itself. So I send you a ""Blue Valentine"" for you not to reject. In other words, ""don't break my heart"" and see it already! ***** Excellent",Blue Valentine
49,estebangonzalez10,Oh the heartaches of falling in and out of love,8,27 July 2013,"""Girls spend their whole life looking for Prince Charming and then marry the guy who's got a good job and is gunna stick around.""Blue Valentine might not be an easy movie to sit through or an uplifting one for that matter, but it is a great story that presents an interesting study about love and marriage. I wonder how many girls were disappointed after thinking this was going to be another chick flick. This isn't a movie you should go see with your date because it may leave you a little depressed. This isn't your typical anti-romantic film either because it doesn't only study the disintegration of love; it also pays a lot of attention on how the relationship and love was built in the first place. It is a very emotional film with some great performances from the two lead roles. The chemistry between Gosling and Williams is just incredible. It is also very well directed by Derek Cianfrance who went through a great deal of preparation and planning before making this film. He also wrote the script and allowed for the actors to improvise giving the film a very authentic and realistic vibe. Blue Valentine depicts relationships in such a way that it reminds the audience that films aren't made only for voyeuristic and entertaining purposes; they can sometimes be a mirror of the way we interact and relate with one another. Blue Valentine is such a film and I'm sure it will leave some people uncomfortable, but I'm still recommending this because it is one of the best films dealing with falling in and out of love. The film introduces us to a present day working class couple, Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams), who have a small daughter named Frankie (Faith Wladyka). Dean is very youthful and playful while Cindy seems a little frustrated with him at the time being. She's a nurse who once dreamed of becoming a doctor, while he works as a painter and has no other ambition in life than to spend time with his family. They are a very young couple and marriage seems to have taken a toll on them. Dean is beginning to lose some hair and he has lost some of his youthful charm, while Cindy is really displeased with the way things are going. The film isn't told in linear form as we see flashbacks of how Dean and Cindy met and eventually fell in love. So we have these two contrasting scenes overlapping each other during the entire movie, one showing how the marriage begins to slowly dissolve while the other focuses on courtship and how the two fell in love with each other. By doing so, Cianfrance slowly draws the viewer in by involving them in the story and also gives us important background information about each character.The reason why I decided to finally watch this film is because I recently saw The Place Beyond the Pines, Cianfrance's latest film, which I really loved. Blue Valentine may be a little too depressing, but it still managed to draw my attention and get me emotionally involved with the characters. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are great together and the chemistry was amazing. Those flashback scenes were so good that it hurt to see how the relationship had dissolved in the present day. Cianfrance created some relatable characters. Love shouldn't be this depressing and I know it isn't like this all the time, but couples nowadays fall in and out of love so easily that this is a film that rings true to life and in a way it is an interesting study as to why these relationships fail sometimes. There are some signs during the flashbacks that kind of serve as warnings as to why the relationship might fail, but love can be blind at times. This is one of those films that leave a lasting effect on the viewer and is open to many interpretations. It is not a film you go see and then easily can forget about and that is why I'm recommending Blue Valentine. It sticks with you.",Blue Valentine

51,juneebuggy,"Wow, Blue Valentine, way to break my heart",8,8 March 2015,"Not your typical love story here and not an easy movie to enjoy because its so true to life, but its super well done. Gritty, harrowing and depressing with damn near perfect performances from Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. (Great to watch on Valentines Day if you're single and want to stay that way.) A very emotional movie, giving an unflinching look of the beginning and end of a relationship. We join Dean and Cindy, a young but weary working class couple, married for several years and raising a daughter. We immediately notice the lack of communication between them, the different parenting skills, Cindy seems exhausted, Dean is lazily content, their marriage is in trouble.In the hopes of recapturing the love that existed between them when they first started dating Dean and Cindy take a trip to a theme motel and there the story unfolds into two distinct time frames, showing us flashbacks of the couple meeting; youthful sexuality and falling in love, interspersed with scenes of petty arguments, discord and receding hairlines. It jumps back and forth seamlessly and you wonder how a couple so in love could fall out of love...such is life I guess.Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams give amazing performances, they have wonderful chemistry together which I'm sure helped as they have several very intense and intimate scenes together.

54,3xHCCH,I Am Not Exactly A Fan,4,24 January 2011,"I watched this film with so much expectations. It has massive awards buzz for its two primary actors, Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. Some predictors even place these two above current favorites Colin Firth and Natalie Portman for the Oscar race. My opinion is, I don't think so. While Gosling and Michelle are intense, I think the overall quality of the movie will not propel their nominations, much less their wins.The movie was very slow and rather rambling. You see that Cindy (Michelle) is a midwife, while Dean (Gosling) works in a warehouse. The film crisscrosses from their fatigued relationship at present to the days when they first met. We see how laidback guy Dean is Cindy's fallback second choice, as she was rejected by her first choice jock Bobby (Mike Vogel). Now that their marriage is breaking apart, will their young daughter strengthen their bonds, or drive them further apart?Wait, haven't we all seen this before, how a weak relationship sours over time? This is exactly my problem with this movie. However talented the cast, the ordinariness of the story felt so tedious to watch develop so slowly over almost two hours. There were so many pointless scenes of the young Dean and Cindy cavorting. You already know the premise from the get-go, and yet the frustrating wait is not at all rewarded by the film's sudden end. Those who seek it out because of the controversial NC-17 rating will also be disappointed, as the scenes in question were not that graphic compared to previous NC-17 films.",Blue Valentine

56,EUyeshima,Relentless Portrait of the Beginning and the End of a Conflicted Relationship,8,16 December 2011,"Filmmaker Derek Cianfrance shows a certain audacity in giving the viewer his dark, sad-eyed 2010 relationship drama a beginning and an ending without providing a linear narrative to bring it together into a more predictably episodic account. Thanks to engrossing performances from Ryan Gosling (""The Ides of March"") and Michelle Williams (""My Week with Marilyn"") and an insightful screenplay co-written by Cianfrance, Joey Curtis and Cami Delavigne, the middle passage doesn't feel missing. Instead, the two parts almost evoke an unsettling memory piece where a couple goes through the enthrallment of falling in love and the purgatory of knowing when that love has died a painful death. Granted the film is not easy to watch at times, but it feels bracingly honest in its portrayal of a marriage unraveling from the weight of social class differences that irreparably breach the relationship at the core.The story focuses on a young working-class couple, Dean Pereira and Cindy Heller. At the outset, he's a high school dropout working for a moving company, and she's a pre-med student living with her unhappy parents and caring for her grandmother in Pennsylvania. They have a chance encounter, fall breathlessly in love, and rush into marriage when Cindy finds herself pregnant by her previous boyfriend, a bad-tempered wrestler named Bobby. Dean agrees to raise Cindy's daughter Frankie, as his own, and their familial bond is established. Several years later near the end of their marriage, they are living in rural Pennsylvania. Dean paints houses for a living, while Cindy has become a nurse. Going through the motions of their marriage, they make one last desperate attempt at resurrecting their troubled relationship by going to a ""sex"" motel, but a domestic dispute ensues leading to a morning-after altercation between Dean and the doctor who had called Cindy to come into the clinic to work that morning. When Dean cannot contain his anger and disappointment, their marriage becomes irreparably broken.The shifting back and forth in time between Dean and Cindy's courtship and the dissolution of their predictable marriage provides a prime opportunity for the actors to show the subtle and often visceral ways the characters had changed over the course of six years. While the scenes of their younger selves are filled with romance and welcome humor in the midst of their sometimes overwhelming bleakness, it is painful and moving to watch the motel scenes where the pair loses the last remaining threads holding them together. Gosling and Williams apparently improvised much of their dialogue, especially in the courtship scenes, and they calibrate their performances with a rhythm and texture that makes their perpetually volatile relationship feel real and heartbreaking. With the use of a Super 16mm in the early scenes and a Red One in the later ones, cinematographer Andrij Parekh lends a palpable authenticity to the characters' lower-middle-class lives. It's worthwhile viewing if only for the lead actors' stellar work.",Blue Valentine
57,MarieGabrielle,"Blue, sad Valentine...",8,12 March 2013,"Well done, and nuanced the story is. Ryan Gosling and Miceelle Williams portray a disaffected couple. They have a six year old daughter named Frankie, the one thing initially that seems to keep them together.Gosling portrays a man who , works as a mover, their neighborhood looks something like Staten Island (not upscale, not the worst) Their family of origin is rather absent, disinterested.Williams always gives a good performance and does not disappoint.She recites the names of US Presidents, proving she has good memory, she wants to attend medical school she says (This is before marriage and child puts an end to her aspirations).The undercurrent is really, a ballad for a lost America. Indeed the scenes evoke a sort of blue, pallid environment. The world they live in is not promising. Gosling's wardrobe is notably lackluster and tattered, at the end of the film he is wearing an America eagle, a sign of faded glory.The film makes you sad, not merely for the marriage that eventually dissipates, but also because it portrays a common story, young couple, just trying to endure daily life, and it becomes impossible.Good performances in a rather sporadic, but interesting message film.

58,aidanratesmovies,"Beautiful, Heartbreaking, Somber, and Brilliant",10,15 June 2020,"Incredibly well acted, heartbreaking, and still managing to be beautiful- Blue Valentine is a inspiring filmmaking standard to follow- that doesn't shy away from the real tragedies of life, and instead harnesses them in a stunning embrace. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are perfect in their roles as Dean and Cindy. Both deserve their awards recognition, and I feel both of their performances were criminally undermined by the Academy. The film can be a bit slow at times, but it feels well made through and through, and though their will be scenes which are hard to watch, they are often incredibly crafted. The script is brilliant, with a truly raw and emotional storyline- that handles the situation of new love and fleeting love so perfectly- it's impossible not to relate on some level. The direction is fantastic, with Derek Cianfrance giving some of his best work in this film. The cinematography is outstanding, and the music fits perfectly well for the film in such a subtle but beautifully somber way. In the end, Blue Valentine was not what I expected it to be, but with the movie in mind, it opens so many new doors and ideas for movies to explore in future years, and is so incredibly daring and thought provoking- you truly feel like a whole life is playing through upon the screen.
My Rating: 9.75/10",Blue Valentine
59,dierregi,Disappointing misogynistic tale,4,21 February 2012,"Described as a heart-wrenching tale about the end of a love story, this movie is in fact a misogynistic take on the dissolution of a marriage.Dean and Cindy, a working class couple who married in a rush and for the wrong reasons, are unable to save their relation when sex starts growing stale. We are told in flashbacks their story. Dean is uneducated but well-meaning, and works for a moving company. Cindy is a high school student, apparently much busier with her sex life than with her studies.They meet in a retirement home, to keep up with the depressing mood of the film. Dean is struck by love at first sight, Cindy not so much. She has a nasty boyfriend called Bobby. In fact, she is even pregnant by him, because selfishly and uncaring he forgot to take adequate ""protection"" during their sex encounters.After a couple of dates, Cindy reluctantly gives in to Dean's proposal of marriage. The reasons of her decision are unclear, apart from the fact that she does not want to abort Bobby's child, even if she does not seem in love with Bobby - or with Dean, for that matters. Bobby is out of the picture as a father and Dean seems merely infatuated, but he is still willing to take on the responsibility of a daughter who is not his.A few years after, their marriage is crumbling. Cindy decides she has enough and wants a divorce. This should come as a shock to the audience, but given the premises, it seemed to me like an inevitable outcome.Several gratuitous scenes highlight how the failure of the marriage is due mostly to Cindy. Dean might have a drinking problem, but at least he wants to keep the family together. On the other hand, the character of Cindy is presented as jaded and cynical.No chance is spared to degrade Cindy, starting from the numerous graphic sex scenes. They are uncomfortable and weird to watch, because Cindy does not seem to enjoy sex much. It is therefore unclear why she has so much. She is made to tell a rather brutal and bad-taste joke; she is presented as very promiscuous (thus uncaring and tainted); she is the one who abandon Dean in a motel without even bothering to wake him up; etc....Ultimately, she is the baddie and Dean the victim of her nasty personality... and so much for a ""love"" story without a heart.",Blue Valentine
60,valleyjohn,Very realistic yet utterly depressing.,7,13 March 2011,"Can a movie be utterly depressing yet still be good. Well Blue Valentine seems to prove that this can be the case. Relationships are extremely complicated things and seldom to movies get to the real nitty Gritty of what can go wrong ( and right ) once you are in one , yet Blue Valentine is very realistic , maybe too realistic for my liking. If there is a complete opposite to a Rom Com this is it. Maybe this was a little too close to home for me to enjoy but i certainly could appreciated it . Ryan Gosling is the one who really holds this movie up. Michelle Williams is good as the latter Cindy but is awkward and unconvincing as the younger , happier, Cindy. I'm also not sure the chronological order of the film works as well as the director intended but it's still a film that will provoke deep emotions in some people. Interesting Stuff.",Blue Valentine

62,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Blue Valentine (2010),9,14 December 2011,"Fantastically articulate analysis of real relationships. Blue Valentine arrives in a heavy shadow of controversy, after the attempted NC-17 rating. Just to clear things up, there is NOTHING here that offensive. It's more offensive that the MPAA would try and give a film like this that rating. The most difficult aspect of this film, is how close to life it is. Some may find it slow and boring, as there isn't anything that makes this a ""movie"" romance. You wont find any particular reason as to why Gosling and Williams fall in love, nor why they break up. As the movie flips between the beginning and the end of the romance, it captures those small moments that lead to something more, and the gradual escalation to a relationship breakdown. Williams and Gosling are wonderful, conveying the starry eyed young couple, and the bitter and distressed married couple. Their chemistry allows for moments such as WIlliams' awkward joke, to be delivered with charm and believability. Life as it is, relationships as they are, the film is shot with a crisp sense of reality, and respects the audiences intelligence enough to allow them to interpret their own morals.",Blue Valentine
63,Matt_Layden,Will crush your thoughts on love.,8,9 May 2011,"Blue Valentine follows the life of one couple as they fall in love with each other and get married and the heartbreaking realities that eventually destroy their relationship. I've been wanting to see this film since I saw the trailer. I think Gosling is a unique talent and Williams has been picking better roles with each film. The two of them together create a genuine and heartfelt performance in each other, which is the heart and soul of the film. The two work off each other so well that it never feels like two people acting on the screen. Most of the script was thrown aside and the director chose to let the two improvise, which gave it a more realistic and reactive urgency in their performances. In any other year, I could have seen Gosling nominated. He has the leading man looks that make all the ladies drool over him. He can easily have a wildly successful career in making movies catered to a certain audience, yet he chooses not to go that route. His film choices have been rewarding for him and us. Blue Valentine is the type of film he wants to be a part of and I'm glad he chooses such projects because it really lets him shine. Williams, as I have mentioned earlier, is getting more mature in her acting roles. She's been nominated for two Oscars now. Much deserved praise for their performances in this film.The film is told through two timelines. The first is the present timeline in which Gosling and Williams are married and have a child. Gosling is balding and smokes, Williams seems to have given up on herself and the marriage. It's in ruin, they both know this but don't want to admit it to each other or themselves. The second timeline is the past, where the two first meet, fall in love and seem happy. The two are intertwined with each other, so we see their happiest and most depressing times. This aspect of the film reminded me of 500 Days of Summer, where we would spend one day laughing and smiling at the fun times they would be having, the next scene would be them in tears, hating each other. Blue Valentine is a depressing movie, I would only recommend it to those who know what they would be in for. It's realistic in the portrayal of relationships. This isn't a romantic comedy where the guy falls in love, does something wrong and miraculously fixes things at the end so they live happily ever after. This film showcases real people, with real problems and no solution. Their are heartbreaking moments that leave you devastated and the truest thing behind it is that not one person is to blame. Both people are at fault for how their relationship has fallen. One has just given up completely, while the other tries, unsuccessfully to fight for something that might have never been there in the first place. Seek this film out, not for the controversial scene, which is more tame than any raunchy comedy. See it for a realistic portrayal of real people.",Blue Valentine
64,lewiskendell,Perfectly named.,7,5 June 2011,"Blue Valentine is painful and honest in its portrayal of the beginning and ending of a relationship that's destined not to last. This isn't the kind of movie you pop in for light entertainment, in other words. Imagine a more brutal version of (500) Days of Summer with far less focus on charm and neat storytelling effects, and more emphasis simply on chronicling what happens in the lives of two people. The non-linear style of storytelling means that we know how this story ultimately ends early in the movie, so even the happy scenes from earlier in the storyline have a bittersweet tinge of inevitability. Williams and Gosling were both great, there's really nothing else to say about their ""performances"". It's easy to forget that you're even watching a movie, at times. There's not a lot to criticize Blue Valentine about. It does what it sets out to do extremely well. Whether you should see it or not depends on your interest in a topic that's sure to be depressing to some.",Blue Valentine
65,bob-rutzel-1,Very Sad Story,7,23 May 2011,"Dean (Gosling) marries Cindy (Williams) who is pregnant with child. Dean loves life, Cindy and Frankie (Wladyka) their child, but Cindy has fallen out of love. Oh, oh, this can't be good. This starts with some very annoying close-ups. We see the whiskers, and skin pores to show you how annoying it was. We hoped this didn't go on for too long.The story is told in the present and in the past at the same time. Nice, eh? It took a while for me to figure it out, but I'll make it easy for others. When Cindy smiles a lot and Dean has close-cropped hair we are in the past. When Cindy does not smile at all and Dean has long hair we are in the present. Dean smokes an awful lot in both time periods. A couple is thrown together (Oh,no one helped. They did it all by themselves) and try to live out their lives, but the problems that come up are too big for either of them and Cindy wants out. Cindy knows that Dean has talents but takes low paying labor jobs. Also there is another twist to Cindy's thinking and she knows something Dean doesn't and this grates on her too. These kids really didn't know much about each other.Michelle Williams was nominated for Best Actress, but didn't get it. All the cast performed well. Sad stories like this should go directly to Dr. Phil and not to the big screen, DVDs etc. Okay, it was my fault thinking I would be entertained. A sad story is never entertaining. But, there is one good thing that came out of this: I was pleased with the ending. Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes,two scenes and one goes on for quite a while. Nudity: Yes. Language: Yes.",Blue Valentine

Starring Ryan Gosling, Michelle Williams, Mike Vogel, Ben Shenkman, John Doman, Maryann Plunkett, Faith Wladyka, Jen Jones, Marshall Johnson. (R)Tense, discomforting examination of a relationship between two people (Gosling, Williams) at two different time periods: the not-quite-halcyon days of quickly falling in love after their first meeting, and several years later (with a young child) as their marriage is coming apart. Delivered in a manner that would do kitchen-sink realism and John Cassavettes proud, co-writer/director Cianfrance refuses to pull or pan away as the actors bleed their souls in the moment; the cinéma vérité-style close-ups can be a bit much, but there are few signs of forced intimacy. Wisely doesn't try to isolate the cause of their struggles to easy incidents or explanations--much is suggested and much is also left unsaid. Tough to watch at times, and probably would have benefited from some minor pruning, but the dramatic impact is substantial and the leads are both flawless. Not recommended viewing for date night.81/100",Blue Valentine
67,bandw,Yet another failed marriage,7,1 February 2012,"Each failed relationship fails in its own unique way, and this movie details one such. It is hard for me to comment on this movie, since I have little negative to say about it, but I ultimately found it unsatisfying.As the couple in question both Michelle Williams (as Cindy) and Ryan Gosling (as Dean) give excellent performances and I believed their characters. The telling of the story by cutting back and forth between early times and six years later is effective. The scenes from the early days are touching, such as the scene that has Cindy doing a little dance in a store entryway to Dean's playing the ukulele. But any joy taken from the early scenes is overpowered by the sadness of the later ones, like the one where Dean tries to inject some romance into their failing marriage by booking a room in a hotel, a room billed as ""future world."" The phony trappings in that room, evoking a science theme with cold lighting, create a depressing backdrop and accentuate the deterioration of the marriage shown in the scenes there.A distinguishing feature of the movie is its realism. There are some fairly graphic sex scenes and some savage arguments that are distressing to watch. And, no matter what side of the abortion divide you are on, the detailed abortion scene, while depicting a process executed by a compassionate doctor, is difficult to watch.Though it is not explicitly delineated what went wrong with Dean and Cindy's marriage, the seeds of the discord were sown at the beginning. Dean starts out working for a moving company and winds up as a house painter. What he seems to want out of life is simply to have a job and be married and have children, even if the child on the way when he married may not be his. Cindy works in a medical doctor's office and wants more out of life than what Dean can offer. Given that setup, it is not surprising that things went wrong.If you want to see the ultimate film in this category, see Ingmar Bergman's ""Scenes from a Marriage."" The fact that there are so many failed marriages in the United States may account for why this movie genre continues to be popular, but after seeing this movie I wondered if I really needed to have seen another movie on the subject, even if well executed.",Blue Valentine

There were many moments in the movie, which left me entirely SpeechLess, the dedication of the Director ""Derek Cianfrance"" and actors ""Ryan Gosling"" & ""Michelle Williams"" can be seen through out the movie. Recently movie became into limelight when it got NC-17 Rating from Censor board which was later on much request and campaign turned into R-Rating. After watching the movie, I can understand that why it got NC-17 rating in first place, because the emotional destruction between two spouses was really painfully portrayed. There were many scenes in the movie which left me Dazed & Stunned. The scenes in the Futurist Room were extremely distractive; the portrayal of Ryan Gosling & Michelle Williams was so real that it was hard to not indulge along with them. The other scene which make in stress was ""When Michelle Williams goes for Abortion"" & ""when Ryan Gosling fight with Michelle Williams in hospital"". Those scenes are extremely powerful & destructively stressful. Where ""Rabbit Hole"" tries to cover its Stressful relationship between Nicole Kidman & Aaron Eckhart by Dark humor, Blue Valentine let it sink its teeth into our Skin.I literally don't have words to describe the performance of Michelle William, it was something really deep and Raw which is unexplainable for me. The diversity between Cheerful young Michelle Williams (Cindy) and Married Unhappy (Cindy) was impeccable. Just like Michelle Williams, Ryan Gosling's portrayal of a man who can't understand why Cindy's is ""out of Love"" was brutally Honest. We see people like that in our life, who wanted to be something but end up as Noting more than a doting husband and father but still somehow its not enough! The chemistry between Ryan Gosling & Michelle Williams is the soul of the movie. It's absolutely brilliant. Mike Vogel is an Eye Candy, sad he hasn't got his big Break yet. Kudos for director for using the shaking handy cam thing, which made the whole movie more realistic. Overall, Blue Valentine is emotionally Stressful & it requires a deep sensibility to appreciate the beauty of the movie. And once again it's the most Intense emotionally Stressful movie about ""Falling in Love and Drying Out of Love"".",Blue Valentine
70,Screen_Blitz,"Derek Cianfrance's testament on the agonizing truth is love is both powerful and heartbreaking, and most importantly, uncompromising",9,14 November 2017,"Blue Valentine is a love story that is not too pleasant to sit through. It is an uncompromising portrayal of marriage showcased in a form that shines light on the more brutal and inconvenient truth of how love is more complex than many people realize. In the world of Hollywood, many viewers have been accustomed with romantic tales that tap into the comfortable fantasies of love always been an adventure to the point where happy endings are almost always expected. Thus, many tend to be blind of the agonizing truth about how marriage is complicated in a way that is beyond our understanding. Directed by Derek Cianfrance, the film unravels a gritty testament of the tragedy that lies within a relationship between a husband and wife, and is driven by uncompromising performances by Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams who simply grab at your heart and never let go. Although the story is not a total downer, it nonetheless holds no bars on evoking a frown upon your face. This film follows Dean (played by Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (played by Michelle Williams), a married couple raising their five- year old daughter Frankie (played by Faith Wladyka). Dean is a high school dropout working as package handler for a moving company, while Cindy is nurse with more healthy habits unlike her husband who enjoys smoking and drinking early in the morning before heading off to work. At first, the couple appears to be enduring an normal, everyday marriage before the story dives into the downward spiral the two are facing as they go for a night-out in attempt to save their marriage. In the process, the story is intertwined with moments of when the two first met as young adults in their early twenties. Anyone who grows in expecting a light-hearted love story with an infectious romantic tone is in rude awakening. This movie provides a powerful and unsettling portrayal on the scorching complexity of marriage, and the events that transpire draw distressing parallels to the harsh reality of how marriage unravels in today's society, especially with the steadily rising rate of marriages ending in divorce. Amidst Derek Cianfrance's provocative storytelling, the driving forces behind this emotionally raw tale should be credited to the performances by Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams who share an immersive chemistry in the flashback moments showing the tender side of their relationship while boasting unsettling heat in the present day scenes showcasing the dour conditions of their marriage. Each minute they are on screen yelling and arguing converted with dialogue so authentic you can almost feel like you witnessing their rivalry in person. Intertwining the story are moments following the more tender side of the couple's relationship that adds a small amount of levity to the atmosphere. These moments shine with such an enamoring feel to the point where our hearts melt for what is anticipated to come. And Derek Cianfrance is not proves he does not believe in emotional manipulation which, in return, bears a more gripping sense of tragedy that is not impossible to leave more than a few wet eyes at the end. For those mature enough to take this journey, you may find those Nicholas Sparks stories as tear-jerking as you remember. Of course, that is not to be condescending. Blue Valentine is a powerful, albeit heartbreaking tale blistering with a raw truth how complicated love is, and as admirable as Gosling and Williams are in their roles; this is not meant to be entertaining but offer an important message that should not be taken lightly nor as a cry of discouragement. As a gripping humanistic drama, this movie makes for a worthy, if somewhat hesitant recommendation.",Blue Valentine
71,frankde-jong,It takes two .... to destroy a marriage,7,4 October 2021,"""Blue Valentine"" follows a young couple during a period of six years. During this period the tension in their marriage slowly builds up till breaking point. At last the couple goes on a ""rescue weekend"" to save their marriage. From the first moment on the mood of this weekend is very tense and the scene almost takes on horror qualities.There are a lot of films of failing marriages. Sometimes the story is told in chronological order (""Scenes from a marriage"", 1973, Ingmar Bergman), sometimes in reverse chronological order (""5x2"", 2004, Francois Ozon). But in ""Blue Valentine"" the story is told in random order. I think the main reason for this is to preclude the spectator to select the ""guilty"" spouse too early.After seeing the film in its entirety and putting the scenes in the right order in your head, I think the only conclusion possible is that there is no ""guilty"" spouse.There is however a difference in ambition. For one the marriage is the final destination, for the other it is a base camp from which to undertake a (career)journey. The question whether one is more ambitious on account of having the better education or is better educated on account of having the greater ambition remains unanswered.With Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams ""Blue Valentine"" has two actors who are among the top of their generation as leading actors.Director Derek Cianfrance used a remarkabe production technique. Pre production Gosling and Williams lived together for a while on a tight budget. After that they were so accustomed to each other that many scenes were shot in the first take.",Blue Valentine
72,Cosmoeticadotcom,Good,7,21 June 2012,"Blue Valentine is a film designed to stir debate, but not in the usual silly political nor emotional sort of way. Its debate is of a deeper and more profound measure, and that is it asks which of the two main characters profiled in the film is in the wrong? The film does its best to be evenhanded, and for every tick of the ledger against one of the major characters, an equally incisive demerit can be handed out to the other. However, the biggest demerit I can give regarding this 2010 film, directed by Derek Cianfrance, about the turmoil of a mediocre marriage, is the critical cribbing that abounds in essays and reviews of the film, online and off. And that cribbing involves the almost near-universal claim that this film follows the end of, or the dissolution of, that marriage. Yet, nothing of the sort can be convincingly construed from the film's contents nor its ending.Yes, the film, which bifurcates into flashbacks of how the married couple of Dean and Cindy Pereira met, and details a troubling two days, some years later, around the 4th of July, does have Cindy declare that she wants a divorce, but that occurs 15-20 minutes before the film ends, with Dean walking away, down a street, after some reconciliation has occurred. Also, given the volume of detail that we get on this couple's relationship, from the things actually shown in the two time frames, to those things easily inferred from those seen things, and the character portrayals of the two lead actors, Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, it's pretty obvious that, like most couples in this sort of relationship between two weak willed individuals, this run of troubling days is simply the latest incarnation of personal melodrama the two have jointly constructed, in fact, enhancing their bond, long term, due to its joint effort. And the film reinforces this with a few telling moments in the film wherein we see Cindy's parents' marriage, and hear of the marriage of her grandmother- two women Cindy clearly resembles; especially as she seeks Dean to be violent toward her, only to belittle him as 'not a man' because he refuses her invitations to be brutish. In short, this is not a film about the end of a marriage, but a film about 99+% of all marriages that last till death do us part.",Blue Valentine
73,napierslogs,"""Blue Valentine"" is tragically real, beautiful, and blue",8,29 January 2011,"Bathed in blue light, intimate romance, and raw emotion, ""Blue Valentine"" is a beautiful, but harrowing, exploration of one relationship. Cindy (Michelle Williams) wants to find love to get past her parent's hatred for each other; Dean (Ryan Gosling) is a sucker for romance and pretty blond girls. Too bad, as he believes, that the pretty ones are always the crazy ones.They rightfully chose to not just show us them falling in love, but also them falling out of love. It is bold in its intentions and with the unromantic route it chose to take. But it really succeeds because of the characters and the actors. These are well written characters that are brought to life and get under your skin because of Williams and Gosling. Undeniably the best performances of their careers. A well-deserved Oscar nomination for Williams and I was completely enraptured with Gosling more than I have ever been with his previous roles.Although I did get emotionally invested in their story, I think it was structured rather poorly. Timing always seemed off, and developments in their characters were too quick and out-of-the-blue. This does take away from its emotional impact, but I was still completely invested in Cindy and Dean. ""Blue Valentine"" is a very well made film for its $1 million budget with beautiful shots (particularly the fireworks lighting up the credits at the end), and it was not nearly as risqué and unbearably sad as I was led to believe. Recommended for those that can appreciate the tragic realism of life mixed in with the romance of soul mates falling in love.",Blue Valentine
74,hall895,Broken love,7,27 June 2014,"Love is great when it works. But what happens when it stops working, when the love is gone? Blue Valentine takes an honest look at a love that has failed, a marriage fallen to pieces. When we meet Dean and Cindy it is immediately obvious that their relationship is strained at best, toxic at worst. Their young daughter Frankie seems happily oblivious to the tension in the home. Dean dotes on his daughter, playing the role of the ever-loving father. Cindy is more distant, obviously frustrated with her lot in life. Dean might think things are OK as they are. Cindy clearly does not. She wants something else. Maybe she wants what she once had. Maybe she longs for something she never had. She takes out her frustrations on Dean. He of course doesn't take too kindly to this, he thinks he's a perfectly good husband. The relationship frays to the point of breaking apart. A marriage crumbles.This all sounds like it could make for a very depressing film and at times that is very much the vibe. But the film relieves the tension by telling its story in nonlinear fashion. We start with the relationship's death. But as that story plays itself out we continually flashback to the relationship's birth. We see Cindy and Dean meet and fall in love. And we begin to understand how in the end it could have all gone so wrong. How did they fall out of love? It's much easier to understand once you see how they fell in love in the first place. Director Derek Cianfrance does a fine job of putting all the pieces together, presenting his story in a very satisfying fashion. Had the story been presented chronologically by the end it would have been just too depressing to bear. And knowing the very specific problems that are to come later shines an entirely new light on the flashback sequences. You understand why this relationship which seems so perfect is actually doomed. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams do excellent work throughout, portraying the blissful young lovers and their bickering older selves. You would probably say that Dean is the more sympathetic of the two characters, though he is certainly not without his faults. Cindy at times is a little too cold to embrace, a woman who is brutally honest with her assessment of her situation. Dean doesn't appreciate that brutality, there are moments the audience won't either. This film doesn't try to sell the notion that love is always grand, that love conquers all. Sometimes love hurts. And sometimes love fails. Blue Valentine tells that story. Certainly not the most enjoyable story to see portrayed. But definitely a compelling story, wonderfully performed by Gosling and Williams and put together expertly by Cianfrance. Love may have failed but the film succeeds.",Blue Valentine
75,cultfilmfan,Blue Valentine,10,24 February 2011,"Blue Valentine focuses on a young couple whose names are Dean and Cindy. The film goes from the present to the past and vice versa to show several key moments and elements of this young couple's romance and what would lead to some very difficult times in their marriage that will eventually end up testing the both of them. When, I went to see Blue Valentine, I was in a very full theatre of other people who had decided to see it as well. By the end of the film I had heard several people while walking out of the theatre saying how depressing they found the film to be. Whether this was a complaint, or perhaps they did like the film, but still found it depressing, I do not know. So, I am going to start off by saying that if you are a film-goer who goes to the movies to be entertained and leave your troubles at home and basically outside of the theatre and anything challenging, depressing, or something that will sit with you and might not be the most comfortable experience and you would rather see two hours of pure entertainment, laughs, action and the otherwise to then return to your home and begin a new day, then Blue Valentine will not be for you. While the film was sad in many areas, I didn't feel it personally weighing down on me as much as probably some of the other members of the audience I was in. Perhaps this was because I had known what the film was going to be about and generally the mood and tone of it from other reviews and comments I had seen. Maybe also because I saw more than just hurt in this film. Yes, the film does chronicle a very difficult time in a couple's marriage where it could potentially end at any minute, but we are also shown scenes from their past when they really were in love and they had a real affection and care for one another. They were there for each other in difficult times, but also in the good times and would make each other laugh and brighten each other's day. Dean seems to have fallen in love with Cindy the moment he saw her and Cindy after she had given Dean a chance, seems to have gotten feelings for him as well. We see so much genuine love in this film, that it is not always depressing, or hard to watch. I think if the film had took the direction of not showing any marital problems, or dysfunction, or even simple arguments then it would not be realistic, or doing any real life relationships justice. Because we all know that sometimes the people we most care for, we do end up hurting the most. This may be whether it is a husband, or wife, or a sibling, parent, or it could happen in any number of different types of relationships. I liked that Blue Valentine took a cinema verite look and feel and gave us a film that will challenge us the viewer and to contemplate and think about our own relationships whether we are currently in one, or even reflecting on those from the past. Because who can honestly say they never fought, or even thought that the other person may just not be right for them. The performances by Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams as the young couple are fantastic. We see them through these loving moments and times of heartache and pain and it always feels believable and real. The writing showing how these characters are so different from one another and yet there was still something to connect them in the first place and the depth and intensity of their relationship at all times was so realistic and haunting and it was done in a fresh and contemporary way and I really liked how the film would go from the past right up to now and it shows us so much we may have missed about these people, had the director chose not to have gone that way. This is a film that will probably stay with you awhile after you have seen it because I know it did with me. It is a perfect film to talk about with others to get different views on why the characters did the things they did and open up a whole conversation about the film would probably not only be fascinating, but revealing about ourselves in a lot of ways as well. This film will leave an impact on you whether you found it challenging, but altogether a rewarding experience, or if you saw it and just left depressed and in a bad mood having wished you never saw it. Either way this film is quite an experience and I am glad I took it and got to see what these brave artists wanted to show us and I feel enriched and thankful for the experience.",Blue Valentine
76,Quietb-1,Choose a root canal over this one,3,29 December 2010,"In outstanding performances, Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams bare their emotions and their bodies.In ""500 Days of Summer"" they told you what day it was. In this Dark Days of Winter you have to pretty much figure it out for yourself.About the second time the Michelle Williams character screams ""I can't take it anymore"" I couldn't either. No amount of sex on the screen is worth the pain and suffering. No need to hang around for a happy ending as you know there won't be one. Not only that, what makes you think he won't be back for another round of physical and emotional abuse in a sequel? Speaking of physical abuse, the only time the Gosling character was alone at work, and not surrounded by his big moving company buddies, was when the writers needed him to be alone at work.The nonlinear story telling got tiresome. It takes you away from where things are in the relationship and back to the happy wedding day way too late to care. At that point it was as meaningless, as the writer forced, liquor store encounter with the old, but important boy friend.Anytime the family dog dies in the first ten minutes you know you are not in for fun movie experience.Interesting cinematography, ranging from reflections, to up too close and personal. Rather than a fly on the wall, you feel like a voyeur to a very intimate relationship.It appears they will market this movie on the cute little dance song on the street and the hot steamy sex.

Honestly, it's one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. It literally left me in a state of despair for the rest of the weekend, questioning my own life and my own relationship. It's a brutally honest, mercilessly cynical and painfully realistic dissection of marriage, love and romantic relationships as a whole, and it hits shockingly close to home. It depicts a marriage that seems downright dysfunctional, but is not all that different than many real ones, and the portrayal is so realistic that it's impossible to not be affected.It pains me to recommend Blue Valentine to anyone, because it's not a movie that can really be enjoyed. It's still a terrific one, though. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams deliver perfectly in extremely demanding roles, playing the protagonists in two different periods of time in their relationship. Both characters are extremely flawed and very realistic, and though I found Gosling's character to be mainly irritating and insecure, and Williams' character vicious, neurotic and selfish, a quick tour around the message boards right here on IMDb will show just how open to interpretation the situation is. It's a movie that can lead to hours of contemplation and debate, none of it pleasant. If I was feeling like making a wise crack, I'd say Blue Valentine does for marriage what Jaws did for the beach. But I'm too depressed to make any jokes right now, so I won't.",Blue Valentine
78,MihaiSorinToma,A disappointing story,6,27 August 2017,"It is the story of an apparently normal couple which faces a mid- life crisis and everything seems to fall apart. Their love seems to have vanished and the only thing that keeps them together is their beautiful daughter. Many frustrations were piled together from both sides and the whole relation seems to be on the verge of destruction. Is there anything than can be done and are the members willing to do it in order to save their relation?The movie presents a very hard situation in a unique way, alternating present moments with sequences from where it all began. It describes what happened and how it got in such a bad state but there is nothing impressing along the way. They're just presenting the lives of two people which came together by coincidence, with love at first site, which proved to be a big mistake. Her troubled past still marks her attitude while his lack of affection from the woman he loves unconditionally (the same one that he ""rescued"" a while back) drives him into a life full of troubles.It is boring, quite predictable, while doing nothing to maintain your interest. To make matters worse, it ends up as inconclusive as it can get, making the whole movie sort of pointless, really. The great presentation and good actors were the only upsides, making this one an average movie which I cannot recommend to anyone.",Blue Valentine

80,JohnRayPeterson,"Cinema vérité, Hollywood(not quite) style.",5,20 May 2011,"The IMDb storyline and summary provide a fair enough description of the movie. Checking the usual sources for movie ratings, I was surprised to see consistent high ratings. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are praised for their performances and I can't find it in me to disagree even if I did not enjoy the movie. Many reviews and critics are crediting director Derek Cianfrance for delivering realism of married life and an atypical story void of any Hollywood slickness if I can use that term. As I scroll through review after review and critic after critic, I start detecting a pattern; it's as if the reviewers and critics have just discovered cinema vérité (look it up on Wikipedia), a style more popular in the sixties French movies but still around and largely used in eastern European movies and emerging middle eastern cinema. If this sounds like bullshit to you, your cultural quotient is simply deficient and you're like people who only eat steak or chicken and with as little vegetables as possible and never would try other countries' dishes. I pity those fools, as would say Mr.T. Sure I eat steak and chicken but give me Brussels sprouts or asparagus with that and that's just fine, not potatoes only; snails, sea urchin, oysters, snakes, eels and sautéed crickets, yummy but I draw the line (for the moment) with maggots and worms. Same goes with movies; I draw the line at cinema vérité. I've seen enough of them, plenty, to recognise the genre; I tried to find something appealing about them and except for the obligatory sex scenes, I don't enjoy them. If you like the genre, good for you but it's not my cup of tea. Blue Valentine is more of attempt at cinema vérité than the actual thing; with time hopping back and forth that fails to explain how or why Gosling's character is a gentle soul at the beginning of the relation while violent later on, and Williams character seems detached at times and too serious at others. Those character traits are not seen to evolve; they just suddenly are different. I had the impression I was watching an amateur short story that went on forever; the editing style, if there was any, was irritating to me. Usually I declare my favourable bias for movies I write reviews about, and here I did mention clearly the opposite.Anyone who claims to be objective is full of it; that's why good radio or TV shows about movies have more than one critic and other medias list as many as they do. I'll bet many will watch this movie because they like Gosling and read the praise and high ratings. If you are disappointed with it, at least it won't be because of my review.",Blue Valentine
81,Likes_Ninjas90,Gosling and Williams are so truthful to their characters here that they will both be nominated for Oscars early next year,8,13 December 2010,"Over a number of years the marriage between Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) has corroded. The film moves back and forth through time, showing how they first met and fell in and out of love. In the present there is a complete lack of romance between them, as they balance their working lives and their relationship with their young daughter. When they first met though, Dean was starting out as a furniture removalist and could charm his way through most situations. Cindy was in college, studying medicine and had a boyfriend who was on the wrestling team. In these flashbacks we see Cindy looking after her sick grandmother. She meets Dean by chance one day when he is in the same building as her, redecorating a room for someone. He immediately becomes infatuated with her and persists in trying to meet her again. There have been numerous films that have chronicled the progression and detours of relationships throughout cinema. Woody Allen's masterwork Annie Hall (1977) is still the very best example of this, a near-perfect fusion of comedy and drama together. There are more contemporary additions that have played with both form and time though, like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and (500) Days of Summer (2009). Blue Valentine, directed by Derek Cianfrance lacks the glossiness of the latter. It's visually derivative, filmed with grainy, muted colours and tight framing but it's also more intent in trying to explore and develop character. It distinguishes itself from similar films by providing the most minute and intimate details for both of its central characters. The opening scenes are set in the present and Dean comes off as a dishevelled, boorish thug, swearing openly as a driver speeds past his home. The film then cuts back to an earlier time when he started off as a removalist. He bumbles his way through the interview but we see a more compassionate side to him when he redecorates a sickly old man's room. The juxtaposition of these scenes rounds his persona in such a way that it is impossible to have an entirely unfavourable perception of his character. From the comparison of these scenes there is a more tragic sense that Dean was once a decent young man who never grew to face life's more demanding responsibilities.Impressively, Cindy's story is given equal value to the narrative. There is a suggestion that as a result of her strict religious upbringing and her abusive father, she was rebelling against these forces through Dean. She too holds some deeply troubling and disturbing secrets of her own. The non-linear structure is fluently controlled by Cianfrance, easily distinguishing the past and present through the changing looks of the characters. It is employed not as a gimmick but as a powerful technique to enrich the depth of character through a completely honest view of their inner lives. Both Dean and Cindy are deeply flawed beings, but the contrast between their most damaging secrets and their more compassionate moments means they cannot be judged simplistically. It is an extremely confronting film at times, grounded so realistically that the later portions of the film are agonisingly difficult to watch. Gosling and Williams, who are both executive producers of the film, are so truthful to their characters here that they will both be nominated for Oscars early next year. Gosling has a particular fine understanding of the films structure because he creates an entirely believable contrast between Dean's personality from when he was young and when he is married. He shifts effortlessly from being a kind, funny but slightly frivolous young man to an older, more grizzled and suppressed individual, weighed down by his own aggression and a lack of affection. Williams has the quieter part here, drawn from the way in which Cindy's life has been continuously suppressed and dominated by male figures, from her father; her boyfriend in college and then eventually Dean. It is a consistently moving and emotional performance from her. Both actors blend themselves so thoroughly into these parts that Blue Valentine becomes as confronting and as personal as an on screen relationship can be.",Blue Valentine
82,Christian_Dimartino,The most overrated film of 2010.,5,17 July 2011,"The award for the most overrated film of 2010 goes to Blue Valentine, a well acted but shallow drama starring Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling. Its not that it was a terrible film, I just didn't think it was a very good one.The film is about an unhappily married couple. It focuses on how they met, and other things from the past, and the present, on how they have grown tired of each other and just plain don't love each other. Thats basically the whole film told for you.I saw this movie a few years ago, but back then in was called Revolutionary Road and it was a lot better. Director Derek Cerifriance does a good job of telling how the two fell in love. That half of the film is gripping.But he fails to tell how they fell out of love. We don't know why. That is why I think Michelle Williams is such a hatable character here. If the film showed Gosling having an affair or something, maybe I could side with her. But from what I saw, he was a good guy, and she was just shallow.All the film needed was an explanation. As far as I am aware, Gosling's character is a good guy who has been through a lot to be with her and to make her happy. And she is just shallow. I feel that that is the main reason why Blue Valentine fails to get my recommendation.C+",Blue Valentine

Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are exceptional in their characters. Three main reasons led me to see this work were: Michelle Williams, your Oscar nomination for the role, and for believing it was a novel, one of those that you fall in love with watching.

85,Andres-Camara,Pretty part bores,4,15 June 2017,"In general it is very long. It is very typical that the directors do not realize that the films are long, the problem is that they get bored. I take for granted that these types of films do not seek what romantic comedies are looking for, so we do not need to tell us so much about how they fall in love, we see them in love and with a little of the above would have been worth. The ugly part of the couple is better, but does not get to leave the average of the film so high to take away already boredom.I also believe that the assembly not being linear, does not help anything, because when you start to put again it inserts part nice and you fall again.They as actors, the truth is that I do not seem to be their best movie. In fact, I think this movie will come to something because they are now famous but at the time it surely went unnoticed. They do not have a great feeling when they are good, nor do you see a bad partner.Typical American independent film photography. There is no picture. Like a video camera.The direction is boring, leave a long movie. The camera in hand pulls me out and when I roll with more TV targets. I imagine that it leaves the actors freedom to act on the scene and it shows that there is nothing prepared because sometimes it is not seen.Anyway, I will not remember her soon.Spoiler: The escape to the hotel, is too badly taken.

87,Eumenides_0,"Sensitive, Humane Film About Relationships",9,28 February 2011,"Sometimes the simplest of stories make the best of movies. Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love with girl. Boy marries girl. Girl breaks up with boy. The story of Blue Valentine, an independent production filmed on a meagre budget of $3.5 million which boasts milestone performances by Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, who, supported by a sensitive and ferocious screenplay, elevate this movie to the status of modern romantic drama masterpiece.The movie chronicles the weekend that leads up to the dissolution of Dean and Cindy's marriage, intertwined with flashbacks showing them falling in love a few years before. The question running through the movie is, what leads these two to break up? Complex matters don't have the luxury of simple answers and this movie moves like an existential mystery inviting the viewer to intuit, through the unravelling of the couple's lives, the clues that explain the end of their love.The movie works in series of contrasts. The rose-tainted seduction and dating scenes from the past, which depict the growing intimacy between Dean and Cindy, collide against the harrowing scenes in the present, which show a loveless, routine marriage. The opening sequence is exemplary: Cindy prepares breakfast but their daughter, Frankie (Faith Wladyka), doesn't want her oat meals. Cindy upbraids her but Dean, instead of setting an example, starts playing with his food too. Cindy, the paragon of responsibility; Dean, the eternal child.Are Dean and Cindy two different to live together? Let's consider. When they meet Cindy is studying to become a doctor. In the present she's a nurse. Did the burden of marriage crush her dreams? Is she unfulfilled? Although there was love once, love wasn't what got the two together. Perhaps the most important decision in Cindy's life is having Dean's baby. The result of an unplanned night of sex, Frankie defines their lives. Dean is now a house painter. When she meets him he's working for a moving company. In the present she complains that Dean has too much potential to just settle for a crappy job. Cindy works a lot. Dean has a lot of free time. Frankie gets along better with him than with Cindy. He has more time to be with her.Cindy comes from a broken home. The child of a turbulent marriage in which fights at dinner time were common. She has trouble believing in love. We learn she started having sexual relationships at thirteen and that by the time she met Dean, at the age of twenty or so, she had had 20 to 25 partners. She's promiscuous, she can't have steady relationships. Dean, on the other hand, the moment he sees her is instantly struck by love. He argues that men are more romantic than women. Are they? If love is blind, marriage is oblivious. Dean's love has given way to the routine of being taken care of by his wife. Their relationship has become as sensitive as a fresh wound. At the start of the movie their dog disappears. Cindy finds him dead by the roadside. Dean's first reaction is to blame her for not keeping the gate locked. To spare Frankie of the tragedy they send her to her grandfather (John Doman) while Dean insists in having a night together at a cheap motel to have fun and rekindle the old spark. In the motel he ironically chooses the Future Room.Williams and Gosling are excellent in their roles. Each undergoes subtle physical changes to distinguish their present selves from their younger counterparts. They put on some weight and Gosling even sports a receding hairline plus glasses to complete his metamorphosis into a self-satisfied domestic slob. We only have to look at them to see the physical stress marriage has had on them.More impressive is their emotional range. In the past Dean acts like a person full of life and good spirits. Dean is unpredictable and romantic then. You can believe that a no-nonsense medical student could fall for him or that she could ruin her life dreams for him. Williams portrays her younger self as a shy and non-talkative person. She's the opposite of Gosling's chatterbox. The scene when Cindy, for instance, nearly undergoes an abortion is a testament to Williams' ability to transmits all the doubts and despair of her character with just subtle facial expressions.In the present their emotions are changed again, they're burned out, numb. Repulsion replaces love. Consider the disgust in Cindy's face when she tries to have sex in the Future Room – Williams shows so much discomfort that instead of being Dean's planned rebirth of intimacy between the two it becomes the most unpleasant sex scene in cinema in a long time. This scene is emblematic of their relationship – the inability to connect physically and emotionally leaves Dean without arguments to maintain their marriage other than resorting to begging and blackmail like not wanting Frankie to grow up in a broken home. What starts as love turns into a callous match where innocent bystanders are used as pawns.It took Derek Cianfrance twelve years to make Blue Valentine: the result is a humane, intimate movie about the possibility that true love may not exist. Some romantic dramas exist to make us feel good. But once in a while comes a movie that reminds us how complicated and relentless human relationships are.",Blue Valentine
88,doctorsmoothlove,Blue is better,9,30 May 2011,"Monday is (or was) Valentine's Day, which means couples get yet another lovey-dovey weekend. People have spent millions and will keep spending through this week for their sweethearts or hopeful partners. Dinner and a movie is the clichéd date night, particularly for our age group, so expect to see many at hot-blooded rom-coms like No Strings Attached and Just Go With It. The irony behind this cultural charade is many of these couples won't be together by the end of this year. Still, even if it weren't Valentine's Day, unrealistic romantic films would still be popular and profitable. Audiences are generally hesitant to see, much less enjoy, anything that doesn't reinforce their fantasies about how relationships (probably) unfold. Typical rom-coms create a falsehood that is perpetuated with even more mindless movies and break-ups.Couples, singles, and anyone else are encouraged to see a much better romantic film which is only playing at the Grande (Friendly Center), only if they can stomach not being force-fed pre-packaged good feelings. Its title is a calculated criticism against just that. In Blue Valentine, the featured couple cannot overcome their own incompatibilities and their marriage collapses. This alone doesn't make compelling drama, and the film isn't inarguably great. It is grounded by the emotional interactions of its main characters. They really act like reasonable people would near the end of a relationship. Experimental direction accommodates the story and elevates what would otherwise be tepid filmmaking.Director Derek Cianfrance plays with the narrative, showing their first encounters, courtship, and marriage while the impending separation occurs in real time. Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) are a young couple with a daughter under five and jobs that take up most of their days. They have reached a point in their relationship where neither person appears to be in love with the other. They have no compelling reason to divorce, and their daughter is a compelling reason to stay together. Dean suggests they take a day to themselves at a cheesy love motel to rekindle lost passions. Cindy perfunctorily agrees perhaps because she just wants time away from work or because her boss is a misogynist. Dean has little to do with it, though he still has a presence in her life. She is much more important to him, and he reminds her of this during the whole movie. She recalls the woebegone era of their courtship as close-ups and colored filters separate her from her husband.Another timely irony of Blue Valentine is Williams' Academy Award nomination for her role. She is deserving of it, for sure, but her character is not the anchor of the story. Dean dominates the marriage, unaware of the feelings of his wife. He is in love with the idea of being with her than the actual her. When she doesn't want to sleep with him, for example, he goes crazy and wrecks her office. Ryan Gosling makes the role work by never allowing the situation to affect his performance. There are many moments where he could have lightened his behavior and lessened the film's impact but that does not happen. Williams' role is actually less nuanced than Gosling's. Cindy is reactionary to Dean's behavior, and the power of her performance is her many rebuttals of his delusional love.Blue Valentine is an evocative film that encourages multiple viewings, and ideally, viewings with other people. In that regard it's a great date movie. Watching it could actually help couples figure out if their relationship has future potential or arm singles with ammo against fiery blind dates that seem unavoidable at this time of year. Just ignore the trailer and be careful when talking your partner or whoever into it.Recommended",Blue Valentine
89,rubenm,"An honest movie, but what's the point?",4,25 July 2011,"What's the point? That's what I kept thinking while watching this film. I was waiting for some sort of plot development, for something meaningful to happen, for a story with structure, a beginning and an end. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I expected too much. Maybe this was not meant to be more than a slice of life of a young, struggling couple, who are already bored with each other only a few years after they have fallen in love. But I'm sorry to say: it bored me. Don't get me wrong, usually I love indie movies. But this film shows that just being indie doesn't guarantee a good movie. This movie has a lot of fans. And I can understand why. This is not a make-believe story from Tinseltown. This is a very honest film. About the real lives of real people, with real problems and real frustrations. The two lead actors have clearly put their hearts and souls in it. But good films about real people are very hard to make. Harder even than a thriller or a comedy. Seeing Blue Valentine made me think about Another Year, a film I saw last year, made by British director Mike Leigh. I wrote a very positive review then, mentioning that the great quality of this film was that it shows real people and real lives. Why did I like Another Year and dislike Blue Valentine? I think it's because the script of Another Year was very well structured, and Blue Valentine's is not. I'm still wondering why the movie started off with a missing dog that had nothing to do with the rest of the story. Maybe I just don't get it.(PS One thing I absolutely loved about this film was the wonderful song 'You and Me' by Penny and the Quarters.)",Blue Valentine
90,christophe92300,Could have been better,7,26 October 2012,"Blue Valentine is based on an ultra classic story, yet the editing based on flashbacks arouse curiosity and makes the movie interesting.

91,TaylorYee94,Emotional because it feel so real,9,20 August 2021,"In real life, love cannot always be ecstatic, shiny, and beautiful. Love can turn into hatred, become responsibility or burden, or fades away. Love sometimes win, but other times love fails in ugliest fashion. 'Blue Valentine' is realistic as heck because it shows the other side of what most romance films decide to present about love: how a couple falls out of love. A story is so truthful that it hurts.Editing of the film juxtaposes current agony and bliss at the beginning of love. When Dean and Cindy go their separate ways, the wedding scene overlaps, the happiest moment of their relationship. Editing broadens the gap between the past and the present, making heartache even more painful. Also, sequence of scenes of past and present is placed in appropriate order. For example, when Cindy meets Bobby in the market accidentally, it shows the past scene when Cindy used to date Bobby After Dean's line 'Baby, you made a promise to me, okay? You said for better or worse.', audience can watch the wedding scene, making a vow to each other. The director does not leave the audience hanging. Rather, he lets viewers walk along with characters, reducing the distance between characters and audience and increasing intimacy. Therefore, the director succeeds in drawing great deal of empathy from viewers, making it feel as Dean and Cindy's problem is my friends'.Cianfrance's pace of the movie resembles how the relationship dies. When one decides to end the relationship, it is usually not a clear cut. 'This is the end' moment comes once a month, once a week, once a day, and multiple times a day. It is rather gradual process. The relationship of Dean and Cindy is similar to that, a dying fire. Even from the start, it is clear their love is fading away, but there is still a hope. They make an effort to rekindle what they had in the past, and it is portrayed that they still care for each other. However, the plot gradually reaches the climax, the hospital scene, and the last flame would be Dean finding the missed wedding ring. How they ended is realistic as heck because it is not plain black and white. It goes back and forth. They yell, remind their vows, hug, and become confused saying 'I don't know what to do' which is very grey area, exactly like how the real love ends.Camera work and acting performance add genuineness and a sense of reality. How the camera moves is very friendly, not formal. It moves freely. The director does not necessarily position the shot in the middle. It brings audience closer to the characters. Gosling and Williams's acting is just perfection. Complicated characters and episodes, but they nail it so easily.",Blue Valentine

93,bob_meg,Simply lacerating,10,30 May 2011,"If the subject matter of ""Blue Valentine"" doesn't make you wince and draw tears, the sheer eloquence of the script and the nerves-laid-raw performances will --- though those would be tears of joy.What really gives this movie its power is how universal its theme is: How many couples do you know whose marriages have ended in divorce? You'll ask yourself how it happened, how they got from A to B. Blue Valentine doesn't really offer any solutions as much as it lays out the ingredients for disaster, and lets you put the pieces together from there.The film follows the juxtaposition format, where scenes from the present are contrasted with scenes from the past, and this is not always easy to do or effective. It's much to Derek Cianfrance's credit that these transitions are so seamless and downright hard to watch in the vividness of their relief.Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams embody Dean and Cindy with obvious meticulousness. It's hard to believe there isn't a little of the characters that they don't know intimately. The level of frustration, anger, rage, guilt, and madness they bring to the screen doesn't come cheap.You get the impression that Dean was always Dean and hasn't changed (or evolved) much in their six year marriage, and whereas he was enough for Cindy at the time of their courtship, he isn't enough now. The sheer impotence Williams' character walks around with on this score, can be agonizing to watch. At times, it's like you're watching a caged animal.The photography, the supporting performances, and the music by Grizzly Bear is sublime. It's not a happy date-night movie, but maybe it should be a required cautionary tale for those heading into serious relationships.",Blue Valentine
94,rooee,Nobody Baby But You And Me...,7,23 January 2011,"...So goes the tagline for this melancholy wallow in a love that's turning into a labour.At times Blue Valentine plays out like a blue-collar Revolutionary Road. Mendes' characters were brimming with ambivalence and guilt: Given what we have, we don't have the right to feel unhappy. Cindy (Michelle Williams) and Dean (Ryan Gosling), by comparison, have every right – and boy are we going to know about it before the 112 minutes are up.The film uses a fractured, to-and-fro narrative, designed to show how the relationship has developed (and decayed) over time; how the same physical motions – in gesture, in sex – drained of the same volume of affection become meaningless. This technique, though purposeful, seemed a bit condescending to me, as if an audience might lack the concentration to perceive such echoes without recourse to juxtaposition.As executive producers and leads, the feeling that this is an acting showcase for Williams and Gosling is never far away. But what a showcase it is. Williams, in particular, cements her place as one of the most interesting and daring actors of her generation. She plays Cindy like a clenched fist. The lack of love in her parents' household points the way to a teenage procession of love-substitutes. Then, pregnant, as she lies cradled, child-like, in Dean's arms, they decide to make a family; and in rebirth there is the hope and optimism missing from her youth. Dean, meanwhile, fights a constant, sometimes violent, battle against expectations: his own; Cindy's father's; Cindy's.Director Derek Cianfrance shoots the actors almost entirely in close-up, delivering an intensity occasionally bordering on the unbearable.

He had been a high school jock, clean cut, and local. There are some good scenes. My favorite involved our male lead helping an old man move into his retirement home room. He shows real compassion for the man. But we also see that he's spooked by the notion of aging.Most importantly, we never get an explanation for why this girl is so monotone, rarely shows emotion, and has such low expectations for herself. Other than the fact that her parents had a loveless marriage or her dad was a verbally abusive guy. She was so boring.Essentially this is a tale of two losers who have no idea how to live a life. Meanwhile, like most characters in modern films, they have no God or code.Ryan Gosling does have that wounded soul anti-hero vibe, but how many times can he access that without it becoming redundant?This was a snooze-fest with a few good argument scenes and poignant moments. To their credit, there are few if any indie music interludes.",Blue Valentine
96,Marc_Israel_365,more typical than we'd like to admit,7,6 January 2014,"As with many great movies that are tough to watch (""One Flew Over The Cuckoo' Nest"" and ""Taxi Driver"" come to mind) we want to go deep into a subject, here being relationships and marriages, and yet we know (the payoff) isn't going to be warm and fuzzy. ""Blue Valentine, title taken from the Tom Waits song, delivers the goods as well as the bad and the ugly that is who many of us become in strained relationships. Who wants to admit that we are part of the destruction of our own ideals? Yet the drama seems pretty darn real as played out by Executive Producers Michelle Williams, as the girls who wants better but is constantly ending up with men who are more interested in bending her over than holding her close, and Ryan Gosling, our ambition-less ne'er-do-well who ended up with girl out of her decision to keep a child that may not even be his. They go as far as they can until someone has had enough. Someone has pointed out that this may sadly be the story of 90% of American women and that was the prevailing revelation that haunted me throughout the film. Williams is as sympathetic as Gosslings' character is is eternally teenager charming and adult like failure. Every scene is carefully set up but in the end, we're possibly looking into a sad mirror. I may like it more on next viewing or decide otherwise but I can't say I wasn't affected.",Blue Valentine
97,cat_ranchero,Excellent!...,8,13 January 2013,"The two central performances from Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are truly excellent. They take the audience through a whole range of emotions and back again! The film is shot using quite a lot of hand-held camera; but not too shaky; which makes for a realistic feel to the drama. To me it seemed a little odd to show just the beginning and the end of the relationship; maybe I missed something, but I wanted to know what happened in the middle. Could be it was doomed from the start. I enjoyed this one and would watch it again (making sure I was in the mood first); definitely worthy of my recommendation.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.4/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Blue Valentine
98,in1984,Nicely Acted Cliché Melodrama,3,19 February 2011,"Yes, it's nicely acted. But beyond that and the mystery of what, if anything, it's going to be about, there's really only clichés and melodrama and enough nudity to to keep male viewers watching. Take out that and you really just have a TV movie.Amongst the other problems is the writer/director outsmart themselves. In trying to capture some meaning or add to the film, they end up creating distractions and distortions. Reading through the reviews, it's clear that the only consistent meaning that comes through involves broken marriages, sadness, and depression (i.e., the Blue).As for Williams and the sex scenes, watching Williams do sex scenes is like watching a little girl. It's not her strong point. I'd opt for No Strings Attached if you want a story involving a smart, young, female doctor in training and Winter's Bone if you want a young Williams look-alike dealing with a difficult, sad situation and children.",Blue Valentine
99,markgorman,Not bad. But missed an emotional trick,6,28 January 2011,"What a curiously and disappointingly unengaging movie this is.It manages to create two great acting vehicles for Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams and contrive to leave you uninvolved and remarkably unsympathetic despite performances that have been talked about as Oscar contenders.The fact that the movie has ended up with but a single nomination for Williams says a lot, because, frankly, it's not that good. Incidentally I agree that Williams puts in a better shift than Gosling, albeit both are fine pieces of work.Gosling's problems start with very poor make up work. He ages maybe 20 years in a film that spans 5 or 6.But the real problem is with the film's structure and, I suppose, the script. One is simply not convinced by the very simple plot vehicle that a couple insanely in love lose every iota of desire or affection in a very short period of time. Well, Williams' character does. Gosling seemingly degenerates from charming cheeky boy into alcoholism almost overnight and Williams' disdain for him is frighteningly sudden. And it's down to the script. It's just too black and white. There is no transition. The film's construction is based on flashback and whilst this works on paper, it doesn't fare well on screen because it's just too flakey.Not only is Gosling's character a bit unbelievable but the casting of Williams' ex makes differentiation between the two (an important plot device) really difficult. (exactly the same problem blights The Departed). It's a bit of a mess.On the plus side, Williams' performance really is very good and deserving of a nomination that will not convert because it has Portman's name on old Oscar, and I liked the cinematography a lot. It works on a really tight depth of field, very tight cropping and a hand held feel which is designed to make the film feel intensely intimate, and at times it does, particularly i the sex scenes.But, overall it's too messy. It's sort of sloppy and despite being the kind of movie the producers, I'm sure, expected us to shed a tear at it didn't even come close.",Blue Valentine

The dialog appears to be improvised and the hand held camera makes it look like a documentary. That in itself would not normally doom a film, but the problem with ""Blue Valentine"" is that both characters are totally unlikable and we never really care about them. Dean is an alcoholic high school dropout and Cindy is a nurse who marries him because she can't do any better.The main problem with ""Blue Valentine"" is that it is extremely boring. It is like watching paint dry. If you like watching depressing lowlifes mumbling for 2 hours, you might like ""Blue Valentine."" Otherwise, be advised to stay away.",Blue Valentine

It is one movie which will have a deep impact on you when you are done watching. Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) are a married couple with a daughter. The story deals with the delicate moments of their relationship from how it started to how it ended. Gosling and Williams give the performance of their careers depicting both the subtle and excited emotions with precision. The back and forth narrative style works to it's advantage along with excellently written conversations. For a movie dealing with a subject like this, it runs on a good pace with terrifically built characters and their situation.",Blue Valentine
102,dallasryan,You Always Hurt...,10,15 July 2012,"A film doesn't get any better than this one. Seriously, this is one of the best films ever made, it's in my top 50 best films of all time(actually it's number 30). The songs are haunting to what is going on in the story and you, the viewer, will never hear these songs, from this movie, in the same way again. This movie is what acting is all about. Gosling and Williams, the two main leads, are sparring the whole way through, and they go through every gamut of human emotion in Blue Valentine. Great acting is an excellent fencing match, the actors are sparring/fencing one another and this movie is the greatest example of that wonderful fencing match that is otherwise known as acting. Real and true acting. This film is like a lot of David Mamets attempts at writing a film, but the difference is this film really great, where Mamet is lucky if he can just write a fairly decent film, he should really stick to plays because Mamets films are boxed in, which are closed off to us, plus most of them are contrived garbage(with the exception of a few). Blue Valentine is free as a bird, not closed off at all, it goes all over the place in the most humanistic, sincere way possible. Blue Valentine will leave you, the viewer, feeling numb for days because it will probably strike an emotional chord with about 90 percent of you. It's a sad film and a film that will probably leave you in tears for how deeply sad it is and for how deeply real it is ergo how deeply will effect you. Most Films have the lovers fall in love, and then they get married, end of film. Those films and most films want us to buy into the fact that everyone lives happily ever after, therefore that is indeed why they always end it with the couple happily in love and just getting married. Blue Valentine has the guts to face the facts of life, to go where most of us don't want to go, where most of us don't want to face, which is reality. Blue Valentine goes there and makes an exceptional, artistic film on reality, and we all need a dose of reality sometimes. This is not a movie for people that don't want to see reality, but it's for those who want to see an artistic masterpiece of filmmaking, and the reason it is an artistic masterpiece is because of it's reality.",Blue Valentine
103,Bob Pr.,Two slices of life,9,19 February 2011,"This is the story of the start and disintegration of a 6? year marriage between Cindy (Michelle Williams) & Dean (Ryan Gosling) that probably should never have happened. Both partners came from dysfunctional families in which they never learned how parents would wisely choose partners and relate with them to have rewarding relationships. Cindy's father had a terrible temper, was abusive to his subservient wife and was distant, not very warm, with his daughter. When Dean was quite young, his mother ran off with another man; he was raised by his father who then became involved with various women. Cindy became sexually active at 13 (looking for love?) and by age 21 she'd had at least 25 partners. Dean dropped out of high school (lack of interest) and worked as a laborer for a moving company &/or as a house painter. Cindy had early goals of being a doctor but went to nursing school. They accidentally meet when Dean helped move an elderly man into the nursing home where Cindy was visiting her grandmother. Their meeting leads to dating (and sex). Cindy enjoys Dean's footloose attitude but she becomes pregnant. She very nearly gets an abortion but changes her mind at the very last minute and decides to marry Dean. (But it's not clear to Cindy or us viewers that Dean is, for certain, the father). Cindy gives birth to a daughter, Frankie, whom they both love. But gradually, their differences become more pronounced, as do their arguments which show no listening to or understanding of the other. Cindy wants Dean to use his talents to make more of himself; Dean is content with their family status quo. A sentence in Roger Ebert's review captures their differences quite well when he wrote that, to Dean, his marriage with Cindy is the RR station while Cindy wants their marriage to be the train. She finally demands a divorce which he argues heatedly, futilely against.The film's story is told in a variety of intermixed cuts which show their lives at various life stages: when Cindy was a nursing student & spending her required day in a wheelchair (to better understand those patients who must use them), or 'servicing' her then boy friend (a male nursing student) in a linen closet --arguments between Dean & Cindy that don't resolve or end --happy times before they married --what they did on their first date--etc.--etc.There are slight hints about their futures: a doctor in the hospital where Cindy works seems interested in her (but for what reasons?). And as Dean leaves Cindy and Frankie, it's a 4th of July evening, fireworks are going off for Independence Day. How will Dean use his new undesired independence? --follow a path similar to the one his father took? Or a different one? Has either one grown from this experience? Will Cindy achieve a fulfilling second marriage? What will Frankie's life script be? We can only guess.I found the flashbacks intermixing so many stages a bit confusing; their ages and appearances didn't differ that much over the few years. Scenes with Frankie obviously were after they married but, when she wasn't there...? I often unsuccessfully hoped to see the presence or absence of wedding rings to tell: is this a scene before their marriage or at what stage in their marriage?After reflection, my rating now is 9 of 10, 1 or 2 points better than immediately after seeing it. ""BV"" doesn't give any answers, instead it generates a LOT of worthwhile discussion and thinking. I'm a retired psychologist/marriage & family therapist and I (sadly) found the characters and events to be absolutely, 100% true to life. I would have given it a 11/10 if not for my problems in keeping its flashbacks correctly ordered. Unique movie, destined to become an enduring classic. And it dramatizes some truths so well, I suspect it'll also come to be used in a number of training programs on marriage & family processes; I'd sure use it in those I taught.",Blue Valentine
104,ghost_dog86,Blue Valentine: A pessimistic look at relationships.,7,27 January 2011,"Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole Ashland  This quirky and sometimes off-putting film, ""Blue Valentine"" has one of  the most well constructed story lines seen all year. From  writer/director Derek Cianfrance and starring a destructively engaging  performance by Ryan Gosling (Half Nelson) and Michelle Williams  (Brokeback Mountain), ""Blue Valentine"" chronicles the rise and fall of  a relationship gone sour. Starting at the end of the relationship, and  fading in and out of past memories of their courtship, this film is a  gritty look as how people grow apart over time.  Praise: Some have said, ""Blue Valentine"" is ""500 Days of Summer""  without the happiness and I would agree whole heartedly. The story puts  two people with STRONG relationship issues in a room together and has  them duke it out. The performances from this small cast are amazing to  watch (even though the characters being played are at times unlikable)  and when it is all said and done, Ryan Gosling may go down as the  greatest actor of my generation, after another Oscar worthy performance  here.  Flaws: As raw and hard hitting as ""Blue Valentine is, there is a slight  disconnect between the audience and these two characters. In the end  this may be seen as a film about two unlikable people breaking up. The  problem with that is, if the two main characters are so unlikable, the  audience may cease to care about them or what happens to them. The  other semi-flaw with this film is that it is very manic depressive.  That is to say that every scene was either extremely high or extremely  low. There is hardly any transition explaining why Gosling's character  and William's character hate each other (to the extent that they do) by  the end of this film.   Side Note: This is the most adult film of 2010. And I am not just  talking about the nudity. Having been cut from its previous NC-17  rating in pursuit of a wider release, down to an ""acceptable"" R rating,  ""Blue Valentine"" is still working on a different level of adult drama  that many under the age of 18 may not understand. Exploring the avenues  of divorce, the different reasons why people fall in and out of love,  staying in a broken relationship because of children, evolving  sexually, and abortion, it really takes more than cutting out a few sex  scenes and naked bodies to make this a film for teenagers and adults  alike. Long story short: This is the most adult film of 2010.   Final Thought: This is definitely one of the most interesting films of  the year. Capturing the true human condition in everyday life between  two people who may have loved each other at one point, but have lost  (over the years) whatever it was that had brought them together to  begin with. ""Blue Valentine"" is a film worth checking out but it is a  downer, so viewers beware. Sometimes one has to be in a certain mood to  watch a depressing film like this. Example: You can't watch  ""Schindler's List"" and expect to be in a joyous mood afterwards. And  that's what ""Blue Valentine is; it's a Holocaust of a relationship film  (not to downplay the Holocaust).",Blue Valentine
105,theinaniloquent,"""Nobody baby but you & me""",10,22 February 2012,"The film centers on a contemporary married couple, charting their evolution over a span of years by cross-cutting between time periods.We've all seen the cliché love-stories. We've all seen how they begin and end. A boy and girl fall in love, have a fight, then at the end they miraculously get back together, with a happy song playing in the background. With Blue Valentine, it's time you learn that love is not always the best thing. You go through a few bumps along the road, and sometimes, that girl your with it just not for you. The thing I liked best about this film is how depressing it could be. That sounds a bit wrong, but if a film can be real, then it's surely for me. The first thing I wanted to say is how great the acting in this film is. Ryan Gosling surprises us left and right, and in this film he shows yet another side of him. I've yet to see one film of Michelle Williams, but in this film she plays so good! She plays the perfect deception of a girl who's lost in this world, where she would give to any guy. The other thing I loved about this film is how you root for both people in the relationship. Ryan Gosling's character, Dean, was loving at first but then seemed to abuse his position in the relationship. Michelle's character, Cindy, was clearly a bitch but it all made sense. This also ties in with the structure of the film. The beginning starts off at the ending of their relationship, where then it transitions into the beginning of the relationship. The structure somewhat reminded me of (500) Days of Summer, although the two films are completely different in their own ways. (500) Days of Summer was a real deception of romance, but it relied on comedy to balance the two feelings out. Blue Valentine, on the other hand, uses this depressed (almost haunting) feel of a relationship, and it was more real in a way. I love this movie, and tops off with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind for the best romance movie. It's surely not a movie to watch on a date, but it makes you think about things. With great acting, a GREAT soundtrack, (yet again, Lakeshore Records) and a great structure, I recommend this film for a different side to the story; the real side. 10/10.",Blue Valentine
106,Gresh854,A Truthful Love Story,8,15 February 2019,"You're darn right I saw this depressing, go-to currently single person's movie on Valentines Day!Derek Cianfrance-an underrated big fish of a director + writer swimming in a vast pool of overselled, featureless present-decade creators-furnishes us with the most down-to-earth romantic allegory ever concocted. Blue Valentine is a lugubrious insight into the likelihood of safeguarding love, and the speculations that are emanated from it that may or may not-but most likely may-become lethal in its never-ending strain of dreariness.Cianfrance's unequivocal gift in refining amateur story chronologies-a talent also exemplified in his abundantly underappreciated knockout, The Place Beyond The Pines-allows the film to voyage back and forth from two opposing time orbits within seasonable perfections. Cianfrance has a knack for directing tonally unswerving patterns while sweating out astonishingly sensible performances from both Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. (Verdict: B+)",Blue Valentine

The film depicts a married couple, Dean and Cynthia Pereira (Gosling and Williams), the transitional shifting of their romantic beginning and the dissolution of their marriage several years later. The film is told in a nonlinear narrative so we can see the subtext of the characters involved.
The film did not actually entertain me as it did set a tone for realism in the tradition of real couples. It was moving, insightful, creatively directed and well written. The characters are dynamically portrayed by Gosling and Williams, which Williams was nominated for an Oscar, but Gosling was not. I enjoyed the tempo and plot and how well it flowed through the almost 2 hour time frame. Traditionally need more film with substance such as this. I give it a high 7 out of 10.",Blue Valentine
108,ScottDMenzel,"""Blue Valentine"" is a realistic and somewhat depressing film about falling in and out of love.",7,24 October 2010,"""Blue Valentine"" is truly an independent film. Everything from the way it is shot, to the acting, to the storyline, to the realness screamed indie! ""Blue Valentine"" has a simple storyline. It's a movie about two people, Cindy (Williams) and Dean (Gosling) who fall in love. I will warn you now that this is not your typical love story. This film shows everything from how a relationship forms to how it can turn into a utter nightmare. ""Blue Valentine"" is realistic, full of raw emotions, and showcases two great performances but does that mean it's a great film? Well I will break that down for you in the next few paragraphs.Just think of ""Blue Valentine"" as a independent or poor man's version of ""Revolutionary Road"" with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. ""Blue Valentine,"" as I stated in the above, is a very independent film. Cindy and Dean portray the average blue collar American couple. From the trailer, you don't really know what the film is about besides the fact that there will be a random and somewhat humorous song and dance number by Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling in the film. The movie is about falling in and out of love. It shows you how once you begin to live life, work, and have a child how life changes and not always for the better. It's a very raw and in your face kind of film. Why this film got slapped with an NC-17 rating is beyond me? There are some realistic love scenes in the film, however, nothing to raw that warrants that harsh of a rating. I don't get why MPAA got so tough on this film.I always enjoy Ryan Gosling in his independent projects and this one is no different. He was a really good hipster in this film. Without giving too much away from the film, there is one scene where him and Williams are arguing and the emotion is so real and powerful. Gosling hasn't been this solid in a film since ""The Believer."" As for Michelle Williams, well she is another great actress. I always enjoyed her work but like Gosling, she hasn't really had many mainstream hits. I think Williams is a talented independent actress but I don't know if she will ever be a huge scarlet. It's OK though because a lot of the best actors and actresses never make their way to being huge leads. Williams will hopefully be noticed this year for her performance in this film.This film was written by three different people and when there are normally more than two writers attached to a project, I tend to worry. Why it took three people to write such a simple screenplay seems odd but maybe Derek Cianfrance, Joey Curtis, and Cami Delavigne put a little bit of their relationship experience in the screenplay. I don't know for sure but this looked and felt like a realistic story at times like the writers had a similar experience. Gosling's character seemed a bit out there and was never really explained that well in the film. I didn't quite get why they didn't do a better background on his character. Also, there was no middle of the relationship. It seemed to jump from good to bad and that hurt the chemistry of the two leads. Cianfrance also directed the film. He had some really good scenes where he captured the emotions of the characters perfectly but than others where he didn't do so well. Also, it should be stated that most of the scenes in the film were written and then shot flashback to the present. It fit the film well and helped overlook some of the relationship potholes in the film.Overall, ""Blue Valentine"" was a depressing, heart wrenching, and well acted piece of cinema. It didn't blow my mind as much as I would have liked it too but than again maybe I was expecting too much from a film with an 8 million dollar budget. As previously stated, ""Blue Valentine"" can simply be summed up as a poor man's version of ""Revolutionary Road."" With no disrespect to Williams or Gosling, Kate and Leo pulled the trouble relationship off better. While Gosling and Williams were both extremely believable at times and showcased some raw emotion, their chemistry wasn't as strong as the I would have liked I think as the characters got older, they just seemed so different from one another. Gosling got so weird as he got older and since it wasn't truly explained why, the film lost points for that. I think the big missing element was the storyline in the middle of the relationship, which was there but not detailed. The story seemed to go from bad to good with no middle. This was the film's weakness and why the two leads didn't have has good of chemistry at times. If you can ignore a few missing plot holes and try not to focus on the inconsistency of the two leads chemistry with one another than I would say you should really be able to appreciate the film. I am trying not to be too harsh because I did enjoy the film a lot and it featured some terrific scenes even if they were extremely depressing.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Blue Valentine"" is a 7 out of 10. Not the best film of the year but definitely a realistic and raw look at relationships.",Blue Valentine
109,RockPortReview,Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling Rock!,9,3 April 2012,"Michelle Williams received her first Best Actress Academy Award nomination for her role as Cindy, a young wife and mother in the 2010 film ""Blue Valentine"". She stars opposite Ryan Gosling (Dean) who together portray one of the most realistic and heartbreaking relationship stories in years. Directed by Derek Cianfrance, the film was rated NC-17 by the out dated and out of touch morality police who call themselves the MPAA. Once again they argue that human sexuality that is frank and honest is worse than any brutal and bloody torture violence. After an appeal the film was later downgraded to an ""R"" rating.This film is both emotionally painful, but also heart felt and endearing. It jumps back and forth between the beginning of Cindy and Dean's courtship, marriage, the birth of their daughter Frankie, then there bitter destructive end. Cindy is a hardworking and dedicated nurse while Dean is a house painter. We flash back to see Dean as a happy go lucky guy who meets an pursues Cindy. He is kind, caring and optimistic. We then flash forward to the present and he is looks angry, frustrated, and trapped. Cindy tries to keep the family together but always seems to be at odds with him. When Dean suggests they use a long ignored gift certificate to stay at a romantic fantasy themed hotel things hit a boiling point.Cindy and Dean's stay in the very appropriately themed future room. The room is pretty sleazy looking with a cold sterile feel and lots of silvers and blues. They get drunk and dance to their song and sort of reconnect but with the issues they've been dealing with will one night save their marriage? As the night goes on the room starts to feel like a prison and they are only left with their problems. We continue to flash back to them as they fall in love, then go through and unplanned pregnancy. Cindy's father has never liked Dean but ultimately wants his daughter to happy. Early the next morning Cindy leaves the hotel room and heads to work. Dean has a breakdown and makes number of bad decisions leading to the films end. This film is pretty heartbreaking and offers no easy answers, it prides it self in being as true to life as possible.The ""Blue Valentine"" DVD and Blu-Ray's has a good commentary track as well as deleted scenes and more. Director Derek Cianfrance has also re-teamed with Ryan Gosling in the movie ""A Place Beyond the Pines"" due out latter this year.",Blue Valentine

111,colinrgeorge,A Bittersweet Success,7,20 January 2011,"There's not a whole lot happening with the relationship film. From annual Jennifer Aniston comedies to requisite art house dramas, there hasn't been a real innovation in far too long. ""Blue Valentine"" takes a crack at it, employing a unique combination of techniques and a back and forth bittersweet narrative, but it still falls squarely into the latter camp.Tremendous credit is owned first and foremost to its cast. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams play characters at the beginning and end of a relationship, and the difference couldn't be more stark. The pair is essentially pulling double duty, and the juxtaposition between past and present is what makes ""Blue Valentine"" unique. We meet the pair now: Gosling with a cigarette crutch and Williams with a defunct imagination. The spontaneous and affectionate couple of years past are unrecognizable at first glance.Perhaps the most interesting byproduct of the flashback gimmick is that it exists solely for the benefit of the viewer. The irony of its implementation is that the characters themselves are incapable of retrieving the euphoric memories. Resultantly, the further we dip into the past, the more poignant their present unhappiness becomes.To conclude analysis there, ""Blue Valentine"" would be just about perfect. The problem is the filmmaking doesn't live up to the premise and performances. I can't overstate how good Gosling and Williams are, but they're getting no help from the camera department. The single most irksome quality of the film is that it's shot often in extreme close up, at times overusing and even cheapening the otherwise effective cinematic tool. Of course ""Blue Valentine"" is meant to be an intimate portrayal of two strong characters, but shooting entire sequences as dueling heads seems like the easiest and most obvious way to communicate that. Gosling and Williams sell the naked intimacy of their relationship on a performance level alone; the jarring directorial decision to focus solely on their faces is not only superfluous, but it robs the audience of their peripheral nuance.A minor gripe, maybe. Director Derek Cianfrance clearly understands that the movie is about a relationship, first and foremost. The script he wrote with Cami Delavigne and Joey Curtis is a good one, and is brought to cathartic life by his actors. His impulse is correct that the film is about them, not him, but the technique backfires by drawing attention to itself with its on- the-nose minimalism. The result is that ""Blue Valentine"" feels like a small picture. Admittedly, it is a small picture, budgeted at a paltry million dollars—but be it a function of the time constraints or a carefully calculated creative choice, the claustrophobic ambiance imbued by the tight shooting style plain didn't work for me.The feeling that eventually seeps in amid the warm, ephemeral glimpses of the past and the shipwrecked future is that much like its characters, ""Blue Valentine"" is spoiling its potential. Admirable in many ways, and I'd still venture to say the film ranks somewhere among 2010's best. Compared to storytellers like David Fincher, Darren Aronofsky, and the Coen brothers, however, what Cianfrance communicates with his visuals is muddled at best.Fortunately for him, he got everything else right. In a way it's revealing that the greatest complaint I can leverage against his film is that it's ugly. ""Blue Valentine"" certainly shakes out better than average in the greater spectrum of romance films, and though it may not be the innovation the genre sorely needs, it does shake off some of the cobwebs. Beneath the grime, there really is something.",Blue Valentine
112,grandmastersik,A boring film about a couple who take almost 2 hours to break up,2,24 April 2015,"To call this film pointless would be very accurate. Inside the first 5 minutes it's clear that the wife doesn't love the husband... and then we go to see that it's not about to change.When being examined at a clinic, in a flashback of how they just met, the wife says that she's slept with ""20, maybe 25"" men, and that left me wondering if her husband even was the father of their child.Basically, she's just a confused woman and he tries to make their relationship work without having much of a clue how to or the money to sweep her off her feet. I guess a lot of people gave this film a high score because they've realised that everybody is different and there simply isn't a handbook to a marital life of bliss, but where most of us may try anyway, watching tedious stuff like this certainly isn't the way to reignite fading passion or say, ""That's happening to us and we need to do something to stop it.""Some people may read my summary and click ""spoiler without warning"" for this opinion, but there isn't anything to spoil, only a warning that, unless watching dull (but admittedly well-acted), depressing and utterly predictable dramas is your thing, you'd be best served not wasting your time.",Blue Valentine
113,n-kefala,"The film was scheduled to be shot in spring 2008. The cause that this movie was postponed was the death of Heath Ledger, out of respect for Michelle Williams.",8,29 January 2011,"One of the films that had impressed us in the last Cannes Film Festival, was the independent Blue Valentine, a film about lost love, love without compromise and the desire for a fresh start. The charismatic leading duo of Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams (in her first appearance after the death of Heath Ledger), in roles that suit both of the two young actors, impress the audience from the first few minutes, making them empathize with the couple.Under the protection of a major film company and the imperative to ""make money"", Blue Valentine maybe it was another superficial romantic melodrama, with the usual lessons on relationships. But with Derek Cianfrance's direction, we have a realistic depiction -and at the sex scenes- of a relationship that starts with fairly good conditions, but over the years and with the difficulties of everyday life, led to quagmire. The truth is that the script does not show anything special that we have never seen before, neither Cianfrance leaves his personal imprint. Besides that, the common practice of the flashback is used and here to learn how the couple met. However, the outspoken and sometimes poetic director's look on the topic of relationships, creates a special film who you can not forget easily. On the positives and the music of Grizzly Bear.",Blue Valentine

115,priyantha-bandara,Crazy good,8,20 May 2011,"It is hard to come by movies which speak of life and relationships in deep such as in Blue Valentine. This movie is not the typical which involves a couple and a bunch of problems about their marriage. This is much more coupled with raw and intense performances and strictly natural dialogues throughout. You will not see fairy tale moments and endings, or utterly dramatic scenes which make you cry for nothing. This is life and this is it. Blue Valentine is top of its art and a must watch.Being said that let me hover on the plot briefly. Dean and Cindy is a married couple with a kid. Dean seems to be a simple minded individual who does not have big plans of life. Being a college dropout and having done several simple jobs he does not contribute a lot to the income of the family but tries his level best to blend in as a husband and a father. Cindy on the other hand is an ambitious lady. Coming from a good family she worked hard to become a doctor and works busy schedules to keep the family running. It is somewhat a puzzle in the beginning how a well educated woman like that ended up with a man with such caliber. But the plot beautifully unravels their love story and develops a solid character base.The story runs showing the viewer several flashbacks of their past and how they collide with the events which occur in the present, and how Dean and Cindy find it difficult to make a balance of their relationship any more. The viewer is put in a tight spot to judge who's wrong and who's correct in their situation. It is a mind blowing experience to realize how such a wonderful relationship blossomed with so much love and affection turns in to a place filled with darkness and hate. And there is always the question of recovery intact. The whole story just places the viewer in a deep hole with little light to feed upon.Other than the wonderful plot and the script there are several things which need to be mentioned of. The whole movie is fantastically crafted with purely blessed acting. In one review I saw that it says 'If there is justice this movie definitely deserves the best acting awards in Oscars'. Sadly it didn't win that award but it was nominated. I have not seeing such pure and raw performance by a couple in recent times. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams make this movie 100 times more watchable.Then comes the cinematography. I loved it. Or I should say that I fell head over heels for it. Such fantastic camera work which makes every seeing a bliss. This has very thematic color scheme and sets that contribute to the story very well. I might watch this over and over again just to get the artistic side of it.I can write more. But I'll stop at this point. Because you need to experience it by yourself.Read more at flickshout.tk",Blue Valentine

117,Davalon-Davalon,Unbearable,1,2 June 2019,"It took me three days to get through this film on Netflix. I only continued to watch it because my husband kept thinking it was going to get better; it did not.I do not remotely understand how this film could garner any review above 1, and I was shocked to see that my beloved Roger Ebert, who was the ultimate movie critic for me, rated this film 3.5 stars.Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, two actors I generally admire and support, portray individuals who I found impossible to like or care about, although in Michelle's case, I did like her more as she had some remote sense of responsibility to her child and her grandmother.The story weaves through this couple's past and present. It tries to portray the past as idyllic and the present as disastrous. Okay... so what?While Ryan Gosling expertly captures the obnoxious, stupid, slacker qualities of ""Dean,"" it didn't matter because I didn't care about someone who was so stupid and out of touch with reality. Yes, his portrayal was authentic; no, I could not empathize or care about him, because he was drowning in his emotional baggage and didn't seem to think that other people existed. So, kudos to him for capturing the realities of a man with limited intelligence and emotional maturity, but ultimately all I wanted him to do was disappear.As for Michelle's character, ""Cindy"" -- she did not seem to have any sense of self, and considering how she was raised, it's easy to see why. But because she could not extricate herself from her troubled relationship with Dean, again, I did not care.The film shows us two people who seem emotionally trapped in a marriage that only one of them wants to be in... but as to why that is supposed to be something I would want to see, I cannot answer.There is not one redeeming moment in this film where someone breathes free or sees a way out. Both ""Dean"" and ""Cindy"" seem to be wandering around in a maze and neither of them will ever find their way out.You can see that the character of Dean is exactly the kind that would go out and buy a gun and kill Cindy, their child, Cindy's father, and probably the rest of her family, because, in his tragically limited view of life, if he couldn't have her, then he would take her with him. I was just waiting for that to happen, but thank God it didn't. It was bad enough that I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.Lastly: I understand that people have sex with each other, for any number of reasons. But in this film, there were two scenes that were essentially pornographic; I was really saddened that Michelle Williams felt compelled to participate in them. Was it really, really necessary to show her previously obnoxious boyfriend take her from behind? Was it really, really necessary to show Ryan Gosling's face buried in her crotch? Did the filmmaker think, ""Yeah! This will show the reality of their relationship!"" Okay, but... can't we get that from some skillful shots?This was sad, depressing, emotionally stunted and never offers a moment of hope. We have enough real life around us to remind us of that. To see this portrayed in a film does not, IMHO, achieve anything except reinforce the tragedy of our existence. Films should offer something transformative, someone for us to root for, someone for us to dream with and hope with and go on a journey with.All that I felt was the great desire to turn this off every two minutes. I'm glad my husband enjoyed it, but I was unable to and really can't imagine how anyone else could either.",Blue Valentine

119,dharmendrasingh,Is romantic love the ultimate form of masochism?,9,1 February 2011,"Director Derek Cianfrance may wish to stop wasting his talent on TV and make films his full time occupation. Cinema could use him. His 'Blue Valentine' studies the breakdown of a marriage through beautiful and heartbreaking juxtaposed scenes of past joy and optimism with present scenes of misery and depression. Flitting back and forth in the marriage, it asks: Is romantic love the ultimate form of masochism?Fine young actors Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams play Dean and Cindy, who unite through a dogged courtship. Dean is easy-going, happy-go-lucky and content in his removal and packing company. He is chary of formal education, but has a philosopher's outlook. Cindy is sexually over-active and, although occasionally frolicsome, is more mature than Dean. About five years on, romance becomes repulsion, and their marriage becomes one of inconvenience. Make no mistake, this is uncomfortable viewing – not the sex, which serves the story quite well – but the paranoia, pettiness and pugnacity in the couple's interaction. They reach their nadir when he practically begs for affection, and she pleads with him to be more ambitious.No two actors have complemented each other this well for some time. In an age where vapid acting is vogue, Gosling is a novelty. He is very charming, yet he has a mournful countenance, and possesses a James Dean-like vulnerability. He'd be my poster-on-the-wall if I were 13. I can't get that entrancing scene where Dean serenades Cindy out of my head. Dean's philosophical outpourings may be interpreted by some as drivel, but more sensitive viewers will detect the shattering honesty. A memorable maxim: 'Girls spend their whole life looking for Prince Charming and then marry the guy who's got a good job and is gunna stick around.'We go to the movies – many of us – to escape real life. Comfortable as voyeurs, we let our favourite stars distract us and we forget our worries. But 'Blue Valentine' shows a truth no cinema can shield us from.

120,SeriousJest,Too Real for Me,6,17 June 2014,"After the meet cutes, after the romantic courtship, and after the weddings that their viewers rooted for, the couples in our romantic dramas actually have to live with each otherand it's not always happily ever after. This film is about that later scenario. It is uncompromisingly real. The actors managed to channel raw emotions that make it very difficult for the viewer to stay detached. And to really drive the point home in an artistic and interesting way, the film is split with flashbacks to that amazingly cute romance that no one would ever think would fail. Overall, this is a very good movie, and it deserved every award and nomination that it received.I guess I've just seen and experienced too much heartbreak in my life to want to spend another 2 hours living in someone else's broken dreams, though. I found this flick difficult to watch for that reason. I found myself strongly disliking Williams's character. I found myself wanting to cite this film as an example of the crappy things that (some) women do. For some people, this movie is a Must See. For me, it is a very real and moving film that brings up feelings I do not really care for. That being said, I respect it as a great movie, and would not say you're wasting your time watching it. Be careful who you watch it with, though, as it could lead to an argument.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com",Blue Valentine
121,Ziglet_mir,Left Empty (in a good way?),7,29 August 2011,"This was my first viewing. After watching Blue Valentine (2010) I feel both saddened and slightly empty. The love story between Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams is viewed through the present and their past. We are lead through (piece by piece) on how these two lovers met. The story beholds an interesting take on relationships as we are exposed to the circumstances which led Dean (Gosling) and Cindy (Williams) to be together. Dean is a playful and caring father while Cindy is uptight and also caring. They share a daughter and seem to have their lives figured out. But as we continue to watch, we find out that everything is not OK. Blue Valentine has wonderful cinematography and editing. The music softly plays along with the story, and the two leads are very strong. There are clever parallels that run the story through (from the past/beginning of the relationship to the current/possible end of one). My only real issue is that I can't figure out what Dean did wrong. He's not a severe alcoholic (alcoholic not even being the right word), he works, he's caring, there is no abuse and he loves their daughter Frankie. On this aspect of the movie, I felt angry towards Williams' character. She never outwardly spoke about her problems and was constantly moody. Albeit she was put through a rough situation at such a young and unprepared age. She was scared... yes, but why not confide in your partner about your feelings... what you desire, what you want to work on? So naturally the ending of this movie leaves me with a feeling of emptiness.",Blue Valentine
122,charles000,Surprisingly well done. I was a bit skeptical at first . . .,8,1 March 2014,"Surprisingly well done. I was a bit skeptical at first, but as I traveled my way through this story, it made more sense than many other attempts to capture this concept and present it well. Michelle Williams really shines here, it may be her best role yet, at least that I'm aware of. The key point here is that is an anatomy of a marriage that has dissolved over time, becoming increasingly irrelevant to the wife, and evermore difficult for the husband to comprehend or connect with what's going on with his wife. I've seen this before, in real life. Sometimes, marriages just come apart over time, even if they started out with the best of intentions and all the chemistry that can be imagined. It just happens . . . people change over time, and often, not in sync with each other. There's no real ""bad guy"" in the scenario portrayed . . . just the realities of how people drift apart, to the point of no return. Trust me on this one, this does happen. This film may not be for everyone, but for those who can relate with this type of story, this is probably one of the best attempts yet which delivers a reasonably realistic depiction of what this can be like.",Blue Valentine

The story and themes are well fleshed out and provide for some uncomfortable scenes throughout the movie. From a film-making standpoint, this movie is great.Despite its technical aspects that I loved, I simply did not enjoy this film all that much.

125,eryui,Oh! darling...,6,4 March 2016,"It is a faithful picture of a situation that we all live, will or have lived, at least once in life. The dissolution of love, and love no longer reciprocated. If you fell in love, most likely, you have already assimilated that, growing with time, love may end, and often not simultaneously, and that is painful, especially when there are children in the middle. If you are more then a teenager you did not realized this issue just in first person but also troughs someone else life or other hundreds movies, thousand books and even psychological treatises.Live or live again a situation for granted so depressing, as it involves us, it's boring if the movie does not contain more than that. In this film in fact, there are not remarkably subplots and twists, nothing but the slow and simple agony of a separation of a common couple, with common issues, topped by common flashbacks.To me, a movie should be more than just a simple common document. In this sense the first film that come to mind, if I do remember well, that at the same time offer something more, like scenery, themes and subplots, are: ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Revolutionary Road"" or just the contemporary and beautiful ""A Separation"".This film is well done about how it shows and let you notice the small details and signs of the incoming dissolution but does not offer anything new to an aged, or less, movie lover. Probably my heart has hardened over time but I found it not even so moving aside the last scene. Therefore, excellent acting aside, is too simple, both realistic and equally boring.",Blue Valentine
126,Kicino,Is it always sweet memory and bitter present?,8,6 June 2012,"Only after watching it for the second time can I appreciate this film. A year ago I did not like it because it seemed very depressing. But over the year, I watched Ryan Gosling in other movies: The Ides of March, Crazy Stupid Love, and most recently, Drive. I fell in love with him (or his character) instantly and decided to give Blue Valentine another chance.I felt I was so simple and naïve when all I could remember from this movie last year was the dance scene. Love emerges and subsides for no apparent reasons. It is sad when we try to communicate but our loved ones do not get the message. Somehow our wavelengths jam and whatever we say or not say lead us into more misunderstandings and frustration, sadness and helplessness. In my opinion, Cindy (Michelle Williams) and Dean (Ryan Gosling)'s relationship did not work because it was not built on common values and life goals. Cindy was aspired to be a doctor but she ended up being a nurse. Dean did not have any life goals but he was happy with life brought him. Both of them come from dysfunctional families. They do not have role models of making compromises and efforts to make a relationship work. They do not know how to communicate and exchange ideas in a way that they can grow together while respecting/admiring each other. Their differences in education and life aspiration set them apart from the beginning. It is sad but seems inevitable.Their relationship is so real: we seem to meet the person of our destiny and fall head to heels in love - only to realize that life thereafter can be painfully different. The documentary-like dialogue between Dean and his colleagues on meeting women and love at first sight, as well as Cindy and her grandma's discussion on love, give a very authentic feeling to the movie.Dean is simple, kind and modest. He did not finish high school even though he is smart and has his own way of interpreting the world. His mother left him when he was 10. In Cindy's eyes, Dean has a lot of talents. Yet when her love is gone, his talents become a burden – he was seen as wasting his potentials. Dean was happy to be a painter because he could have a beer in the morning and have more time for his family. Cindy thinks he should get another job where he does not need to drink in the morning. When things turned sour, Dean took the initiative to fix it: he booked a love motel in an effort to turn things better. Dean believes men are more romantic – they spend their whole life avoiding marriage and but would die to marry the right girl; women spend their whole life looking for Prince Charming but end up settling with someone who has a job and is willing to stick around, ditto not necessarily love, which is bound to disappointment.Perhaps this way of thinking dictates the main tone of the movie and describes Cindy and Dean's relationship except Cindy wants something more. Yet she is unable to articulate what she wants because she does not know what she wants: just that he has so much potentials and he could achieve more. Perhaps that is also a projection of herself: that she could also do more. Naturally there is a lot of frustration in not actualizing her potentials and she seems to have taken it onto Dean who appears to be a big kid. But men are basically big kids! And we are always talking about treasuring our inner child!! Cindy asked her grandma what it feels like to be in love. Grandma advised her to be careful of that person she falls in love with is worth it to her, meaning he might not be good for others but good for her. Growing up in an abusive family, all Cindy knew was saying I'm sorry in a relationship. She did not know how to make things work. She has such dark and insecure personality that even though she is smart in books, she may not be very smart in life. Cindy feels stuck in the marriage. She works hard for the family but it seems she does not love Dean anymore. Perhaps she has not loved him from the beginning – they were together because he was available and was nice to her and that he accepted her for what she was (smart and nuts and pregnant). Her parents did not seem to approve their marriage – they did not show up at the wedding. Cindy was so moved at the wedding; but why was she so cold in the end? It seems she has grown to despise him, mainly because she was not clear of what she wants and neither did he (except he accepts what life gives him). She might have functioned better if she got help from a counselor and be more assertive of what she wanted in life. Both Ryan and Michelle are excellent. The future room is such an irony: the lack of windows in the room signifies the suffocation and metallic coldness of their relationship. Even the name of future room sarcastically predicts the stale future of their marriage. It is quite a depressing movie when it talks about the present. But memory is sweet. Or did we just choose the happy moments to remember? Blue Valentine is so inspiring in leading us to think about how love sparks and how to keep it going.",Blue Valentine

129,Cinnyaste,Too Real; Too Bad,5,18 January 2011,"Entertainment is meant to transport us to the extraordinary outside the bounds of the daily mundane. Well crafted entertainment sometimes blurs, yet does not cross, the aesthetic distance between fiction and reality. The closer to reality the greater the danger of the illusion disappearing in the transient flickers of cinematic light.This, then, is the main problem with ""Blue Valentine."" While a remarkable and courageous film, the story fails in a reality approaching home movies (including momentary loss of optical focus), or a fly-on-the-wall POV in a dysfunctional family's living room.Based on an NPR interview with writer Cami Delavigne, the much rewritten, long un-produced script was essentially thrown out for improvisation by Producers Gosling and Williams. Further, Ms. Delavigne offered the stars 'got' the story's subtext and delivered a film that satisfied her. Perhaps the script should have been afforded more respect.It is difficult to complain about a heartfelt and sincere project like ""Blue Valentine."" Yet, the filmmakers bear responsibility for creating the film and must answer for the shortcomings as well as capture any accolades.There's also the fact the story was derived in large part from both ""Two For The Road"" and ""Scenes From a Marriage."" Updated, of course, with near porn quality sex scenes (again disrespecting aesthetic distance). Frank sex scenes work. See: ""Leaving Las Vegas."" Here they are squirm-inducing.That there is no happy ending is laudatory. In life, at times, even the most initially promising relationships are doomed from the start due to the participant's family-of-origin issues. This revelation is lost in this story's machinations. In a fantasy, Cindy and Dean approach each other oblivious to their discordance. And it catches up. Yet, too little time is spent on exploring the fascinating human undertaking of mating with someone completely inappropriate.""Blue Valentine"" is a most exasperating film.

Ryan Gosling's is back in the genre that won him praise in 2004 in the romance hit ""The Notebook"" starring beside Michelle Williams most recently known for her role in Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"". Gosling's and William's characters Dean and Cindy have fallen out of love with each other and say that they are only together because of ""their"" daughter Frankie. However, they want to give their relationship one more shot to save their marriage. In order to do this Dean makes them a reservation at a hotel with a futuristic theme for one night of escape from their home and from their current selves. The night consists of more fighting as they flashback to better days during their courtship and newfound love. A conflict between Cindy and her ex-boyfriend Bobby (Mike Vogel) is revealed through a present day encounter and flashback when she first falls in love with Dean. Her parents are disapproving as she strives to work in medicine, while Dean works at a moving company to make ends meet because he dropped out of high school. However, nothing else matters for a couple in love, but now they are fighting the fight of their lives in order to once again find love for each other in their hearts.Great acting is the reason that ""Blue Valentine"" is a good movie. This is because the film is solely about Gosling's and Williams's characters. The award nominations speak for themselves; however, know that their nominations are well deserved and that they were not just an afterthought to fill nomination slots. Writer Director Derek Cianfrance does a lot with this super low budget film (1 million dollars) with respect to camera work and showing different tones to Dean and Cindy's present situation compared to their young and in love selves. Together these three artists may and should break into the ten best picture nominations for the Oscars. One thing for sure is Gosling and Williams have Oscar nominations in their near future.The ending is very ambiguous and occurs very suddenly. In a way it leaves you hanging, but that is not why the ending is questionable. The problem is that the ending moves towards more of a Hollywood ending, which is fine, however, it still leaves a lot of unresolved consequences of previous actions of the couple. Therefore, in order to enjoy the film and take something away from it you enter into a love hate relationship with the characters and their duality along with the large gaps that Cianfrance creates with his artistry including the open ended, yet closed ending.""Blue Valentine's"" MPAA rating dispute is very important to the film because the sexual scenes in the film are semi-graphic and very important.

The relationship between Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) evolves beautifully by covering touching issues and contrasts within the life of two once-lovers. It doesn't get too melodramatic, it doesn't get cheesy nor predictable and it juggles with the emotional core of the movie. Dean is a low-educated guy, who is ruled only by his intuitions and views the world in just one dimension. Although he is not trusty in adapting to the society and to the family's needs he has a great heart and acknowledges the great responsibility he must have inside a family. Cindy is an immature, confused and I could say pitiful person but her reason and judgment save her in a lot of harsh situations although her life seems to be conducted not by her wishes but by her personal mistakes and even fantasies. Blue Valentine it's a great in-depth analysis of the ups and downs in a family built on lies, at least from one individual if not both.Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams gave life to their characters and although their judgment is one dimensioned they are three dimensional characters. They have a great chemistry between them and they manage to combine romance with anger and frustrations, self control with delusional behavior, optimism with pessimism and love with hate. A moving mixture of on-going real life problems. One of the best actors of their generation and Gosling proves once again why he needs to step out under the rock that has a ""underrated"" mark on it.The camera work was fantastic. Great balance, contrasts, colors and close-ups. I really enjoyed watching this movie even more thanks to the way it was shot. The sound was also clear and the songs used, especially those choir moments were incredible. Blue Valentine is by far, the best dramatic and romantic experience put on screen in 2010. It promotes unity but at the same time it admits the influence of materialism or selfishness in many situations. Sometimes, women spend all their time wandering in the wilderness looking for their prince but decide to stop and marry the guy who has a bigger paycheck while men always dream about having harems and be classy playboys and end up being more romantic than anyone and fall in love for the girl next door.

136,warthogjump,"A realistic, but depressing portrayal of marriage.",9,26 January 2011,"In this movie, basically what we have is a man and woman, Dean and Cindy, who are trying to mend a broken marriage. From the male point of view, everything is perfect as Dean seems so content with his whole life, his wife and his daughter. However, from the female point of view, although we don't understand exactly what Cindy is going through as she may not even know it herself, it can fairly be said she has fallen out of love and since then hasn't been treating Dean well, especially on an intimate level, and has had much more of a focus on a her career, inherently not giving enough attention to her family.It's natural to point the finger at Cindy for the break down as she is the one with the problem and all Dean wants to do is continue living happily ever after. But, a hasten blame like this is far from accurate. If the situation were better understood by the general audience, they would realise there is no one to blame. It is not Dean's fault the marriage is breaking down nor is it Cindy's. Rather, it is a perfect example of incompatibility in a relationship.From the very beginning of the relationship, when Dean and Cindy had their first meetings, I could tell that even though they were both having a joyous time, they were not compatible people for each other.This is a problem most associated with the early stages of a relationship, which may in some cases not be weeks or months, it may even be years. In these early stages we ""fall"" for someone, think they are the one, and settle for that. But, during these stages we're blinded for what we really feel, and it isn't till the actual ""long"" relationship starts that we start realising our true feelings.For some, the initial feelings will remain the same, a perfect example played by Dean. For others, they will realise they either ""fell out of love"" or they never loved to begin with and the early stages of the relationship was simply a period of lust or desperate need for connection.People require different things to be happy in a relationship, as Dean muttered at some point during the movie: ""what do you want me to do, I have you (Cindy), I have my daughter, I have my job, I'm happy."" He doesn't need anymore than a loving family. But, Cindy has a different outlook on things and it appears she does need more. Like I said before, this isn't a scenario where one says Dean or Cindy is right and the other is wrong. It's just a perfect example of incompatibility. The two were not compatible for each other and it was inevitable they either break up or live a marriage without passion anymore.Take Cindy's mother as another example, she's been married for however many years and she doesn't even know if she ever loved the man she had been married to her whole life. That is depressing. I'm a believer in love, but also a believer in falling in and out of love, as I don't believe there is this one person who we can continue to love for eternity. Our immediate family are the only exception, these are the only people we can love unconditionally. But, as for a romantic love, I don't think it can last forever.To put it in perspective, I know of an elderly couple in which case the male went on ""holidays"" for a few weeks and came back married, only to gather belongings. After a rather persuasive talk, he remained with his original wife, leaving the newly wed for the sake of the kids. Him and his wife, now in their 80's are living one of happiest marriages I have witnessed. But, I wouldn't be able to say they're still in love, they're just good at keeping each other company till death I guess. Plus, they're old and if separation occurs, they're going to die alone.Point is, relationships continue on due to a belief in one or more ""external"" factors. We stay together for the kids, we stay together for fear of not finding someone better, we stay together for religious or cultural purposes as otherwise it would be sinful, we stay together because we respect our partner, we stay together because we feel sorry, we stay together for whatever reason. But, we don't stay together because we're still in love. If relationships were based solely on love, none would last. It's probably love or in other cases lust, that brings a relationship together, but what holds it up to the end are these external factors.As times have moved on, so have relationships and divorce is ever increasing. It is simply an example of the external factors I mentioned before not having much of an effect on people anymore. If the love isn't there, the relationship isn't, this is what's common these days. And I guess there's no wrong way of looking at it, but it's just a sad fact of life that so many couples are not compatible and are either breaking up or staying together without the love they first experienced.Whatever people choose to do, the magical period of love isn't one which lasts forever, but it is one the comes across most people at least once. Make the moments while in love worth it, share those miraculous moments together and allow it to make you happy, just in case you don't get another chance.Gosling and Williams were more than perfect for their roles making a perfect character study. I want Williams to win the Oscar. I'm hugely surprised and disappointed Gosling didn't even get a nomination. In my opinion he was even better at showing his subtle, sensitive emotion in the film that Williams was. I hope Gosling wins one day.",Blue Valentine

Dean and Cindy met in unusual circumstances but both felt like they were in love at first sight. After years of marriage, flashbacks of their youth reminded them of how happy they were, unlike now. Dean works as a house painter and only work occasionally. Cindy pursues her career of being a nurse and feels that Dean is not giving his all to his ""potentials"". It isn't a new story, it isn't the best executed film, and it isn't easy to watch. But somewhere between the passionate relationship between the leads and how the story was told, Blue Valentine won me over.",Blue Valentine
138,padawanmovies,Bravo; A must see,8,19 January 2020,This is a true telling of how relationships shift over time. These 2 had a challenging genesis; meeting as kids right after she gets knocked up by someone else? Oh my... It's also a showing of how our parents' past difficulties affect our own relationships. (I assume Cindy was as promiscuous as she was because of the lack of parental affection and never seeing a loving family dynamic). Michelle and Ryan have been 2 of the most talented actors of their generation because they take material and personify it to the highest extent. This is an awesome yet sad portrayal of marriage and family.,Blue Valentine

If you enjoyed it then you'll like this movie. This movie is almost 2 hours of watching people argue and fight. I never found myself interested to see what they'd do, or say, next. I only wanted them to shut up, grow up, and perhaps get some critical thinking skills. The only reason I kept watching is because I thought for sure that the movie must be going somewhere. I mean, why would anyone make a movie that's only about people fighting? I kept thinking, well, now they'll get therapy. Or now they'll really think about things and reevaluate themselves and their role in their own and each other's lives. Whatever. They just fight. Or have sex.

You can only watch what you have often seen in real life (and wanted to look away) if you have lived long enough, know enough people, and don't live protected from the dramas so common to people who struggle. A difficult scene for me was watching Michelle Williams' character as she did housework. In the background, Ryan Gosling's character rests with his feet up. You know what? He deserves that. He works at a physically tough job. Does she? Well, yes, in a way - but nursing is a profession that has its own type of physical demands. However, not necessarily lifting heavy objects all day and perhaps climbing stairs with them on your back. You want her to put her feet up, too. You also want the married couple they portray to have an au pair. You want someone else to make dinner and do the dishes. When someone says, ""I'm tired"" in this movie, I wanted to shout, ""Yeah, well, I'm tired just watching you get tired!""Marriage when you're somewhat poor (economically disadvantaged, let's say) doesn't have to be like this. In another lifetime, give me a Ryan Gosling to be part of my struggling marriage and I think I could give it a shot. The man has serious sex appeal going on. There aren't too many people who come out looking good in this movie. Even the doctor who is Michelle's employer seems sleazy when you truly understand what he proposes. In no way does he seem honorable. Wanted: a 'feel-good movie' about being poor. This ain't it. But it is nonetheless wonderful for a one-time viewing. These people are fine actors.",Blue Valentine

The movie is a love story told from the beginning and the ending randomly and sure is very well told and contains terrific performances.Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling give exceptional performances.....

142,Raptorclaw155,Pick Your Battles,8,17 July 2020,"I can't help but to compare this film with The Notebook not only because it stars Ryan Gosling but also because it also takes a different interpretation of what fighting for one's love and relationship for someone else that exists - albeit in passing - in The Notebook.This film goes into the gritty realities of what relationships are really like in contrast with many other films under the romance banner which are more idealistic and have more of a place in fantasy than in reality. Blue Valentine paints an incredibly interesting picture of the relationship that exists between the two leading characters. Both of them love each other, but come to that end in completely different ways that don't go communicated. There is a line Gosling's character says in one of the flashback sequences which sort of foreshadows the later events of the film and ultimately the fate of their relationship.Blue Valentine relies heavily on interlacing present day events with past events through seamlessly integrated flashback sequences. They are so seamlessly switched between that, if you're not paying attention, you might find it a little confusing and slightly difficult to follow, however, it is easy to catch on to and the confusion is - at least should be - momentary. I didn't have much of an issue with them, myself.Blue Valentine is probably among the most believable romance films ever made, but it should not be something you go in expecting to be feel-good. This is not lighthearted date night window dressing you put on while on a date to help set any particular mood unless its one of introspection and reconsideration - which will probably kill your whole night. Unless you are interested in film, I would recommend seeing this film outside the context of a date unless you're ready to have the kind of discussion this film tries to get out of you.",Blue Valentine
143,mistarkus,Grittiness of a doomed relationship,9,4 February 2011,"A gritty peer into a doomed relationship. The creation of subtly idiosyncratic, multi-layered personalities created extremely believable characters. She has this quiet enigmatic quality with more than meets the eye and he has an eager simplicity full of emotion and soul. The outwardly complex and simple was perhaps not a match made in heaven but it was an interesting story to see how they ended up together. Great acting was needed for this character driven movie and expectations were surpassed by both of the main actors. Raw, realistic human emotion focusing in on the ecstasies and agonies of the beginning and end of a relationship allowed the actors to create and achieve the greatest acting performances of the year. The simplicity of the story, that merely concentrates on the slice of life of a breakup, made it heartfelt and emotionally arousing. Theamatically dark commentary on relationships was novel and interesting. The realness revealed makes you ponder the relationship portrayed and relationships in general.",Blue Valentine
144,jhigginbotham151,Heartbreaking is an understatement in Blue Valentine,9,25 April 2014,"Romance is a difficult thing to portray in film. Its the emotion between two people that even in real life, people still have trouble describing what it is that makes two people fall in love. Blue Valentine is the first film I've seen that feels authentic in its portrayal of romance, from the first kiss to the heartbreaking separation. Cutting between past and present events, between the first spark of a relationship and the crumbling of a broken marriage, isn't used as a gimmick, instead it is used to make you even more connected to the characters. A scene in the present where Dean puts on a song and starts to lip sing before getting into a heated argument with Cindy becomes even more saddening when you discover from a later scene that that same song is supposed to be their 'song', a song they made love too. The film uses its past tense scenes like this a lot, making scenes in the present all the more hard to watch because of how these characters, these young, innocent people are being almost being punished for falling in love. The film deals with the themes of marriage at a young age, abortion, depression and divorce in the most mature of ways, but at the same time managing to have a personality, a heart that isn't just simply stating whats happening but showing you with an unflinching stare that makes the film one of the best, yet hardest viewings iv experienced. It all comes down to the characters at the end of the day, Dean and Cindy are characters that we want to see together and want to see happy like they were when they were young. It makes us dread every time the film shifts to the present day, because we know all what are going to see is heartbreaking and it makes us long for another chance to see the main characters be happy just one last time.",Blue Valentine
145,spicy_bee,Choices and consequences,8,11 April 2020,"This movie takes a deeper look at complex relationships formed from simple decisions. Ryan Gosling, like you've never seen him before and a charismatic Michelle Williams deliver an in depth look at a strained marriage. It's a story of what happens behind the scenes in a marriage. It could also be taken as what happens after the curtains close in some Hollywood love stories. Not your typical Rom-com but definitely more down to Earth and realistic.There were definitely other underlying messages like society's view on what is considered manly or what is romantic and making gender conforming choices and definitely a critical look at a powerful choice made by the female lead midway. These aspects and more make this movie a challenge to watch but the director does a wonderful job portraying them as they are without any sugarcoating.How I decided my rating:

146,seronjaa-797-313124,"Beautiful, but not clear enough",7,14 March 2017,"Maybe it's just me, but for the first part of the film I didn't realize, that Dean and the trailer guy with glasses and a beard are the same person. I thought, that Cindy was cheating on her husband, but it was only a time jump. This could have been shown much less confusing. And what happened to him anyway? Clearly, she's the one who got unhappy in that marriage and she looks the same and he, who is actually happy, somehow started to look like trailer trash? Throughout the movie, I can't really know what the character's motives are. Why is Cindy unhappy? Why do they even fight? The fight scene in the hospital lasts for an eternity and we don't even get to know what's it about? I think, the writers could at least come up with some topic for the fight, like a drinking problem or whatever. But this was just a soup of ""fight words"", that doesn't tell us anything about the characters or about the story. If someone says, that this shows a ""normal"" marriage with the beginning and the end of it, like falling out of love- i don't see it. What's the cause? What's the motive? Dean clearly loves his wife and family and so again we have another movie, where the man's love is shown as pure and honest and the woman's as manipulative and fake. All in all, the film is not bad. The story is quite interesting, the acting is wonderful and I even think, that the scenes are quite beautiful. But it's unexplained and unnecessarily confusing.",Blue Valentine
147,varun_120,Feels very blue after viewing the film,8,24 July 2012,"Seldom it happens that you want to write something about a film you have just watched. Well Blue valentine is that kind of movie. This is a very sad film. If you are in good mood, it will definitely spoil your mood and its effects will remain for at least a couple of days after you watch it. Again, seldom it happens that you hate a character in a movie. I don't know about others, but I hated Cindy's character brilliantly portrayed by Michelle Williams( No wonder why she was nominated for Oscar).This film is about two people Dean (Ryan Gosling) & Cindy (Michelle Williams). This film shows how love is growing apart from the couple. Both the characters are responsible for the lost love between the duo. But, somehow I think Cindy is more responsible for the broken relationship. Cindy is a girl who loses her virginity at the age of 13. She has a dysfunctional family background. She has had sex with more than 25 guys. She doesn't know who the father of her kid is. She is not a person who can make a marriage work, she only knows to say 'sorry', and get over with a relationship.While, Dean is a guy, who believes that men are more romantic than women, and a little immature, very happy with his life even though he is not earning a sufficient money. The flaw I found in Dean is that, despite knowing that Cindy doesn't love him anymore, he is not ready to let her go. He is alone trying to save the marriage, while Cindy has become repulsive of Dean over the years (Don't know the reason of it) Cindy's personality is very strange can be assumed by the joke told by her on bus. Cindy is not the person who can remain in relationship with a person for a long time. She laughingly says to Dean that she met Bobby (The guy who beats Dean up and gives him a black eye) and asked hi how he was. A first, when Dean was irritated at the mention of Bobby. But, later when it comes to know that Cindy broke up with Bobby, and Bobby beat Dean up, it is quite natural of Dean to get pi##ed off.Dean is not sure, if he is the father of Cindy's child. But, still accepts both of them, loves both of them like anything, only to get rejected by Cindy over and over again. The reason of her repulsion of Dean is not shown. It hurts you a lot when Dean says- 'How much rejection I am supposed to take?' Of course, there are flaws in Dean's personality too. But, somehow I feel sorry for Dean in the end. Even their daughter loves Dean more than Cindy. Anyways, this is a very sad or what we can say far too realistic movie, where there is no enlightenment, and in the end you will feel blue, with its effects remaining on you for a few days.",Blue Valentine

149,fwmurnau,Well-done but WOW is it depressing ...,5,6 February 2011,"Gosling is excellent and Williams is even better (a remarkable actress!) in this hyper-naturalistic kitchen sink drama of a working class couple's unraveling marriage.It's full of deliberately grim and ugly details like the death of the family dog at the beginning, sex scenes that will make you never want to have sex again, and an abortion clinic scene that -- at the showing I saw -- sent several traumatized female audience members charging out of the theater.With its focus on everything negative -- despair, degradation, alienation -- BLUE VALENTINE reminds me of those Ingmar Bergman films of the 60s and 70s about horrible couples in horrible relationships. These films are so relentlessly morbid and depressing they're almost unwatchable now. The story is very well-observed, well-written, there's a lot to relate to, but still it's not exactly fun to view. Mainly because the characters are not interesting people; they're just helpless and pathetic, though the leads do everything they can to make them sympathetic. Still, much of it plays like watching a car wreck with fatalities.If you like this kind of kitchen sink realism, this may be for you; it's a fine example of the genre. For others it may seem like enduring a two hour root canal.",Blue Valentine
150,cB391,"Painfully Good, but not Great",6,19 April 2011,"I watched the first hour and a half, and could barely understand the movie. It made sense in the plot was good, the acting was good, and the storyline was real, that is why it made no sense to me. Going through the movie, it was made to look that Dean is the bad guy, but from what i watched is that he was a caring, good father who works hard and does all he can to help make his marriage work. Cindy on the other hand was an overemotional character, that is seen as the abused one throughout the movie, but to me it kept appearing that she was the one that caused the whole situation, and wasn't helping her husband make the situation they were in workable. The starting was enjoyable and emotional at times, but I did not really connect to the story, and felt that these dysfunctional relationships happen, and they are heartbreaking to see, and the trauma that it causes on all members is horrifying.",Blue Valentine
151,macktan894,When passion cools,7,15 January 2011,"We can see that Cindy has fallen out of love. She rarely looks her husband in the eye anymore; there are no touches or embraces. She's got to get to work, drop her daughter off at school, all the things that cause most people to hurry in the morning. Except her husband, Dean, who is content to play with his daughter and take his time. He paints houses. She's a nurse. Without their daughter to manage, they'd have little to talk about.Blue Valentine takes us back and forth from the beginnings of this relationship to its current state, from the blossoming to the withering. They were kids when they met, with not a care in the world except themselves. At that age, you take people at face value and romanticize the rest. Dean is witty, talented, carefree and caring. Cindy is trusting and perhaps a bit needy. Sex is great.Most of us have been in relationships that ended, and the ending is rarely painless. But when you begin fantasizing about your independence from the person you used to dream about being with constantly, that's a sign. The story needs little interpretation and the director's style is somewhat cinema verite, very unHollywood, documentary verging on mundane. I liked Gosling a lot--his character had more dimension than Williams' and I ended up feeling more for Dean even though the director made him the heavy in the relationship. Many have raved about the film but I found it a tad bit tedious in parts.",Blue Valentine
152,flickernatic,From beginning to end without passing through a middle?,5,20 January 2011,"This hyped-up movie turns out to be rather average. The plot is simple and universal - a young couple fall in love, they get older and more world-experienced, they fall out of love. Plot-wise, that's pretty much it.Numerous often confusingly-placed flash-backs show us how pure and simple their original relationship was, though She had a lot (? - 'about 25' from the age of 13) of lovers. When she falls pregnant she cannot be sure that He is the father.We also see the couple in the present, She now a busy medic, He (naturally!) a drunken, chain-smoking bozo who has never progressed beyond warehouse work. Not that he is an unlikeable character, for we see that he loves children (his infant daughter), animals (the dog) and old people (he tenderly helps an elderly man settle into a rest home).The couple's marriage is disintegrating; they go to a futuristic hotel for a weekend of passion in a room that looks like a cross between an American diner and the Tardis. It seems, as He puts it, 'like a robot's vagina' - a phrase which is striking but which doesn't really work - and neither do they. Later there's a confrontation at her place of work, and they are nicely shown looking past each other with Her image reflected in a glass partition. Interspersed with these scenes are various depictions of full-sex which simply become boring and which don't add to the story.What we don't see, however, is what happens in between then and now. We don't see them struggling with Life, so we are not really much wiser at the end of the movie than we were at the beginning. How He and She got to be where they are remains frustratingly obscure.The movie is saved from being a complete turn-off largely by the excellent acting all round, and by the lush camera-work. Faith Wladyka is particularly brilliant as the couple's child, especially in the early scenes with her daddy. If only He had not been encouraged to mumble his lines so much - what is it with this mumbling thing? It wasn't up to much even from Brando.So, worth seeing but don't be surprised if you come away disappointed.P.S. We saw the movie at our regular haunt, the Cornerhouse, in Manchester, UK, a great movie venue if you're ever passing this way.",Blue Valentine
153,Nothinggrandproductions,A film that doesn't hold back but suffers with it's poor pacing,7,28 August 2013,"As I went to sit and watch Blue Valentine, I had somewhat high expectations. I had already seen The Place Beyond The Pines, which is done by the same director (Derek Cianfrance). I found The Place Beyond The Pines to be unique, interesting, and had ambition that paid off in the end. I can't totally say the same about Blue Valentine. The movie follows Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) through their marriage as well as flashbacks to when they first met and their young love. This isn't your typical happy romantic comedy, it's very serious and isn't all about how great love is all the time rather it shows both sides. It shows the turmoil of their relationship as well as how pure it was at first. And I really appreciate that. Most films that are solely about romance and love will be unrealistic and rarely have actual realism in anyway. But, this film didn't implement everything perfectly.The performances by Gosling and Williams are fantastic. Every single conversation in this film feels real and could easily be something that happened in real life. None of it feels like a movie, rather real life. From the beautiful purity of the early relationship to the argumentative years of their marriage, it never feels fake. The flashbacks to their early relationship are used as a fantastic contrast while also fleshing out the story more. That doesn't mean the story never feels thin. The pacing and plot itself were off. The movie moves much too slow for it's own good and it needed more details. I felt like it showed the beginnings and ends of their relationship fairly well (although, pieces could have been cut out to make the movie move better) but the middle essentially being left out leaves both characters to go from a pure relationship and then towell a not so pure relationship without much context. There was plenty of details in the plot that only scratched the surface and needed to be explained further to allow the characters to have more depth. As I said, the characters do indeed feel real but that doesn't mean they didn't still fall into stereotypes. They could still fall into typical categories of characters used in any narrative and that's a problem. I needed more depth for this character and it's unfortunate that the film runs for nearly two hours and doesn't provide me with quite enough for these characters to feel more significant. They don't resonate enough, the movie needed to be more specific with them rather than only scratching the surface as I mentioned early about the plot, it applies here as well. Don't get me wrong, the film is still worth a watch and I'm glad to see a film not hold back with showing a failed relationship while using a great contrast of their early love. But, the bigger issue here, is that it's already been done better. 500 Days of Summer provides a much more interesting experience and had more depth as well as at the same time, at least has some comic relief. Now, I don't care if a film doesn't have comic relief, that doesn't bother me in anyway, it's just that 500 Days of Summer does pretty much everything better (I know comparisons are a waste of time, but I couldn't help myself.) The film is good and certainly worth a watch, especially if you hate the typical romance films that come out of Hollywood which seem to paint the world as a perfect place where everything is okay (not to say escapism is bad, but, I think it's easy to say films like those definitely distort reality for some people). Ultimately, I'd say the performances carry the film and the fact that the film doesn't hold any punches back, Gosling and Williams are great in it, it's worth it just to see their performances.",Blue Valentine
154,MovieGeekBlog,A real relationship with real people in the real world!!,8,24 November 2010,"This film is possibly one of the most realistic depiction of the ""falling in and out of love"" story I've seen in a very long time (possibly ever). It's certainly not an easy watch: its raw and honest quality makes it almost palpable and you truly believe these two characters have been living as a couple for years, had a child together and are now going through their toughest time yet.The film follows two time lines and inter-cuts them to perfection: The present day, in which things are not going to well and the past (you're never quite sure how long it's been between the two times, but the make up on the actors and the age of the child, makes you deduct that it must be at least 5 or 6 years).The audience is left putting the pieces together and wondering ""how did they get there?"". And yet the film doesn't really answer many questions, mainly because sometimes there isn't a straight answer.Derek Cianfrance films this story as a documentary (it's interesting to notice that's what his background has been so far). The camera seems to capture little looks, gestures, lines of dialogue almost by mistake, as if it happened to be there by mistake. Crucial lines are sometimes delivered as the leads turn their back to camera and sometimes even off-screen. There are a couple of intimate moments in the film too, and why they too are raw as they can be, they're also never distasteful or gratuitous. I was shocked to learn how this film got a NC17 rating in America, treating it as if this was some sort of pornographic flick (which it really is not!), or as if it was worse than any of those explicitly graphically violent movies like Machete for example, which is out at the same time.I mean... really!? You barely see a couple of breasts from a few seconds and that's about it. I seem to remember much stronger images in Basic Instict years and years ago...(SPOILER ALERT) I must confess there's a scene in the film which is so intense that for a moment I thought I wasn't going to take it. It's when Michelle Williams decides to go to the hospital to have an abortion. Once again the true raw atmosphere of the film makes this scene almost unbearable. A woman sitting next to me was covering her eyes all the way through... and yet, you don't really see anything at all. The whole scene is played on Michelle Williams face as you hear the doctor explaining to her what he'll do, step by step. Mercifully, she changes her mind before it's too late.Which brings me to talk about the acting in this film. This is certainly Michelle Williams's best performance yet (though she has already been pretty good in the last few years) but what really stood out for me was Ryan Gosling who managed to portray a character full of imperfections and faults and yet made him so likable that it's impossible to blame.(SPOILER ALERT) The scene towards the end when Michelle's character confronts her husband and tells him she has no love for him anymore is truly heartbreaking and made even more powerful by inter-cutting of the scene wedding day. The dialogue is minimal, the music almost non-existent and yet the actors bring it alive like nothing I've seen this year.Sadly the film might be a bit too low-key to get any Oscar recognition, but it surely deserves some!! moviegeekblog.wordpress.com",Blue Valentine
155,nazztrader,Trying to have it both ways doesn't work so well.,7,17 January 2011,"The director or writer wants the audience to feel at least some ambivalence about who is to ""blame"" here, apparently. And that's fine with me, but I would have liked to have seen the Cindy character say to the Dean character: ""I'm not blaming you. It's my fault. I saw you go back and forth, one moment a child and the next a passive/aggressive creep. I knew something was wrong but I sort of got addicted to the entertaining Dean and allowed myself to overlook creepy Dean. If you want to get some counseling, I'll go with you, but in the meantime I'm going to establish some boundaries, and the first time you violate one of them, it's over for ever. Then it will be your fault, not mine.""To me, that would have been more thought-provoking, and the film could have ended there, with Dean thinking about it, and the audience not knowing whether childish Dean or creepy Dean was present, mentally. I knew someone like Dean. The way his wife dealt with him was by getting into long, loud arguments. Nothing was ever really resolved, but they kept arguing this way for many years (eventually, a divorce resulted). If you are interested in this kind of phenomenon, I suggest reading one of John Gottman's books. For me, this film was consistent with what he's written (based on his experiments), and so it was somewhat interesting academically for me, but not all that enjoyable as a film. It was a bit too long for the subject matter, containing scenes that ran too long. I guess we are supposed to ""get to know"" these people and feel for them because of the documentary-like presentation. However, I felt a bit manipulated. This kind of thing is common, and solutions are out there, for those who are willing to do some ""work."" If not, I'm not sure I want to see these kinds of problems when I watch a film. I'll read a Gottman book instead, when that's what I want to ponder.",Blue Valentine
156,ldquinn,A Bit Disjointed,4,21 December 2011,"I really tried to like this one; really tried to get it to three stars; but, I just couldn't seem to like the entire film enough.Both Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams did a good job with their roles - sometimes excellent jobs. The direction was, like the acting, really good at times, pedestrian at others.Flipping back and forth through time was a key part of this film, but I found myself hoping for a clearer delineation of when I was in the past and/or the present - one should not have to discern this in a film - one should be brought there and know without wondering.Also, I found that the physical similarity between the two characters involved with Michelle Williams was too close and tended to lead to confusion.I certainly didn't feel that this film lived up to the hype. Shame on me for not picking up the telltale clue that generally points to a disappointing film - the majority of films that have a spurt of press just before opening that surrounds the film's rating always seem to disappoint.Oh well, as usual, the popcorn was excellent!",Blue Valentine

This movie was sooo awful it was unbearable...I didn't know whether my wife felt the same way, so I didn't ask to leave (we don't speak during movies); AND, we had dinner reservations timed to the end of the movie. So...I sat there. BIG MISTAKE.The characters were shallow, the dialogue was not funny, clever or nuanced...nothing but dull. It seemed that half the scenes were improvised. I imagine the director saying: ""OK folks...here's what's happening in this scene...feel it, and go for it. Ryan you start with this line 'blah blah' and Michelle, you respond like this 'blah.' Then, you both take it from here."" And the endless ENDLESS close-ups...this looked like a film school project slated for 20 minutes that got out of hand. Depressing.

But it is also a case study of how marriages with good intentions, all of the right feelings, can just as easily die when those feelings fade and reality sets in.Check out my full review here: http://reelstorymovies.blogspot.com/2012/05/blue-valentine.html",Blue Valentine

A bunch of negative characters that didn't respect one another. It was torture to sit through.Michelle Williams character was arrogant and had the nerve to question Ryan's character's potential. Here is a man that simply wants to be with his family but that's not enough.I don't even know why this deplorable film was even two hours long. An argument that lasted way too long toward the end. She's abusive toward Ryan's character. I know that there are people like this, but what is the point of sitting through a film like this.I didn't see how this was heart warming at all. I did like the non-linear approach. So the direction wasn't bad but the writing and development of the characters was.The actors did do a great job working with what they were left with.I guess the one redeeming quality of Ryan's character was that he wasn't abusive toward his wife or child which was good to see.I hate to be harsh but, for me this was a waste of time.",Blue Valentine

162,ken1848,Move Thee Reviews: Love is Just Like Fireworks,9,29 January 2011,"With an Oscar nomination for the best leading actress, Blue Valentine is a poignant portrait of a failed marriage. It is no Revolutionary Road, which is much nosier and about a bourgeois couple. Unlike 5x2, which shows a couple's story in reverse chronological order, Blue Valentine interweaves the happy past with the unhappy present and creates a stark and heartbreaking contrast.The main characters are so realistic and three-dimensional that the audience will care about what happens to them. Dean is a lower-class man coming from a broken family. When young, he had dreams and never thought becoming a husband and a father could be one, but now, because of Cindy, it is. He truly loves Cindy, who is an ambitious nurse. Although she does not fancy Dean, she marries him because he is willing to take care of her baby whose father is her ex-boyfriend. After six years, she becomes dissatisfied. Dean may be right. ""Girls spend their whole life looking for Prince Charming and then they marry the guy who's got a good job and is gonna stick around."" Therefore, she keeps herself aloof from Dean, though he is good to her and her baby. It is worth noting that Cindy's boyfriend is physically weaker than her ex-boyfriends (the doctor < Dean < Bobby), yet he has a higher social status (the doctor > Dean > Bobby) and it seems that men solve problems by resorting to violence. Besides, Cindy's inability to form a stable romantic relationship and feelings of insecurity may be shaped by her abusive father. The three broken families show that marriage is fragile and passion dies away. Lies, suspicion, broken promises, fights, the wreckage of dreams, etc, seem inevitable in a marriage.Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling, whose facial expressions, body language and remarks can effectively convey their pent-up emotions, give convincing and powerful performances. Thanks to the capable and charismatic cast, the audience will be dragged into a stifling whirlpool of the lifelike characters' growing frustrations. There are several scenes of immense tension, e.g. the future room, hospital, kitchen, etc. To my astonishment, Ryan Gosling can sing. In one of the most memorable scenes of the year, Dean sings while plucking the strings of his ukulele and Cindy tap dances, which reminds me of Once.The music sets the right atmosphere for the film. A romantic but melancholy mood is captured in this bittersweet love story. You and Me by Penny and the Quarters and You Always Hurt the One You Love by Ryan Gosling simply blow me away.Love is just like fireworks. They splutter, burst into dazzling sparks and go out. When passion eventually wanes, an aching emptiness reigns.",Blue Valentine
163,deproduction,A heart-wrenching and cautionary tale of love,8,17 January 2011,"I came away from this film more wary of love and relationships than any film I've ever seen. You look at Dean's character (Gosling's best role to-date) and wonder what it is that he did wrong. He fell for a beautiful, young woman (Williams), stepped-up to care for her and her yet-unborn daughter, and shifted his life to focus entirely on being a good husband and father. He was so charming in his interactions with his daughter, and was also loving towards his wife enduring more rejection from her than most could, trying to breathe love back into the relationship. Even his outbursts seemed attempts to give her what she wanted.So many reviews talk about this being a story of falling in and out of love. My response is surely subjective, but I don't feel Cindy ever loved Dean. She was desperate, pregnant and facing life as a young parent, and Dean was there to hold her. As a mother and wife, I found her to be unlikeable and selfish, cold and unloving. Cindy was probably not intentionally manipulative, but from her initial reluctance to tell Dean about her pregnancy, to her secrecy around her job offer or the encounter in the grocery store, these are all subtle manipulations and lies, hiding the truth (and her true self) from Dean.I heard the director say he was sympathetic to both characters. Any sympathy I had for Cindy as a young woman caught in a relationship and family she did not hope for was overshadowed by the fact that she made the choices that led her there, and dragged others in with her. I did not sense any growth in her character to indicate she'd move on to create a brighter future for herself and Frankie.Dean, on the other hand, was a good person, eager to love, and all-too-willing to devote his life to Cindy and daughter Frankie (a sparse, but strong, performance by Faith Wladyka), and in the end, he's left with a broken heart and a broken home. I'd love to feel he's better-off without Cindy, if only it weren't so heartbreakingly clear that he loves her and her daughter immensely. To me, the film served as a warning in love to be careful where you put your energy.",Blue Valentine

165,francescof86,"""Blue Valentine""",5,28 October 2011,"The movie focus is the depiction of a broken marriage between two working class people,Dean and Cindy.What could have been a great movie becomes a failed occasion to portray an emotionally absorbing tale of an ended love story(as it was in a terrific movie such ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind""). Despite the movie boasts great performances by the two leading actors,particularly by Williams,the big problem is the lack of a solid script that doesn't offer the chance to know about the characters and their love story.I would not call them insignificant informations because when you decide to make a movie about a couple and their fallen marriage you have to provide the audience of a plausible explanation of their relationship.Without that we struggle to be involved with the two leads.With ""Blue Valentine"" we exactly don't know why they fell in love and why after years they can't stand each other and why their love ends.We are left with a series of disjointed bouncing back and forth scenes of their former happy days that have not much to say,except that they go quite well together in the first chapters and scenes of their declined relationship.As I said before,the acting is solid(to compensate the holes in the script).Ryan Gosling was very good but it's Michelle Williams who gives a great performance that is the best thing of the entire movie.She deserved her Oscar nomination for her outstanding performance.Gosling portrays a man who tries to understand why her wife doesn't love him anymore and a good father although he has a scantly work that clearly makes Cindy feel quite disappointed and he is often drunk.I suspect that Cianfrance takes the side of the female lead although she is the most unlikeable of both of the leading characters and due to the troublesome script we hardly understand why she was in love and why she became so cold towards her husband.I simply found ""Blue Valentine"" the most overrated movie of 2010 and I don't know if this movie wouldn't have struggled to win many praises if it wasn't for the Weinstein campaign.My vote of the movie is 5/10.",Blue Valentine
166,smoky_circles,Seems to me someone could be blamed,7,25 June 2012,"A chilling and frustrating movie that tries to say 'it's both their faults, and this is how it goes'. It shows how the worst qualities of the couple (especially the wife) come out full force against each other.I couldn't help but feel that it was Cindy's fault. Distant and repelling from the start, Cindy goes to the affectionate and caring, if stupid, Dean when she's pregnant with another man's child (a note should be made: a pre-medical student does not know how to/ attempt to prevent a pregnancy immediately after sex? Instead she just washes herself after having unprotected sex....Then three months into it, decides to have an abortion. It's really not a wonder that she didn't end up a doctor).Dean goes on to do more for her than any man can be expected to: first takes her to the clinic, then marries her....He even loves the daughter as his own. He repeatedly tries to be affectionate to Cindy, only to be repelled by her every time. When she meets the baby's father, who once beat up Dean like crazy, she makes conversation with him like he was a high school sweetheart or something.So overall, it was just easier for me forgive Dean's character flaws: he smokes, he drinks, he's lazy and he makes excuses, to Cindy's repulsive attitude: she is consistently distant and repelling, obviously blames him for her dissatisfaction with life, and just can't let Dean in.All in all, this movie seemed to me the case of a loving, if incapable man chasing after a distant and repelling woman.

168,cheryllynecox-1,"Red, White, and Mostly Blue Valentine",8,14 February 2010,"This family album is familiar. A beautiful small town girl meets an eccentric but charming stranger and they fall in dumb. Five years and one enchanting child later, his romantic notions sustain the illusion of his happiness, but her reality is not so poetic. This is a quick snapshot of Dean, Cindy, and Frankie. What happens in this family is what happens to so many others when affection is replaced by contempt, when passive aggression becomes less the former and more or less the latter.Derek Cianfrance has been developing ""Blue Valentine"" for nearly 12 years, and his film is not just a complex portrait of its two main characters, it's also profoundly honest as it examines intimacy from every angle. Emotionally and physically, the romantic story of Dean and Cindy flashes backward in beautifully edited matching shots that show us the first flourish of affection, and the final backlash of frustration. Cianfrance doesn't force his audience to choose sides though it was probably easier for me to identify with Cindy. That's what is the most compelling about this film. I cared about both of the main characters and didn't want either to lose. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams both delivered superb performances and each took a little piece of my heart. Or as Tom Waits said in his song, ""It's the tattooed broken promise"" (Dean has a ""Giving Tree"" tat on his upper arm).The camera work and art direction are exceptionally effective. Set primarily around Independence Day, we see flags, fireworks, and all realm of red, white, and blue. This motif is subtly conveyed with the lighting and costumes throughout the film and continues throughout the credits. Fireworks serve as a last reminder of the explosive power and fractured remnants of a brief illumination.When this film is finally released, I expect it will receive an R rating for some fairly graphic nudity and explicit sexuality. There is also a brutal fight, alcohol consumption and smoking. And if that's not enough, a near-abortion might be too much for some, but hey, this is a very contemporary portrait of a familiar American marriage.",Blue Valentine
169,picassomanhdan,an authentic depiction of romance in the modern age,7,8 September 2016,"To be frank, I didn't finish the whole movie on one go: three separate days was what it took me. The inability to sit through it continuously doesn't justify this. Certain parts of the film suffocated me to the extent that the urge to take a respite is inevitable.The main enquiry point that the film tries to address, in my opinion, is what constitutes to a marriage, and thus, if these constituents are absent, does divorce ensue? The protagonists are both troubled adults: Dean was rejected by his mother and Cindy grew up in her parents' strained relationship. The romance of Dean and Cindy was fostered in an unexpected manner. They met each other at the old folks home, a place where their identities are stripped away. Such a circumstance is commonplace to nurture romantic inclination - the perception of those that one has previously acquainted with matters little, providing an opportunity for a fresh start. Although they did get to know each other more thoroughly, eventually revealing their personalities, this was done in a rather controlled way. Full decision of how they extract their own souls to each other allows such.The juxtaposition of the past and the present grants watchers the ability to compare and contrast the initial seed of their relationship, as well as its decay. Dean's school of thought and his unconventional romaticism appealed to Cindy tremendously. However, she gradually grew to get fed up with it. The uneven growth of the protagonists - Dean being dogged to sustain his philosophy and Cindy demanding more from a husband - facilitates the breakdown of their relationship. Romance is still evident in their relationship, but it has developed into a rather morbid thing. The caress that they give each other, the closeness that suggest intimacy, appear inconsequential to the damage they inflict on each other. Distorting Cindy's words into seemingly inconsiderate and mean remarks, Dean illustrates his view that he doesn't feel worthwhile of the relationship. Although meant to disturb Cindy, Dean's comments, I consider, were subconsciously intended to hurt himself.Daisy's intolerance for Dean's ignorance of life intensifies as the film progresses. His lack of an ambition infuriated her, especially when she is in a field of work that is surrounded by professionals. This frustration is essential in driving Daisy to grow disapproval of Dean, a key turning point of the whole movie. I hardly believe that there's nothing left between the couple when Dean departs from he family. Daisy's hug proves the otherwise, as more clearly shown when coupled with the scene of their wedding ceremony. The romance that they have cannot be defined by the conception of marriage. After all, is marriage an accurate indicator of romantic love? This point transforms the view of divorce that is predominantly deemed as the nonexistence of love. The fact that physical distance is in-between doesn't necessarily hinder and lessen any degree of romanticism. Ultimately, who is responsible for the cripple of their relationship? Is it Dean who yearns little for his own career, conceives inflammatory remarks and shows insensitive altitudes towards Daisy? Or is it Daisy who has grown to want more from Dean, feels troubled and shackled in this relationship and loses the sense of exhilaration that once resided in her mind when they first met? I doubt if the answer can be satisfactorily provided. Some aspects circumstances change, some remain consistent; some parts of people change, some exhibit little alteration. They all play a role in engendering the decay of the relationship.I adore the fact that his movie does not employ a key event to guide the story line like an accident, memory loss or incurable diseases. In reality, rarely do such events occur in one's life, yet relationships could still rot. However, I doubt if there is any clear correlation of the downturn of a relationship with the sustenance of romance. Relationships are rather a physical thread that bound couples together, but romance deals with metaphysical confrontation of oneself.",Blue Valentine

172,myc4971,"Falling In, Falling Out: It always take two to tango",8,25 January 2011,"As the credits began to roll (which is just visually stunning!), the first thing that came to my mind is --- WHAT??? THAT'S IT? Some would characterize the movie as somber, gut wrenching, heart breaking, depressing but after some thinking (and I've only finished watching it about an hour ago), I would rather say that it's refreshing which is quite contrary to my thoughts during the first 45 minutes of the movie. Going into this, I thought this movie would remind me so much of movies that tries to dissect a marriage --- Heartburn, The Story of Us or even Revolutionary Road (which I refuse to compare it with since the whole point of that movie is not about the dynamics of marriage but rather breaking out of the norm).But now that I've processed the movie as a whole --- the movie is not as simple and plain as any viewer would think. There's a whole layer of story unspoken and silent between the lines and the scenes. And I think it's very clever for the director to leave it to the audience to try and put things together. I've read a wonderful and insightful review from Ebert on the movie and one thing that struck me in his review: ""The movie paces back and forth as if trying to find out what went wrong"". I think that statement pretty much sums up why the screenplay was structured this way. It characterizes and reflects the state that the characters are in. And it was just done seamlessly.For one, it wasn't explicitly explored why Cindy fell out of love. And at first that put me off but as I think back now, I think it was --- not in so many words... but that's where the subtlety and the uniqueness of the movie shines through.Everybody knows the basic plot of the movie: boy meets girl, the two fell in love, girl gets knocked up, they decide to get married, they fall out of love. But where Blue Valentine is set apart from all the previous movies we've seen about marriage is that it covers probably the most common reason why marriages fall apart --- different expectations. Let's go back to the beginning: going into the relationship, you know that the relationship is bound to fail. Dean is pretty much a simple guy with simple dreams looking to fall in love. Cindy is a girl looking to fall in love with someone who can be with her as she accomplishes greater things. And it took 6 years for this problem to unravel. This difference existed when they got married but they never got around to talk about it. Parenthood came, which buried the issue even much deeper.Dean is a romantic by nature but definitely not a dreamer, he went through the marriage like it's always going to be there; the same approach he takes in jobs. Cindy which you can see by the way she conducts herself at work, sees her job as a career and not just a means to an end. This conflict is apparent in almost conversation before the confrontation happened. I like the scene at the car going to the motel and Cindy was unsure if she was going to tell Dean that she bumped into her ex because it just showed how severe things are between them --- they can't even carry a conversation without twisting each other's words. In the end, I don't think it's fair to just blame Cindy just because Dean has proved to be great at romantic gestures. It takes two people to make a marriage work and marriage is definitely not a string of romantic gestures... it's made up of daily responsibilities, hard work, dreams, planning, maturity and more things that's outside the realm of romance.OK, the situation may not be as bad as some of the problems in other marriage but I think majority of marriages have the same problem. It's a terrifying mirror how a simple problem can end up so badly.I would recommend this movie as a MUST for couples planning to get married just as a REALITY CHECK. Sometimes the last thing on our minds when we're about to jump into it is if we both have the same expectations. So in the end, will Dean and Cynthia find a way to make it work? You definitely don't have to watch the movie again to find out, you just have to look around the married couples around you or your own marriage. Or maybe it's easier to google for divorce statistics.To sum it up, it's an old wheel reinvented so it comes highly recommended. Michelle Williams is the star of the movie --- you don't see much physical transformation in the time lapses but the changes were all innate which is harder to pull off. Ryan Gosling, I think could have been better but it was a strong performance nonetheless.",Blue Valentine

I could have stayed home for that. Nothing was new in this.

175,fpcholcomb,A Relationship Unadulterated,8,21 July 2019,"Human relationships are endlessly complex. There are so many subtleties buried in the ways we interact that often lie undetected to the untrained eye. We wade through the waters of life occasionally clinging to each other in an attempt to buoy ourselves against a sea of uncertainty. It does not always go the way we hope. Blue Valentine takes a small subsection of a particular kind of city relationship and puts it under a microscope for us all to dissect, and in doing so it paints a heartfelt, melancholic, and turbulent story for viewers to immerse themselves in.It is an unflinchingly real depiction of a dull postmodern marriage between two people who were forced by circumstance into each other's arms perhaps a bit prematurely. It challenges a romanticized version of love often portrayed on the silver screen. Love does not conquer all. It is far more enigmatic than we like to believe. Circumstances change. People change. Ryan Gosling & Michelle Williams melt into their respective roles and play off each other's physical and verbal cues with a familiarity that is palpable. I loved the setting, a scruffy contemporary New York. It is not the concrete jungle of yesteryear but it still has its fair share of sleazy motels and cheap busses. The cinematography does not romanticize the place and time, instead offering its focus on the two main characters. Ancillary characters are extremely ancillary. Apart from a few indulgent shots the movie is very up-close and personal intimately peaking into the two's relationship. It tries to confine itself to the relatively small confines of their world. In this way it succeeds.The movie feels long and is hard to watch at times. But there are moments in our life that don't skate by, and this movie attempts to portray such moments honestly. Watching the two play cat and mouse in a sleazy motel is equally parts romantic as it is terrifying. Seeing Ryan hold his daughter so affectionate while his wife frustratedly toils in the background is both cute and sad. You hope and hope these two will work out their differences, if not for themselves than for the sake of their child. You hope love will win. I did not always enjoy watching the life and death of a relationship, but I respected everything Derek Cianfrance attempted here.",Blue Valentine
176,GrowMagicBeans,A study of Love in context,9,13 January 2014,"The first we see of Cindy (Michelle Williams), she is looking worn and tired as she tries organise her day around her child, her work and her seemingly no-good-for-nothing, lay-about man. Dean (Ryan Gosling), the beer guzzling partner, first appears to us as a man with little ambition, overly jealous and, lets be honest, a bit of a lose thread.The movie continues to develop as the couple plan a week-end away in a shady 'romance' hotel. Here they try to rekindle their love and reconcile their diverging needs, aspirations and sexual wants. These scene are course and very hard to watch at times, but are intermittently cut with flashbacks outlining a happier past of how the pair originally met and came to be. We can't blame Cindy for falling out of love with Dean, nor can we blame her for falling for his romantic and goofy antics to begin with, but the interesting aspect of the movie is, that as we see Cindy's love fall away, our sympathies actually grow for Dean as we witness how genuine his feelings for her were and just how much he unconditionally sacrificed to win her love. The true tragedy is then that two people, once very much in love, can end up falling from each other because time can change the context in which that relationship began. In this way, I don't think I've ever seen a movie that manages to so subtlety shift my sympathy --we really do feel for Dean by the end-- and yet manage to stay true to the characters in essence. I think this has to be Ryan Gosling's best performance to date! He breaks from his usual demure of staring off wistfully into an unknown space and actually presents a character who is animated, goofy, genuine, vulnerable and very much human. So too, does Michelle Williams make an outstanding performance. She has to meld the younger, more naive Cindy with the older, perhaps wiser and ambitious Cindy. Again there is something that touches upon the human condition in her performance: as we begin to realise how much she means to the Dean character, we could very nearly come to despise her for falling out of love with him, but she manages to portray a girl troubled with conflicting desires and so we near feel her pain, written on her face, as she battles to reconcile the inevitable shift within. As far as on screen chemistry goes, these two are about as genuine as it gets, portraying both a young couple very much in love, and later as a couple straining to maintain a relationship. Though it is not always an easy picture to watch, it has some very touching moments. It is one of those works of art that will move something within, as it is a contemplative narrative that has something genuine to say.",Blue Valentine
177,Mun7eanu,Love still exists,8,1 October 2018,"One of the best couples on screen. Unexpected real and great acts from Gosling and Williams. They have good times and bad times, but you can feel the love all the time. They gave me the feelings from the first love.",Blue Valentine
178,movieevangelist,Review: Blue Valentine,8,25 January 2011,"The Pitch: Breaking up is hard to do. And to watch, for that matter The Review: Love stories have been rich fodder for cinema over its entire history, with many of the most highly regarded films ever made boiling down to the simple story of how two people find love. Trying to pin down love is a little more elusive, however, and the nature and representation of romantic love is somewhat different to what it might have been in previous generations. Consequently, fewer films have trodden the path of what causes love or relationships to break down; Blue Valentine tackles both ends of the relationship spectrum, looking at a couple's initial coming together and the beginning of the end for their relationship.The non-linear structure is initially only given away by the visual cues; different film (one digital, the other more old fashioned) used for the different times, but also the appearance of the two leads. Not only do Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) sport different clothes and hair to show up the difference, but their very mannerisms and demeanour serve to contrast the exuberance of their first exchanges and the world-weariness of their marriage after six years together, seemingly going through the motions. It's almost trivial to say that both are excellent, scattering their respective characters with little details which make them completely believable, albeit more than a little unsympathetic.Now more than a third of marriages end in divorce, where once that statistic would have been much lower; the film juxtaposes the older characters and their relationships with the failing marriage, although it's hard to escape the underlying cynicism about both love and marriage, almost as if those couples that stay together do simply because they can't be honest with themselves, and that there is no such thing as love at all, only circumstance and a set of choices that present themselves over time. There's certainly mutual attraction at the beginning of this relationship, and the kind of flirting that often happens in indie and low budget films, but the cuts between the beginning and the end are done in such a way as to make the end inevitable and the film becomes almost a modern day tragedy, a parable of our times and a social commentary on generational differences but one still only reflective of the minority. The rampant symbolism in the settings, from doomed love songs to tacky motel rooms, all support the fatalistic attitude that Blue Valentine has towards Dean and Cindy.Director Derek Gianfrance wants to make us hurt as much as the characters, so pushes us in close with the camera, even when the going gets tough, through both physical pain and the emotional endurance of the characters. There was much controversy over the sex scenes, but they're all an extension of the mood at that point in the narrative and there's nothing hugely gratuitous, serving only to ground the whole film firmly in the real world. The direction itself gives full weight to the acting, and there's a suitably doleful score that flits in and out of proceedings, but what you're left with is a very one sided argument about the nature of relationships, and the only thing that rewards are the beautifully nuanced performances. The almost complete lack of sympathetic characters means you may appreciate the quality of Blue Valentine while in its presence, and that quality does make it worth your time initially, but if you're anything but a hardened cynic you may not wish to make a long term commitment to it.Why see it at the cinema: It's beautifully shot, extraordinarily well performed and the close in camera means the cinema will give you an absolute intimacy with the characters. If that's what you want, of course.The Score: 8/10",Blue Valentine
179,Valithanithizum,Triumphant Cinema.,9,14 February 2012,"Blue Valentine is one of those movies that takes you into a realm that not many movies take us. It's a true epic work of cinematography, dialog, and acting all rolled into one. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Willams put together two of the finest acting jobs I've ever seen. Such amazing chemistry, they simply command you to watch this movie. The plot is deep and involving. Ranging from fun and comedic, laugh out loud funny at times. To melancholy and depressing. It shows true range of emotions, and really takes you into part of your head that isn't often explored. I really think this movie should be praised more than it has been, it's truly a classic.With one of the most compelling movies of 2010, you simply must watch this film. It's one of those movies that will stick with you for ages to come. Triumphant Cinema.8.9/10",Blue Valentine

What is the point with these movies jumping around different periods of time in the story? Half the time you are trying to work out what time period you are in, it helps a little with the balding look of gosling as the later period of time. Michelle Williams was good as she always is.

182,etvltd,"recommended by myETVmedia, great movie.",9,7 October 2010,"With his film Blue Valentine, director Derek Cinefranc brings one of the bright lights of the Sundance Film Festival to TIFF. The film documents the bookends of a relationship, juxtaposing the past, Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) meeting and falling in love, and the present, as they struggle through the painful disintegration of their marriage. In the Q&A following the screening Cinefranc revealed that the genesis of the film came from his own life. As a child he had two nightmares – one was nuclear war and the other was that his mother and father would get divorced. When, as an adult, his parents did separate Cinefranc sought solace in film and literature but was unable to find anything that he could relate to; anything that didn't depict a ""Romeo and Juliet version of love"". With Blue Valentine, Cinefranc has created a work that any child of divorce, or anyone who has ever loved and lost, will find realistic and moving... read more @http://www.myetvmedia.com/film-review/blue-valentine/",Blue Valentine
183,BeautifulDisaster5287,"You Always Hurt, The Ones You Love...",10,21 January 2011,"What a film this was. The story spans over some year and is about a man and wife with marital problems. I don't really want to tell you anything more...just watch it. I just finished, and they said this film stings...boy does it. The acting, first off, is exquisite. The back and forth from past to present was perfectly placed throughout the film and the overall outcome is so heart-wrenching, it feels like you've been punched in the stomach. Awards season, here this film comes...And The Soundtrack? I want it.....soooooo bad. Whoever did the music deserves a medal.Best Scenes: 1. The part where Ryan Gosling sings ""You Always Hurt The Ones You Love"" 2. The rest...Excuse Me Michelle... Michelle Williams seems to always play the role of a grieving wife/widow/cancer patient(Dawson's Creek) so maybe that's why she has this role down to a tee. It's not an insult, it's a compliment....or just an observation. I don't think I've ever seen her in a happy comedy role so maybe a future project...no, nevermind.Best Lines: 1. Dean: ""In my experience, the prettier a girl is, the more nuts she is, which makes you insane."" Cindy: ""I like how you can compliment and insult somebody at the same time, in equal measure."" 2. Dean: ""I feel like men are more romantic than women. When we get married we marry, like, one girl, 'cause we're resistant the whole way until we meet one girl and we think I'd be an idiot if I didn't marry this girl she's so great. But it seems like girls get to a place where they just kinda pick the best option... 'Oh he's got a good job.' I mean they spend their whole life looking for Prince Charming and then they marry the guy who's got a good job and is gonna stick around.""Overall: A wonderful and heartbreaking love story with spot on acting, singing, cinematography, directing and writing. It's so powerful, it out-shines most films I've seen this year and it's definitely going down as one of my favorites.9.5 Stars.

184,torchwood949-166-552404,True Romance,9,13 December 2011,"When we fall in love we assume it will be forever and that's the case with our protagonists in Blue Valentine. The story follows the relationship between a withered married couple, cross cutting between the present and the past showing how their relationship built and the point of which it has now come too. At a glance it's easy to compare to the 2004 film 'The Notebook' which Gosling himself starred in but that's far from what this picture is. Blue Valentine approaches a difficult subject of how relationships between people can change and how the person we once fell in love with can be completely different deeper into the time they spend together.What makes Blue Valentine so impressive is it's harsh brutality to the subject and not sugar coating the situation just merely showing it for what it is. Gosling and Williams act their hearts out and bring across a credibility that at time borders into too realistic territory. It's a dark, gritty love story that almost anyone can find a element of to relate to which makes for a truly beautiful and heart breaking watch.",Blue Valentine
185,rama-28,Sweet And Emotionally Devastating,10,17 December 2010,"BLUE VALENTINE is both sweet and emotionally devastating. It's raw in every sense of the word. Writer/director Derek Cianfrance has crafted a brave and genuine relationship-character study. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams floor me. Acting doesn't get better than thisDramas about a couple whose relationship is warm and fuzzy at first but then grows cold and bitter over time is not something new. You don't have to go back to classic films in the 60s, you could just take last year's indie Peter and Vandy for example. So there have been many attempts to capture relationships on the big screen that's not fantastical but more grounded and more honest. I believe that BLUE VALENTINE has perfected it.What's genius about Cianfrance's story is that the dialogue doesn't hold any type of pretense to it. I attended the press screening and read the press notes afterward and was amazed by the long, grueling process that Cainfrance went through along with his stars Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams just to get the kind of characters they have in mind. Some of the scenes you see in BLUE VALENTINE were contributions of Gosling and Williams who had complete understanding of the characters and the goal of the story. The story shows you the past, how these two characters met, what made them fall for each other, romantic and heartfelt.. and then.. the present, of what time does to a relationship when communication is not clear anymore and misunderstandings take over like an ugly bacteria that worsen every situation, it just doesn't look hopeful from that point on.Last year we had the film Precious which was a pretty heavy, emotionally draining drama. This year is BLUE VALENTINE which serves similar kick but it's less cinematic and even more performance-driven. I can't even begin to fairly describe how astounding Gosling and Williams are in this film. Their performances here will be the kind that aspiring actors and theater students will learn from for years to come. They're spontaneous and unadulterated. I'm completely amazed by the way the play the fights and the arguments. As Dean and Cindy, Gosling and Williams respectively convince you that they once love each other and now they may or may not be able to stand each other's presence.Which leads me to the characters themselves, I don't think Cianfrance created them so that you the audience would take sides or try to decide which of them is right or wrong because I believe that these are two individuals who eventually realize that they're living not just with each other but also with regrets of the past, which make it very hard to be grateful,.. you can tell that they're 'suffocated'.One could argue that Cindy is right in that Dean seems too content, like he doesn't have ambition, he's short tempered and very demanding. And one could argue that Dean is right in that Cindy is too consumed by the thoughts of what could've, would've, should've been if the her choices had been different. Their relationship is not physically abusive but it might as well be, there are times when things get heated, you would think it's only a matter of time before somebody would get seriously hurt.It seems like somewhere along the way, Dean and Cindy just aren't in the same wavelength anymore. Their unhappiness stems from the fact that they no longer know how to make each other happy. Cianfrance wants to remind the audience that marriage is hard, it's a lot of work and it can get rocky, it's no laughing matter. If you're looking for a happy ending or perhaps Dean and Cindy have a moment where they'd still be friends, BLUE VALENTINE doesn't offer that, what it offers you is a depiction of both the beauty and the hardship of relationship/marriage. It speaks to those who may have grown up in a home where the parents aren't your stereotypical love dubby mom and dad you see on 7th Heaven-type soap operas. So if you don't come out appreciating BLUE VALENTINE, not even for the performances, then it's possible that it's because you're not the intended audience.",Blue Valentine
186,vinzarka,Good enough romance,8,30 January 2015,"It was a great movie which had included everything that life has inside and outside it. It was a great big mix of all human feelings giving messages time after time. No complains about casting, They all played so perfectly and everything looked natural. It make us a bit confused this stile of video editing, of video montage. It gives us other idea and they didn't look so different in these two periods of times...and barely could understand that it was a mixing of their life before with the life that they are living now. It is a movie with full of hope, love, feelings, sex and passions and nothing with dirty sex. It was pure natural sexual feelings that this couple were trying to ""survive"" in this bloody relationship.",Blue Valentine
187,seniorbayir,Some notes on marriages,6,20 September 2012,"This film states that even perfect lovers may become separated as time goes. Before the marriage, Dean and Cindy were perfect couples however after 5-6 years, when they spend a lot time in the same house, they feel the bitter differences in their life visions. And things get worse, worse and worse...I actually liked both Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling, in the sense of their roleplay. Michelle W(Cindy), successfully plays the ""cold"" wife, kinda reminding my ex-gf. It's the same attitudes.Also, I had difficulties while discriminating the young and old Dean. I thought it was a third guy at first. Flow is problematic in that sense.And finally, a good quote of Dean emerges in the movie: about girls, boys and their choices of marriage. I won't tell it here :) but it's a perfect one.",Blue Valentine

The story contrasts the happy moments of the past with the happenings of the present: the concerns of unwanted pregnancy and acceptance process (with the cruel alternative consideration of abortion as showing the harsh world where they move their executors), the monotonous life of a low-income couples guided by the example of her dysfunctional family and highlights the sex culture predominance over other values​​.Gosling's and William's performance is sensitive and credible and clearly conveys the feelings of anger and frustration and the monotonous life of a ""normal"" couple.",Blue Valentine
189,bala08,Revolutionary Road meets Notebook,7,28 May 2012,"This movie is well made and realistic. However during certain scenes I was reminded of two other movies, Revolutionary Road and the Notebook. The way they move back and forth in time in Blue Valentine was similar to the movie Notebook and the emotionally depressing scenes were bit similar to the movie Revolutionary Road. So it didn't feel too original to me but still this movie had few things going on its own. Anyone who has been in a troubled relationship with the opposite sex will know how realistic this movie is but mind you it will leave you depressed. Good to see some realistic movies keep coming along the way in the midst of stupid scripts.",Blue Valentine
190,CinemaFrostedBetty,An emotional roller-coaster,9,17 May 2011,"Get ready for 112 minutes of tears and sorrow! In Derek Cianfrance's Blue Valentine (2010), we peak into the lives of a dissatisfied, working-class, married couple, as key moments in their lives unfold through a scattered narrative. Right off the bat, we learn what we're getting ourselves into. We watch a tired, disconnected 30-something-year old (or perhaps late 20s) couple, and we cannot help but wonder, how did it get this way? This is where the film takes off. The audience works as a fly on the wall through the deconstruction of their relationship, taking note during the bittersweet scenes that we're not meant to be enjoying this as much as they are. We have the high-power of knowing they're doomed. There is no solution. Michelle Williams as Cindy and Ryan Gosling as Dean work as a tremendous on screen couple under these emotionally demanding roles. Unbelievably (or should I say believably) strong acting from the both of them. You feel like you already know them because you, most likely, do, in fact, know a couple just like them—our neighbors, our parents, anyone. It's such an honest portrayal of contemporary marriage—one that we all hope to defy, but heartbreakingly know is bound to happen. The cinematography is also greatly astounding with shots that accent their deteriorating relationship and truly allow you to suffocate with the broken characters. Blue Valentine will take you on quite the emotional roller-coaster in a disappointing world without hope.",Blue Valentine
191,jtprius510,A Painfully Effective Ironic Backlash,8,3 October 2011,"People keep writing articles about Ryan Gosling on Thought Catalog. In the last two weeks I've seen two. One is about Gosling's eligibility as today's bachelor while the other brings about a question of why everyone is so obsessed with him. The article discloses some fine points, with the exception of two very important details, movies, and they are Blue Valentine and Drive.As an actor Gosling produced Blue Valentine and hand picked the director for Drive. With Drive Gosling really snuck one under the radar with his choice of director Nicolas Winding Refn, while Blue Valentine received minimal recognition at the academy awards last year for how much it depressed everyone.It affected audiences in ways that they didn't want to be so nobody knew what to say about it besides Michelle Williams. Besides Williams' performance nobody said it was bad but nobody could say it was good. Nobody could say that they liked Blue Valentine. In a nutshell, Dereck Cianfrance's Blue Valentine is a brutally honest story about that point in a relationship where love no longer matters.The reason why I think this movie gets such mixed reviews is because probably half the critics that saw it last year were going through something similar. I know I was and like them throughout Blue Valentine I myself tried to deny it. You can say the protagonist in Blue Valentine is a dying relationship.In the first scene we have the daughter making an entrance through the dog's door to tell her sleeping father that their dog is missing. With a receding hairline over a pair of sunglasses on that might be prescription, Gosling picks up his daughter to have a look around outside with a cigarette ready for lighting hanging off of his lips. After waking up Williams she prepares breakfast for them, when gosling makes a comment on how long she let the oats soak in milk, then sprinkles some raisins on the table for them to eat off of like leopards before Williams says that the last thing she wants to do is clean up after two children. Everyone, from Williams, to her parents, to the audience sees what's happening; everybody except for gosling.Detail by detail Blue Valentine is about getting to that point of the inevitable and there is something surrealistically sad and ironic in that which earns Blue Valentine its' cult following. Most people involved in something like that do not see or ignore the inevitable. Worse case scenario would be only one out of those two going through the motions ability to acknowledge it and that is exactly what's taking place in CianFrance's Blue Valentine.There are no heroes in Blue Valentine, only villains and victims. The roles switch throughout Blue Valentine between Williams and Gosling. Things from each of their pasts are finally catching up to them. Things that each of them should've realized ever since they had met. Two words to describe this movie are sad and true because it chronicles a metamorphosis of those sweet things we remember about each other first before they become sour.Sadly one of the first things Gosling ever said about her in a flashback to his co worker is that she makes him feel like he knows her. What is so true about Gosling's first statement on Williams' character is how universal that is to any man that has ever tried to talk to a girl he didn't know.In so many more ways than what I have mentioned Blue valentine is everyone's story. If we haven't been through this we've seen it. And while this could bring back painful memories of the last thing you did before it all finally ended, having gone through it makes appreciating Blue Valentine so much easier. Aristotle once said that tragedies are the best kinds of drama because we learn the most from them.Cinematically Blue Valentine is a painfully effective ironic backlash on everything we have ever romanticized about love.",Blue Valentine

Like some sort of bad 'reality TV' show, who wants to sit through 2 hours of fighting & sex. After 30mins I was looking at my watch and decided if this film wasn't going somewhere then I would! Too many hand held camera shots were annoying and it makes for difficult viewing. And why is some people think that getting drunk is the only way to have a good time....or that's what this film suggests was going to 'fix' their problem.However good the 'acting' might have been it was all just a pain to watch.Forget this one..save your money and your time!",Blue Valentine
193,mikechinea,Excellent performances. Brilliant direction,10,14 December 2010,"Just about when I was giving up because of formulas, remakes and sequels comes Derek Cianfrance with this masterpiece. So refreshing to see a filmmaker throw out the cliché filled formulas and convention and get down to the real Indie spirit and make it work. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams moving performances took you on their characters life's journey without holding back any punches, a true slice of life, warts and all. You felt the love, anguish, pain, depression, desperation and joy as Cindy and Dean struggle with a relationship nearing the end. I felt I knew these characters and I felt for them. Ryan was magnificent in his portrayal of Dean, somewhat a loser with a heart of gold. Michelle made you fall love in love with Cindy's charm. Derek's brilliantly let you make your own discoveries without having to hit you over the head with flashes of the blinding obvious. I will buy it and keep it in my collection of classics.",Blue Valentine
194,Siren555,Poignancy Above Sadness,9,4 June 2013,"I resisted watching Blue Valentine at first because I was leery of being weighed down by an oppressive drama. But I am here to tell you that there is a poignancy to this film that rises above sadness, making it well worth watching. Blue Valentine is a marvelous, incredibly well-acted, and authentic film. Unlike many dying-relationship dramas, it never drags. From beginning to end, it is well-paced and captivating, due in large part to the incredible acting of Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. With them, you are never merely watching two people act; you are being allowed into the intimate lives of two people who happen to be inhabited by two of Hollywood's most gifted actors. For her performance as Cindy, Michelle Williams received an Oscar nomination (Natalie Portman ended up winning the award that year for another movie with a color in the title). While Williams' performance was indeed award-worthy, it was Ryan Gosling's portrayal of vulnerable, loving,complicated Dean that really deserved an Oscar nod.

196,chwalker-christopher,puzzled and disappointed,4,6 February 2011,"I didn't understand the picture, I guess, and I didn't understand a lot of the responses to it here. I found the movie sad and the female protagonist almost inexplicable. Many describe a film about a couple who were in love and fall out of love. That isn't what I saw. I saw a picture about an appealing, likable working-class man who has the misfortune to love and marry a person who doesn't love him even at the beginning of their story, let alone at the end. I can't figure out what she doesn't like about him. He's affectionate, good-looking, a devoted parent, and gainfully employed. I feel sorry for the couple's child at the end of the picture. Her dog is dead and the parent who is actually fond of the child is forced to leave.One of the characters muses that men marry only if they meet someone that they can't live without, while women merely wait for an acceptable offer. It's a depressing opinion and I hope it isn't true, but since it's offered as part of the screenplay maybe we're supposed to factor it in as part of the explanation for the wife's behavior.Less importantly, the character of the wife's father seems to undergo a change that is not explained. He's an intolerable bully in the flashback scenes but seems passive when we see him again.Some of the hand-held camera work is annoying.",Blue Valentine
197,ivan-caldarevic,Touching...,8,10 July 2011,"Could have one spoiler!Fantastic movie. Haven't seen such a good acting for some time now, Gosling really is a star, and Michelle Williams was fabulous also!I wouldn't say that this is a story just about love and relationship, but about humans, their nature and perspectives they have on life in general, love is only being used as a medium to show them in a best possible way. Specter of human emotions is shown in best possible manner in Blue Valentine.This is a story of two young people that meet in their early age, each of them with their personal problems and situations. One of them fell in love with the second, love on the first sight, while the other stayed at distance. At the end they ended up together and got married. One of them changed its perspective and life path, and the other went into the relationship as a result of problems that were present in the life at the moment. That decision was one of the causes of all the problems in their future life, while other was a bit manipulative personality of the character impersonated by Gosling. On the other hand Gosling's character is a perfect husband and dad to their kid. The story jumps to the past every now and then, showing pieces of the story that matter at the moment, or just to help getting on dramaturgy of the situation. Whole movie and story behind it are really realistic, a situation that is happening to the couples on daily bases. It shows how humans are imperfect creatures, but all that ""flaws"" give them the right and the beauty to be humans, and live their life.This is a great movie that I would strongly recommend!",Blue Valentine
198,jamie-carrick,One of the most complex and authentic portrayals of love I've ever seen,9,14 September 2016,"What a movie. This film is one of the few to make me think about things on a deeper level that hasn't been filled to the brim with metaphors and big life quotes. It's as simplistic as it is real. The screenplay was incredible, not really needing much to make it shine on screen. The actors took care of that. I knew from 20 minutes in that the highlight of this film would be the lead performances. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams were wonderful. Their respective portrayals of Dean and Cindy were honestly so powerful, so real and true that there was not a single moment in which I thought they were acting. Having seen them both in other things, it shocked me that I forgot they were only pretending to be Dean and Cindy. Gosling proved that he's not just a juvenile rom com actor with this performance. He can take naturalistic, serious material and make it his own. Williams was in a class of her own in this movie. Her Oscar-nominated turn as Cindy Heller proved her as one of the best. If not for the strong Best Actress category that year which resulted in Natalie Portman deservedly winning the statuette, it would have gone to Williams without a doubt. Her performance was quiet, subtle and nuanced yet captured the entire screen every time she appeared. Her range and depth of emotions and physicality is awe-inspiring and she is long overdue the accolades she so well deserves.",Blue Valentine
199,mintonmedia,Ple-e-e-ease. (Rolls eyes) Note: now including AN UPDATE.,2,19 January 2011,"I thrive on difficult, complicated, emotionally raw films. I yearn for heartbreak and I love ambiguous endings...when they are earned. I even like films about people I don't like...when they stimulate my interest or emotion through a level of reality (or, for that matter, unreality) that communicates something--anything--genuine.I hated this film, because it felt rooted in another planet: indie-world, where cute hipsters revel and couple in movie-ish ""joy"" and fight and come apart in faux ""anguish"". I felt no discomfort except boredom in watching ""Blue Valentine"" because the actors, who've swept me up entirely into other so-called ""difficult"" films (Williams in ""Wendy and Lucy"", Gosling in ""The Believer"", for example), were utterly unempathizable (if intensely ""acted"") caricatures in this one. He was shorthand for an initially likable, none-too-bright slacker who turns out to wear poorly, she was destined from word one to be a brittle smart-aleck who finds it easy to fault others but recognizes none of her own, increasingly nasty flaws. The child is sweet (and a talented little actor) but is, sadly, just a plot device, not the emotional story center she could have been.The structure had promise, but the direction and script (or improvisation) were sloppy, the work of people who base their visions of reality on other films, not life. Muffed details like the clichéd ""meet cute"" or Cindy's dad's careless morphing from awful father to sensitive grandfather or the incredibly wooden level of dialog and acting in the doctor's office fight could have been overlooked if I simply cared about the people at the core of the story.But the pair were as fake as the ""robot's vagina"" of a sex-mecca offered up to show us how low their relationship had sunk. And, frankly, my dear, I couldn't have given less of a damn. Sorry to be a bring-down, folks, but this film, like Hans Christian Anderson's emperor, has no clothes.UPDATE, added almost 4 years later, having, in the meantime, seen and loved Cianfrance and Gosling's next collaboration, THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES: Guess I may have to view BLUE VALENTINE again...because I can't believe how well the synthesis between director and star works in their second film together. Hell, when the intricate Mr. Cianfrance showed up for Q&A after the PINES screening, the first thing everyone must have noticed is how much he physically looks what has to be his on screen avatar in the last two films he's helmed.

It meant that scenes did not flow and in a number of cases, added little to the story and felt just... wrong.After the film, I read about the making and I admire film makers that take risks and the way that this was made was certainly a risk. Risks however sometimes do not work out and this was such a time.The movie drags and you feel little sympathy for the two main characters. If the original script had been followed and editing improved, this may have been a good film. In the end, it felt like a homemade project made by students.",Blue Valentine
201,ShazzMatazz,"No Character Study but plenty of Sex, but for what?...",1,14 December 2010,"This movie was so disappointing!I expected so much more from these two actors. There's one scene that is supposed to be sweet where Michelle Williams starts dancing to a Ukulele song played and sung by Ryan Gosling that's not even cute because we never got to know these characters. The story jumps back in forth through time. Just keeping track is exhausting. You never know when it starts or begins. Sex scenes that are there but why? I'm never convinced that anyone ever loved anyone in this entire movie. The only actor that got a rise out of me was the boyfriend from college who plays a wrestler. He was a bit of a smacked-ass and played this role beautifully. I know this movie already got nominated; so my question is, Who blew who?",Blue Valentine
202,shoutingagain,"intelligent, raw, difficult material.",9,20 January 2011,"Such a stark, honest and visceral depiction of one marriage is a bit hard to ingest but certainly kept me thinking for hours afterward. Always a good thing. I have to start by writing the overall high user-score was contrary to the very user reviews I read here, so that's perplexing. But I get it-- I've ruminated over this film overnight & I think I understand and agree. I also was uncomfortable, unsettled and dismayed with the tone, message and focus because like most persons perhaps, I prefer to focus on a positive message, believe in the power & ultimate triumph of love and seek out happy endings. For one thing, it's far more welcome than to fear such outcome for oneself or those we love. But, you know, look around at our divorce rate and you can't help but see reality differs. It's FAR more like what was displayed here with such precision and clarity. I much appreciated how the characters were fleshed out and no one depicted exactly as the villain or an angel as that rarely is the case & mimics real life, though from my position, for the record, I landed squarely on the husband-protagonist's side. He was never once asked or encouraged to quit drinking or find his life's passion....not in a proper context of a loving spouse. This can be the difference between night and day (how it's approached). Honestly, I deeply felt his substantial heartbreaking level of pain so kudos to the writers and actors! The thought this movie most prompted in my head was how NO ONE really can predict how one will respond in times of unhappiness, dismay, strife or discordance. We think we can; we cannot. It's simply NOT something one commonly engages in contemplation, let alone conversation, when walking around interacting happily in love and looking forward. Those conversations rarely or never happen. If anything, people will convincingly project (not necessarily lying) they will bravely,loyally persevere and battle for their loved ones, no matter what, and love will win out. Sounds good. But you know, No one really knows (or can predict themselves) until they are tested WHEN or IF they will quit. You can think you know your mate (or yourself) but the reality is, you don't know what, when or HOW someone will respond to (what they define to be) serious challenges until that happens. You only can take on faith what a person tells (or shows) you they are--- but life & time will prove what that really is. I truly believe now (as a woman nearly 50) If it turns out in your favor, it's more often than not, simply mere LUCK, not special keen insight, perception and intelligence having acted out on your end. That's what I came away with. Yes, I knew this but still, riveting, unique, honest with stellar performances of two deeply flawed and struggling persons (she more flawed than he. She didn't ring as genuine, invested, sincere or even mildly compassionate) Yes, of course relationships must change and evolve as the participants do so certainly there's increased risk when uniting young (when having obtained less wisdom that can only come from age & life relationships) but fortunately for the viewers, in my humble assessment, this material went deeper than that. It brought to surface again this deeper fear I have within me...again, the truth & knowledge aren't necessarily absolutes....that we only know persons as well as they LET us, that they create their stories & how we know what they CHOOSE to allow us to know about them! Sadly, whether we want to believe that or not, it's how life works. Lastly, I concluded that people all bring not only their idiosyncrasies and flaws to the union but their coping (or lack of coping) manners & varying levels of commitment & expectations too.",Blue Valentine
203,WalterSoprano,Possibly the most genuine and realistic film about love that you can find,10,14 August 2016,"The summary isn't a lie, rarely do I find a movie that so much as touches on genuine portrayal of romance as this film does. A lot of people say this film is depressing, well they aren't exactly wrong but a lot of those people that say that seem to confuse that word with realistic. Hands down bar none this is the most genuine realistic romance film I've seen. It pulls no punches or sugar coats anything.If you are a person who has truly felt love then this film will hit hard, within the span of minutes this film successfully and effectively portrays the peak and high point of what every couple wants and the moment that could be described as every couples nightmare. As a man whose parents divorced and endured heart wrenching failed relationships I can strongly say this film captures the dissolution of a once great relationship better than any other film I've seen (and I've seen a lot).Is it depressing? I would describe it more as realistic because although it is sad at times it never feels as fiction or even the slightest bit contrived it feels extremely natural. The construction of this film and the execution feel incredibly realistic and genuine thanks to the excellent acting and of course the director and writer Derek Cianfrance. If you dig into the back story or behind the scenes of the film you'll quickly find how dedicated the people behind the movie were which led to the film being incredibly authentic.I don't want to give anything away but in conclusion if you want a fairy tale happy ever after this isn't where you should look, regardless if you are a person who understands and has experienced the true feeling of love you definitely without hesitation TRULY need to see this movie, the feelings that will resonate can't be conjured from any other movie that comes to mind. I don't want to get too much into detail to avoid spoilers but if you know the true feeling of love watch it, if you don't understand love you would only waste your time watching this (sad but true). If you understand what I'm saying you know what to do. Thanks for reading this review and I genuinely hope you can experience the film the way I did.",Blue Valentine
204,arseniy,Certainly Not Your Typical Breakup Tearjerker,9,28 January 2011,"Let me put it this way. Before seeing it for myself, my sense (from the previews and interviews and whatnot) was that this could very well be a shameless, pointless tearjerker in disguise. And now, after seeing it, I'm relieved to say that this is not at all what I found to be the case. Does this film contrast the interactions that take place between two people when the chemicals inside their bodies induce closeness, with those that take place between these same two people when those chemicals wear off and new ones take their place? In short: is this about relationship problems? Yes, it certainly is. But instead of doing what's easy and jerking us around by our tear ducts - this film instead, sets its sights on what is most difficult. It does all it can to see these things for what they really are. And it does this brilliantly. Perhaps so, while being a tad kinder to the male ingredient of this this equation than its female counterpart (which is a bit suspicious given the creator's own gender), but brilliantly nevertheless.",Blue Valentine

Underplayed, natural acting by both Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling ought to have got at least one of them (Michelle?) an Oscar. Alas, the Academy committee had other plans. Or maybe I should be handing out the kudos to the director Derek Cianfrance. After all he directed the movie, probably had a say in the actor selection and more. All in all, its a very well directed, very well acted 'love or thereabouts' movie. You'll leave with mixed emotions - the posters are a fair bit misleading - and the ending was a wee bit abrupt - but you'll have to agree that its well made and rings true. What didn't go down so well was noticing that Michelle Williams was a co producer...don't know why, just somehow made her into a more commercial entity than that hurtin' wisp of a woman we just sympathised with a minute back...(before the credits started rolling, I mean)",Blue Valentine
206,dramses79,Mixed feelings about this movie,7,27 April 2011,"After watching this movie, I was left with very mixed feelings about it. I mean, the movie is good, it has some great acting by the leading actors, and all...but, something about it bugs me! I recommend people to watch this movie, and draw their own conclusions about it...still, I can't make out what to think, or feel, about it.The movie is about a couple who is currently not happy with one another. It tells the story of their past, some of their present, and also their end as a couple. The problem is...I don't really see the point for the way the movie ends. I mean, I don't understand, clearly, where it wants to lead the viewer, even if I have lots of ideas about it.Dean is a guy who's been in love with Cindy since the first time he laid eyes on her, and he's still in love with her 'til the very end. Apparently, the problem is in Cindy...she seems to be more screwed up than anyone else in the movie. She tries to be a nice wife and all, but it seems that the things she's been through in life have made her cold to love itself.She's revealed, in the abortion clinic, that she had had around 20 to 25 sex partners in her life, since she was 13; her last boyfriend, before Dean, was a crazy, violent guy, who may be the father of her child; Dean quickly offers to make a family with her when she finds out she's pregnant, so maybe she never really loved Dean; and, so on...What I see is...the movie may be about things that happen in life, just that. I don't feel it as a movie about how a relationship can go wrong throughout time, but I see it as a movie about how love can go wrong...Dean loves Cindy very much. One of the reasons he has a job as a simple painter is also to be able to spend as much time with his family as possible (besides being able to drink his beer whenever he wants). Cindy, on the other hand, doesn't seem to love Dean all that much, maybe she never really did; at some point in time, she's asking her grandma what it is like to recognize true love...she doesn't seem to believe much in it, specially by coming from such a dysfunctional family (agressive father, who didn't love his wife).So, that's I understand from the movie...love depends on both people in the relationship to work out; if just one person really loves the other, the relationship won't survive...something Dean says at some point in the movie really shows that (and it's not as sexist as it may seem): ""Guys are more romantic than girls; when a guys chooses a woman, he thinks, 'I'd be an ass if I didn't keep her'; but, women, they only choose, they choose the guy with the best job...""",Blue Valentine

It is the story of a couple Dean Pereira (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy Heller (Michelle Williams) going through a separation while also giving us an account of their past. Gosling and Williams are absolutely brilliant throughout the movie potraying emotions beautifully throughout their journey together and also while they end their marriage vows.

It's a simple story of a complex relationship, beautifully written, intimately directed and extraordinarily well performed.Williams and Gosling each has a resume that suggests neither is in it for the money.

214,mrtomclift,A bleak and heart wrenching yet utterly captivating break-up film,8,13 January 2011,"You always hurt the ones you love. So go the lyrics to the song that Dean (Ryan Gosling) serenades Cindy (Michelle Williams) with on their very first date in Derek Cianfrance's emotionally devastating romantic drama Blue Valentine. Several years later, the two are married and have a young daughter together, but it is painfully clear that their relationship is coming to its end. Using the same narrative device as last year's indie romantic darling (500) Days of Summer, Blue Valentine cuts back and forth between the beginning and the end it's protagonists ill-fated union, showing us how it all started and where exactly it might have gone wrong. What results is a bleak and heart wrenching yet utterly captivating story featuring two of the most impressive performances of the year.By the time Blue Valentine begins, the relationship between Dean and Cindy is on the verge of collapse; they argue over the pettiest of problems, blame each other for things beyond their control, and despite the love they both clearly feel for their daughter Frankie, any feelings they might have had for each other have long since evaporated. In one desperate, last-ditched effort to try and reconcile their relationship, Dean books the two of them a night in an erotically themed motel where they attempt to rekindle their passion. At the same time, flashbacks introduced us to younger, more optimistic versions of the couple, as under less than ideal circumstances, they meet and begin to fall in love.The performances from Williams and Gosling are astounding. Raw, believable and filled with anguish, both actors deserve Oscar nominations for their work in a film that has them bearing the entirety of their souls. Cianfrance's screenplay is spectacular, although one suspects that the films dialogue was largely improvised. These characters do not feel scripted; from the flustered, inarticulate ways that they argue to the frank and sometimes painfully un-erotic fashion in which they make love, Cindy and Dean both seem brutally, unflatteringly like real people, and the inevitable tragedy that befalls them is all the more upsetting because of this. Perhaps most impressive is that neither Dean nor Cindy begin the film as particularly likable, but the phenomenal work from the two leads ensures that by the stories end, we want nothing more than for things to work out all right.Cianfrance employs a minimalistic directorial style in order to match the simple, real world story that he is trying to tell. Using predominately hand-held cameras, the writer-director highlights the unremarkable nature of his characters; their vulnerabilities, hopes and frustrations. The way the film cuts from one timeline to another is extremely subtle, so much so that at first you may not realize it at all. Flashbacks are not accompanied by sound effects or flashy cuts, but by uncomplicated edits and the skillful juxtaposition of images, a technique that, especially towards the end of the film, results in some incredibly moving moments. Blue Valentine uses flashbacks as neither a gimmick nor a storytelling trick, but as a way to lend additional feeling to the most everyday of objects, and an additional tragedy to a relationship that at one time seemed capable of overcoming anything.It does not seem like a spoiler to reveal that the ending of Blue Valentine is not a happy one. To anyone who watches more than five minutes of this film, it is all too apparent that the conclusion is inevitable, and that all efforts to change things are in vain. (500) Days of Summer brought a bittersweet poignancy to a tale of breaking up; by comparison, the story of Dean and Cindy is merely bitter. But while the movies outlook on love and marriage is a sad one, its astonishingly real aesthetic, intensely human performances and heart-breaking emotional effect is simply undeniable.",Blue Valentine
215,ecstatic-tickle,Not a date movie.,7,4 January 2011,"Derek Cianfrance's sophomoric feature explores the complex and often painful relationship between Dean and Cindy (Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams) - a young couple in Brooklyn who meet, fall in love, get married, and then five years later fall apart.It begins with their daughter, shouting for the missing family dog, something that seems to symbolize the loss of everything familiar and good about their relationship. We meet these characters at a point where things are beginning to crumble - Cindy works as a nurse, and seems to be the only adult in the house, as she is unable to the break through the play-acting daddy-daughter dynamic that Dean has created, that is when he isn't off painting houses or getting drunk. Her sense of disillusionment and obligation is palpable.Intimately shot with a gritty blue color palette and conspicuous focus pulls, this film is definitely from the same ilk as the leading duo's other indie flicks Half-Nelson and Wendy and Lucy. The film has a rather loose narrative, switching between the breakdown of the marriage and the first few weeks of their relationship, which is an effective storytelling decision. The shifts are easy to keep track of thanks to Gosling's receding hairline and Williams putting on a few pounds - and the pair have super chemistry that makes the sense of time feel authentic.After the dog is found dead, Dean suggests getting out of the house, getting drunk and making love. And so they check into the ""Future room"" of a sleazy themed sex motel, and a good portion of the film takes place in this strange neon-soaked location. The two of them get busy in the bedroom more often than perhaps is necessary to show - but while these depictions of sex do have a degree of realism you won't find in most mainstream movies, there was nothing here to warrant the MPAA's initial kiss-of-death NC-17 rating.After a rather muddled first act, the film does pick up - especially when it explores the couple's first encounter. Dean gets a job at a moving company and sees Cindy across the hall in an old folks home where she's visiting her grandmother and he is moving a war veteran's belongings. The connection is instant and a tentative romance is formed. However, back in the present day the sense of disconnect between becomes more pronounced, and awkward confrontations soon arise. There is a visceral quality to these scenes, so well-acted and shot as to take on a voyeuristic dimension. But as the relationship disintegrates and the arguments become more intense, one wonders what the value of witnessing these painful exchanges really is.Ryan Gosling performance is kind of a conundrum. I've never been that impressed with his acting but the merit of his work in this film is harder to judge due to the character itself being so grating. Dean is an extremely insecure man who makes a habit of being stubborn and obtuse, and his childish antics do become rather head-wrecking to watch after a while.He nails the character's defensive and destructive nature, but it's not a performance you can warm to - there are a few flickers of charm in the early stages of his relationship with Cindy, however his irritating somewhat creeping nature does make you wonder why she would fall for him in the first place. Gosling's mannerisms here are identical to most other characters I've seen him play, ruminating with his hectic masculine energy, there's more than a hint of self-consciousness about it.On the other hand Michelle Williams is flat-out excellent as Cindy. Her gift for conveying raw emotions on screen is put to good use as she reveals the character's scars, her sense of sadness and ultimately suffocation. Late in the film there is a pivotal scene in which her character makes a decision that will change course of her life, and the fear and release of that moment is truly affecting - her best performance yet.For the most part, Blue Valentine is quite an unpleasant film, fixated with the misery of a relationship - with only a few fleeting moments of beauty or romance. As the conflict between them reaches fever pitch there are a series of climactic scenes that will command your attention - but a little more of what they're fighting for might have made the experience a richer one. Still, what the film says about who we choose to love, and how we treat them when we do is powerful.",Blue Valentine

If you have never bitten your nails, now is the time to start. This is what happens when humans are unwittingly cruel. This is the human condition. The question then becomes can two people incorporate too much subtlety into a relationship, can they over-interpret and fail to give the benefit of the doubt? Can two aesthetically functional people who had at one time fallen in love because they knew creative beauty as their mother, understand that love must withstand the onslaught of time and observation? Is it that people grow and change in uncharted ways? Or is it that familiarity equates to seeing too much of what we are, as lost entities in a Universe so huge and so impersonal, that the beholding of it kills what we know as children?

Not only that, it's real. There's none of those corny lines that nobody in real life would ever say. It's just two people falling in and out of live with each other. The music is sweet and sad which matches the understated cinematography perfectly. After watching this a second time the thing that stands out the most is the colours in this film, and how they work so well to portray different feelings, emotions, time frames etc. To anybody who didn't like this movie, I'd say that you were obviously expecting a Romantic Comedy, a movie where everything turns out well in the end and everyone is happily in love. This film is not exactly the complete opposite of that, it's just more honest. If I had to pick one word to describe Blue Valentine it would be resonating. It stays with you long after you've watched it.",Blue Valentine
218,electrablind,Blue Valentine Will Break Your Heart,9,18 January 2011,"thefilmsmith.com Romance in cinema is usually confined to two distinct categories: Either two people learn to love each other (consummated by a kiss or marriage) or they learn to leave each other for someone else. Other than the uneasy ending to The Graduate, there are few films willing to follow a couple beyond their climactic decision to get together/leave. Blue Valentine plays with each romantic format, but its uncomfortable window into a marriage imploding will make you want to call the cops for the couple's mutual safety.Cicadas rattle in the Pennsylvania morning as young Frankie tries to find her escaped dog. She goes inside and pounces on her dozing father Dean, an unkempt man capped with a receding hairline and a smoking habit. He wakes up and tries to find the dog before sitting down to have a breakfast prepared by mommy Cindy. When Frankie turns her nose at the hard oatmeal, Dean echoes the critiques of Cindy, and encourages his daughter to at least eat the raisins straight from the table. ""Let's eat like leopards,"" he suggests as the two slurp up the dried fruit, much to Cindy's chagrin. Frankie calls out to Dean as Cindy scoops her up, ""Daddy you got me in trouble!"" From this small scene we understand we are bearing witness to a couple at odds, and it only gets worse as the film goes along: from Dean (Ryan Gosling) telling his wife, ""I told you to keep the f*cking gate shut,"" after the dog's escape, to Cindy's (Michelle Williams) frequent denials of affection. They're slinging arrows at each other and they couldn't care less where they land.All of which is intercut with how the couple first met, juxtaposing the love that has since slipped away. Director Derek Cianfrance brilliantly blends these realities with clever match cuts, showcasing how the pair unknowingly falls in love just as easily as they can fall out of it. Cianfrance's obsessive adherence to close-ups during the Present sequences stylistically underscores the stifling nature of the relationship compared to the wider, more open air of shots in the lovely Past.* Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are at their most vulnerable, appearing emotionally and physically naked in the performance of their lives. Cindy's face is the foggy window into her soul and whether falling for Dean in the past or loathing him in the present, Williams' delicate gestures scream what's lurking beneath her mask. Gosling too is especially powerful as he alternates between bastard and charmer, yet the love for his family (especially Frankie)undoubtable. The result is one of the most genuinely heart wrenching films in the last ten years.It's difficult for filmmakers to tap into the sincere dysfunction of parents on the rocks without poeticizing the debacle; though there are poetic elements to the shots and visual look provided by cinematographer Andrij Parekh, at the forefront of the film is the storm of the century for this couple. Cindy passively acquiescing to Dean's sexual advances is one of the saddest moments in cinema history (and becomes all the more nuanced when Dean stops, realizing what she's doing) and when Dean fights to hold on to his family you'll be hard pressed not to be crying along with him.Despite my praise, the film is not perfect. It is billed as a relationship on the wane, but due to issues of perspective it seems more a film about Dean falling in love with a girl and then realizing she's done with him. What's left is an uncomfortable gender politics in which Cindy is left holding the bag for the crumbling relationship (essay to come).Blue Valentine might better known for its scandal involving the MPAA's initial rating (NC-17)**, but there's so much more to the film and it's not pretty. Much like anything by Darren Aronofsky, however, the pain is worth bearing for the overwhelming intensity of its truth.-Remington Smith *Past sequences were also shot on film (bringing warmer, romantic textures) in single takes (no do-overs), while the Present was shot in sterile digital and with up to 50 takes to bring out the combative frustration from the two.**There's nothing to merit such a rating, which is why the film won an appeal for its current R rating.",Blue Valentine

I'm not including any spoilers in this review either, I'm hoping to give an honest review of the film, rather than giving an opinionated one. The fizzled relationship between these two people is something that I think a lot of people would be able to relate to. The trouble with the characters here is they got pregnant and married while still in that warm-and-fuzzy stage of their relationship, believing that the love would stay that way. It is clear that even though Gosling's character is the drunk who doesn't work but dotes on his daughter and wife is actually the one who wants the family to be held together and William's character is the one whose soul is not in the marriage. I really believe that there are also so many visual metaphors within the film that are brilliantly mirrored in the relationship of this couple and their marriage woes, you just have to look out for them (I can't list many without spoiling). I give it a 7 because the script definitely wasn't the strongest point, but Gosling and Williams are brilliant. And any film that we see Gosling in a love-related role makes us imagine being with him (dream) :) Don't write this one off, and Grizzly Bear do a fab job on the soundtrack.",Blue Valentine
222,alli_m97,original and heartbreaking,10,15 March 2021,"Few love stories in recent cinema felt as real and authentic. Both Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams give terrific performances, and the storytelling is flawless, not a single false note. A great indie, highly recommended.",Blue Valentine
223,aaronlmadden,One of the most realistic films I have ever seen,9,23 May 2012,"This is not a love story. It is an incredibly authentic depiction of two people falling out of love. The only reason the film hasn't received a better rating, in my opinion, is that this film is too realistic. It is not an enjoyable film in any aspect. There are hints of humor used throughout the film, but it does little to lighten the mood. This film is very well made. Almost shot like a documentary. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are superb. Ryan Gosling is explosive as the husband who wants so desperately for the marriage to work. Yet he reinforces their deteriorating relationship with his carefree and eccentric behavior. Michelle Williams carries an uncanny sense of vulnerability as the wife who knows the marriage is over, and is beyond saving. Together, they are magnificent. There's a real chemistry between them that actually makes it harder for viewers to witness their fading relationship. They are definitely the force behind this film, and have proved themselves among the greatest actors of our time.If you like romance, I personally don't think this film is for you. But if you like well made, well acted, emotionally powerful films, then I definitely suggest Blue Valentine. For me, the haunting realism and very credible performances earn this film a 9/10.",Blue Valentine
224,allovernorth,Excellent,9,16 February 2021,"A movie about two broken people. It's very normal in Hollywood to have a negative view of the husband and father, I would expected to see that. However, though it hides a bit under the surface--she was very broken, and couldn't even recognize it.

225,xavierPoulain,Deep,8,18 September 2014,"I can understand Michelle Williams not getting enough recognition for her performances in film, as they are captivating, soulful, insightful, and daring, but in this independent darling, it's Ryan Gosling's most potent performance. The two weave a story of love fading with the memory of love beginning. The film captures a human truth that we fall in love with each other as slowly as we fall out of it. I just wish I saw more of Michelle Williams' character more. It felt more like Ryan Gosling's film than hers. Need I say, the Oscar nomination should have went to Gosling, but Williams was a previous nominee, and she is responding to him well on her own, but that's her only job in this film.",Blue Valentine
226,strus2001,good loving gone bad,9,31 May 2011,"This movie was often difficult to watch. Difficult because it seemed to be so real. A close, intimate look at the private moments of a dysfunctional married couple who are hurting all the time. Cindy is a cute, promiscuous, blonde young woman with a hankering for bad boys. She has no trouble finding what she likes. The tension of the story revolves around her inability to put her previous relationship with Bobby (very bad, jealous, violent) behind her while married to Dean (drifter, alcoholic, jealous, violent). Cindy has a sweet face, but never smiles until a chance encounter with Bobby in a grocery store early on in the movie. She mentions this to Dean in the car, and immediately regrets it. His venomous response is one of the scenes that makes this film seem so real. An issue never addressed is that when in a car together, Cindy drives. I can only assume Dean has lost his license due to drunk driving. This is unspoken but you can't help but notice. Cindy is the central character of the movie. Intelligent enough to succeed in nursing school, but not smart with men. Her father is hot tempered, domineering, and hooked to o2 to treat his COPD. She has the face and body that men will fight for in real life and in the movies. She works for an obstetrician, who clearly likes her and may be scheming to get this honey into his bed. She clearly likes the attention. So now this is thrown into the hormonal stew - and will be dealt with. I highly recommend this movie - if you prefer reality to escapism, and have had difficulties in the romance department, it will really hit home.",Blue Valentine
227,mc_thou,This Movie Missed A Wonderful Opportunity,4,28 May 2011,"Blue Valentine misses the opportunity to explore why a marriage that starts out wonderfully ends up broken. There is no reason given throughout the story of this couple as to why things started to dissolve - nor any attempt to do so. It seems that out of the blue the wife decides she doesn't want to be married anymore - but no reason why. And out of the blue arguments escalate into physical or sexual violence - scenes that don't seem to fit where the marriage is at and seem so out of place. That the movie doesn't explore why the marriage dissolved left me very frustrated. The only redeeming feature of this movie is the stellar job Ryan Gosling does in portraying a husband still in love with his wife and desperate to save his marriage. There are many better movies out there that explore the breakdown of marriage, like, The Story of Us, a little recognized but powerful movie of the same subject.",Blue Valentine
228,pricedominic,Real Love?,8,26 January 2012,"Stories about love don't usually appeal to me. Woman tries to get dream guy, gets helped along the way by another guy, she ends up falling for him blah blah blah... or man plays about, doesn't respect women, has a woman who is a friend, realises the error of his ways and falls for her blah blah blah. At the end there is always a fall out between the two, and then one goes chasing after the other, and it all ends brilliantly. So when my friend at work lent me this DVD, i was pessimistic. This film is unlike the Hollywood romance stories i have described to you in everyway. It shows exactly what love can be. It can be harsh, it can be brutal, it can feel like your heart has been punched several times over. This film portrays that perfectly, flitting from the happier moments at the start of the two main characters relationship, to the dark side of love where one or both of you know it isn't going to have a happy ending.Michelle Williams plays her part brilliantly, but i was really surprised by the excellent performance of Ryan Gosling. Having not seen him in many films previously, it was a nice surprise to see the talent he has as an actor, as the character he portrays in the film completely changes from start to end. If you are looking for a film with hearts and fluffy teddy bears, go watch Valentine's Day. If you want to see a great story played out by two very talented actors, then watch this film. You will not regret it.",Blue Valentine
229,andrewhanes,Read below for review,9,9 August 2020,"So I had seen this on a top 10 list of 2nd time unwatchable films. While I understand that you can have that opinion, I don't necessarily agree.That being said the movie is damn-near heart-breaking and pretty emotional, but personally there are other ways to make people think/feel with visual aid (two movies I won't name off-hand come to mind).
What made me watch it a second (and even third) time is the sort-of improv performances of the actors in this.In case you haven't read the synopsis at the top or watched the movie (it'd be a good idea). This movie chronicles the story of a man and woman who we see the beginning and fall of a marriage.As of 2020 I have already watched a Place Beyond the Pines and I Know This Much is True (both by same director) and I can say that I do understand his direction style approach. So ""unwatchable"" depends on your mood and your own attitude.",Blue Valentine
230,wogsurfer,Heartaches a-plenty,8,28 December 2017,"I probably haven't watched as many, or as varied films as you would expect for someone who says they are a film lover, but I was never about quantity, instead for me it was always about quality.Its also about the lasting impression a film makes on me, whether by completely blowing my mind, by using certain motifs like music, and scenery, or by making me feel something on a deep emotional level. Today Blue Valentine really hit me in the feels, and not the good kind either.This film's tagline is 'A love story', and I feel this could not be further from the truth.This film is so anti-romantic, that the most romantic moment in this film was when a decision about an impromptu hotel stay was being discussed, and hastily planned. The spontaneity by the frustrated male protagonist in a desperate attempt to rekindle a small spark that started the relationship.Blue Valentine is told in two cross-cut linear story lines, and stars Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams as middle-class married couple Dean and Cindy Pereira who are hopelessly trying to make a happy home for their adorable little daughter Frankie.The story lines tell the evolution of their relationship from an awkward first meeting, and fateful chance second encounter, through to a courtship of bad decisions, and a marriage of convenience mostly to fit in with conventionality, then living in rural Pennsylvania.While not much is known about Dean, other than he is from Florida and new to NYC, and an affable yet somewhat unfocused kind of gent. We do get a fair bit of insight in to Cindy's home life in the boroughs of New York, and the ineffectual role models for parents who share a fairly loveless existence.I said this film is anti-romantic, and is so evident throughout the film. The sex scenes are devoid of emotion or intimacy, and is purely based on the physical needs of those involved, and the only love shown to anyone, is to their daughter who seems to be the only happy individual in this film of emotional bleakness.Its been about 8 hours since I watched this film, and I still feel sad about it. I have put much effort into watching indie, or non-major studio films, and for the most part, while having sad, and emotional parts to them, they are often quite uplifting, and leave you with modicum of hope. Blue Valentine does neither, but this does not mean to say that it is a bad film. Quite the opposite, it is a very good film, with excellent performances, expert direction, and writing that achieves exactly what its meant to.Do not go in to this expecting the Notebook, or I dunno, Love Actually. Expect more (500) Days of Summer without the lovelorn male protagonist, or hopeful ending.",Blue Valentine

233,james-726-893190,One sided,8,14 January 2015,"First off I'd like to give this movie an eight because its acting and the filmography is my taste, it's as many stated like a documentary to make you feel like a person glancing over their life. Or a third wheeler. Lol. But the relationship? I've never believed they were in love- it was only one-sided actually. At the beginning they show how he might be the lousy one in the relationship but in reality it's sort of the opposite where he wants attention from her rather than being a mean ass. & they also illustrate how kind his heart is (crying over the dog?) in which indicates how much he really treasures everything that belongs to the family. So they start with the background of each-- he's (Dean) a naive but reliable man with no expectations and she's (Cindy) a woman with ambitions of her own but insecure about her existence and has a skewed belief of marriage in general due to her parents. He sees her and she sees him- he's quite naive cause he believes in love at first sight and gets affected by his environment very easily while she tried to avoid him at first. & coincidentally this all takes place when she tried to avoid her ex (Bobby?)- this shows she's an escapist while he pulls an effort to be otherwise in getting what he wants. So to me, it seemed that Dean was just there as an alternative for her to run away to from her problems with Bobbi- it was quite clear when she ignored him. Another aspect of hers is recklessness- it shows how overwhelming she could be (losing virginity at the age of 13? having sex with 25 men?) in her life with her disbelief of love whilst Dean was standing out there ready to embrace all her consequences and just be part of her life. I'm not being sympathetic with Dean, I mean he's an entirely flawed character himself and really persistent but she seemed to have more issues than he did. For him, I didn't like how he gets upset suddenly when she tries to say something but that's probably because she always rejects him at the beginning then tries to sugar-coat her actions later after reflecting. Which isn't very sincere and quoting Dean he's quite ""intuitive"" so he's not a fool when it comes to these things. Another interesting thing is that it feels like Cindy was insecure around her own husband- alright, he seems like a man with a lot of capability and always excels whatever task that is given to him with ease while she tries to find that potential in herself for medicine. Then she asks of him to also feel the same way and set a standard for himself while his answer was all: ""I'm working to live my dream- to be there for you and Frankie."" in which pushes Cindy to a corner and makes her seem like a bad person and also could have triggered her indirectly of being selfish. His sincerity killed her let's say. Even at start: she was all quiet and negative about the room while he adapted to it and just tried to make the best of it by being positive. It just shouts one-sided. Then comes the explosion of the two- after looking at their background and seeing how he tries to fix the problem as much as he can while she tries to escape it as hard as she can and just gives up says A LOT. Sure, he was drunk and it was a terrible mistake to visit her regardless she was a bit tardy in leaving him at the motel or at least covering him up while he's asleep on the floor- he waited outside for her and all. But the intriguing part was when she asked for him to be a ""man"" he got very confused since his conception of being a man is being someone whom offers his all to his woman- but apparently that isn't right or isn't enough so he just mildly throws things around being the opposite of what he is. Lol. Another scene where it shows he prioritises her is when he tells the doctor not to fire her it was his fault entirely. As mentioned, she has parents that aren't really mushy with one another and she only sees it that way with her life with Dean(her biggest fear of ending up that way- basically she's avoiding that fear as well) whilst Dean had a rocky parenthood of a missing mother at a young age and a father with modest background, yet it did not stop him from believing of good marriage but instead was a motive for him to achieve the ideal love and fix one when a problem occurs. And he still chose her happiness over his' (leaving her for her).. God. His impatience and her quietness are the main factors for their miscommunication which is their biggest downfall. That's the gist of this movie. I just wonder what happens to Frankie after this, I don't think the father will stop seeing her (Dean) since both have grown quite attached to one another Overall, I think the movie was nice & frustrating. It's a one timer. You just need to read between the lines in this one.",Blue Valentine
234,TheTVSamurai,Blue Valentine (2010) Review: A Modern Day Love Story,8,25 January 2012,"This indie film has been around for awhile now, old to many but new to me. I wanted to watch Blue Valentine for the longest time but was waiting for the right time to watch it, in my opinion, you need to be in the mood to able to fully experience and enjoy these types of intense dramas. It's not something I'd watch on a Sunday morning.Be warned, Blue Valentine, is no feel good film and I think everyone should go in knowing that—Fellas, this is not a first date movie. Maybe its the way it's shot, the way the characters are dressed, the saturated colors, the very grainy film look, the middle class and old city scenery, the film just looks depressing from the get-go and it all works beautifully with the film.The film follows a married couple, Dean (Ryan Gosling, Drive) and Cindy (Michelle Williams, Shutter Island). The story is told in a very unique way, it's simultaneously telling two different stories of the same couple; their past and their present. Consistent flashbacks of how they met, how they fell in love and how they got married vs. the modern day couple and how they are coping with marriage on a daily basis. ""Coping"" might be an understatement.Director, Derek Cianfrance (Brother Tied), who's done mainly TV Documentaries and Shorts, tells a brutally honest story of what is sad to say, a realistic portrayal of the hardships of many (definitely not all) modern day couples. I think anyone that's been in a long term relationship or been in love before can totally appreciate this film. From the butterflies-in-your-stomach feeling when you first meet that special someone, the nothing-bothers-me-I-can-do-anything feeling, to the boring, routined and arguments-over-things-you-can't-even-remember married life; this is what Dean and Cindy—along with the help of Cianfrance's storytelling—so artfully illustrates.Continue reading the full review at: http://goo.gl/EdwE0 or http://www.thetvsamurai.com/search/label/Movie%20Reviews",Blue Valentine
235,mikes-movie-review-onlin,"""A contemporary romantic drama""",7,15 April 2012,"Blue Valentine tells the story of the inception and eventual decay of a relationship with a vast understanding of human emotion and filmed with subtle genius. Director/writer Derek Cianfrance shows us two days in the life of a married couple, played by Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. The working-class Pennsylvania couple started off as an incredibly sweet young couple madly in love with each other, but over time they have lost that magic and the reality of everyday life seems to have drained the two of them to the point where the marriage is loveless and hollow, bound for eventual implosion.Dean (Gosling) and Cindy (Williams) met at a retirement home, when Dean was working as a mover and Cindy was studying medicine at university. An almost classic nod to the 'boy-meets- girl' romances of Hollywood, an ironic component given the end of this film,. Their relationship began with the speed of any young romance, passionate nights were occasionally interrupted by cute looks shared in the warm light of a streetlamp. Dean meets Cindy's parents – who don't exactly approve of him – and Cindy tries to end the other relationship she was in at the time. She becomes pregnant, and after a rash wedding the couple decide to start a family and a life together. This is told entirely through flashbacks while the real time of the film tells two days in the couple's lives at the climax before the fall of their relationship. They have reached the point at which the attractions of younger romance no longer exist, Cindy has become sick of Dean's insistent smothering and minor drinking problem, as well as his underachieving life as a house painter.Blue Valentine, as the title seems to suggest, smartly contrasts the rashness of young love, and is suggestive of the shallowness of emotion that lies below. Dean asks his buddy if he believes in love at first sight as the two men set perched on the back of a moving van the day after he first lay eyes on Cindy. He's in that phase where ""when a song comes on you just have to dance"". The problem is that Cindy and Dean both have different perspectives on marriage, Dean sees his wife and family as the reason to work, and that marriage is the final station, while for Cindy it seems to be more of a journey than the destination. The foundation of their marriage simply wasn't strong enough to last, and in that way Blue Valentine isn't a tragedy, it is simplistic and realistic tale, as well suggestive and perhaps precautionary. After several year of marriage, they reach the point where Cindy cries ""I feel nothing for you anymore!"" as Dean, partially drunk, comes to her office and quarrels with her boss and co-workers. What is interesting is that it isn't Dean's alcohol problem that ends their marriage, or Cindy's dedication to her job, the relationship just runs its course, as it seems it was always destined to do.Gosling and Williams are gifted young actors, and both show understanding of their respective roles. Doug and Cindy's relationship feels so real because Derek Cianfrance writes with realism in mind, and the cast seem highly dedicated to producing as genuine a film about love as possible. An intriguing and deeply interesting film, Blue Valentine is a contemporary romantic drama which maps the first six years of a couple's marriage through flashback, as well as witnessing the marriage's almost inevitable collapse. The movie asks audiences to question the concept of love at first sight, as Doug and Cindy did love each other at one point, but that is no longer the case. They have reached the stage where we wonder why they ever got married. Different audiences will associate themselves with different characters, making the interpretation of the film a different experience depending upon your perspective.",Blue Valentine

Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams gave the best performances of that year and certainly one of the best I've ever seen. Is this movie a good Valentines day movie to watch with your girlfriend or boyfriend? no, but is it a good, tense drama about how far can a relationship go? yes. This movie goes through the past and present, what this movie handles so well by the perfect direction of Derek Cianfrance is relationships, getting to know our characters, their character development, how Ryan Goslings character goes from nice boy to alcoholic and a scary person to be with, and Michelle Williams suffering from his actions. The script also by Cianfrance is amazing it captures the development, feelings and the struggles of our characters. The movie is shot very well the movie really looks beautiful. Overall it is another masterpiece in Derek Cianfrances belt of success, this not a Valentines Day movie it will make you think two times of your relationship.",Blue Valentine
238,thefilmnotebook,Blue Valentine: where did love go wrong?,8,31 October 2017,"Derek Cianfrance was a documentary filmmaker. Blue Valentine was his second feature film. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are Dean and Cindy, a young couple very much in love, who after a few years, seem to hate each other's guts. Cianfrance's utilises documentary instincts to tell a realistic love story that is both heart-warming and heartbreaking.Dean and Cindy had their classic meet cute, and went from dancing and singing in the streets together to arguing with each other with annoyance and contempt. They had such a rare spark, and laughed so easily together, and yet now, they just don't seem to get each other anymore. Cianfrance, and fellow writers Cami Delavigne and Joey Curtis, presents Dean and Cindy's story in two alternating points in time. The past – bathed in warm light, which represents the more romantic, happier times, to the present – that uses cooler and darker colours to reflect the loss of love.I was extremely impressed by Gosling and Williams exceptionally strong performances. They each have to play two different versions of themselves – and portray two images of their love. Externally, apart from Dean's obvious hair loss and glasses, the differences are minimal. On the inside, it is difficult to tell. But Gosling and Williams does a splendid job showing the changes through their interactions. They lived with each other before and during filming – their comfort and familiarity with each other really seeps through on screen.The contrast between the before and now is handled masterfully. The last scenes where Dean and Cindy cries in each other's arms, with Dean's 'I love you so much' to Cindy's 'I can't do this anymore' is incredibly real and relatable. Cianfrance cross-cuts this with the scenes from their wedding ceremony, in direct contrast. It is saddening and you really have one response: how?Blue Valentine doesn't attempt the answer the questions of why things went wrong. It gives the facts as it is, and it is open for interpretation as to the causes and the why. My interpretation is that they didn't try to follow each other in their growth, and keep up with what each other needs. Even they don't know how they came to be like this. And that is the most tragic part.",Blue Valentine

Heartbreaking and powerful I couldn't recommend it enough to anyone interested in true cinema.",Blue Valentine
241,dstanmyer,Engaging & intense performances carry the film!,7,19 February 2011,"Blue Valentine is an enjoyable, though raw and dark portrayal of a relationship between two flawed individuals. I may have falsely assumed that this film was meant to be reflective of the complicated duality and oft-neglected realism of love and relationships in today's day and age. For me though, it failed to register at such a level of all-encompassing reflection and did not fully work as a statement on relationship realism, minus Hollywood gleam and shine.Though it wasn't quite what I expected, it doesn't mean it wasn't successful in it's own way. We are shown a study on what can happen between two people that seemingly come from damaged pasts wrought with dysfunction. Gosling's Dean never graduated High School and holds odd jobs throughout the time we see him on screen and has a developing problem with alcohol. We also know that his mother abandoned him at the age of 10. Williams' Cindy clearly has scars from a childhood that included a father who, at the very least, from the one scene we're showed, engages in intense emotional abuse. Cindy lacks faith in functional relationships, most likely not trusting that they can work out and probably having deep seated issues with men in general. It appears that she is somewhat distant in her relationships, with Bobby and Dean, often coming across very serious and reticent to let go and have fun. It becomes clear that she most likely struggles with finding, and keeping, happiness. Add to that the fact that her relationship with Dean accelerates very quickly on the heals of her relationship with her volatile boyfriend Bobby and then she discovers she's pregnant, goes through an emotionally wrenching abortion attempt, and then decides to keep the child that's not Dean's....is it any wonder that things do not work out? This is a cautionary tale about the benefits of taking relationships slowly while understanding they have ups and downs. Relationships need room to grow and evolve before both parties know what they're in for regarding the long haul of marriage and ""forever"". After two intense months, it's fair to say that you truly don't fully know the other person yet, what they're capable of, and how they handle themselves when the passion wears off and the going gets tough. Anything formed too quickly under intense emotional arrangements most likely won't work. Further, this movie does not speak to the ""average"" masses of people that are equipped with supportive families, coping skills, and the ability to think before acting. Then again, maybe it's not supposed to. Director Derek Cianfrance was successful at illuminating the above realities of love and relationships. This movie was engaging and brought out many strong human emotions along its path of descriptively describing this couples' journey from quick love to absolute misery. The most heart breaking moments include those with their daughter. Williams and Gosling are revelations in their roles and can carry the weight of this movie. To watch the portrayal of such sadness and heartbreak, interspersed with the happy and passionate beginnings, is almost too much to take at times. I imagine that everyone can find moments about their life that started so ""up"" but ended so ""down"".Though the overall story falls short of cinema mastery, the real and raw performances in this film are well worth the price of admission and worthy of much praise. Watching Williams and Gosling portray the full gamut of genuine human emotion was a pleasure to behold.",Blue Valentine
242,not_the_real_george,Social drama,7,6 March 2012,"There is a lot of truth behind the movie, it just paints reality: the way in which an apparently good looking relationship falls into pieces. This kind of instability is so characteristic in today's society. The fake impression of Dean that he isn't good enough or that Cindy is the perfect girl is a common illusion we all have been/are going through. So I love, for example, the scene where she wants to do abortion and talks about her number of partners and so on with the nurse followed by the scene where he decides to raise her baby. Another element is the comparison between the father, a very aggressive man, and Dean, who was still in love with his wife after all. Not to take sides(too much), but I think this shows her superficiality. I know the title is inspired by a song, but another meaning I thought about is an ironic one : Valentine means the ideal love, a part of the movie, and Blue is the other side, the color which is in that future hotel room.",Blue Valentine
243,maggiemaexo,Soo Sad...,6,25 October 2012,"Dean is a young high school dropout, working for a New York City moving company. Cindy is a pre-med student living with her unhappy parents and caring for her grandmother in Pennsylvania. Cindy and Dean meet by chance and rush into marriage after discovering that Cindy is pregnant, possibly from her previous boyfriend Bobby (Mike Vogel). Dean agrees to raise Cindy's daughter, Frankie, as his own. Five years later... Dean is content with their life, Cindy believes he drinks too much and lacks ambition. In the hope of resurrecting their troubled relationship, Dean brings Cindy to a motel. That morning she's called into work, Dean shows up at the clinic drunk, leading to an intense argument and violent altercation with a doctor, who fires Cindy over the incident. Dean tries to persuade her to give the relationship another chance, asking if she wants their daughter to grow up in a broken home, but Cindy says she does not want Frankie to grow up with parents who are so hateful to each other.The story is a familiar one because it's the most common source of drama in life and art but avoids cliché and instead handles the subject with uncommon insight and grace. The lack of context scene-to-scene keeps the audience engaged and on their feet, filling in the intentional holes. The camera work and art direction are exceptionally effective. Set primarily around Independence Day, we see flags, fireworks, and all realm of red, white, and blue. This motif is subtly conveyed with the lighting and costumes throughout the film and continues throughout the credits. Fireworks serve as a last reminder of the explosive power and fractured remnants of a brief illumination. The future room is such an irony: the lack of windows in the room signifies the suffocation and metallic coldness of their relationship. Even the name of future room sarcastically predicts the stale future of their marriageRyan Gosling's performance is one with a true everyman quality while allowing for an, interesting character. Michelle Williams does the same you almost forget its Michelle Williams. It was a Real relationship with giggling filling many of the lines, and realistic, uncomfortable arguments taking place that give the characters sure personality. Blue Valentine has the guts to face the facts of life, to go where most of us don't want to go, where most of us don't want to face, which is reality. Blue Valentine goes there and makes an exceptional, artistic film on reality, and we all need a dose of reality sometimes.I really felt for Dean, like most viewers did. His ability to adapt to unexpected situation, and even more, to embrace it, was mind-blowing. Despite the fact he didn't finish even high school, he knew how to find joy in life, unlike his wife. Maybe the most outstanding remark was the one where he explained the difference between man and woman finding their lifetime partners. He was fighting to very last breath, so many refusals and he wasn't defeated. Even Dean's alcoholic moment at the end, I don't find his future life. It was just crisis, maybe his final acceptance of falling them apart. Because of his character, he will be happy and satisfied man in life after he cures the pain, but Cindy She won't because of one small reason; she never felt a true happiness. Even when she was smiling, it was usually compromise. If she was given a chance to choose whatever she wants to be completely fortunate, without any condition, she will be",Blue Valentine
244,annnc,Crude and tender,9,18 March 2013,"Crude is how to describe this story. As reality itself; sometimes softly tender others never-ending rough and bitter with no damping. Is thanks to showing both sides that despite the rawness it can convey some hope. In this authentic film making many times the first is forgotten giving just slow sour anguish to experience. I recognize and thank the mastery of being able to genuinely portray both.Acting and directing are superb. What I find interestingly discussable is the plot itself; it has managed to be as gray and polemic as real relationship. Many lean openly on his side; my companion stated that she had the problem, she was the one unable to be happy dispraising his efforts to recover her. For me though he is easy to love she is also to understand. His inability to grasp how he could meet her needs shows he also had a problem; he lacked the realism and active companionship that she needed not to feel alone with the load; but is more complex than that. She couldn't even articulate clearly what she needed or accept that he couldn't be different from the warm idealist he was. At some point there is a desynchronizing that disables them to understand the wavelength of the other (quote from oth review). Significantly the director omits the transition between the sweet and the sour for us to fill the unexplainable with our own experiences.",Blue Valentine

I said to myself, ""I haven't seen this and I don't know much about it. I'm going to check it out."" And I'm soooo glad I did. I absolutely love this movie. It is one of the most realistic movies I have ever seen. Ryan and Michelle give (in my opinion) an Oscar worthy performance. This movie officially made Ryan Gosling my favorite actor, along with Drive and other great films he has been in. I don't think I'm going to ramble on much more. So to wrap this up, I must say that the movie has so much emotion that it made me tear up multiple times. And it stuck with me for weeks after I watched it. I just constantly thought about it and how honest of an observation on relationships it is. So I highly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't watched it. Hope u enjoy.",Blue Valentine

When you read the other reviews and pay attention to the ""Hollywood Hype"", you would expect to see a movie of value. I should have known better though. When have they ever promoted a ""man's movie""?With the way Hollywood works this will win Best Picture and prove; yet again, that the Oscar committee doesn't know what fans really like.

248,smallandmighty-294-659109,"A real romance, told beautifully",10,26 August 2012,"All i'd heard about Blue Valentine before watching it was a warning that it'd be the most depressing film I've seen since Requiem for a Dream. I can happily say that while it is sad, it is not depressing, what it is is greatly made, greatly acted, and a great experience.THE STORY makes great use of the split-narrative structure to tell both the start and tough times of Dean & Cindy's relationship, and there are some definite tonal differences between the sections. The 'past' sections manage to be charming, filled with some human comedy as the couple make each other laugh; while the 'present' is tough, claustrophobic, but not without heart and still some humour.THE SCRIPT (much improvised by Gosling and Williams) conveys the cuteness and tediousness of a highly real relationship, with giggling filling many of the lines, and realistic, uncomfortable arguments taking place that give the characters sure personality.THE DIRECTION has clear differences between the past and present: Cianfrance uses long takes and lower quality film to create an almost documentary-like feeling to the past; the present shot up close with little depth, and at times makes us feel like we're seeing too much.THE ACTING is spot on, and this is really an actors' piece, as Gosling and Williams write many of their own scenes, and both come off incredibly, creating some of the most 3 dimensional characters of recent years.OVERALL, Blue Valentine is just immensely moving, while not to everyone's taste, it's certainly to mine.",Blue Valentine
249,GrungeFan1996,An intimate and realistic depiction of a tragic break-up,9,25 March 2017,"The trailer for Blue Valentine makes it look like an indie rom-com, however it is not, far from it actually. Blue Valentine is about the end of a failed marriage involving two people named Dean (Ryan gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams). The film cuts back and forth between two time periods separated five years apart, the beginning of their relationship, and the final 24 hours of their relationship. Dean is a good man, a little childish, but only wants to be a good father and a good husband, Cindy on the other hand is selfish and only seems to care about herself and not so much about her family. Blue Valentine is a hard film to explain without spoiling anything, so with that I won't go any further into the plot. There's not really a straightforward plot with this film, Blue Valentine is a film that relies mostly on acting. The performances in this film are very strong and the movie is very emotionally intense, it feels as if you're actually watching an unhappy couple drift away from each other, and this is not a movie to see with your boyfriend or girlfriend unless you want them to dump you. This film originally received an NC-17 rating due to a scene involving cunnilingus, Ryan Gosling later complained about this and accused the MPAA of sexism and misogyny, therefore, the rating was changed to R. Blue Valentine could be seen as a cautionary tale that teaches this lesson, be careful who you fall in love with and make sure that person is worth it, because most marriages these days are just like this movie, they start off happy, but eventually go down a black hole and into the divorce courts. I strongly recommend all young people to go see Blue Valentine because it shows what very well could become of a marriage, and if you do decide to get married, make sure that person is worth it. Blue Valentine is a great film with great acting and two very good, well respected actors, however, this is a film I will never be able to watch again. 9/10.",Blue Valentine
250,moviemaker-49866,Heartbreaking,10,18 January 2021,"This is a fantastic movie with realism, great acting, and dialogue. No matter what

251,DirkesDiggler,Heartbreaking and Powerful,10,29 October 2010,"I am going to soap box it here for a second. The MPAA (those fine folk who decide what rating a film will receive) ticks me off to no end. Their system feels arbitrary, outdated, and stupid. You can only use the ""F"" word once in the non literal sense and maintain a PG-13 rating. Because that's the problem, kids hearing the ""f"" word too many times. For want of any other description, it is terribly stupid.Why do I bring this up? Well, because the film I watched tonight, a powerful and incredibly touching film has been assigned an NC-17 rating for a sex scene that is not erotic, not violent, not disturbing. It is graphic, but more that that it is sad. Really sad. I'll talk more about this later, but the idea that we have a system that gives ""The Human Centipede,"" ""Hostel 1&2″ and all of the ""Saw"" movies an R rating without a second thought gives this film an NC-17 stuns me. I honestly cannot make sense of it. This is a beautiful, touching, and wonderfully authentic film that deserves a shot at release. There is no logical way a reasonable human being could say that this is less appropriate for a teenager than any of those listed above. For some reason we think graphic torture is fine, but sex and nudity will be the downfall of us all.My favorite poem is T.S. Eliot's ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock."" I've always identified with it and I think it is one of the finest pieces of writing ever produced. Specifically I am enamored with the line, ""Shall I, after tea and cake and ices have the strength to force the situation to its crisis."" This describes a situation most of us have been in. You're in a relationship that is failing, you know it's failing, the other person knows, your friends know, but it just hasn't reached that crisis point that forces it to end. That is what this film is about.Most films center on the beginnings of a relationship (the honeymoon), the middle (where things have reached a comfort point), or the divorce proceedings, but you rarely get the moment when the relationship dies. It's hard to present well and it's difficult to watch. This is what happens when the things that were once funny and cute aren't funny or cute anymore. We've all been there and it is painful.If you think of a relationship as having a life then Blue Valentine is that life at the moment of death where the life that is dying flashes in front of your eyes. There is a combination of present time and flashback showing how these two people came together and how the inevitably fell apart.Gossling and Williams are both superb in this film. He plays all the clumsy sweetness and frustration of Dean perfectly, and she plays the damage and need to be loved with a quiet power that is absent from most performances today.These are two people with a very idealized and romanticized view of love. They view it as something that is there or it isn't. From their backgrounds it is obvious why. Neither of them has any exposure to a couple working at it, tending to the relationship. Things are good, then they aren't. Williams character says early on, ""How can you trust your feelings when they can just disappear like that?"" That is a question that has plagued people as long as there have been relationships. At some point your feelings will change and if you are unequipped to change and grow with them, then any relationship is destined to fail. The two stories (falling in love and falling apart) are told in intersecting circles. You see the beginning of the end, then you see how they meet, you see the relationship deteriorate further, then you see their amazing first date. This style allows you to see how they fell in love with each other, but also showed the lack of foundation the ultimately doomed them. Through most of the film it is obvious that the only reason they stayed together as long as they did is because of their daughter, and their absolute love for her.Gosling as the devoted, hard working father is touching, Williams as the overworked mother who seems to be raising her husband along with her daughter is touching. The dynamic of goofy, doting father, and concerned, loving mother is brilliantly played, and creates some genuinely sweet and heartbreaking moments.This is not an easy movie to watch. It's quite brutal, emotionally, at times. The scene that earned the NC-17 is quite graphic. The two go away to a romantic hotel for a night to try and rediscover something, and end up in a graphic sex scene that is just hard to watch. It's not as graphic as say ""Monsters Ball,"" but there is a resistance by Williams, followed by a resignation, she doesn't want to, but she'll do it. It isn't violent, it isn't a glamorized rape scene, it's hard to watch because it's just so sad. There is no way to deny that this is the death of the relationship embodied in a single moment. He is still infatuated with her, but she has moved on and there isn't any of the old spark left.While I did enjoy this film it is most definitely not something I would watch often. It is good enough to deserve another view or two, but it is just to heartbreaking. This script went through 66 drafts over 12 years and it shows in the attention to detail, the brilliant pacing, and the way it allows a look and silence to speak volumes. This is a well acted, solidly written and directed film that is well worth at least one viewing, just be aware that it won't be an entirely pleasant experience.",Blue Valentine
252,dick-sanders,Disappointing -- great actors can't save a weak script.,3,1 February 2011,"When I heard Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams were to be in a film called Blue Valentine, and it was about a marriage going bad, I was excited. I was hoping to see something as intriguing as Revolutionary Road, in which Leo Dicaprio, Kate Winslet, and director Sam Mendes do a fine job working with a Richard Yates novel. Nothing of the sort exists here. Overall the film is dull and somewhat painful to watch. Not because of difficult emotional material, but rather because we just don't care about the characters. I don't fault Gosling and Williams. I think they did a fine -- perhaps even heroic -- job, but the film is a big disappointment because of weak writing and direction. From what I understand Blue Valentine was delayed for years and when writer/director Derek Cianfrance finally got around to shooting, he told his actors he was sick of the script and that they'd better come up with something to surprise him. Purportedly, Williams was disappointed at this because she loved the script, but Gosling didn't mind because he wasn't good at remembering lines anyway. The film does have an improvised feel and the direction seems unfocused. I never got a sense of where Cianfrance wanted to take us with his story, if you can call it a story. Cianfrance said he wanted to explore the idea of falling in and out of love, and just what causes that feeling of love to go away. I'm not sure that's a good enough premise for a film, especially if on the first day of shooting you're throwing out the script and asking your actors to improvise. Some reviewers here have said you won't see better acting this year. Yes, it's good, but it doesn't rise to greatness because the actors don't have great material to work with. Compare to Rabbit Hole, in which Nicole Kidman, Aaron Eckhart, Dianne Wiest, and Miles Teller move us to the depths of our souls -- mostly with what they say! Early in 2010 I saw Rob Reiner's lovely film, Flipped, at which he was available afterward for a Q&A. One audience member asked, ""What makes for a good movie?"" Reiner didn't hesitate, saying, ""If you start with a good script and you cast it right, you're 90% there."" I liked that answer. And now I'm wondering ""what percentage there"" are we with Blue Valentine, if the casting is right but the script is thrown out in favor of a scene list? Let me venture a guess -- 30%? Cianfrance doesn't add much that I can see because he uses a hand-held camera with too many close shots that makes it more difficult to engage with the actors and action. A documentary style is no substitute for good writing. What's more, much was made about the NC-17 rating this film originally received (appealed and later revised to R) because of the oral sex scene. But frankly, that scene, and most of the sex scenes, just made me angry because I couldn't help thinking that Cianfrance should have spent a lot less time on the sex scenes and lot more time writing a good script. Maybe then, he'd have a good picture. But he didn't and he doesn't. Cianfrance opens the film with a married couple that we can see is unhappy, and then he flashes back to romantic times early in their relationship. The back and forth repeats throughout. Maybe because of this structure, I never really bought the romance. To me, it felt like two ""not very bright people"" got married for the wrong reasons, and then later found out about it. No big surprise there. Compare again to Rabbit Hole, which also opens with an unhappy married couple, but soon enough we learn that they have very good reasons to be unhappy and are struggling mightily to hang on to their love and make sense of their marriage after a devastating loss. It's great writing that lets them deliver great performances so that we truly care about them. After the picture, my wife was disappointed, and upon learning of my disappointment, she couldn't understand why I didn't suggest leaving. I told her I had high expectations, and out of respect for Gosling and Williams I stuck with it, hoping it would get better. Well, it didn't and I'm blaming Cianfrance for wasting a lot of talent, effort, and money on something not worth shooting.",Blue Valentine

254,a_kozak,Blue Valentine turns Red.,7,22 June 2013,"This film is absolutely great. I have previously seen The Place Beyond the Pines which was also directed by Derek Cianfrance. He is a fantastic Director/Writer. His decisions in pace, shots, story and more are unbelievable!Pace: The pace of this film is great because it is slow and steady, just like their relationship. I really like the non-linear module used because it shows how their relationship was on and off, positive and negative.Shots: The shots of this film is great because the shots are so beautifully crafted to show emotions in the characters without using dialogue. Especially the scenes in the motel room. The use of colour to reflect feeling was stunning. In the last shot where Dean is walking away from Cindy and Frankie is one of the best shots in terms of meaning. Dean becomes a silhouette and this is the point where all characters realize that Dean has become a shadow of the man he used to be.Acting: I can't even begin to say how amazing the acting was especially in the climactic scene where Dean only wants Cindy and Frankie. Nothing else. I believed everything that was happening on screen throughout the film. The acting jumped out at me.Although, at some points it was a little confusing when time skipped from past to present. Sometimes this took me out of the movie for a bit. Ryan Gosling's character was definitely the most enjoyable and interesting character, we see everything through his perspective. Which was great decision because he changed so much throughout the film.8/10 Great film.",Blue Valentine
255,namenotnecessary,Decline of a former romance,6,25 April 2010,"Aptly titled, Blue Valentine is a present-day American marriage drama charting the all too familiar decline of a once romantic relationship. Cindy (Michelle Williams) is adrift in her own feelings for her devoted husband Dean (Ryan Gosling) who through their inadvertent creation of a family together has discovered his true vocation is no less innocent and precise than that itself; but alas this is a virtue too primitive for her ambitiousness to handle.Expressing the nascent romance of the relationship in flashback scenes, the film effectively displays an authentic study about the emerging difficulties of a particular marriage and our underlying impression of the child Frankie sustaining her parents' connection is preserved well throughout the drama. Acted well, the film is an engaging, worthwhile watch. Although at times a little amiss under the presupposition of our knowledge of the characters' history, the flashbacks ultimately succeed as a method for this narrative and the film manages to maintain a consistent, enjoyable pace. Perhaps the most poignant aspect of contemporary director Derek Cianfrance's film is its simplicity; a simplicity that does not drown in monotony but rather leaves one thirsty for a little more – double entendre nevertheless intended. This austerity builds a wholesome relationship between its protagonists, and Cianfrance's endeavour to create equality about them is brilliant but not flawless. One yearns for them both as individuals and as a couple to end their battle for the contentment they want to find for themselves within each other but I questioned the physical actions of the female protagonist to a greater extent than those of the male. Indeed it would be reasonable to question his behaviour and thus equality would again prevail.A good character study, less symbolic than Revolutionary Road, it meets resolve in its entirety. Like piecing together a puzzle whilst uncertain of the intended result, it stumbles forth to a conclusion that nonetheless renders it intact and entertaining.Rating 3/5",Blue Valentine
256,yingszhou,Sad but real....,9,6 September 2018,"I watched this film twice, the 2nd time I watched it was during a time when my marriage was falling apart, so much like how the film portrayed. I can feel that Dean's character is a good person, he has good heart and intends to do the right thing, however that is not enough. His character portrays immaturity, he is sweet, sensitive and loving, but the lack of maturity and realism creates a hurdle in holding a family together. I feel what Cindy is going through. The only difference between this movie and real life is that Dean is trying really hard to make it work, and he really does love his wife and daughter. This is hard to find in real life. Most men give up or have a change of heart, or find an affair elsewhere. I think if a man has the will to want to make it work, then there is hope.",Blue Valentine

We learn a lot about the individuals and their relationships during their courtship and then when they are having significant difficulty, but what is missing is what really caused the rift between them, cause and effect become blurred and while we enjoy fine acting we never get the story itself. Of course there is a lot we are allowed to connect if we want to, we can make up the story of the missing years and decide for ourselves what the failures were, but I ended up very unsatisfied.

260,ultimitsu,a terrible movie of a rare kind,3,4 January 2012,"There are many movies that you would think was great as you watch it, but afterwards on reflection felt something about it was weak. Then there are few movies that afterwards you would realise it totally sucked. This is one of these movies.Let me begin by praising Gosling and William's performance, they were great, though I don't share the same view as some other viewers that they were exceptional. they both have done better work work elsewhere.The first noticeable major flaw of this movie is its cinematography, it down right sucks. In this day and age where a lot of indie film makes can use SLRs to make clips great quality, there is no excuse for this sort of appalling filming. the whole film looked grainy, unpleasant and very often of focus, it was a waste of money to see it on Blu-ray. the colour and tone was never pleasant through out the film, even in the happy scenes where it could not have been intended artistic direction to make everything look dull and unattractive.But the biggest problem is its plot, it is simply broken. The movie is basically two supposedly related stories unfold together and somewhere somehow they suppose to interrelate and make sense of everything. But that didn't happen. We see the young, naive if not retard Dean woo the equally naive if not selfish Cindy with his innocent charm and begin the happily-ever-after, we at the same time see the older, still gentle and loving but frustrated Dean try to keep their marriage work, with that same Cindy, what happened in between, where and how exactly did Cindy ""lose her feelings"" over the course of their marriage (as she was predicting at the beginning of the film)? Fatally, this was never explained. Some viewers may insist that you could to draw inference from the fact that she was so smart and he was so dumb and lazy so they would draft apart. That is plausible but in the fashion that it is unexplained, it is a major hole in the story. Audiences can always make up their own mind as to what the story could be but that would defeat the whole purpose of story telling. If we are to understand the story the way it is told, the only conclusion we can possible draw is that Cindy is a terrible person. She was a loose woman in her youth, 25 sexual partners since she was 13 to before entering med-school, got pregnant, has sex with a guy she just met, then tells him that the baby was his, he marries her for who she was but she constantly tries to change him into something he doesn't want to be, and psychologically abuses him with her passive aggressive treatments, in the end despite his unconditional love to her and her daughter, she divorces him over one day worth of fighting. If this is what the story really is about, then it has got the tone all wrong and it is not a enjoyable story, if the story is suppose to be about ""manage love is hard"", then it failed to do so, it tells us something else completely.the only thing truly heart breaking is that after 9 years of hard work of rewrites and financing, all they ended up with is this pile of ""doesnt make sense"", somewhat ironically parallels the main theme of the movie itself.",Blue Valentine
261,fiz-2,amazing that most critics seem to have misread this film,8,24 January 2011,"Most external reviews I have read (including my most admired critics) see, quite astonishingly, to have misread this film. Here are the most significant aspects not addressed. 1. she is pregnant when she marries him (deciding to have the child, not knowing exactly who the father is but unable to go through with an abortion). Would she have married him otherwise? probably not. 2. The difference in education and even social class is not conducive to lifelong compatibility. He is a laborer (painter, mover) even if he can play the guitar. She is a nurse, who had aspired to medical school. Even so, she has possibilities of advancement to a higher position (despite the fact that the doctor is sort of making the moves on her). He is going nowhere, and what's more, has no interest in doing so. 3. Emotionally, he remains where he was when they started: fun, sex, and total devotion to her. but that devotion has a price: insecure in his own masculinity, he is quick to anger, possessive and demanding to 'own' her. He is soft, sentimental, a weeper, and does best with his 5 year old child. She lives in a more complex environment: her father, her job, her attractiveness to others. 4. If the film has a major flaw, it is the fact that the relationship from the start is that of the imbalance between lover (he) and beloved (she). It was never idyllic to begin with. This said, I found it a subtle, absorbing, and complex look at human relationships. And both the cinematography (many close ups, interesting angles, use of blurred figures in the background) and the music were original and compelling.

We were both young and had many issues to face although I am much older than these characters.I feel that Dean was a good person to take on another man's child. He was not as intelligent as her but the child adored him. She seemed to question him too much so what if he was a painter and had a beer in the morning no harm done. She was not a warm person he was. Her family background accounted for that. He always meant well and I was sad at the end that they broke up.

Both sides of the story are portrayed fairly making it easy to empathise with both characters.

I was prepared for a romantic drama with some 2nd act tension that would be resolved in some predictable way. Boy I couldn't have been more wrong. While Blue Valentine almost comically hams up the romanticism at times, it ultimately paints an extremely mature and realist point of view on relationships that I was completely taken aback by. While not crazy revolutionary film, the execution is so precise and thoughtful I have to give it the credit that the filmmakers clearly contributed to it.Both Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams put on stellar performances here, bravely exposing a side of themselves through these characters that I was utterly convinced by. Gosling's character is incredibly charming especially in the flashback scenarios, and yet while you ask yourself how could it go so wrong? The seeds of his trauma are so cleverly established in these same flashback scenarios. Raised by a single father, and no money for a strong education, Gosling's character arc is justified in how he prioritizes his duties as a middle aged adult. He understands all to well the importance of the optics to his child of a wholesome loving family and dedicates to much to it, yet he can't understand the nuances of a long term relationship and all the challenges that brings with time. Michelle William's character so ambitious and goal-driven, is a perfect clash that ultimately comes to a tragic head during the third act of the film. I watch sappy romance movies often with a feeling of indifference and banality, yet this movie caught me off guard as so emotionally rich and real, to the point where it made me uncomfortably introspective about my own romantic life.I am hard pressed to recommend a better romantic drama than this one, and this is typically a genre that I brush off the shoulder and forget about the next day.

He makes mistakes but never let go of his family.The director portrayed beautifully about the most common problems which arise between a man and wife and how they overcome those problems. Apart from this, I totally loved the chemistry between Dean and Cindy before marriage. This movie includes some sweet moments and some bitter moments as well. I'm 23 and single and If I ever become a husband then I wanna be like Dean(The character in this movie).",Blue Valentine
267,george-napper,Blue Valentine: The Most genuine and heartfelt romance in more than a decade.,10,16 November 2010,"If ever there was a perfect film that defines the romantic relationship for the 21st century, Derek Cianfrance's 'Blue Valentine' is that film. We begin at a secluded ranch house where a little girl is trying to find her lost dog. We then see her father (Ryan Gosling) comforting her. Enter mom (Michelle Williams), the concerned mother who tries to balance work and her child's needs. Seems like a generally happy household, right? Wrong. Though they may not want to admit it, Dean and Cindy's marriage has been on the rocks for years. Dean decides to take his wife to a sex motel that ends up being more like a Star Trek motel to try to rekindle the way they used to feel about each other. The reason for their bickering is unclear until the flashbacks that have been following the main plot line give you a full understanding of why things have deteriorated so. You see them meet each other, fall madly in love, and then experience well, you'll have to see it yourself.Personally, I think this is the tragic romance to end all tragic romances. Films will try to beat it, but they will have to work long and hard before they can eek out an ounce of the genuineness with which this film tells its story. Ryan Gosling's performance is one with a true everyman quality while allowing for a full-fledged, interesting character and a brilliantly realized character arc. Michelle Williams does the same. She delivers this role with so much raw truth that you almost forget that it's Michelle Williams and not just an average woman. I would not be surprised at all to see both of these superb talents get nominated for Best Actor Oscars, along with Derek Cianfrance for Best Director and the writing team for Best Original Screenplay.It's heartbreaking, it's deeply moving; it will have you laughing, crying and singing its praises. Even though the MPAA seems to have a beef with truth in filmmaking, it's hard to imagine this film not being discovered over time and being recognized for the infallible masterpiece that it is.",Blue Valentine
268,stevewhite88,Stand Out Film of the Year,10,22 April 2011,"Blue Valentine centers on a contemporary married couple, charting their evolution over a span of years by cross-cutting between time periods. The movie flickers between times of joy and happiness, and times of heartbreak, allowing the audience to fully distinguish how the lead characters relationships have evolved/changed.The two leads in this film are both fantastically played out by Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling albeit Williams being the only one to receive an Oscar nomination for her role in this film. In this reviewers opinion Gosling was equally impressive, and thus should have equally deserved a nomination for this movie, although he was not nominated for this years Oscars. It was an absolutely travesty to see Williams not take home the Oscar for her performance in Blue Valentine, however she WAS beaten by an extremely competent Natalie Portman for her role in the hit drama/thriller Black Swan. The character of Dean (Gosling) is portrayed as laid back, and a person with not a care in the world, however this is contrasted in the modern day by his seemingly moody behaviour – with many suggestions within the movie hinting of an alcohol addiction. It is interesting to see the stark contrast between Dean in the scenes from the past, and the Dean we see in the present – something translated perfectly to screen by actor Gosling. In contrast Cindy (Williams) is portrayed in a positive light more so in the future scenes, with a great focus on her dedication to her daughter, and her career. In the scenes from the past Cindy can be seen as a fairly confused and mislead character, there is a suggestion that she was bought up in a broken home, and she is extremely sexually active. She falls pregnant at a young age, and although never directly stated, once can assume that her daughter was not fathered by Dean. Nevertheless, Dean steps up to the mark, and marries Cindy – something that is portrayed as a potentially wrong decision in the scenes set in the present day.It has been a long time since we have seen two characters gel so well together on screen, and in many respects two actors work so flawlessly together. Much of this can be contributed to the fact that both Williams and Gosling were able to improvise throughout the shooting of the film, and were made to live together/have real arguments with each other in preparations for their roles in this film. It is difficult to watch the film and imagine different actors in the two lead roles – something you can seldom say when it comes to the majority of modern day releases.On of my favourite features of this movie is how realistic each of the scenes in the film are. We are also given huge amounts of opportunity to spend time getting to know the lead characters, and invest ourselves into them. Without the strong back story and the amount of back story we were given, it would have been difficult to appreciate this film in the same way. By having an appreciation for the characters, one is able to have more of an appreciation for the story itself.This movie was engaging throughout and brought out many emotions – both happy and sad - along the way. The two lead cast members are both exceptional in their portrayals of both of the main characters and carry the story well. Blue Valentine comes with a hearty recommendation from myself, and is definitely one of the stand out films of this year so far.Visit my blog at StevieNight.com for more of my reviews.",Blue Valentine

In slow times I left waiting to pass something, but there was nothing I did not have any progress. I Here is a nice beginning not the best, but good. The couple begins to live in anguish, but in a little romance mixed with ""no reason"" Ryan Gosling has a talent for drama that looks very natural in previous films such as The Journal Noa, but this couple was false when there mixture of passion the expression on their faces were very boring, out of what they were doing at the moment. the role I'm very depressed.This film is not much that can mean good Indeed, except for the drama in the beginning of Ryan Gosling.This is a movie where you get bored waiting for slow some kind of progression show you exciting and only disappointing scene.This commentary was written by a Latino which his English may not be quite perfect.",Blue Valentine

I don't think any one else would have done justice to the characters of Ryan Gosling as DEAN and Michelle Williams as CINDY did. Every scene in the movie is so convincing that you never feel that you are watching a movie.The story of a guy, the story of a girl, the story of a man, the story of a woman, the story of a father, the story of a mother, the story of hate and the story of LOVE.BEAUTIFUL",Blue Valentine
271,Ryan-tosatto,Beautifully sweet and heartbreaking film.,10,9 January 2020,Cianfrance came out of obscurity with a bang after releasing BV as his first major film. The young and up and former director got career performances from 2 soon to be superstar actors in Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams and masterfully wove a tapestry of a relationship coming together and falling apart through seamless flash backs. The effect created is the viewer watching the 2 fall in love and decide to be a family and also grow apart to the point of no return where no love remains and decide to destroy their family. It gives goosebumps and provokes shed tears for both happy and sad moments. The score is also perfectly done by the soon to breakout indie band grizzly bear adding the perfect beautifully sweet and melancholy sonic backdrop. This is definitely not an easy watch but it's worth every twinge of heartache it coaxes from the depths of your subconscious,Blue Valentine
272,queen_abbiedala,Breathtakingly Beautiful,8,13 April 2013,"Well there Ryan Gosling goes again with stealing our hearts in another beautiful and tragic love story. This movie literally took my breath away. I was in pure and utter shock as every minute passed. It was so different than what I had excepted when I began to watch it. From the opening scene to the ending credits, my eyes were not only hooked, but my heart was as well. It takes a hell of a lot of emotional stability to make a film like this and boy did Gosling and Williams do it. They had the most perfect connection of any two actors I have ever seen. In my opinion, this is some of their best work. Being an actor is about telling a story, but what they brought was so much more. They took me on a journey. I laughed, I cried (way too much), I lost and regained hope. My heart literally broke. I felt their pain. It taught me about love, loss, strength, and sacrifice. I questioned myself. I realized that we all make mistakes...but that we also have to learn from them. It showed me the immense power of love, and that it is not always good and pure. It can damage and destroy us, but it can also lift us up when nothing else can. Grab your tissue box when you go to watch this movie; you're gonna need it.",Blue Valentine
273,joserobertomendoza,Patetic,1,19 August 2016,"Honestly, it's a movie that is not worth seeing and less spending money on it or rent, is horrible, depressing abuses foreground left much to be desired sex scenes only seeking to attract the public, flash backs incoherent, plots and dialogues of the worst, with dismal performances and a script out of some trash. Really did not understand the message the director, because it had not, it is so sinister and depressing as Frank Kafka novel, which gives me nauseous just seeing her. Do not recommend it for anything in the world, it is the most horrible and frightening movies superlatively, I've seen in my life, and I've seen hundreds of movies. In a word it is pathetic.",Blue Valentine
274,williamdouglas743,Raw Love,10,21 November 2019,"In most movies about a relationship falling apart, there's one element that was the turning point. Someone lied, someone died. But in Blue Valentine, there's no one thing that caused Cindy and Dean's relationship to deteriorate; there's no point you can look at and go, ""that's where it all went wrong."" This makes watching the film even more painful, because there's no way to know how to fix it if you don't know what the problem is.The editing makes this process even harder, showing us two distinct moments: the week they falled in love, and, years alter, the week they get a divorce. Cindy also delivers one of the cruelest quotes about marriage and the moment you realize you don't love the person you married anymore: ""How do you trust your feelings when they can just disappear like that?""Amazing. SIde by side with the ""Before trilogy"", and a must-watch to anyone.",Blue Valentine
275,etpharrypotter,So Real it Hurts,9,15 October 2016,"This movie is not your typical go-to film, it's very dense and it represents the best and worst in human beings. I watched this film recently because i started watching Gosling movies since i watched Drive (2011) about a year ago and it left me speechless. So i wanted to check out more of Gosling's work. I was excited for this one in particular since i loved The Place Beyond the Pines, and it was directed by the same guy that directed this movie ( Derek Cianfrance). The movie starts by showing us a broken family and its members, we have Dean (Gosling), Cindy (Williams) and their daughter Frankie (Wladyka), we can see that they are going through difficulties, but as the movie progresses it goes to the past showing us a young Dean and a young Cindy in their first encounters. The hard part of this movie is that it shows us the life of many people in this country, the basic story is the girl meets a boy, the boy and the girl have sex, the girl gets pregnant on accident, the guys marries the girl to take care of the baby, and years after they can't stand each other. The fact that Gosling's character thinks that everything is alright is even more heartbreaking since William's character is completely tired of him in every sense, but at the end its another love story with no happy ending.",Blue Valentine

Yes I suppose it was realistic but it wasn't a feel good film at all. Also the constant jumping backwards and forwards from past to present confused me. I wish I had researched how unhappy this film was before I watched it.the sex scenes were supposedly risqué but I thought they were quite tame.i feel really disappointed after watching this. I'm glad I didn't pay any money for it and it was just on the TV. I'm not sure what Ryan Goslings character did wrong.

All the details, the emotions are so perfectly captured. I also loved the cinematic techniques of the contrast in cold and warm colors which hinted at the couple's emotional stages.In the end this movie had me thinking, who was more at wrong? Initially, I had put most of the blame on Dean; he didn't try hard enough to provide financially for the family, he was an alcoholic, he whines over things like oatmeal and makes the life of Cindy way harder than it should be. But then as the plot progresses, I turned my hate towards Cindy. She was emotionally unavailable for Dean, she perhaps did not love Dean as much as he did, she kept things hidden from Dean. In the end, however, it became clear to me that both of them are equal to blame for the annihilation of their marriage. Both of them are bad communicators, both of them are melodramatic and over-sensitive, both of them are fighting their own demons.This movie really taught me a lesson; which is it seems like love is impossible to maintain. All in all, I am gonna low key practice abstinence from now on and become a spiritual nun.",Blue Valentine
278,lostgirldiary,Add Two Basis Points for Featuring Ryan Gosling in Anything,6,6 August 2011,"I could watch Ryan Gosling stand around, sit around and walk around and remove his shirt all day long. No problem there. I also happen to think he's a wonderful actor, but it's a little hard to prove with this yawn fest. I waited and waited until the roll of the first ending credit, but not only did nothing happen, no one even said anything of much interest. These are your friends, your family, your neighbors; simply living. That's it. Living. No one's good, no one's bad, nothing's wrong, nothing's right. Just people being people. Weird premise for a film. There was some attractive cinematography and Gosling and Williams did a fine job, but where's the script? Huh? The story is: Not happy. Not sad. Not hot. Not revealing. Not amusing. Not clever. Not nutthin'. There IS no story.Now THAT'S sad.",Blue Valentine
279,tjlarson_,You will not see better performances this year,9,27 October 2010,"No matter what else is yet to be released, you will not see two better performances this year than Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams.It's almost impossible to imagine anyone in anything coming close. In the defensive, aggressive way he turns every line of dialogue around on the speaker as a hidden affront to his insecurities, Gosling reminded me of no less than De Niro in Raging Bull as the older Dean. Playing the younger version, he channels the charm, romanticism, and recklessness of a 1960s Paul Newman.Williams, who has emerged as the best American actress 30 and under, pulls off a performance that recalls Gena Rowlands' work with Cassavettes. Which is not to say either is an imitation, they aren't ""doing method"" or aping the authenticity of previous greats. They're 100% the real deal, so good you can only compare them to the best, and they fully embody these characters in every frame. They made me believe, they made me care, they broke my heart.The story is a familiar one because it's the most common source of drama in life and art but avoids cliché and instead handles the subject with uncommon insight and grace. The lack of context scene-to-scene keeps the audience engaged and on their feet, filling in the intentional holes with their own experience and lending the film a universal relatability. In good times and bad, we can recognize our own triumphs and failures in love. It captures the joyous highs and devastating lows of relationships better than anything I can recall. Gosling singing while Williams tap dances, what she reveals to Gosling on the bridge and how he reacts, the scene in the doctor's office towards the end... they achieve that sense of cinematic transcendence so rare these days. They simply don't craft scenes like this or give actors roles this fully realized in Hollywood anymore.It's clear this was a labor of love for all involved and it paid off in spades. This is the best American film I've seen this year.",Blue Valentine
280,michaelhasenstab,Love is a Bore,5,13 November 2010,"Throughout this film about a failing marriage, I wanted one question to be answered: What was the problem? Here we have a funny, loving, childlike guy married to an unhappy woman. Seems she gave up her medical career because she became pregnant before they married. Hmmm...since when does this thwart an entire career? It ain't the 50s anymore. We see through flashbacks that they were very much in love, but we do not get to know why she, not he, becomes dissatisfied with the relationship. We are expected to believe that this is how most relationships dissolve? For no particular reason, just a blah feeling about it all. This film needs a half hour of editing and a much faster pace. The dialogue is flat, and the much hyped sexually explicit scenes may be just that for prime time network TV, but not for me. I didn't see sexually explicit at all here. I asked audience members around me--all women--what her problem was. Three said that it wasn't clear to them why she was no longer in love. One suggested it was probably because he smokes. Another because he drinks. Another because he is immature. Hmmm...Then I asked (bothered it seemed) two other moviegoers, again women, and they looked at me puzzled. When I asked her what the wife's problem was, she said, ""You mean--what caused her problems?"" Uhm...yeah. The other said, ""Life."" And they both left. This film is not satisfying emotionally or intellectually. And it's a bore, too. When the female protagonist says that she has two children, implying that one of them is her husband, I thought--could be this is her issue then. Lame, just lame. The guy clearly loves her and their daughter, and he is clearly childlike, not childish--in fact, is is she who seems childish and selfish. Writers: be clear.",Blue Valentine
281,intense_life,drift along to the very real depiction of the moods of marriage,8,25 August 2014,"One of those films where the mood and intensity takes center stage, and I cannot remember much else despite having watched it last evening. Past scenes intertwine with the present. The resentment (on her part) between a married couple with a kid, further manifest itself on their weekend away to a hotel room aptly named future. She rejected him repeatedly in the shower scenes and in the end, he rejected having sex with just her body. It was as if alcohol was necessary to remove the distance between them, to stand being alone with him. Their happier times in the past have faded into this, the audience do not know how, it just had happened. A very real movie. Back from the weekend, it finally escalated to a full blown outbursts by him at her workplace and she screaming for a divorce. With a vague ending of her needing space. The acting was not particularly memorable...the actress could be better casted as some moody and antsy teenager with mental demons. It is a movie to drift along to its mood, not one for plot nor characters.",Blue Valentine
282,ShahabSabzi,I can say this movie is better than some high-considered ones like Revolutionally Road or recently's Rabbit Hole.,8,6 February 2011,"I remember a friend who used to say ""never promise you will love someone forever."" At that moment I didn't realize what he is saying because I never was in the situation, but now, after watching ---'s Blue Valentine I am believed in the words my friends always said. The best work the movie does is proving that life isn't always the same and everything may happen and everything can change someday so you can't count on anything permanently. This dramatic romance puts you right in middle of everything. There is a young couple who seem to live happily together with their little daughter, but then some little happenings which seem to be ordinary make big changes in their relationship and cause something you don't expect. Every steps are taken gradually between them in the script and each step make another hole in their relationship. That's what the movie does. Presenting problems, how they consider these problems and at last revealing consequences. Fortunately these three levels are linked together in the best way, so you can accept what's happening between them as a matter of fact, but not anticipate them. The movie is honest enough in presenting the rough scenes and I admire that. As I said you can accept what happening between them, and sex scenes are included. I'm totally sure --- and --- has presented their best performance of the life in this movie which make everything more serious. There are a bunch of evoking scenes, including the illustrious performance of --- which I bet make you feel him as a real person who is really facing these problems. I'm not going to say Blue Valentine is the best movie of its type or something like that, but basically it's done very well enough in every ways as I can say this movie is better than some high-considered ones like Revolutionally Road or recently's Rabbit Hole.",Blue Valentine
283,Ioannis111,We don't need any more (sexist) movies like this one,7,26 January 2011,"7/10 It seems cool nowadays to ""analyze"" divorce, especially in such a way that women are defended. The movie does not avoid the clichés surrounding this ""analysis."" The man comes to be the bad guy, even though the beginnings of the story show clearly that he has a golden heart. The woman is selfish and immature throughout the whole movie (at one point we are toldt that she has slept with more than 25 men!!!), but she is the one who takes the decision for divorce. Why? Who gave her this right? The movie does not explain. The acting is amazing, that's why the movie takes a 7 from me. The editing is also very good and the story is realistic. But realistic in the sense of describing a possible state of affairs, not in the sense that it discloses the reality of broken marriage. I expected the director to give more emphasis on the oppressing, annoying and other-destructive character of the female protagonist. Why did the husband start behaving badly? What did she do to him? This, for me, is the great lacuna of the movie: it is not shown clearly that the woman is the real cause of the downfall of this marriage.",Blue Valentine
284,pugnose,This movie to me is about making you think,7,15 May 2011,"It isn't about who is right and wrong and not having enough information in the movie -- it is about making you think. I think Cindy's behavior is right on. She doesn't love him anymore is why she acts the way she does. She can't laugh and play and discuss because she doesn't want to do these things with HIM. She just doesn't care. In my life I've seen more than one marriage and been in relationships that have ended this way. I notice too with the dog situation he didn't comfort her, he just said that you shouldn't have left the gate open. This movie is not as empty as some people think it is. I think it is sadly very right on. I also think the actors gave it everything that they had.",Blue Valentine
285,anelena89,"Sad movie, good movie",7,23 August 2012,"I will start by saying that I think this is a good movie. I loved the direction, the way scenes were shot and the actors - both of them superb in their roles as a couple that spends their last Valentine's day together. What I didn't really like so much is probably the storyline, which in my opinion lacks of reasons to leave you so sad in the end. Because that's what this movie does, it makes you really sad, and the worst thing is there's nothing to blame - no-one dies, no-one cheats, no-one becomes insanely violent or anything. They just go from being an happy couple to being estranged to each other - and we don't get to know why, because the storyline just covers the beginning and the end of their relationship. The reason why I didn't enjoy this movie so much is probably there: it's even too real to be true - in real life a lot of people break up with no particular reason except the lack of love, of that sparkle that made it all start. Although I think the goal of the director was not to make the viewers empathize with one or the other of the character, but just to watch them drift apart, I couldn't help but feel that Michelle Williams' character lacked in common sense sometimes - and made the whole ""breaking up is probably the right choice"" thing seem a little one-sided, with Ryan Gosling character left there to be a caring father who still wants to fight for their relationship but keeps on meeting his wife's rejection. We do know that the said loving father is a drinker, but we don't get to know why he started drinking, and how is this problem affecting the relationship, since he seems to be always there for his wife and especially for his daughter, who he absolutely adores. On the other hand, we can understand the frustration of a hard-working woman who married a guy that could have done much more with his life than painting walls - and she obviously regrets it, while he doesn't seem to mind.While writing this review I'm actually changing my mind towards the film. I already went from a 6 to a 7, and it might come up to an 8 at some point. It takes some time, though, to ""digest"" all this couple's issues and to come to terms with their breakup, because it's not something that you'd wish for since the beginning, nor something that could be solved in time - basically, as real-life love can be: extremely, utterly sad.",Blue Valentine

Michelle Williams and her chemistry with Gosling is incredible. Brilliant screenplay and a different kinda directing by Derek Cianfrance , he's telling a beautiful tale. Every scene from this movie is memorable, starting from Dean's daughter's singing and up until Dean and Cindy search for his ring. Therefore I can tell that, This is a complete movie.

It's sad that it has got NC-17.""Girls spend their whole life looking for Prince Charming and then they marry the guy who's got a good job and is gonna stick around."" How true.Unlike other movies, this tells how easy it is to fall in love and how tough is to maintain the relationship . It deals with the things happening in the real life instead of some superheroes saving Earth from aliens and i think that's what matters.

287,isakregal,''You Always Hurt The Ones You Love'',7,24 May 2013,"Blue Valentine is a 2010 Drama film which circles around the lives of Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams). The film explores their relationship as it was when they were young and madly in love, and then jumps to an agonizing time when they are in their mid- thirties, have a daughter and the sparkle in their marriage has faded.This is a very mumble-core film, set up in a way where the audience is following the lives of two people without their love and dissent for each other glamorized, but displaying a melancholy and truthful dialog. It's an independent film and people live and interact with each other just as you'd expect your neighbors and friends to (regarding sex, love and resentment etc). The film portrays the difficulties of being a working-class married couple in America. The movie doesn't have a very complicated plot nor is there anything genius about the story line, but it can be enjoyed for what it is, which is a character study of these people and what it is to be trapped in a difficult marriage where both partners are trying to make it work for their child and themselves.The performances are excellent. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are absolutely flawless in this film, their relationship is believable and honest. The have great chemistry and they really are perfectly cast, some scenes were improvised and you get a picture of just how good these actors really are. The dialog: It does go a bit over the- op when they're arguing but I think that in most of those scenes it was mostly improvised and there wasn't any dialog written. Overall it displays the relationship that these two people have.The cinematography: Really great angles showing every aspect of the environment and beautiful scenes through-out the entire movie. It really goes deep into the working-class areas of New York, showing places in Brooklyn that you usually don't see in movies, for example there are no shots of people standing in the middle of Times Square with neon signs everywhere.The performances and the perception of these real-life type of situations are the main appeal for this movie. If you are into romantic drama, and films like the Notebook for example I'd recommend you check this one out.",Blue Valentine

I saw this movie shortly after it came out on DVD, and have probably watched 10 time since.I don't think I have ever seen such a realistic motion picture. The dialogue deserves much respect for taking the risk of being boring to achieve such a sense of realism.Ryan Gosling easily takes this movie as his best performance. He doesn't do the whole ""stone-face-no-emotion"" look he seems to be doing lately. I can tell he really got into this role - same with Michelle Williams. Oh yeah, get ready for Michelle to be a total brat in this one.Derek Cianfrance is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. I think Place Beyond the Pines sealed him in my top three.

Love can be filled with hatred. Love can express jealousy. It's a strong feeling, so why wouldn't it arise other strong emotions?Blue Valentine represents realisticly a failing relationship.

290,adeck14,the falling out of love story,9,16 April 2013,"WARNING: this review may contain spoilers First and foremost, Michelle Williams is one of the greatest actresses of all time! Her acting in this film has to be one of the best in film history. But, she probably won't receive that much recognition for it because this isn't exactly a mainstream film. I would call this film a hidden treasure.This story is more of a falling out of love story more so than a love story. Unfortunately, I would say this storyline rings true in a lot of marriages. The film begins at the start of their marriage's dissolution. The problems in the marriage are slowly revealed to us, starting with Cindy's (portrayed by Michelle Williams) rather miserable demeanor in the beginning. You can tell that she is annoyed by Dean: he is childish, unambitious, and badgering. The movie tells their love story through flashbacks. These flashbacks reveal that Cindy and Dead are no longer the same person as they were when they first met: Cindy was free spirited, quirky, and on the path to college and becoming very successful; Dean was a romantic, working day to day to make ends meet. Dean seemed to have no real plans for the future until he met Cindy. Dean saw Cindy as his future while Cindy saw Dean as stimulating. His quirkiness seems to match with hers and perhaps over time Cindy would have loved Dean the way he loves her, but that determination is up to you. Instead, she gets pregnant and getting married just seems like the next step. Dean didn't have a future to ruin, Cindy did.It becomes clear that Cindy and Dean are no longer the people they once were. Cindy resents Dean for being so simplistic and being okay with it. I like that the movie is not your typical, happy ending love story. It is realistic in the sense that love changes over time, just as people change over time. People who were right for each other at one point are no longer so. It is sad to think about how many marriages end this way and how many children are affected my divorce.The movie is packed with very touching moments between Cindy and Dean. The superb acting by both Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling makes this a very emotional movie to watch. I can't say that you end the movie feeling good. It's definitely a downer, but for the movie buffs, this movie has got a lot to offer. It has a brilliant script, award-winning acting, emotion, and depth. I would put this one on your must-see list.",Blue Valentine
291,Sagiepoo99,An uncomfortably intense story of two extremely unhealthy people,6,29 March 2021,The acting is fantastic. The story is tragically relatable to every human being. Both characters were desperate for some sort of love/safety in both the earlier and later parts of the movie. Great parallels. Ryan Gosling will always blow me away with the general charisma he seems to have with the elderly and the young.,Blue Valentine
292,anupsoren-49249,realistic contemporary intense devastating romantic drama,8,20 October 2017,"It is a raw realistic contemporary intense devastating romantic drama. It adeptly shows the mysteriousness of falling in love and getting separated. The movie dances between the past and present brilliantly portraying the two aspects. It shows how easily promises can be made against all odds and similarly how easily they can be broken despite trying so hard. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams have done a good job in portraying two lovers as two different personalities in two different situations and time period. Director does a good job in putting together a good story in a realistic environment. The cinematography has been kept deliberately simple and realistic due to to the tone and style of the movie. Music is average and does not add a lot to the movie. The movie is a realistic romantic drama and viewers who have gotten used to enjoying typical feel good happy ending movies will not like it. The movie works at different levels and makes you think after you've finished watching it. It builds up an atmosphere of confusion, helplessness, frustration and finally devastation very effectively and thus leaves you pondering after the movie. The movie is recommended for viewers who like watching realistic drama and would like to watch how the two aspects of the falling and breaking in love commences, propagates and culminates.",Blue Valentine
293,FilmWatchingHumanoid,"Real, relatable, and so sad",8,16 February 2020,"This film documents a relationship in its death throes, and rewinds to show us how it got there. The two leads are both excellent in their roles--he's an immature idealist, she's an overworked young mother--and I couldn't help but sympathize with them both. A relationship built not on shared aspiration, but rather on shared loneliness, is doomed to fail when the two people in question begin to realize that their realities no longer coincide.",Blue Valentine
294,atticismic,The Antidote to all those Hollywood love stories,8,8 January 2011,"Sometimes, the truth hurts. Blue Valentine is an honest portrayal of the way most love stories go- it is pure in that the characters are seen walking in the street beside you. You yourself have been in this love story, or have known someone who has and you have witnessed this marriage fall apart this way, by these people. The director got it all right. He got every gut wrenching visceral emotion and squeezed every ounce of disgust out of this gruesomely realistic portrait. It's the worst horror movie you've ever seen because it's what people willingly put themselves and each other through every day. It's not sped-up, it's not hokey, and sometimes it's so unbearable cliché, so unbearable painful that you wonder when to start laughing to keep from crying.I know I'm not supposed to be opinionated in film reviews in order to sound unbiased and civilly objective, but this movie is going to hit close to home with anyone who sees it. If it doesn't, you just don't get it. And you'll think the entire movie is about nothing- the rise and fall of a relationship, a chest rising and falling after inhale and exhale- but it takes a wee bit of EQ, some social experience, and digging up old feelings to recognize the disappointment, stagnancy, bitterness and total disillusionment that's all the worse because maybe you've been there and been deeper before. It's all of this past experience and deep-seeded unearthing that makes a film like this a prime target for those looking to project. Though even the director says himself that he's providing no answers here- who's right?, who's wrong?- most people will probably decide based on their pre-conceived prejudices. What do you hate worse- adultery or drunkards? Irresponsible parents or workaholics? word- retching arguers or contemptuous silence? Denial? The one who gives up first? The man with the first word or the last laugh? It's probably the more ""adult"" thing to say that in the end, it's nobody's fault. Well, that's not really true either. The real world sucks, don't it? The angry immature men and self-hating women will be stuck on 'but she promised."" The defensive women and any man who went through the Oediopal complex will swear up and down she did the best thing for herself and the child. But to be fair, the writer meant for it to be a hard decision, but with the way in which Michelle plays her character- that is, honestly and pure heartedly- some of the scenes and lines which could have been meant to demonize her come out soft and tender. Ryan's character, on the other hand, was impossible to play softer and his character spirals into sorry pile of crap under his wife's shoe. You know how they say sometimes the cure is worse than the disease? If this movie is the cure, then it's totally worth it not to fall into the disease. Yes, it's painful. It hurts to watch, to think about later. But it outlines the pitfalls, In contrast to Revolutionary Road, another accurate portrayal of archetypal characters in a marriage we can each see ourselves in, this story doesn't end with a huge emotional climax suddenly made physical- maybe because it's a story of a different era, a different realization and a different expression where now everything is so opened and exploited and blended and stale beyond the point that at its starkness our vision actually grimes with the patina of over-used ""miscommunication""- like the difference between a plastic suburban nowheresville at 2 AM with a full moon in January and waiting for the ferry back to Long Island after the last bar has closed on the same night. Okay, now that sounds like a pretentious cryptic movie review. Point is, every long term relationship will get to this point. Some survive it, some don't. The unanswered question- Is it worth it? Watch the movie and decide for yourself.",Blue Valentine
295,mostconvenient,This is an abusive relationship,7,25 May 2011,"I apparently came away from this film feeling quite differently than others which is more disturbing to me than the movie itself.I thought this film would be about the breakdown of a happy relationship. Instead, I think it's about a dysfunctional relationship that gets worse with time.The signs were there right from the beginning. Dean is kind of pushy when trying to find Cindi and he is manipulative when he climbs over the railing on the bridge to get her to tell him what's wrong. Cindi has never had a good relationship with men. Her father has anger issues and the only other boyfriend we see becomes stalkerish and violent when she rebuffs him. So, in comparison, Dean is a sweetheart.But he's not supportive of her becoming a doctor (he thinks school is stupid). He picks out a song for them instead of them picking one together. Everything in the relationship, he has to have control over. Later on, when he makes the hotel reservations, I give him credit for trying to be romantic. But it's just a symptom of his controlling the relationship that he gets the room even though she says no because she's on call. He's always grabbing at her, holding her when she doesn't want to be held, and almost forces himself on her when they're drunk.Now, I give him props for staying with her and raising the kid. He's a good father. Also, you can see where his neediness came from: his parents' divorce. Cindi does seem to have given up on the relationship already and she's pretty messed up, as well: telling him to hit her, telling him she's the ""man"". But to me, these could have been symptoms of an abused wife. When he comes to the clinic drunk, the other nurse is very protective of Cindi and that was telling. Dean never respects her wishes, never leaves her alone, never gives her space, never listens to what she's actually saying. I think it counts as abusive; it's definitely dysfunctional.I was happy they were getting divorced though it's sad for their kid.I thought it was a really well done movie and beautifully acted but I think I took something markedly different away from it. I wonder what the director thinks. I hope he doesn't think it's about true love.",Blue Valentine
296,abutvinik,Lots missing,6,23 May 2011,I was looking forward to seeing Blue Valentine.The acting was superb but there were many gaps in the plot line.We saw the beginning of the relationship and the painful end.ONLY. I wondered how the couple got to that point.In the beginning Dean was portrayed as a very loving man.The man at the end of the movie was quite different.I imagined that he became that way because Cindy was never invested in the relationship as much as he was-but I am just guessing.I really did not like her character.I wish she had been more honest with her self from the start.She wanted a better education and a distinguished career.I guess this is the kind of movie that you have to piece things together for yourself.It was not as good as I had expected to be.,Blue Valentine

298,fatboyslim31182,Great look at modern relationships,10,16 May 2011,"Beautiful and tragic...the common saying for most modern relationships. I swear this movie hit home directly with everything. The fact that the young couple met at a retirement home is just genius. Sweet and endearing but what it really showed was that even when life is ending there is a beginning. Starting a relationship in an assisted living home is a bold/brilliant move. That was totally awesome and ironic for this movie. This was a great film because it demonstrated how wonderful the beginning in a relationship can be but also told us the story of the possible downfall, a destined to fail relationship. The resentment factor is deff attached to almost every relationship now a days. The fear factor is too high and is a major cause of relationship failure. Life sucks and this movie proves it, but also shows that even though the end result might not be what you expect, the journey there might actually be worth the disappointment. I feel this is a film that most young adults should watch in order to see how spontaneous relationships might work in a negative way, however you should still always remain hopeful that things will be everything they ever hoped it will be. It's a leap of faith no matter how you look at it. Falling in love is great...but everyone knows that when you fall you always get hurt...",Blue Valentine

I even give ""Best of me"" a solid 8/10 because its nice.But this one, a very simple story line being dragged for 2 hours, gosh, I was looking at the clock and hoping it would finish asap.This movie is boring, but I see some good acting inside. I personally don't care too much about acting, as long as I know what they r acting about.

I have noticed that any movie with a rating above 6 at IMDb is usually of at least average quality, and movies with ratings of 8ish tend to be really good. I really went forward with a lot of expectations due to the high ratings and reviews by people at IMDb, but this movie rating by IMDb community definitely ran an exception.I watched more half of the movie last night and gave up cause I thought it was awful. Why such an awful review by me? It is the slowest moving movie I have ever watched. It seemed like it will never reach a climax, ever. The scenes and stories seem to drag on forever and the dialogues were flat. I couldn't sit through the rest of the movie, and lost patience half way through. The movie can probably run a snail race for sure. And if you are expecting a romantic film due to its name, don't be fooled either. It's a lose-lose situation.",Blue Valentine
301,ajflick,"Good acting, weak directing",5,16 February 2010,"I saw this film at Sundance 2010. Great performance from Ryan Gosling (especially) and Michelle Williams.Biggest flaw is that although the director said at the screening that he went back and forth himself feeling sympathy for the two main characters, I and many other women at the screening felt NO sympathy for Williams' character. Her character seems to use and discard men for no good reason.Also, the director said he was inspired by the second ""Godfather"" movie for creating parallel story lines separated in time. However, the contrasts in the flashbacks and contemporary story lines aren't drastic enough. It made the flashbacks too confusing. If you spend time in a film saying, ""Wait, what's this right here?,"" which I found myself doing several times, there's something wrong. ""Oh, so when Gosling's character has glasses, that means it's a flashback?"" There wasn't a great enough time span between the flashbacks and the flashforwards to be coherent.",Blue Valentine
302,rockinrio_1,A Beautiful Movie!,7,21 January 2011,"I saw Blue Valentine last night and it's still in my head today. It is, truly, a beautiful film! Brilliant performances by both Gosling and Williams combined with the skillful cinematography make this movie well worth a watch! The story is flawed, slightly cliché'd, but is fluent throughout. However, the story is not an issue while you're watching it, the script is solid, the performances are terrific and both are consistent throughout. The scene which has received a lot of attention (where Williams dances while Gosling plays a ukulele) is genuinely sweet, and i smiled uncontrollably until my cheeks were sore. It makes a powerful contrast between later scenes, such as the one in the hospital, and the directors idea of having the actors live together for a few weeks really shows through in the later scenes. it's sweet, it's sad, and it's beautiful. I wouldn't hold my breath for awards as these types of films tend to be overlooked at award season, but i would recommend it to all, except for young couples at the start of their relationships.7/10",Blue Valentine
303,bilgepredator,Irritating,4,30 January 2011,"While this film has some good things to recommend it that other reviewers have enumerated very well, what stays with me is the very beginning and the very end.At the start, we see youngest family member, well played by Faith Wladyka and by far the most unknown yet likable character in the whole thing, calling vainly for her dog – the cut to the empty rocking horse confirmed my immediate instinct that the call would never be answered.At the end, we see the youngest family member, calling vainly for her father, (or the man she has lived her life calling father), to come back. Of course, he doesn't do so eitherthis is a Serious Film, after all.In between, about the only other glimpse we get about the first loss, (other than a view through the window of Mr. Gosling's spasm of tears and then his watching a home movie of his daughter with her dog), is the apparent acceptance by the child of her father's glib comment that the animal, ""went to Hollywood to be a movie dog."" This is a Realistic Movie.I realize the first third or so of the film is driven by the death of the dog: from Ms. Williams' unpleasant roadside discovery to the improvised storage of their daughter at her grandfather's to allow the burial to Mr. Gosling's need to use his gift certificate to get away that evening to go to the most hideous, claustrophobic sleeping apartment ever committed to celluloid. (Mr. Gosling's pointed selection of ""The Future"" and a glance into that chamber of horrors was more than enough information to know how the movie & the marriage would end.) I also appreciate Mr. Cianfrance's limiting the representation of the creature to a there-and-gone flicker on a television screen even though its influence on the actions of the characters is substantial; the theme that much of life is reaction to events beyond our control and so we muddle along as best we can runs through the movie. There is potential here.But the child is a merely a plot device, from conception to zygote and beyond - positioned when and as needed and then swept off - and frankly I can neither like nor care about the parents when the script so indulges their grief but can't be bothered to make a token gesture to their responsibility to help their child with such a loss. The only thing these people are inconvenienced by are their own concerns: Mr. Gosling's character thinks nothing of puffing in his daughter's face on his ubiquitous cigarettes but this behavior isn't one of the multiple complaints the girl's mother directs toward him.(And I must add, the impression I had, perhaps wrongly, was that the filmmakers used this smoking thing to indicate socioeconomic status or lend it verisimilitude and it irked me. In the US it seemed most people quit very shortly after there was a candid release of data: intelligence, responsibility and common sense – and love of one's kids - are distributed pretty evenly among human beings regardless of trivial differences like the color of a collar.) This relentless self-absorption is characteristic of the adult characters – all of them.except perhaps the old gentleman deposited in a nursing home near the start since he needed to do nothing but be another cipher, sit still and allow Mr. Gosling's character to pound us on the head with a demonstration of his own decency.Nope. Sorry. Some artistic production values and good performances but mostly blatant, irritating emotional manipulation without anything of much substance.On another note: the IMDb trivia remarks that filming was scheduled for 2008 but delayed out of respect for Ms. Williams's loss at that time as opposed to finding another actress. No disrespect intended toward this generous act, but both Ms. Williams and Mr. Gosling are featured prominently in the closing credits as executive producers, so it may be the chances that a replacement would have been cast are very small.",Blue Valentine

Imagine my surprise, when there is about about 10 minutes of ""happiness"" in this entire movie, and 100 minutes of the main character getting squashed (emotionally or physically.) Ryan Gossling's acting was great...don't get me wrong. But if you want to watch 2 hours of a movie not really telling you anything new, and you ultimately feeling much worse than when you started...here's your flick !!

306,buenosdiasmel,Lousy,1,22 September 2011,"Well, I have to say that this is the worst romantic-drama movie I have ever seen. The characters are not developed (over all the husband's psychology). The script is weak, they show you a relationship that is ending and you can see clearly why love ends. After you watch it you have nothing truly insightful, just more of the same. Another girl was commenting that the couple knew their relationship did not work, and there is a point of crisis moment when everything ends and that this is the main thing about the movie... Geez, how do I say this? The crisis (or the entire film)was awful, not worthy, not touching, not heart wrenching. It was pitiful. Don't you think life has enough crisis moments from which we want to escape going to the movies at least? And at the movies what do we see? More of the same with ""Blue Valentine"". By other meanings, I think it should be called ""Porn Valentine"". There is just sex scenes, after sex scenes. The direction is quite bad, I mean, they could have implied the message of these scenes in some other way. I think they wanted to do something like ""Revolutionary road"" (which is an amazing movie)and they just got a lot of ugly sex sequences without a truly deep romantic message as the foreground of the film. The main characters were just a pair of persons doing things they really didn't want to do, which is our daily bread, but without an impact message, without that feeling that makes you have a true insight about love and life. ""Revolucionary road"" achieves this indeed, but Blue Valentine is mediocre in comparison, and in my personal opinion. I really, REALLY can't understand why this movie was nominated for an Oscar. The acting was fine, but it didn't deserve a nomination. I'm sorry but I don't understand, why do they put Michelle Williams and Natalie Portman in the same scale?",Blue Valentine

It seems that happily ever after is what we aim for in movies and in real life. But no one told us how Cinderella and Prince Charming dealt with day-to-day problems after they got married or how Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy lived the rest of their lives in Pemberley. I really liked how the storyline went back and forth from present to past and back to the present again giving us an idea of how Cindy and Dean's love evolved. Usually when we see messed-up relationships in movies we get this idea that the characters were ALWAYS like this: constantly fighting, declaring war between each other. In this case we get the whole perspective, knowing that there was a beautiful beginning but not that good of an ending. I don't want to give away anymore so I'll just say I highly recommend it.

Her dad wakes from his slumber on the couch, while mum sleep in the bed, and ventures outside realising the family pooch is long gone. This event sets off a chain reaction which forces this couple to re-evaluate their marriage and try to rekindle the affection they have lost.Dean (Ryan Gosling) is a house painter who likes a beer at 8 in the morning, his wife Cindy (Michelle Williams) works long hours as a nurse. Their daughter, Frankie (Faith Wladyka) is the only positive thing gelling their fragile relationship together. Some how husband and wife have grown apart, fallen out of love, become burnt out, call it what you like. Dean, the ever optimist, has a plan though. A night of passion at a run down motel where Cindy half heartily agrees, just to get out of the house. It is within this cramped and claustrophobic room where the cracks within their relationship are highlighted. Dean needs physical touch, Cindy doesn't want to be close. Cindy wants communication, Dean is emotionally stunted. The film is also interspersed with flash backs of a happier couple with plenty of passionate sex going on. All of the flash backs focus on the beginning of their relationship, when the passion is usually the emphasis. The hard work begins when the passion subsides and one has to deal with what's left, which for some is a shallow foundation for a solid relationship. The film took over 11 years to get green lighted, where Williams came on board in 2003 and Gosling came later in 2005. As director and co-writer Derek Cianfrance says, ""I was thankful for the time that I was forced to wait. The film is better for it."" Gosling and Williams are impressive, (both now nominated for Golden Globes), capturing the empty marriage perfectly, which leaves them trapped and suffocated. Only problem is Cindy realises the situation while Dean doesn't want to. Blue Valentine isn't pretty at times, with a rawness and a hard look at the human condition - along with controversial sex scenes, but it has funny moments too, with Dean's goofy charm. Apart from the 'older' Dean looking a lot like Earl, from 'My Name is Earl', Blue Valentine is a carefully crafted, where you feel for both characters, somehow hoping they can make it work.Australian release December 26.Blue Valentine 2010Director: Derek Cianfrance.

My focus is the acting that has been so heralded. I don't know why. All I see is two actors badly improvising. Michelle Williams in particular (nominated for an Oscar!!??) seems completely out of her depth. You can see the actress (not the character) desperately trying to think of something to say and ending up just repeating the same phrase over and over until even the director gets bored and says cut. Why do people fall for this and think it is natural and intense. It isn't. It is an insult to the crafts of acting and script writing. As for the rest of the film, it has nothing to say that other films haven't said much better and would probably be depressing if it wasn't so dull.",Blue Valentine
316,toddamerica,Must see movie with flawless performances,10,11 February 2011,"What an amazing movie! I saw this movie 4 days ago and it is still stuck in my head as to how realistic, flawless performances, and how you want the characters to succeed no matter how difficult their life is. The beginning of the movie shows how Dean (Ryan Gosling) is as a father and person. As a father and husband who has never been divorced myself, it is very easy to relate to this character or to know someone who fits Dean's profile. The most effective parts of the movie are that it was filmed in 2003 with a much younger Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling. The transitions to the past and present quickly will help develop a sense of compassion for the characters and film that I have never felt before. The director did an amazing job that I have never witnessed before which is to show earlier footage of two young lovers who you see are deeply in love (2003 footage-Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams). The footage of the past is so appealing to the eyes that it really makes the audience fall in love with the characters.The middle of the movie really shows the present as to how the two lovers have fallen out of love mostly by Cindy (Michelle Williams) and how Dean really wants the marriage to succeed, but just doesn't know how. The scene in which they go to the hotel is the one that stands out the most to me because it shows that nothing is like it was before. Cindy asks Dean why he never progressed in his career when he is so good at everything he does. At this moment, the film really becomes an American classic and helps ask the question as to whether or not that is the real reason that Cindy can't accept Dean anymore. Dean profoundly disagrees and says that he loves what he does and that his real love is his daughter and being a husband. He states that he does what he does to spend as much time with his little girl Frankie and Cindy as much as possible and just as he tries to make them happy, he knows he paints people's houses and makes them very happy. Dean is stuck in the past, but there is so much sympathy for him that that really is the part that audiences will always have stuck in their head. Also, the music in the hotel room really helps to show the mood of Dean in the room. He wants the romance to last forever. His heart is on his sleeve,but only for Cindy and for his little girl. He really doesn't care about anyone else.Most people will have the final scenes stuck in their head as well. But, the transitions back and forth to the present along with the ending will break a person's heart. It really is a sad movie, but it is a very necessary movie to show how the dangers of a bad relationship can destroy two lovers and a child. I don't think that there is one thing that causes the relationship to go sour. I think it is a build up. But, the sadness is magnified up on screen because married people realize that this sadness can happen in any marriage in real life. The biggest question that this movie asks is ""Why does love end? And how can two people who are so much in love one day stop being in love or stop loving each other?"" This movie will be talked about by many once they see it for several days. The scenes are very realistic, performances are superb, and people will fall in love with the characters.",Blue Valentine
317,dimitriasimov,"Overall, a poorly made movie.",2,28 April 2020,"I never knew why this movie was so appreciated, why people always said ""it is so realistic"". There are so many contradictions in this movie.I've seen quite the romantic movies, but this one was by far the worst one, made me think that it was made by a frustrated woman (and don't get me wrong, she has all the rights to be frustrated, at least in this movie).The premise begins with Cindy getting laid with some boy from high school. Right. She gets pregnant. Dean stays by her side even though it wasn't his child, and eventually becomes a degenerate as years pass. A dad that would do anything just to be a good parent for his little daughter, although this statement is completely false. He usually tends to be aggressive or just toxic.I don't even know why would you state so proudly ""I'm doing my best for my kid and you"", when in reality you just chose to walk away at the end, you don't get a proper job, waste your talent and so on. Like, girl, from all the mans around the globe you were choosing a jackass, really?I saw no motivation whatsoever from Dean, things were rushed so damn hard, let's say it was about 5-6 years after the incident, and yet the characters just look way too older, especially Cindy's father and Dean. Lots of - points for the realism. Cindy's and Dean's story wasn't true love, it was just a big failure. At the very least, if Dean would've truly loved his daughter or the woman of his life, he would have done something about it.I will give 2 stars for the cross-cut between time periods. Was really well made.",Blue Valentine

Gosling's looks after only 5/6 years at most? The sunglasses all the time? At first it looks like had happened at least 15 years. Then we learn that they got married when she was already pregnant so...hat happened to his appearance! Come on. Too much change for a few year. Not believable, along with wearing the sunglasses inside and at night.
We can only assume that they don't get along and are tired of each other, but the last final fight is out of nowhere. We are not explained what is going on and why the relationship is so damaged. We can only assume typical couples problems, and that's not reason enough for a film.

320,sns106,"Too long, what happened?",3,3 May 2011,"My favorite movie reviewer is James B. If he gives a movie three stars (out of four) the odds are very good that I'll have a satisfying viewing experience. He actually gave this dog 3.5! I've never differed with him so much. If this story had been told chronologically, it would have been excruciatingly obvious that this marriage wasn't going to work out. It's as if the movie makers cut up the story board and shuffled it like a deck of cards. We find out only well into this bore that she wanted to be a doctor while he was a high school dropout and and made no bones about it. He marries her even though another guy just knocked her up. For the first half of the movie I thought she was just an impossible person; in the second half we are given a crumb as to why - he drinks in the morning and lacks ambition. And that's it. The only charming pleasant scene in the whole movie is in the trailer, him playing the ukulele and singing, but we are given precious little more to convince us they should fall in love. In fact, we're given no reason why she broke up with the previous guy, except that he came inside her and that she would never speak to him again. Everything is too sketchy. What were the things that happened along the way to make them so miserable? Instead of a storyline, we get awkwardly timed flashbacks and long, lugubrious scenes of them being miserable together. My wife and I have been married (happily) less than two years and thought this movie might provide some food for thought, things to watch out for, but this movie gives nothing of the sort.

Brilliantly written and performed. <<* Sort of a Spoiler *>> I usually always demand a happy ending for movies because I feel that movies are a escape from reality and I have enough disappointment in life that I want the movies I watch to give me hope. This film is the only exception. The ending was real, raw, deep, emotional and I appreciate someone being courageous enough to show it.

323,vincent-270,You Always Hurt the Ones You Love,9,2 February 2011,"Blue Valentine, as the title suggests is full of contradictions. What is love, It is playing a little song while watching your beloved one dance, it is holding someone so tight you can't even hear their muffled cries. Dean and Cindy's story goes from a point where it all seems promising, exciting, unexpected to a shrinking world that grows smaller and smaller room by room so no one can get away. It is movie hard to watch. Endless arguments with robotic repetition of swearing in contrast with the sweetness of the family makes it so heart-wrenching and unsetting. Dean's love toward Cindy is indecisively unrequested by the time when there is no passion in their marriage yet Dean keeps pushing and pushing the limit wanting to impose more and more affection on Cindy, who finally converts the love into pressure. The song foreshadows Dean's tragic end and makes him such a likable character so that his impulsive deeds will all be forgiven because he is the one who's got hurt. I whole-heartedly love this movie though I'm only 19 and for many reasons I'm not qualified to judge marriage, but i truly think if you love someone, give her/him some more space to breathe",Blue Valentine
324,TheSofaKing,Gosling going from strength to strength,8,11 May 2013,"After watching The Place Beyond the Pines I've felt it necessary to have a little bit of a Gosling film frenzy, and I am still yet to watch a film of his I haven't enjoyed. Blue Valentine is no different. Directed and written by Derek Cianfrance, it is a film which portrays a relationship between Dean (Gosling) a high school dropout, and Cindy (Williams) a doctor, as it descends from the promising 'potential' the relationship has to a distant, rather depressing comparison to what they once had.The acting can't be faulted, and this is telling in both Gosling and Williams' chemistry as the film is presented in a non-linear manner, juxtaposing the past with the present, allowing the viewer to directly compare and acknowledge how their relationship has deteriorated. This is blatantly present when a scene showing them embracing each other as they prepare to begin a family is immediately followed by a blue-tinted, dull, desolate dinner in a motel as they desperately attempt to give the relationship some sort of kick.The power of the film lies in the reality of the situation itself, as the increase in the divorce rate in most places of the world signifying the relevance the film may bear for many, to emphasise the true fragility of the usual marriage dictums that promote foreverness. It's a film that'll force you to be pensive, and it's strengthened by a powerful score in snippets of Grizzly Bear's album Veckatimest.",Blue Valentine

In the final scene when the wife is telling the husband that it's over and she can't stay in this marriage any longer, you're hoping that he will be able to convince her to stay. It seems she finally acquiesces. We think they're going to keep trying to make it work. Then we see him say good-bye to his daughter and walk off. I was kind of irritated by this ending. It was dissonant like a final minor chord in a film score. I wanted some resolution which I didn't get.

Although it should be assumed from the trailer itself that this is a more realistic look on love and marriage, I fear a lot of people will not understand nor appreciate the depth of what this movie has to over. The spiraling love story between Dean and Cindy is a heart-wrenching tale and approaches the point of almost unbearable if you're a soft hearted person. This movie takes to the dark side of love when it focuses on the disintegrating marriage of Dean and Cindy and is a far cry from the movie ""Revolutionary Road"" and its depiction of marriage. The depth of the script, the actors' performances and the touchy subject matter all create what has become a sensational movie among the typical cinema disappointments of today.",Blue Valentine
329,evkendig,I've had better.,3,17 January 2011,"Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams were both excellent in this movie, their talent was exhibited very well which was about the only redeeming thing about this film, they played a miserable couple very well. Now that I got that out of the way, the movie itself was a renter at best. I read reviews saying that this movie was ""Heart-wrenching"" and ""Moving"" but only thing that wrenched my heart out is the fact that people buy into this mediocrity. The script was weak, there was no decent dialogue, no compelling plot, no creative story-line, no real character development and no insightful resolution; it was as if someone wrote about a sad boring broken romance that they had and found some sucker to produce it. It was a hyperbolized exhibit of the worse side of the marital statistics in society. As for the cinematography, I have seen better quality work done in Junior colleges. Some of the scenes the frame was zoomed in so much the viewer didn't know what they were looking at; I understand that it was done purposefully to bring a first person perspective for the viewer, but it was contrived, not avant-garde. I don't understand how people found this movie entertaining or valuable in anyway. Now for the story. Let me break it down, guy meets girl (already Pregnant, 9 weeks in) takes her anyway, gets married in a roadside chapel, five years later she doesn't appreciate him due the suffering of her own guilt, but can't own up to her faults and blames it all on him. Guy, sucker that he is raises the child as his own after being beat up by the biological father and still stays with the girl even though it is blatantly apparent she doesn't love him, and using him as a scapegoat emotional crutch that throws him to the side after everything he's done for her. Heart-wrenching? Only because Gosling's character was so spineless. Was I moved? To tears, that I opt to go see another movie. Never did I imagine that a shotgun wedding love story could be made into a movie in such a pretentious and predictable manner. Those of you who thought this depressing chic flick was some kind of phenomenon, please reconsider some truly good films that are out there and compare their qualities to this one and appreciate the well crafted deserving work that is available to you. As for the morals of the story, don't marry someone you just met and is pregnant with someone else's child or stalks you on a bus with a ukulele. Don't need to remind me twice.I must again stress that Gosling and Williams did very well in their performances. Their abilities to show the change of state in their characters feeling towards one another was astounding and quite an inspiration in their work. Their choice to be a part of this project is what was disappointing. If these two were not involved in this project it would have never had such a big spotlight on it.",Blue Valentine
330,arghuable,Are all you viewers on crack?,9,19 January 2011,"From the get-go I loved this movie. I immediately identified with my own relationship. In my case, the character of Dean was my silly, playful boyfriend, and the stressed out and over-worked, ""everything is so serious"" female lead, myself.Let me contest with some of you other viewers - Dean was not abusive. He didn't even hint at it. He loved his family, he fought for them. We should all be so lucky. He didn't grow ""weird"" either. He stayed true and loving to the end. Years of rejection will change anyone.Michelle's role was a typical female. Over worked, stressed out, mistaking people's ""admiration"" in the jobplace as anything other than the sexual exploitation it was. (Not that she wasn't deserving of praise, just that that's rarely what an attractive and smart woman is appreciated for, even AS a professional). It seems that over the years she took advantage of her husband's adoration and affection, and like many women, grew to have higher ambitions. Woulda, shoulda, coulda. Michelle reminds me of my mother. Unfortunately, also someone reminiscent of myself (thanks, Ma!), but I'm not proud.I spent the whole movie laughing and crying. The end left me unsatisfied, but I never (not even for a moment) felt that this couldn't be ANYONE'S relationship. Seriously...if it wasn't yours, it sure as hell was mine.I am both characters.

If you are happy to watch a married couple argue for the vast majority of an hour and 50 minutes, you'll love this movie. This movie doesn't address the causes of relationship breakdown, doesn't present solutions, it shows us a couple with a breakdown in their relationship. We piece together and can speculate on the snippets of past that are presented to us, that got us to where we are with this couple. There are no conclusions, no pieces that fit clearly together and it becomes a hazed ""documentry"" of a couples collapse in communication. It's painful to watch!",Blue Valentine
332,jin-leah,Well acted but slow and unrealistic movie about love,5,11 March 2011,"I will keep my review short and brief. This movie has some definite highs. Bravo to Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling for great performances.Ultimately I felt the script to be lacking in reality. It feels like a movie written by a man from a male perspective of a woman's unhappiness in a marriage, and therefore feels fake and contrived. The arguments that the couple have feel petty and ultimately seem so insignificant that that they do not warrant the demise of an otherwise average marriage. I wish this movie could have actually been more real because I think the concept is a good one, and could have been turned into something a lot more people might have been able to relate to. Unfortunately, I could not relate to it at all. Most of the time when I was watching the movie, I was thinking what a b**ch the Michelle William's character is, and how realistic she would either never have married the Ryan Gosling character, or if she did, would not take divorce so lightly. Perhaps that's another thing that annoyed me about the movie, was that it depicted a woman trivializing divorce in a way that I have yet to see in real life, and almost felt slightly offensive to me to see a woman being portrayed in that light.",Blue Valentine

It is slow and boring. None of the characters have any qualities that make us want to care about what happens to them. They appear to all be losers and are satisfied to continue being losers.There seems to be a collection of movies that appear to be artsy and intellectual, but are just about sad people being sad. Not every movie has to be ""Singin' in the Rain."" But there should be some progress, some growth of the characters, or reason for us to care about them. This movie had none of these things.

Seenig them at the beginning, made me think that somewhere in the past they were truly deeply in love. Then something went wrong. But it was completely different. He felt for her at the very first sight. She wasn't into him, she never called, she didn't even planned to tell him about pregnancy. She did it only after his insistence. That's even how she decided to marry him. I am used to say that for the right one, you must have had that special feeling at the first meeting. But as it happens that we have met him/her so long ago, we do not remember what it was like. I consider that important. Her reaction didn't predict a bright future. What made me so desperate about this film is that she became exactly like her parents. Demanding, careless, unable to show love, particularly – everything she hated, everything she blamed her parents for. When she came into their position, she lost her principals and did exactly the same. I do not blame her, actually I it wasn't on purpose. Probably it was slow process, she didn't even noticed how she slipped into contrary. Personally, during the whole movie there was no sympathy for her except one ascertainment: marriage like their wasn't worth saving for their daughter, it's better to divorce. On the other hand, I really felt for Dean, like most viewers did. His ability to adopt to unexpected situation, and even more, to embrace it, was mind-blowing. Despite the fact he din't finish even high school, he knew how to find joy in life, unlike his wife. Maybe the most outstanding remark was the one where he explained the difference between man and woman finding their lifetime partners. That level of awareness made me think that he will find the exception, but his generalisation turned out to be 100 percent (also the part about men), like he was anticipating his future. Despite that, he was fighting to very last breath, so many refusals and he wasn't defeated. Even Dean's alcoholic moment at the and, I don't find his future life. It was just crisis, maybe his final acceptance of falling them apart. Because of his character, he will be happy and satisfied man in life after he cures the pain, but Cindy She won't because of one small reason, she never felt a true happiness. Even when she was smiling, it was usually compromise. If she was given a chance to choose whatever she wants to be completely fortunate, without any condition, she will be speechless.My friend told me once, that he didn't't know how people get married without even going on holiday together.

He plays a character who loves and loves and loves his wife and child - a child who is not his own. This movie is depressing right from the beginning with the death of the family dog.

That is until I awoke with a revelation not spoken of so far in reviews read: The movie has a flawed time-line. Consider that the present time of the movie has Dean with a (shaved) receding hairline, Ontario has minor crow's feet, and their dog Megan even looks old. Of the liquor store encounter Cindy remarks to Ontario that they have not seen each other in ""forever"". And such time has passed that Ontario is unaware of his lost love's marriage. Cindy is portrayed as a mature minded women suffering from a disintegrating marriage symptomatic of many years.The time-line problem lies in the age of their child. Had she been fourteen or fifteen, all would have worked. But she is not. Indications are that she's all of five. Cindy was maybe mid-way through college and still living with her parents when she and Dean met. It was shortly thereafter when discovered that she was pregnant (by Ontario), and subsequently married Dean while clearly showing. (Did she endure a ten year pregnancy?) At movie present she couldn't be more than twenty-five; with their relationship hardly of five years! It's not enough to sensibly say that this is too little time for their relationship to tank as portrayed, but more importantly that they could not have been in their mid-twenties to make circumstances of this movie at all plausible.",Blue Valentine

While the acting was in fact superb to the point of obnoxious realism, the plot of the movie was no more than a depressing trip designed to inspire suicide. What was so lacking in this movie you might ask? Well, to start with the most disappointing I'd have to look toward the ending. I won't spoil this for you as the movie will, but I will say that watching a good man have his life ripped from him in the most normal of ways is 'blah'. That was really only point of this movie. The director must have woken up one day, (most likely after a night of hallucinogens and heavy drinking) and decided to realize the most upsetting, depressing ideas in the most mundane of ways. I know that this may sound redundant, but the truth is I still cannot describe enough what a waste of a dollar and almost two hours this movie was.

Which is women tends to go for real good options. They choose too much when they shouldn't. They should just go with the flow. Dean character who's played by Ryan Golsing has some brilliant script in the film which makes the audience tingle a little bit but a good tingle because he is automatically right. I don't know if there are anymore people who's like that but who knows I'm still young myself. Cindy who played by Michelle Williams, she is gorgeous and mysterious in some ways. Now understand why she was picked for this character because I love mysterious characters. But that's not just it. She plays this character very well and I can't imagine anyone else playing this role although there are many good actresses out there. The two characters in this role has both fell in this same path in this awkward circumstance. Dean saw Cindy watching him taking some money and straight away he know's what exactly she is thinking and that's when the whole confusion and his ambition his devotion he has for this girl he know's there is something about her but how can this be? I mean a stranger he just met is having these built feelings for her. It's amazing. It doesn't just present us the two young, unplanned couple. The film show us years later when they have a baby angel Frankie. Dean loves her and so does Cindy but the family isn't there. What I mean is Cindy doesn't feel the same way how Dean feels therefore the family is not whole. Obviously nothing is perfect which makes the film so real. It's crazy I can't go any further you just have to watch this yourself than reading a dumb review a person is writing because these words you can't imagine what we are interpreting until you see it.I rate it an 8 because is serious, is real and most of all is love. Don't get me wrong this film is great and I love director Derek for what he composed. This film is cool as f but is too serious for me.

In this film you will see how two characters and actors complement each other, it's like nothing I've ever seen and that is what made me love every little thing about this film.It's their characters and the way that they portray them that wins my respect. Ryan Gosling plays Dean and Michelle Williams plays Cindy. Dean is is an easy going, laid back, happy character who adores Cindy, where as Cindy is quite closed off, quirky, but grows to be too mature to handle Dean's free attitude. Throughout this film we see how they grow to love each other deeply from the beginning and fall completely out of love to the end, to the point where they both fall apart. Is a failing marriage really worth falling apart over? This creation deserves every star, every nomination, every award, every good review it gets. It's a masterpiece that stands quietly on its own and there won't be one like this for a very long time.

As the two of them spend their years together, Cindy is given more and more opportunities while Dean stays the same and has a lack of motivation to grow and support the family. There is a lack of explanation of certain things that happen in the movie and i wish the producers had spent more time explaining them.",Blue Valentine
345,ry-m-fernandez,Painful Melancholy,8,5 January 2013,"I hope I'm not spoiling this for anyone, but you should knowing going into this film that it's about two people growing apart. The sadness & melancholy is amplified by flashbacks of the couple first falling in love, and the present day – where there doesn't seem to be a simple fix.Ryan Gosling's performance as a tone deaf manchild (Dean) is perfect. Michelle Williams (Cindy) is even better. Her performance is much more subtle, but she has an even harder part to play – someone with once great ambitions of becoming a doctor, ultimately disappointed with the way her life is turning out. She resents her husband for being content with their situation, seemingly having no ambition for a better life (""Potential?? Potential to become what? What does that even mean? Potential?!"").Ultimately the film is a cautionary tale about the twists and turns life can take. The chemistry that drew the once happy couple together, is the same chemistry that drives them apart.",Blue Valentine
346,jewelee7998,Wow.,8,15 April 2013,"Probably the best acting EVER!! Great, great job all around, but holy crap, this movie is depressing!! I loved how angry, sad, & desperate to be happy this made me feel. Anyone who's ever felt numb in their relationship should definitely see this. Both Michelle & Ryan really surprised me in this one. I knew they were good, but I'd looooove to see them top these performances!! This is the kind of movie the world needs to replace all that reality crap on TV right now. THIS is reality! If you love movies that really make you feel something, this will definitely be at the top of your all time favorites. Again, all I have left to say is WOW.",Blue Valentine
347,sarahmirza1,"The film starts in the present and in clips looks back at how Cindy and Dean come together, and ultimately end up falling apart.",7,26 September 2013,"You can see both parties fault. Dean lacks any ambition and is very childlike. Forcing Cindy to be the responsible one and mother her husband is well. Cindy wants Dean to be more mature as examples can be seen at the breakfast table when he decides to feed his daughter of the table instead of her bowl. Frustrated Cindy says she does not want to clean up after them both but she is left with no choice. Cindy is overworked and clearly very unhappy in the marriage. Deans outburst at her work place is the last straw bringing Cindy to the decision of divorce. Dean's outburst at Cindy's work place seems to of cost her, her job and was very inappropriate and could of waited until Cindy arrived home. Dean is also constantly drinking and starts as early as 8 am regularly. This is a very bad sign and is another reason for Cindy's unhappiness within the marriage. Dean is clearly infatuated with Cindy but she has fallen out of love with him. Cindy gives Dean no affection in the marriage as she did when they were young loves. Cindy does not really seem to try and reach out to Dean or create any sense of laughter with him. However when watching the film Dean's heartbreak at losing Cindy really makes you wish she would give him another chance and some guidance.",Blue Valentine

349,Mister-Sir,Blue Valentine is a rich and frankly depressing portrayal of a failing marriage,10,24 July 2014,"Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams deliver the best performance of their careers in Blue Valentine while director Derek Cianfrance offers a raw, depressing, and honest film about love and the struggles that one faces while fighting to staying in love. Although the stones may be small, Cianfrance leaves non unturned as he dives into the deepest and darkest depths of a relationship.The film starts with Dean and Cindy near the brink of their marriage. From the opening scene you sense a frustration or tension between the two characters that seems as if it had been building for quite some time. After a family tragedy the two decide to stay at a motel for a night. Throughout their stay, the viewer is offered flashbacks of when their relationship began. As it unfolds you begin to wonder how such a beautiful relationship could go so sour. By only depicting the beginning and end of their relationship, Derek Cianfrance leaves this open to speculation and offers only hints as to problems that the couple are going through that have eluded a longer description in the story.As the story develops, it is apparent that Dean loves Cindy more than any man can love a woman. Dean's character is so moving as he fights from the very beginning to have the chance to love Cindy. As he wins over Williams character, you start to realize that there isn't anything he wouldn't do for her. Derek Cianfrance does an exceptional job of bringing out Goslings character through his expressions and actions. Although his character isn't developed much through narrative, each scene is set to show you how compassionate, caring, and loving he is to everyone he encounters, not just Cindy.Where Dean is goofy and laid back, Cindy is the opposite. She is much more proper, shy, and her actions will leave you frustrated to your core and screaming at the screen. Cindy is a confusing character and hard to depict. She looks as if the relationship has exhausted her and it seems all to obvious that she cares about Dean and is faithful to him; but at times I was left wondering if she really loves him or is just trying to do the right thing. From the beginning of the relationship Dean sacrifices everything for her and at times she shows no appreciation. Eventually the rejection becomes to much. Dean cant take it and Cindy is pushed to her breaking point.Derek Cianfrance does a great job at giving you just enough information to understand the relationship, but also allow you to interpret some situations yourself. Gosling and Williams are perfect and believable. When the two are in love they have more chemistry than any two actors I've seen. But the two are able to turn it off an make things awkward when they need to and its absolutely brilliant. The movie doesn't ask questions and leave them for you to answer, but makes you want to ask questions you are forced to determine on your own. It's a sadistic sequence that will have you obsessing over the film and wanting to change it all, but then again no, never mind, because actually you wont want to change anything as it is beautiful and perfect the way it is.Lastly This movie was probably the most depressing movie I have ever scene. There's are no holding back tears in this movie. Biting my tongue lasted for about 10 minutes. The few scenes where Dean and Cindy are happy only break your heart more because you know that the inevitable is coming. You are left wanting to fight for the two of them but you soon realize that all is lost. When you realize the magnitude of the situation you will notice your already out of tissues, the toilet paper roll is empty, and now you have to blow your nose into your shirt, or blanket. It hurts because it is so honest as marriages or even long relationships in which two people had once been so in love can still fail. As a single man it terrifies me that I can spend so much time with one person and someday be unhappy. Everyday can be a struggle and Derek Cianfrance shows us how hard relationships can be.",Blue Valentine
350,sadmanrayan87,So much unthinkable once watched and can't avoid of being depressed!,8,7 January 2019,"It just made me so depressed and I am feeling so sorry for Dean. What he did to deserve that? I guess Cindy couldn't take the pressure of Dean's loyalty and his love. She has that erratic nature in built and she just can't stay with a single person and she had 25 or more partners before she got pregnant and her behaviour in the liquor shop with her ex. Moreover, everything of Dean's frustrating her as she was fighting with herself consciously and subconsciously to get free and lead a life how she lived earlier and eventually she burst out. Dean is just a true lover without having the complex and selfish mind. Come on man, he took the responsibility of the baby which was not not even him. The whole thing is just stuck in my mind and that's the success of the good movie.",Blue Valentine

You think that what you are watching is a base to understand the comings. and very unexpectedly it ends?????? It isn't a love or romantic movie , completely a drama with a poor story. Don't waste your valuable time for this piece of s***. Especially the final part. The moment the story captures you, you find yourself listening last movie song with titles..Dean Pereira and Cindy Heller Pereira are a young, working class married couple - Dean currently working as a painter, and Cindy working as a nurse in a medical clinic - with a young daughter named Frankie. Despite their relatively tender ages, they are both ravaged by the life they've eked out together and by the experiences they've had leading into their marriage. Dean, a high school drop out, comes from a broken home, where he never really had a mother figure. He never saw himself getting married or having a family despite falling in love at first sight with Cindy. He doesn't have any professional ambition beyond his current work - which he enjoys since he feels he can knock off a beer at 8 o'clock in the morning without it affecting his work - although Cindy believes he has so much more potential in life. Cindy also comes from a dysfunctional family, with her own mother and father not setting an example of a harmonious married or family life. One of her previous serio",Blue Valentine

354,taekwondomaster-81325,"Not a romance, but a very real drama",9,30 March 2020,"I created this account just to review this movie.
I don't classify this movie as a romance, there is absolutely 0 romance involved.
This movie is an excellent portrait of two people who were never truly in love.
Ryan Goslings character became obcessed with a girl he saw once and gave her his number.
She never responded back and never called because she was not interested. Weeks later he went to find her travelling hours like an obcessed stalker just to talk to her. I don't find this enderearing and neither did the girl. Overtime and by him forcing his way, they finally hooked up and she became pregnant. She became very resentful of this. She had plans, dreams and hopes while he was just scrapping by with no life goal and barely any
education. He was too childish and immature and never learned to act like a man (even his character at the end of the movie asks her ""What is that, a man?"").
An excellent question coming from someone who never learned to be one.This a very intesting drama because I have seen this so many times in close friends and relatives.
People stop being interesting and they just live for the other person. No one wants that.9\10 movie just because finally a movie displayed how NOT to act in a relationship and the ending was a true and very real ending.",Blue Valentine
355,whereiendandyoubegin-15314,Wannabe-Noir,5,18 May 2020,In and on itself the movie is great but the director tries a bit too hard to shove this neo-noir vibe in there; just dont force that jazz man,Blue Valentine
356,run_out,"Love is an ideal thing, marriage is a real thing.",9,10 January 2018,"I strongly recommend this movie especially to whom always believe to find their true love. There is nothing like that. 
In this film, this couple is really good match and have a love marriage. But after a while they can't endure each other. It's also just 5or 6 years. Don't you think that it is quite short time to hate each other for lovers?
Of course, there are great metaphors and this depressing story is worth to watch. It is quite deep. Highly recommend to lonely cowboys! :)",Blue Valentine
357,gab-28,What's the point?,3,15 February 2010,"My impression of this movie is best encapsulated by a passage from the movie ""Adaptation,"" when Nicolas Cage asks Brian Cox the following question: ""Sir, what if the writer is attempting to create a story where nothing much happens, where people don't change. They don't have any epiphanies. They struggle and are frustrated, and nothing is resolved... more a reflection of the real world."" Blue Valentine is a lot like that. I watched this film during a post-Sundance screening in Feb 2010 where director Derek Cianfrance discussed the movie with Geoffrey Gilmore. Cianfrance said he didn't like movies to ""preach"" to the audience by providing answers about the characters and the story. He said he wanted his movies to ask questions instead of provide answers.Blue Valentine gives you 2 hours of watching a marriage fall painfully apart and how it got to that point. But, it does not really provide a message of any kind. It does not provide goals or motivations for the characters. It does not provide much insight into human nature that we don't know already. There's very little character development. The movie does not give you a message. It does not speak to you. After watching the characters struggle through their very frustrating lives, you walk away thinking, ""What's the point of this film?"" On the positive side, the film gives you two very powerful performances by Gosling and Williams. However, that's the best I can say about this movie.I understand the director doesn't want to ""preach"" or spoon-feed a message to the audience, but a film should make a statement of some sort that provokes interpretive thought and makes the audience feel there's a point to the movie.Otherwise, as with Blue Valentine, you wonder why you just spent 2 hours watching people claw through a painful, frustrating existence in which nothing else happens aside from the pain and frustration. See Brian Cox's answer to Cage in ""Adaptation"" for a more colorful description of how that feels.",Blue Valentine
358,beingganonymous,Absolute must watch..heart breaking..but worth it!,9,23 August 2016,Such an intense watch! It grows on you..I could not stop thinking about this the next day..or the day after! You feel so immensely for the couple that you would want to do something for them..and anything for the kid! Ryan and Williams are incredible throughout and so believable as dean and Cindy that all you want is to give them each a hug an tell them..it will get better..please hold on to each other a little longer! and their vulnerability due to their broken childhood..you can not even say what or who is right and who to blame! The experience feels like a journey and at the end I felt devastated as if if have to go through a divorce myself! (and it is kind of funny cause i m not even married yet :D ) Must watch!!,Blue Valentine
359,bzjetblue,Feeling depressed,10,27 May 2017,This reminds me of my own romantic experiences before. What is true love? When does he love you for real? When do I love him for real? Who loved me most? Who did I love most? So that is how guys look like when they fell in love. I seemed to have seen them before.It is heartbreaking when you feel that you might hurt someone like this and you might get burnt as well someday. I don't know if I believe in Karma but I've heard something like that. It comforted me for a while after one of my past breakups. I could not face the answer if Karma exists in relationships or not.I want to believe in love or any other most beautiful things in one's life. I want to live a happy life. I wish romantic relationships or even marriage could be one of the sources but the reality said it is not guaranteed.I don't want to act as a coward who cannot afford to love and dare not to love. I want to embrace it and I want to have some faith and feel the strength to fall in love.I want to be able to love the ones I love for a happy life.,Blue Valentine

361,cwcolors,Very Disappointed,1,23 May 2021,I'm writing this to let people know that I disagree with the rating this film received. I can't believe this movie won any awards except for Cindy Williams' acting. It had no entertainment value to me; just made me feel depressed and very sad. I don't run from deep subjects but I'd rather be uplifted and this movie was only hopeless. My time is valuable and I feel I just wasted it watching this film.,Blue Valentine
362,liupinyi,Heavy heartbreaks,8,3 April 2020,"Sometimes love isn't enough. To sustain a relationship, the power dynamics, equity in communication, all have to match up. I think Dean was devouring himself into this family and they jumped into a family without knowing what the future could leads them to be. Prince Charming can't always make your marriage life beautiful.
Love during marriage was like the fireworks, spectacular and marvelous at the moments yet never seem to sustain.
As we co write the books together we never thought how much exhaustion this could bring.
We always end up hurting the one that loves us the most.
the vows that we made were never a magic spell that prevent the expiration date of a relationship",Blue Valentine
