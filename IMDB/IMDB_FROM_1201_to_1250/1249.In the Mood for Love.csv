0,MartinHafer,beautiful but slow going,7,13 March 2006,"This is an excellent film--with beautiful and haunting music and an interesting story. I like how the two people knew their partners were cheating on them but they were just too decent to return the favor. Their unresolved love was very well developed and really had me pulling for the characters. However, although I have a pretty high tolerance for slow-moving films, this one just seemed to drag and went at too subdued a pace. I actually liked the pacing, but kept expecting it to pick up a little more. But, it never really did, and this reduced my overall score for the film. I didn't need some sort of Hollywood happy ending, but the slowness just got to me after a while.",In the Mood for Love
1,Leofwine_draca,Slowest film ever,3,11 March 2015,"This seems to be a love it or hate it film. I'm in the latter camp, but then I hate romance films in general so I was predisposed to dislike this before I even started. I watched it because I like the actors and I love Chinese films in general, but I guess I should stick to the thrillers and such.The problem with this story is that it's so subtle that it wasn't even worth making a film about it. I'm not sure why people seem to love it, because this is a film where nothing happens. Even the romance is so understated as to be virtually non-existent, and the posturing of the central characters becomes more than annoying before long.I like Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, but their acting feels artificial here, their characters hollow. The main thing in a film is to empathise with the central characters so that you become emotionally caught up in the story, but that's impossible here. Leung seems slick and smarmy and Cheung aloof and distant. The interlude in Cambodia felt random. I understand that Wong Kar Wai shot this film without a script, which explains everything.",In the Mood for Love
2,SnoopyStyle,Poetry on film but a bit too reserved,7,27 July 2014,"It's 1962 Hong Kong. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Chiu Wai Leung) is a married newspaper editor who moves into an apartment. Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) moves in on the same day. Her executive husband is often away on business. With his wife away with her sick mother, Mr Chow befriends his beautiful neighbor.There is a lot of midrange shooting style. In that I mean the camera is a little further away. It doesn't always directly shoots the subject. There are stuff in the foreground a lot of the time. At first, I didn't really get it and put me off. I thought it was an amateurish mistake. After 15 minutes, it's pretty obvious that's the camera style that writer/director Kar Wai Wong is using here. It's somewhat voyeuristic and beautiful visual poetic.The mood is more reserved. The first 30 minutes is too perfunctory. Then it gets interesting as the lead characters start getting together. It's hesitant and awkward. It's different than the usual hot and bothered romance. It's a slow burn. It has mature feel about it. However it does walk the edge to being too slow and sometimes it falls right over.",In the Mood for Love
3,Horst_In_Translation,Felt like style over substance for the most part,4,29 August 2021,"""Fa yeung nin wah"" is a co-production between Hong Kong and China, but this was made in Thailand back in 2000, so it is already over two decades old now and I had the occasion to watch it for the first time not too long ago as theaters picked it up again. I like that usually and find it a bit sad that for these old films being presented again at movie theaters, there are no great crowds, but with this one here, in the end, I was not surprised or disappointed that there was only one other person in the room. The really high imdb rating basically got me to the movie theater that day. And also the number of ratings here because the six-digit amount means that this is surely among the more-seen, if not most-seen Asian films from the 21st century. Even if it barely made it inside this 21st century. The writer and director is Kar-Wai Wong and this was far from an early career effort from him. He is in his mid-60s now and still considered among the most influential Asian filmmakers out there, even if quite a few others have made very big waves recently. This film here was not the only not exactly recent film that hit theaters again from him, so he seems to be in the news again. Kinda ironic though that my favorite from him is a movie with American actors that most do not like too much, but may have to do with my Norah Jones preference. Anyway, back to this one here: The running time is briefly under 100 minutes, so not a too long film in fact and I think there is also really this one version, which is really not a given with Asian films. And I must say I am glad about that. It dragged a lot for me and there felt little substance below the admittedly fairly watchable make-up, cinematography, art direction and costumes. But it's just difficult when key conflicts in here consist of characters wondering for how long their mah-jongg game continues.The two lead actors are Tony Chiu-Wai Leung and Maggie Cheung, both briefly under the age of 60 now, which means barely under the age of 40 back then. He is still a prolific actor, she seems to be retired now. Everybody as (s)he wants. I cannot say a lot else about these two actors because I don't really know their other stuff, but what I saw here also did not really make me too curious to check it out, even if I feel that the screenplay was a bigger problem in this very slow movie than the performances. Anyway, there are of course many supporting actors as well, but none were really massive key figures. Maybe the main characters' significant others before the movie come closest to that, but in the end it is about nobody other than the two people you see on the poster here. There are no side stories really. Also, it's not even remotely comedic. Kar-Wai Wong has delivered subtle comedy here and there, but this one here is really all about the romance. Also not about drama. No other genre than romance really. I guess the idea that one character says she goes out to buy noodles (while being really well-dressed) could have been a bit of a running gag, but it is never meant as such. So there is the spice somewhat missing to this film altogether and the idea alone of a romance between these two, of him falling for her as he explicitly states does not make it watchable on its own the way it was presented her. She is never as explicit with such a statement that she loves him, but you can maybe read between the lines with how he reminds her of her husband, but also we hear (from him) that she will never leave her husband. The smaller characters are brought in again through statements like how they know there is something going on and it did not work for long to shut them out and keep it a secret. From that perspective, maybe the reference to the question if it isn't enough that the two themselves know there is no romance between them (yeah, right!) is an interesting one. At least more interesting than the rest of the film for the most part.The sequence with the male protagonist and for once not the female protagonist is also easier to remember when he is asked if he has somebody else, then responds with yes and basically relaunches the weird situation and then says no. This honestly did not feel like something to happen in real life. Not in 2021 for sure, but also not 20 years earlier. We have to keep in mind that this is not a film from the 1960s or so. I know this is where it was set, but even for that era, the ways in which the characters interacted and the exact dialogue writing did not feel too credible. It felt more modern and looked more modern. This surely, at least to some extent, had to do with this being a color film. As for director Wong, it is not unusual at all that he has connections to western culture, not only because of him having worked at Hollywood too, but also because of how he has used really American English-language songs in other films and here at least the performer is American if we take a look at a song used on really many occasions here, especially in the second half. I am of course talking about Nat King Cole, an artist I kinda like, even if I would not say I am a fan, and the song is ""Quizás, quizás, quizás"", the Spanish-language version of ""Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"" that is mostly known thanks to Doris Day if I remember correctly. Anyway, this song is one I definitely appreciate and always feels very catchy, so it may have been my favorite aspect from the film even. Says a lot about the other production values though in a not particularly positive manner. So yeah, more focus from Wong here on South European language instead of America this time, but still not a 100% Asian movie, even if it is with the setting, character etc.Aside from that, I must also say that the impact of the main characters' professions and scenes linked to their workplace left me rather unimpressed. Nothing simply stood out. Nothing made an impact. There is just nothing special to one minor character telling a major character that she can have the next day off until noon because she will be out in the evening. At a movie it was I think. Hopefully a better movie than this one here. As I am moving closer to the final stages of my review now, however, let me still say from a more positive perspective that visually this film is okay. I mentioned it early already, but there is really no blame here to put on the fashion designers or the visual artists that worked on the many production departments linked to this film. However, as a consequence of that, the outcome overall feels like a fairly solid birthday present in terms of the wrapping, but what is inside, feels like a major disappointment. I also don't think I was distracted or anything while watching. This movie never really took off from my perspective and I'd say the rating here on imdb is way too high unfortunately. The film is still in the imdb top250, top235 even, but to me it belongs nowhere near, also not into the top2500 for that matter, maybe top25000 barely, and it will be a good day when it loses its place in this prestigious collection of movies. Certainly one of the worst inclusions.A key criticism of the entire presentation for me is that I never really cared for the characters, cheered for the characters to get together, end up asa couple and at least this could have been a desired effect if there is really absolutely nothing else to it here. In terms of genres or true qualities. Also kinda shocking to see this was (according to imdb) nominated for almost 100 awards, including big players like the BAFTAs, and won approximately half of them. I cannot see why at all and I am pretty sure a rewatch is not gonna change anything about that. This film is not a failure, but certainly on the weak and highly overrated side. I give the outcome a thumbs-down and again I must say that this did not run for two hours or something. Still, I guess you can nonetheless check it out if you like or better love Asian romance films that are not very recent because, looking at the overall reception by critics, awards bodies and movies-goers in general, many thought this was a quality watch. I am curious how you see it, but I would certainly be more amazed if you also think this one is very much on the pompous,, style-over-substance side. I give it a thumbs-down and a pretty definite one indeed. Best if if you skip the watch here. Even at a movie theater, this was not good. At a simple television or laptop screen probably even more disapointing outcome.",In the Mood for Love
4,claudio_carvalho,"A Beautiful, Melancholic and Romantic Love Story",8,5 November 2004,"In Hong Kong, 1962, the editor Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife, and the secretary Su Li-Zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband simultaneously move to an old building. Each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor. Their wife and husband stay most of the time away from home, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they like kung-fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant nearby the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a sort of platonic and repressed love. Later they realize that their mates are having an affair, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but her shyness and probably repressed condition of married woman keeps her love in a platonic level. 'In the Mood for Love' is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story, with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film had not had a screenplay, and the actors were never sure about what they would be shooting. Later, the director edited his story based on the footages. When Chow moves to Singapore, there is a gap of many years in the story until 1966, when its conclusion is intentionally open and not well defined, leaving questions such as who is the boy with Li-Zhen. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Amor À Flor da Pele' ('Love on the Surface of the Skin')",In the Mood for Love
5,classicsoncall,"""I thought I was the only one who knew.""",8,12 December 2017,"This film might present the most unrequited pure romance in movie history. There's an ethereal quality to the picture, with close-up frames of the conflicted principal characters, and fluid slow motion sequences that add to the romantic nature of the story. For this viewer, the ambiance seemed to be French in a way, even though the story takes place in Hong Kong with an Oriental couple attempting to sort out their feelings after discovering their marriage partners are cheating on them with each other. I had to think about that, because the off screen relationship is insinuated quite strongly, but we never actually see the husband of Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung), or the wife of Mr. Chow (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). They could have been carrying on separate affairs altogether.As odd as it sounds at first, the soundtrack with Nat King Cole singing in Spanish adds another layer of exotic mystery to the relationship between the chaste lovers. One may admire the way the couple resisted temptation to break their marriage vows, particularly in light of their own partners' indiscretions. To my mind, Mrs. Chan appeared to be the more resolute of the two, which makes it somewhat surprising that with the passage of years, she wound up living alone with a child, with one's instincts about the father left to the imagination. It's a rather ambitious film for director Kar-Wai Wong, who's unique filming style often involves characters having conversations off screen, adding yet another thoughtfully reflective layer to the story being told.",In the Mood for Love

However, they agree to keep their bond platonic so as not to commit similar wrongs.Regardless of what other qualities this film has, what stands out most is how there is such rich color. Yes, this is supposed to be the 1960s, but did the 1960s ever look this good? Brilliant tones, great flow.Beyond that, it is an interesting story about love, both romantic and platonic, and the loyalty of our significant others. And when the platonic friendship is between a man and a woman, where do these lines blur? Sometimes they never do, but other times it gets complicated.",In the Mood for Love
7,jboothmillard,In the Mood for Love,7,16 April 2007,"Just like Chungking Express in 1994, from the same director, Kar Wai Wong, this was a film I would need to watch as part of my Film Studies exam. Basically in 1962 Hong Kong, newspaper editor Chow Mo-Wan (Cannes Film Festival Award winning Tony Leung Chiu Wai) has moved into a new building with his wife, at the same time as beautiful secretary Su Li-Zhen - Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung) with her executive husband. With both their marriage partners away a lot, Chow and Su spend much time together as friends. They have a lot in common, and it seems almost like an affair as they try and fail to get closer. They are shocked to find that their partners are having affairs, so they decide to find comfort with each other as closer friends. Eventually though, it ends rather sadly when Su rejects him for a closer relationship. The only annoying thing about this film is the use of music, with the violin theme playing almost every ten minutes of the film. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, and it won the Cannes Film Festival Technical Grand Prize, and it was nominated the Golden Palm for Wong. Very good!",In the Mood for Love
8,paul_haakonsen,Wong Kar-Wai is nothing short of spectacular...,8,14 January 2016,"""In the Mood for Love"" (aka ""Fa yeung nin wa"") is one of the movies that you would think about first and foremost if someone mentions Hong Kong cinema, because director Wong Kar-Wai really did manage to put together a very beautiful, unique and well-told movie when he directed this movie back in 2000.The movie is a drama laced with romance, and it is a movie that is not only driven by the will of the director, but most certainly also by the sheer force of the acting talents. And they had two of the biggest names in Hong Kong cinema on the cast list, being Maggie Cheung and Tony Chiu Wai Leung. These two are also, in fact, two of my all time favorite stars from the Hong Kong cinema, and when guided by the skillful hand of director Wong Kar-Wai, something extraordinary was meant to come from this project.The story told in ""In the Mood for Love"" is a well-paced story which is centered on the characters in the story, and as such it might be a bit of a struggle to get through for some people, if you are not overly keen on movies that are story- and character-driven. If you are looking for an Asian martial arts movie, then this is definitely not the place to be looking. ""In the Mood for Love"" is a down-trodden love story of sorts, but it is also a nice story at the same time.""In the Mood for Love"" is a definite must watch if you enjoy Asian cinema, and in particular if you have a love of the Hong Kong cinema. And director Wong Kar-Wai proves his knack for storytelling and movie making with grace and finesse.",In the Mood for Love
9,Quinoa1984,the quintessential romance of Wong Kar Wai,10,4 June 2008,"In the Mood for Love, a film shot in an improvisational style with the actors and, frankly, the most mature and least feverish lensed and edited work of Wong Kar Wai's career, is about two people who know exactly what is right and what is wrong, but have the feeling, the emotion, to possibly cross the line. Why shouldn't they, after all, when they both suspect that their respective spouses are having an affair? But this, for Wong Kar Wai, is far too easy for the audience to expect. We want these two characters, Chow (Tony Leung) and Chan (Maggie Cheung) to be together not simply as friends, or even playing their 'game' of acting out like they're married, but fully invested in each other's ever growing affection and companionship. That they want to, desire to be together, and cannot- or, in fact, will not- is part of the challenge. And it's quietly, subtly thrilling.It's always something special to see a filmmaker challenge the expectations of an audience saturated with the usual, and In the Mood for Love is certainly unusual in the respect of how it treats its characters which is with a frankness, naturalism that seems at first to be not out of any old 50s or 60s melodrama. It's because these two people, who live so close to one another and grow a bond as they do, that one thinks that they are bound to be made for each other. Whether they are or are not isn't the point, however, but how little by little the same things that go on for them, the routine of day to day life, gets splintered. The perception of their realities are broken down until all they have left is each other, and out of fear, apprehension, all the common fears of adultery, they don't go where they know their respective spouses have. It's almost more appealing to see their restraint, the passion buried right under the surface.But the director doesn't make this a detached experience. On the contrary, despite his ditching of the constant hand-held and strange lighting of the 90s, things move at a pace that is, simply, meditative on romance, the little details that can come up with repetition, the slow-motion, the violin music. Just a simple pan done across a dinner between Chow and Chan is extraordinary for what precisely is shown. Objects seem elegant, like Chan's dresses, which she wears just to go out for an errand, or even some things that at this point should be a cliché in movies: the look of cigarette smoke, and scenes with rain. He and Christopher Doyle bring one into, as it goes, another feeling within scenes that add drama, sorrow, and, of course, love, where otherwise it would be just mundane and kind of strange. Towards the end (i.e. Cambodia) it gets strange anyway, but for a while it's sublime.And lest not forget stars Leung and Cheung, both regulars of WKW's films, who inhabit these characters as opposed to playing specific parts; they're people sort of stuck where they are in life, one at a printing press the other a secretary, and they both have possible dreams for themselves (mostlty for Chow as a serial novelist). Together, they start acting out the roles of each others spouses, sort of filling in the spaces left behind, and the actors convey the sense of slight hope within this hopeless relationship that few I could imagine ever pulling off period, much less in this setting.It's all a combination of factors, between the subtle experimentation with the direction, the realistic edge of the actors, the music, the clothes, the direct lighting, all of it comes together better than in any other film I've seen from this HK romantic wildman. This might not mean it's for everyone, however; it's the kind of film one gets tuned into, like some far-off radio station that's clear as day, but uncommon in a lot of ways, too.

10,sunwarrior13,A Must-See Elegant Film,10,21 October 2012,"Auteur filmmaker Wong Kar-wai directs this moody period drama about unrequited love that, like his earlier work, swoons with romantic melancholy in this movie entitled,In The Mood For Love.It features Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung together with Siu Ping Lam,Rebecca Pan,Lai Chen,Joe Cheung and Chan Man-Lei.Set in a Shanghaiese enclave in Hong Kong in 1962, it centers on two young couples who rent adjacent rooms in a cramped and crowded tenement. Li-zhen works as a secretary in an export company while her husband's job at a Japanese multinational keeps him away on extended business trips. Across the hall, Chow works as a newspaper editor and is married to a woman who is also frequently out of town. Neither respective spouse is ever shown in full, instead they are shot from the back or obscured by walls and furniture. Li-zhen and Chow soon strike up a cordial friendship. Chow begins to suspect that his wife's long absences are not entirely business related when he stops in unannounced at her office to discover that she is not there. Later, a colleague tells him that he saw his wife with another man. The icing on the cake comes when Chow notices that Li-zhen's handbag is identical to his wife's while Li-zhen discovers that Chow is wearing a tie that she gave her husband; it doesn't take long for them to realize that their spouses are sleeping together. Drawn together by shame and anger, Chow and Li-zhen reveal nothing of their discoveries to their partners. While working through their guilt by imagining how their adulterous spouses first hooked up and rehearsing interrogations, the pair slowly fall in love in spite of their determination to uphold their end of their marital vows. With a stealthy, eavesdropping camera style and a screenplay created through spontaneous on-set inspiration, Wong Kar-wai crafts an intricate, finely tuned platonic romance, enhancing its ambiance with a kaleidoscope of color and careful attention to character detail.Added to that,it is a mixture of bold devices with delicate understatement that leave a remarkable aftereffect.Truly,an elegant film that should not be missed.",In the Mood for Love

12,CinemaSerf,A measured and emotional love story...,7,15 September 2021,"This is a fine piece of cinema from Wong Kar-Wai that tells us a story of two people whom circumstance throws together - but not in a way you might expect. We start with two couples who move into a new building. One a newspaper man with his wife, the other a business executive and his wife. The businessman is rarely at home, nor is the journalist's wife - which leaves the other two at increasingly loose ends. It isn't long before a friendship develops - usually over some noodles - and though entirely platonic, their relationship becomes solid and trusting. Then, something entirely unexpected occurs that causes the two to refocus their relationship in the face of betrayal and disappointment - and well.... What helps this film stand out are the performances from both Tony Leung (""Chow Mo-wan"") and the gorgeous Maggie Cheung (""Mrs. Chan"") - it's a love story, and it burns intensely - but not physically - as their story subsumes both themselves and the audience. The film looks marvellous, is paced stylishly and uses quite a bit of Nat King Cole to set and keep the mood atmospheric, romantic and interesting. The photography offers us lingering close ups, we get a sense of them falling in love as if we, too, were undergoing the same experience and that all adds to the richness of the story. To give us a breather from the intensity, there are some fun scenes with their very close neighbours who love nothing better than to sit up all night playing mahjong!! Super film, this - flew by.",In the Mood for Love
13,dbborroughs,A Beautiful Looking Love Story,8,15 July 2004,"This movie is one of the most technically perfect films ever made. Its sense of time and place oozes off the screen. We are there watching the lives of two neighbors. The performances by everyone are dead nuts perfect and in an age of over or under acting by most of the acting community the two leads stand out as shining examples of how to be real on screen.The trouble with this movie is that its oblique. Its the tale of two people who meet and learn that their spouses are having an affair. The story is told mostly through short screens that highlight a moment and slowly build into something, the question is what. I reached the end of the film and was left wondering if I had missed something, it was very good but I wasn't certain what it was about. Looking at the Criterion DVD things became even more confused when I looked at the deleted scenes which alter the nature of the movie.Don't get me wrong. I like the movie, but I'm not certain it amounts to much in the end... then again I could be wrong, I need to see this again.If you want to see perfect acting with two performances that arc electricity then by all means see this movie.

Original yet simple plot, told in a very elegant, classy manner. Considering the infidelity involved, the movie could have been a cheap, sordid affair but this is nothing like that. The relationship develops slowly, almost accidentally, and the movie highlights their feelings for each other, and their issues and insecurities.It does move slowly at times though and from a point seems headed for a dull, unprofound ending. However, there's a nagging unpredictability about the plot that keeps you glued to the screen. This open- endedness produces a final few scenes that are wonderfully poetic and a conclusion that is incredibly powerful. Poetic in its script, and artistic in its presentation.

15,Boba_Fett1138,A reverse love-story.,8,28 September 2012,"Of course this is not a movie for just about everybody but those who are able to appreciate a more subtle, quiet and artistic made movie, with great visuals and a slowly told story, this is a great watch! You could basically enjoy this movie for two different things; either its storytelling or its visual directing approach by Kar Wai Wong. Really, if you just don't care very much about its story, this movie might still be a very worthwhile experience, due to its great looking visuals and vice versa. Or you of course could enjoy the movie simply for both of these two reasons, which isn't unlikely you will!It's an odd thing, people describing this movie as a romance. Not that they are wrong about it, after all the movie is shot and told as such a movie but the story in fact is actually being far from romantic. I would even call this movie a reverse love-story, in which the main characters are loosing love instead of finding it and fall out of love instead of in love. It doesn't make this movie any less powerful, involving and even uplifting to watch though. It's not a depressing movie by any means, despite of its themes and more slower type of storytelling.So it's a slower, more subtle and often visual orientated movie. Normally this style of film-making would often come across as pretentious, also because it's all obviously done in a deliberate and perhaps somewhat forced way. I mean, it's nothing that the movie truly needed to have in it but still it manages to add so much to the movie. It really helps to let the story move along and to establishes the mood for its characters and all of the particular situations. Even when not much is being said, you still exactly know what is going on in the character's minds at the moment.It's a 'different' movie but that doesn't mean it's being a hard, or odd one to watch. It's a perfectly accessible movie, mostly also due to its clear and straightforward storytelling, that might dwell but never strays off. It's truly a movie you need to experience for yourself and chances are you'll absolutely be grabbed by its storytelling and visual approach!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",In the Mood for Love
16,evanston_dad,In the Mood for a Truly Cinematic Film?,9,19 June 2008,"It can be surprisingly difficult to find truly cinematic films -- that is, films that tell their stories in a way unique to the medium. Kar Wai Wong's ""In the Mood for Love,"" therefore, will come as a welcome surprise to cinephiles. I can imagine this story being told in another medium, but certainly not in the way Wong tells it.Set in 1962 Hong Kong, the movie is about a lonely man and a lonely woman who live next door to each other, and who discover that their spouses are having an affair with one another. Thrown together out of mutual feelings of rejection and hurt, the two embark upon a timid friendship that gradually becomes something more. They vow not to become like their unfaithful spouses, but what they do become can not be completely categorized. The movie is vague about how far they take their friendship, but the vagueness feels right, for this is a film not about obvious emotions but rather about the complicated inner workings of the heart and mind that don't always allow for tidy answers.Wong shoots the film in a dreamy, slightly surrealistic fashion. Nothing about the film is overtly avant garde, yet it's not entirely accessible as a traditional narrative film. You might spend the first fifteen minutes or so somewhat confused, but stick with it. Everything eventually makes sense, but it only makes sense after Wong has established a certain pattern and rhythm. Early scenes only have meaning after you've seen scenes later in the film.This is one of those films that gets in your head and stays there. It reminded me at times of both ""Brief Encounter"" and of the films of Douglas Sirk.Grade: A",In the Mood for Love
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: (DVD) In the Mood for Love (2000),10,23 July 2006,"It's beautifully depressing.How someone you come to love, in a relationship that's forbidden and socially frowned upon from the onset, has decidedly moved on, while you cling onto and yet distract yourself from it, until the day you finally choose to call it quits, by trying hard to forget the bittersweet memories.That basically summed up the storyline in Wong Kar-wai's movie, with the title from a song of the same name, it's all about the mood. And key to bringing this mood to life, is the excellent production sets, art direction and costumes. Accurate to the littlest detail of how a 60s Shanghainese community in Hong Kong lived, I couldn't help but smile at the presence of an ""amah"", because I grew up as a toddler with one, kind of. And the language adds that bit of authenticity too. This movie did wonders for the cheong-sam, having Maggie Cheung appearing in different ones in most scenes to highlight time progression.And what is mood without the necessary music to punctuate the visually beautiful shots, by long time cinematographer and collaborator Christopher Doyle, and Lee Pin Bing? It's half the battle won in my opinion, that the musical pieces fill the gaps which lack dialogue and compliments the slow cinematic shots, and I'm addicted to the waltz of the main love theme. But it's one thing to have excellent music, and another when the music, effects and ambient noise are able to carry the entire movie on its own (you can select this audio track option from the Criterion Collection DVD).Now that the obvious statements about music, sets, costumes are out of the way, all these come to naught without a story. I'm glad that most of the scenes which were cut off, were done so, as they were quite cheesy, though humorous, and what remained from the 15 months production, tells a very mature, measured story on forbidden love in society's eyes, friendship and then more.There are plenty of material here which 2046, another movie which I enjoyed, had referenced, adapted and complimented, such as the hotel room, the writer in Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung), and his attitude in the sequel. One of my earlier Wong Kar-wai movies which I watched as a teen in the cinemas is Days of Being WIld, starring an ensemble cast which included Maggie Cheung, here as Mrs Chan, though I'd like to think of her movie's character here, as an extension of Su Li-zhen in Days (actually Wong provided her that character as a reference point when Maggie was asking incessantly questions about her character). And Tony's character in Days, a last moment cameo like appearance supposedly about a gambler in a never-made sequel, I'd liken it to Chow here, so in my own way, these movies form a loose trilogy.For those who have already watched the Korean movie April Snow, you would already realize that it borrows from the same theme of two characters, chancing upon each other by Fate, and learning that their respective spouses were having an affair with each other. While April Snow went for the common jugular in having the cheated upon spouses go head on with each other, In the Mood tackles it way too differently, providing loads of tension, and subtle teases, negating your want of the leads to develop their friendship into something more.And therein lies the strength of the movie. How Chow and Mrs Chan develop an unlikely friendship, which hints strongly at how it all could have been, under a 60s conservative environment, where they have to restrain their feelings for each other under society's judging eyes. Living in a communal environment too doesn't help their cause, even though it is pure to begin with - 2 lonely people, betrayed, and at times, tempted to take that leap of faith to challenge societal norms about love.Thankfully, potentially confusing ideas were not fully developed or made the final cut. There were thoughts to have the respective cheating spouses played by the same actors, but that would truly add to the confusion, The idea was developed separately into the ""what could have been"" and played out as various ""rehearsals"" as Chow and Mrs Chan try in their earlier quest to find out the whys and the hows their spouses could have gotten together, known each other, and started off the affair, but themselves vowing that they will never go down the same path.So in this vow already laid the foundations of how their friendship would be, and set a line in which their friendship could not cross nor develop into something more. And it's sometimes ironic too, that Mrs Chan, in her job, assists her boss in covering up his affairs. Kinda like a what-goes-around-comes-around.There are plenty of imagery throughout the movie that one could look into and try and interpret. I'd take forever in trying to list down all of mine, perhaps I'll do so one day when I own the DVD (saving to get my copy!), but I particularly liked the one at the restaurant where they finally learnt about their spouse's affair, and that long walk back home, where they walk, from out of step, into tandem. It's a becoming of 2 to 1, where lonely persons find solace in each other's company, especially in the scenes after.Anyway, all said, I love the movie, and it ranks up there with my all time favourites. If you were to watch it, make it none other than the Criterion Collection. (I'm not advertising for them, but I feel that this edition would help the viewer to appreciate the many rich layers more).",In the Mood for Love
18,siderite,"Great romantic movie, if you are in the mood for it",8,3 December 2013,"Pardon the pun, but the truth is I have seen this film twice. Once it just felt pretentious, frustrating and pointless. The second time it resonated with me and I could suddenly see the characters like a veil was lifted from my eyes. The movie's strength and weakness both stands in the way the characters express their feelings through micro expressions, through gestures that get unanswered or misunderstood.So it is pure romance, with the sweet agony of love, the bitter pain of betrayal, with tension that builds and builds throughout the film until one feels it must burst. Depending on your state of mind, it can be a boring story about people who don't know what they want, a painful depiction of people who cannot escape their culture, a cowardly dance or a deep characterization of real people who choose to make hard choices. The truth is somewhere in the middle with the film, though. Perhaps the ability to see different things in the film depending on your mood is a testament to its quality.This is not a romantic comedy, it's a romantic drama. It makes you think and feel and ask yourself questions, it doesn't release, amuse or entertain. The actors, the direction, the era, the music, all were chosen very well. A tad long, perhaps, but it is only to extend the viewer's perspective on opportunities lost and choices regretted and the feelings of the main characters. Good movie!",In the Mood for Love
19,=G=,"ZZZZzzzzzzz (snort)...Um, is it over yet?",6,8 December 2003,"""In the Mood for Love"" takes you back to Hong Kong in the 60's and introduces you to a married man and woman (Cheung & Leung)  who have neighboring apartments and spouses who are abroad and suspected of having extramarital affairs. This entire film is about said couple falling in like with each other while maintaining restraint so they won't be like their spouses. End of story. Artful and technically good with raves from just about everyone, ""In the Mood.."" is a sloth of a film which could have been much more than it was but it wasn't which is pretty much the point. Hence, if you like your Chinese subtitled flicks off center, underdone, moody, plaintive and all about yearning, you may buy into this snoozer which simply follows Cheung and Leung around while we watch them eat, talk, hold hands, and look woebegone as they long for one another. Cheung is always dressed to kill with bird of paradise eye lashes and a coiffure which looks like it's been sprayed with shellac. Personally, I think it would have been nice to see her let her hair down in every way. Whatever. (B-)",In the Mood for Love
20,paul2001sw-1,Overly reserved,5,12 May 2013,"'In the Mood for Love' won awards at Cannes, but it passed me by entirely. A stylised portrait of an unconsummated relationship between two neighbours both cheated on by their spouses, it combines a visual and aural reconstruction of domestic life in 1960s Hong Kong with the director's strange desire to shoot almost every scene down a corridor or through a doorway: I've seen few movies where I had less sense of where each location fitted in a wider landscape. This certainly gives the film a distinctive feel, but with its inconsequential dialogue and plot - every moment is really about what's not said and not done - I struggled to follow it: with little actually happening, I lost track of what actually was happening, and the subtlety that I assume was intended sailed over my head. I like films that don't spell out everything to the viewer, and the point of this one is that its protagonists don't spell out anything to each other; but surely something has to be done to command the attention of the audience. The movie attempts this through its sense of style; but for me, that wasn't enough.",In the Mood for Love
21,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A tender affair.,7,29 July 2019,"What's refreshing about the central romance of 'In The Mood For Love (2000)' is how it's presented as being purely of the mind, heart and soul instead of just the body. This is especially revelatory when you consider that it's actually an extra-marital affair of sorts, which are usually demonised and displayed as pure acts of nature-driven hedonism. The film favours implication above all else, usually leaving the frame devoid of almost everything except its two leads. It only shows exactly what it needs to, often skipping huge chunks of time between scenes. This creates a near scene-by-scene experience that requires constant reorientation. It's not confusing, though, as it actually forms a rather cohesive whole. Wong Kar-Wai often toys with his own unconventional construction to play around with audience expectation, paving the way for the flick's most devastating and emotionally-revealing scene. These moments wouldn't be possible if the filmmaker didn't fully lean into his own unique style and, as such, they feel incredibly satisfying. The same can't be said of the oddly-paced final movement, which eschews the previously established structure and setting to somewhat artificially extend the story past its, perhaps, logical end. It's not an awful segment, by any means, but it doesn't compare to that which came before and causes the narrative to 'fade out', if you will. Of course, this whimper of an ending is intentional and the lack of traditional closure is a bold choice, one that's ultimately welcome and is only possible because of the genuine investment built up prior. After a somewhat slow opening act, the picture becomes much more compelling. It's not long before you're invested in the tender relationship between the two somewhat trodden-on central characters, hopeful for the best but wary of the world in which they find themselves. Their chemistry is palpable, if mostly unspoken. This delicate balance between romance and realism is what keeps things feeling fresh, constantly teetering on the edge of love and friendship. The slow cinematography highlights every beautiful moment and the grounded screenplay (or lack thereof) keeps things seeming achingly true. Refreshingly, its style is integral to its storytelling. It's a distinct, self-assured experience that's strangely enjoyable. 7/10",In the Mood for Love
22,richardchatten,Super Stylish Mood Piece,7,2 January 2017,"If you want to make a film about passion you can't do better than make a film about passion unconsummated (and the couple in this film barely get further than holding hands), and if you want to make a super-stylish movie about beautiful people you can do far worse than return to the buttoned-down early sixties. William Chang's award-winning make-up and costumes vividly evoke late Sirk, Hitchcock & Ozu and early Resnais, and probably helped inspire 'Mad Men'.One wonders where Maggie Cheung finds the room in her tiny flat to store the breath-taking succession of figure-hugging qipaos she models (doesn't she ever wear slacks?); and putting an action heroine in such constricting clothes heightens the controlled passion of her performance to a pitch that matches the saturated colour images created by Christopher Doyle & Mark Lee Ping Lee. One finds oneself speculating, however, as to what she looks like first thing in the morning in a dressing gown with dishevelled hair; unless Ms Cheung somehow emerges fully formed every day looking like the cover girl of a 1962 Hong Kong edition of 'Vogue'.",In the Mood for Love

(2) The film is on the  Top 250 list of highest rated films.Having watched this, I can't possibly understand how this can be one of the highest rated movies. This is one of the most restraint (boring!) love stories I have ever seen. I mean, hell, could this have been any more boring???The director used very unusual camerawork and I'm not sure I like it. Some angles made me believe he desperately tried to make an art movie (which I suppose it is). This could easily have been a stage play, and actually also looks and feels like one. We never get to see Chow's wife, or Chan's husband.'In the mood for love' is incredibly slow moving and more often than not gave me a sense of deja vu. How many times do I want to see them eat noodles?? How many times must they get caught in the rain?? How many times must they show Chan walking in slow motion?? I felt like playing the film in fast forward (I'm certain, even then, I wouldn't have missed much). Even the dialogue was repetitive.

26,tomgillespie2002,Achingly romantic,9,22 May 2017,"The second of an unofficial trilogy by Chinese director Wong-Kar Wai which started with Days of Being Wild (1990) and concluded with 2046 (2004), it would be difficult to describe and appreciate In the Mood for Love without using the words beautiful, sumptuous and erotic. For a film trying to capture the pure eroticism and sweeping romance of the meeting between lost souls, there is precious little dialogue or conventional narrative, with Wong instead choosing to tell this story through gorgeous visuals and, to steal a word from the film's English-language title, an overbearing sense of mood. Continuing with the semi-improvised, free-flowing approach that brought him international success with the likes of Chungking Express (1994) and Happy Together (1997), In the Mood for Love is an achingly romantic experience, and may just be his finest work.Set mostly around a cramped apartment block in 1962 Hong Kong, the central 'love' story is between Mr. Chow (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung), who, along with their spouses, rent a room in neighbouring flats. They regularly eat alone at night as their other halves call to say they are working overtime, and they both suspect infidelity. eventually coming to the conclusion that Mrs. Chow and Mr. Chan are indeed having an affair. Despite the ever-presence of the pleasant Mrs. Suen (Rebecca Pan) and her mahjong-playing friends, the couple feel isolated and alone, often venturing out to the nearby noodle stand to purchase a meal for one. The two start to bond through imagining and even re-enacting how their spouses met and courted each other, while insisting their own blossoming relationship remains platonic. But feelings are developed and suppressed, with things intensifying when they begin work on a martial arts serial, renting a hotel room to escape the gossiping of neighbours.The era in which the film is set not only gives the opportunity for some exquisite costume design (Mrs. Chan's colourful dresses radiate sensuality), but also offers the chance to reflect on a more conservative, socially-conforming time. While the couple refuse to allow their friendship to boil over into romance, there are still whispers and raised eyebrows. With this kind of secrecy and restraint forced upon them, they are made to pass each other on the street with barely an acknowledgement, and this is where Wong's style becomes the substance. Sexual tension is captured by the brush of a hand, a sideways glance, and even the dipping of meat in hot sauce. In the film's most effective scene, they pass each other on a stairwell, barely daring to offer the other a glance, just as the rain starts to lash down to bring them together under shelter. Where most films will have their characters lay their romantic cards on the table, Wong says so much more with repressing as much as possible, climaxing in a haunting final scene set amongst the ruined temples Angkor Wat in Cambodia.",In the Mood for Love
27,Thanos_Alfie,Nothing special...,6,17 March 2015,"""In the Mood for Love"" is a drama movie in which we watch two neighbors a woman and a man creating a bond because they are both left alone from their spouses. They left alone because their spouses have many works but they believe that their spouses have something more than this. So in order to avoid the same mistakes as their spouses did they keep their bond platonic but everything can change because the line between friendship and love is very thin.I think that this movie is not something special but nothing more than interesting. The plot is quite good but as I said before not something extraordinary that will change your world. Although I believe that the direction of this movie which made by Kar Wai Wong was good. I also want to say that I liked the interpretations of Tony Chiu Wai Leung who played as Chow Mo-wan and Maggie Cheung who played as Su Li-zhen - Mrs. Chan.Finally I believe that ""In the Mood for Love"" is a simple movie and nothing more. I also believe that is overrated for this kind of movie because I have seen better drama movies which are combined even better with romance, that's why I rated this movie with 6 / 10.",In the Mood for Love
28,Red-125,"The better title is ""Golden Years""",9,28 June 2020,"The Hong Kong movie Fa yeung nin wah (2000) was shown in the U.S. with the title In the Mood for Love. I think that the better title is the original Chinese title, Golden Years. (If you watch the movie, you'll see what I mean.) The film was written and directed by Kar-Wai Wong.Maggie Cheung plays Su Li-zhen, a married woman who moves into a new apartment. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung portrays Chow Mo-wan, a married man who moves into the apartment down the hall. Early in the movie, it becomes evident to the two of them that their spouses are having an affair. What happens next is the basis for the movie's plot.Tony Chiu-Wai Leung has been called the Asian Clark Gable. He's extremely handsome, and often portrays dark, brooding men. Maggie Cheung's appearance makes us wonder if she's of the same species as the rest of us.Not only is she beautiful, but she's dressed in the height of fashion. In every scene she appears to be wearing a different elegant dress. I've never mentioned the costume designer in a movie I've reviewed, so this is a first. Ms. Cheung's costumes were designed by William Chang, who is a genius.This is a serious movie about a serious subject--adultery. It's not a feel-good movie. Most of the time it's raining in Hong Kong, where the streets are empty and gloomy. As the title implies, there's romance in this film, but it's not Doris Day and Rock Hudson, or Diane Lane and John Cusack, or Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. We see a more brooding, tentative romance here.In the Mood for Love worked well on DVD. It has an extremely high 8.1 IMDb rating. In fact, it's one of the IMDb's top 250 films of all time. I thought it was even better than that, and rated it 9.",In the Mood for Love
29,SAMTHEBESTEST,Thanks to Hong Kong Cinema for Finally providing an Intelligent and Intellectual Classic in dumb Romance Genre..,8,15 July 2020,"In The Mood For Love (2000) :Thanks to Hong Kong Cinema for Finally providing an Intelligent and Intellectual Classic in dumb Romance Genre. I believe Romance/Love is one of the most dumb genre for films because the things happening in these films are totally senseless. More than True love or sacrifice what we get to see is Kisses, Sex, Break Up, Patch Up, Affairs and then silly dramatic reconciliation. If i have to name a few films which i felt were quite Intelligent in this Romance/Love Triangle/Foursome theories then those Hollywood flicks would be Dodsworth, Casablanca and Brief Encounter. Finally after a long gap i have found an intelligent, intellectual, emotional and moving film having pure form of Love and it comes from Hong Cong 'In The Mood For Love'. Yes this is it. It's time to forget all those overrated romance chapters from 70s, 80s and 90s and remember this film forever for what it has done in this dumb genre. The film is about a man and a woman who form a strong feelings and bond after suspecting extramarital activities of thier spouses but decides to keep it platonic so as not to commit the same mistake as thier spouses. This film doesn't have a single kissing scene yet it has the deepest reach i have ever seen in this genre. You know true doesn't need lusty angle and if you are from those smart audience who believe in this theory then you just can't miss In The Mood For Love. This seperation is far more better and lovable than those absurd reconciliations we see in almost every film. The bleak ending is terrific and end up making lot more sense towards Real True Love Saga missing forever in cinema world. The cinematography is brilliant i mean so freaking innovative. Acting, background score and Direction is Top Notch. Nothing left to make complaints. This is a Must Watch but you should keep Hong Kong laws in mind to not complaint about some choices made by the characters.RATING - 8.5/10*",In the Mood for Love
30,Vartiainen,"Subtle and careful movie about love, commitment and betrayal",8,7 July 2017,"In Hong Kong in the 1960s, a man and a woman end up living as neighbours. At first they're casual acquaintances, finding some common areas of interest, but barely more than that. Their bond deepens when they find that their spouses might be having an affair with each other. This brings them closer, but they vow not to repeat the sin that has brought them together.In the Mood for Love is a very different kind of love story. It talks just as much about loneliness and the need for human connection as it talks about love or lust or any of that stuff. Both Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung) and Mr. Chow (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) live lives surrounded by people. Their apartments are rented rooms in other people's houses. Those people are rarely more than a doorway away, yet a recurring theme of the movie is them eating alone in their rooms or out on a stand somewhere. Only in each other they find that something that sparks a connection. Yet in 60s Hong Kong their friendship is something they have to hide, something they cannot share with others, adding to their isolation.The story alone is strong enough, but it's also told beautifully. Both of the main actors are superb in their roles, with Maggie Cheung especially pulling off a role of a lifetime. But a huge part of the film's success is also thanks to its director Kar-Wai Wong, who gives the whole film a dreamlike existence. Loneliness is expressed through meaningless of time. Lots of scenes are very similar with one another or they seem to move fluidly from one to another, but suddenly you realize that a significant amount of time has passed. One of the tricks through which this is shown being the changing dresses of Mrs. Chan. The film contains multiple small touches like that, but I shall not ruin them here for you.In fact, time loses so much of its meaning that it's almost recommended to see this movie twice to get the full experience. The friendship and romance between the two main characters is a slow thing and sometimes you realize only a few scenes later that something important already happened.Powerful film and well worth a double-viewing.",In the Mood for Love
31,Polaris_DiB,Diagonals and dances,8,23 February 2007,"And now Asian cinema has outdone the West in romantic comedies as well. Our options run short.Wong Kar Wai's ""In the Mood for Love"" is the story of two neighboring tenants with absent spouses who develop a friendship/love of each other. They promise each other that they will not be like their cheating spouses, but as they spend more time with each other they felt more drawn and comfortable with the other as time passes.The literal use of absent spouses (never seeing their faces, hardly seeing their presence) is a very good and surprisingly original way of representing the loneliness these characters face. Both of them are kind-hearted and interesting people, but also very normal and recognizable, and to feel their loneliness is rather heartbreaking. It's backed up with a certain use of mise-en-scene which involves a screen clutter... I believe the tendency would be to say that there are many ""frames within frames"" in this movie, but the borders and lines that bisect the camera don't really frame the action but block out and divide things, often isolating a single character or maybe a group of people out-of-sight to present a form of almost existential crisis. People are everywhere, the world is full, and yet making a connection is difficult. It's hardly surprising, then, that when the the friendship blossoms, the screens clear and we see more of the characters than before.Another very good aspect of this production is the music. It's very romantic, in a dance-like way. It's almost like the two characters are tangoing through their lives alone when they meet and their dance is complete. The music is immersive and makes the whole movie reach an emotional level beyond most people's expectations.This was the first Wong Kar Wai movie I've ever seen, but I'm definitely going to check out more of his oeuvre based on this experience.--PolarisDiB",In the Mood for Love

In contemporary times, it is in Asian cinema that this element has been found. If one looks closely at this film, it is not only the Hong Kong director Wong Kar Wai but also the Australian cinematographer Christopher Doyle who have virtually cashed on this aspect by making the leading actress Maggie Chaung appear as highly sensual,seductive and alluring.""In the mood for love"" also gives allusions about unrequited love made coherent through maximum use of closed spaces. It also looks as if the filmmaker is trying to convey that closed spaces are fruitful in bringing human beings closer to one another.As far as mystery element is concerned it has been depicted by not showing the respective spouses of the couple in love.

33,drqshadow-reviews,Shared Heartache and Honorable Uncertainty Bring a Young Couple Together... and Drive Them Apart,7,20 October 2017,"Set in Hong Kong, 1962, In the Mood for Love depicts a pair of quiet, introverted neighbors who discover that their spouses have been carrying on an extramarital affair. As a means of coping with this mutual heartbreak, they begin spending time together - bonding over martial arts serials and a mutual curiosity about their significant others' double lives - and are shocked to uncover the flicker of a budding romance themselves. Their sense of honor, propriety and, perhaps, a jolt of fear stands in the way, though, and the pair treads cautiously lest they commit the same sins that first brought them together. That central conundrum proves impossible, ultimately, and it's an issue the film never completely resolves despite toying with the subject for quite a while. Which, in a way, is the most relatably authentic path it could've chosen. Sometimes life is defined by what happens between those narrowly-missed connections, those epic romances that could've been but weren't. Actually reaching that conclusion is somewhat laborious, as director Wong Kar-Wai dallies about with only faint plot developments for most of the duration, but I didn't mind that so much. The marvelous cinematography, rich supporting cast and lush, detail-laden scenery provides interest where the story itself might otherwise fall short.",In the Mood for Love

A wonderfully evocative film about unfulfilled love. Set in Hong Kong about 40 years ago it brings out some of the wonder of the culture in haunting and memorable images. Maggie Cheung is utterly wonderful (as she should be by now - I understand she's made over 70 movies). Both lead characters have fantastic subtlety. Orientals generally tend to portray emotion less openly, so the nuances are a revelation. The pace of the story is also one of subtlety. Favourite tricks include leaving one scene half unexplained as to some minor detail but with our interest piqued - finding the answers as if unravelled to a casual bystander a scene or two later. (You have to concentrate - occasionally it's almost too subtle for it's own good and you wonder if you're losing the place as the oriental faces blend into each other with half-explained scenarios). Sometimes the camera perchances on a scene of hidden emotional depth and we realizes only a moment or two later that the characters were rehearsing possibilities as they work out the emotional consequences of what the future may hold. One comes out of the cinema with the feeling that one has been privileged to witness an intimacy of great beauty, a rare masterpiece.",In the Mood for Love
35,noralee,Very Intense Look at Longing and Guilt,9,20 December 2005,"""In The Mood For Love (Fa yeung nin wa)"" shows that there's still something new filmmakers can bring to a very old subject, the impact of adultery. Here we only see the cuckolded spouses.Situated in the specifics of crowded Hong Kong in the early 1960's to intensify the proximities, the spouses become next door neighbors, v-e-r-y gradually (yeah, there was some snoring in the theater) realize their connection, then try and understand the emotions and the morality of their unseen cheating mates by reenacting critical decision points they assume must have occurred.The fantasy vs. the reality gets a bit confusing to us and overwhelms the characters with guilt just by the power of their feelings. The camera's intensity in communicating longing is a double-edged sword for Western audiences of playing on some visual ""Oriental"" stereotypes.For a woman living in a one-room apartment, the wife has more ""Suzi Wong"" type, very tight dresses than a department store, with a different one on in every blink of the lens, and wow does she look fabulous in them as the camera lingers on her fully-clothed body parts (the audience commented afterwards that even the PG rating seemed too restrictive). The man gets only a couple of visual leers.The finale in Angor Watt seems a bit unnecessary with its heavy symbolism. It's frustrating that the songs on the soundtrack are clearly commenting on the emotions but they are mostly Nat King Cole singing in Italian or Spanish, with one Chinese pop number thrown in, so that nuance is lost to English-speakers.(originally written 2/17/2001)",In the Mood for Love

His wife and her husband are cheating on them, and they know it. They talk about it, even try to figure out how that has happened with a role play. The man and the woman probably love each other, want each other, but to give in to that would make them as low as their spouses, so they say.Since this is not a Hollywood movie things happen as they should happen. The movie is quiet, and the songs by Nat King Cole add a lot to this atmosphere. There is a theme, Yumeji's theme, that plays when the man and the woman realize what is going on, when they pass each other in the hall. It is one of those themes of some kind of rare beauty, perfect for the tone of the movie, sad but beautiful. An intelligent and moving story is what 'In the Mood for Love' tells.",In the Mood for Love
40,Spleen,"Reasonably attractive, needlessly oblique, mostly tedious",5,2 May 2002,"Yes, it looks good.  It's soft and dingy and glows with colour.  Each shot is nicely framed just so (by a camera that appears to be spying on the central characters, always looking at them from behind something, or through a half-open doorway ... for no good reason at all, so far as I could tell, but I'm willing to grant it was an attractive gimmick).  I liked the music. I can't fault the acting.  So far as world-spinning goes (with a telling exception I'll get to in a moment), I'm forced to admit the film doesn't set a foot wrong.Yet at times I was so bored I felt like gnawing off one of my legs.  What was it with these people?  Why didn't they just get on with it?  What was STOPPING them from getting together, if they wanted to so much?  (I presume they wanted to, otherwise the film really had no point.)Two answers have been offered, which I'll take in turn:(1)  The social setting.  In Hong Kong at this time, adultery was frowned upon, the two would have been outcast, etc.  Now, I'll admit I don't know the first thing about what Hong Kong was like circa 1960, but the setting is whatever we see it to be on screen, and what we SAW was a crowded city in which people could move in and out of anonymity as they wished - in which people could move into an apartment building in which nobody recognised them, and get away with it.  (The spouses of the central characters were having an affair, and THEY, in some sense, got away with it.)  I suppose it partly depends on the extent to which people were tied to their jobs, but this is something we never found out, despite the constant references to and images of workplaces.(2)  The protagonists' own sense of duty.  Chow and Li-zhen ""didn't want to be as bad"" as their spouses.  But they wouldn't have been.  The sense we get - since we never see the spouses - is that they have been abandoned, more or less, and are free, MORALLY free, to go their own way.  If they slept together nobody would be hurt, in all probability nobody would even care, and no contract, implicit or explicit, would be violated.  As for the theory that Chow and Li-zhen just mindlessly adopted the moral code of their surroundings, this insults their intelligence.  They don't come across as being either so mindless or so conventional.The self-imposed celibacy and separation of these two remains a mystery, although not an interesting one.  One person here has suggested that they DO sleep together, that the child we see briefly at the end, is THEIR child, which they didn't want to be stigmatised as a bastard.  I'm not sure this makes the best sense of the elliptical hints we're given at the end.  (Why does Chow act as though the child is news to him, if it's the very reason they separated?)  But if it is, it only makes me more annoyed with the film's opacity.  What is this, a cryptic crossword?  You could take Charles Dickens's ""Great Expectations"", remove every other paragraph, and you'd be left with something which set the reader the same difficult and thankless task this film sets the audience.  The book would not thereby be improved.It's also odd that the ending shatters the mood, the building of which had been the film's main selling point so far.  Suddenly, a key part of the story is told with narration and stock news video footage of Vietnam.  I can't view this as anything other than an admission of failure on the part of the director.P.S.:  I'm sick of hearing that understated facial expressions and hand gestures are SO much more erotic than blatant nudity, and I'm even more sick of hearing that this is because they ""leave more to the viewer's imagination"".  It's true that ""In the Mood for Love"" leaves some things to the imagination, like the precise shape of Maggie Cheung's breasts.  But films that are less coy about such matters can leave far MORE to the imagination - such things as the characters' emotional response, for instance.  It's really just a question of what turns you on.  This stuff didn't turn me on.  Should it have?",In the Mood for Love

42,Seraphion,Excellent focus play through less emotional outbursts,8,5 August 2014,"This movie allures me with its charming background of old 1960s Hong Kong middle class flats. Also the story starts up nicely with the well designed screenplay of coincidence. Having big names of Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, that coincidence played out so very interestingly. At first I thought It was for the sake of art that the Mr. Chan and Mrs. Chow characters aren't in-frame. But later I realize that the thing is a guaranteed way to make sure that the focus only aims at the two focus characters that Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung plays. I really like how technicalities are done. The coloring of the entire movie emphasize the aura of the 60s era even more. The tight sets increase the implied focus of Hong Kong middle class workers. The camera angles really maximize the tight sets, and with all those sliding camera shots, zoomed stills, and detailed props, this movie makes you feel reeled into the exact time and place of the setting. The scenes also make the movie feel so lonesome, and even though it has some crucial scenes shot at daytime, the movie feels as though it's all at night. The acting is just great. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung did great to portray the disappointed spouses. The story can be told implicitly and beautifully, with no graphic scenes. An 8 out of 10, which is quite rare from me, is very deserving for this movie.",In the Mood for Love
43,RainDogJr,Wong Kar Wai !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,8,22 May 2007,"I finally saw In the mood for love and of course i understand better the character of Chow (Tony Leung) because well i saw first the film 2046.In the mood for love is film about love, lonely, friendship and well all the others things that Wong Kar Wai always put in his films.In this film Chow (the same writer of 2046) move to a new house with his wife. By the same time a woman named Su Li zhen (Maggie Cheung)also move to that same house with her husband.We can see how Chow and Su Li zhen are most of the time without his respective couples because the husband of Su Li zhen is a always in Japan and Chow's wife is also always getting late because of her work.Then Chow and Su Li zhen starts to hanging around and one day the discover that their couples are having an affair.....this make a shock to the two main characters and also make that they start to hanging more and starts an affair.Chow fells in love with Sue Li zhen and when he needs to move to Singapur for matters of business, he invites her but she refused the invitation of Chow.Well this is a resume of the film and well you must see if love others works of Wong Kar Wai and also to see the complete trilogy: Days of being wild, In the mood for love and 2046. You can see it separated and you will understand the film because there are only connected in the characters of Chow and Su Li zhen.Finally i want to agree that for me about the trilogy, the best is 2046 but In the mood for love is also a very original and beautiful film that you must see.Conclusion: in think that the phrase: still you love a person and finds a lot of things in common, if you don't meet this person in the right time you wont have a good relation with the person. This idea is the base of the two films with the character of Chow, first with Su Li zhen and in 2046 with Wang Jing (Faye Wong)",In the Mood for Love
44,nycritic,Regrets from a Lost Opportunity,8,16 March 2005,"Set in 1962 Hong Kong (in turbulent times, as we are informed), this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between a two married people tied to their traditions manages to recall the essence of old Hollywood in scene after scene of lush colors, evocative yet restrained sensuality (as opposed of the requisite sexuality and occasional nude scenes which has become part of the norm of a romance in film), and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication. It's not hard to see the influence of Marguerite Duras here, since she is known for minimalism in storytelling as well as describing powerful drama using the art of verbal and non-verbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as well as the use of re-enacting scenes that could eventually take place in both the characters' lives. From Hiroshima MON AMOUR to MODERATO CANTABILE, her pen is strongly visible here from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) to the last scenes which explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls the opportunity which was lost in reaffirming this relationship.The plot even resembles something that Duras could have written: Mr. Chow and Mrs. Su Li-zhen, neighbors in a tenement apartment while both being fairly successful professionals, begin to discover in the most banal of ways that their spouses are cheating on them, and they discover quite naturally, it's with each other. The question is, should they act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners? Every scene plays with the notion that at any moment they will give in to each other, and at one point, it is suggested that eventually they do though as intrusive as the camera is in detailing to us their encounters (which seem to occur on a daily basis as seen by the frequent changes of Cheung's dresses), we never see it. And just as not seeing either of their spouses heightens their own love story, not seeing them carry through with their attraction makes the eventual separation even the more bitter because at every moment we want for something to happen -- some catalyst -- and the only one which comes is when Leung reveals to her that he loves her, followed by his quietly brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband, which implies that neither will he. It also gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do: from a Western point of view, a consummation of their romance into a more solid, lasting affair would have been possible especially in the 60s, but as it's Hong Kong, cultural values are markedly different.Performances here are of the high order: it's very easy to play a torrid love affair, but to continually play a repressed, platonic relationship that is brimming with desire only barely suggested is hard and makes all the sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual. Cheung and Leung smolder and their blighted chemistry lingers long after the credits have rolled.",In the Mood for Love
45,philip_vanderveken,Take your time and enjoy,8,10 March 2005,"""Fa yeung nin wa"" or ""In the Mood for Love"" as it is called in English is a very beautiful, romantic movie. It is far from what we are used to get from Hollywood as it isn't corny, mellow, too soft or whatever you would like to call it. It's just beautiful and well-crafted.The story is situated in 1962, in Hong Kong, where two families move into neighboring apartments. In the first apartment Chow Mo-Wan, a newspaper editor, moves in with his wife. At approximately the same time, Su Li-zhen, a beautiful secretary also moves in with her executive husband. Both Chow's wife and Su Li-zhen's husband are almost never at home, because of their jobs. But they suspect that their spouses aren't telling them the truth and that in reality they are having an affair. Because they are always alone they start spending more and more time together. This leads to friendship and love. But the fact that they spend so much time together and that they start to have feelings for each other will never be tolerated by society...In a way this is a typical Asian movie. Some might say that the movie is slow, I say that the director has taken his time to portray his characters and to develop the entire story. And he has done a very nice job. The way everything was shot is absolutely beautiful and the actors did a terrific job. I give this movie a 7.5/10, maybe even an 8/10.",In the Mood for Love
46,valadas,A curious movie,7,4 June 2015,"This is a love story very different from what we use to see in movies. No romantic excesses and no sex at all, not even a kiss. A married man and a married woman who feel somewhat abandoned by their consorts who are away for long periods, become neighbours and start a friendship relation. But friendship between man and woman although possible has often a narrow and fragile border with love and in this case it changes into love although keeping always a platonic, restrained and chaste way revealed only by shy dialogues. The story develops itself through quiet and smooth images and words which are sufficient to let us know the dramatic spiritual inside of them both. They end up by realizing that their love is impossible and turn away from each other. The movie ends with a poetic image of the Angkor Vat Temple in Cambodia which stresses its spiritual climax already shown before in the facial and corporal expressions of both protagonists. The quiet atmosphere of the movie seduces and captivates us.",In the Mood for Love
47,frankde-jong,One of the most beautiful uses of slow motion ever,8,21 May 2021,"""In the mood for love"" is a film about adultery. Contrary to other films about this subject however, it is the victims of adultery who are central. ""In the mood for love"" thereby becomes also a film about loneliness.The two victims (played by Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung) become involved wth each other but, in order not to make the same mistake as their spouses, the involvement remains entirely Platonic. In ""In the mood for love"" not a happy ending a la ""When Harry met Sally"" (1989, Rob Reiner).Kar-Wai Wong shows the rapprochement between Maggie and Tony in very beautiful images. When they are passing each other by a take away restaurant for noodles, the images are in slow motion. Twenty years earlier Martin Scorsese received high praise for his use of slow motion images in ""Raging bull"" (1980), but to be honest I think the ones in ""In the mood for love"" are much more effective.Kar-Wai Wong regularly uses intermediate shots. Contrary to the ones used by Yasujiro Ozu these are however full of meaning and symbolism. The shot of a clock ticking symbolizes time that is (slowly) passing. Images of a rotating ceiling fan suggests an atmosphere that is sweltering and maybe also a little bit sultry.In the film Maggie Cheung wears different colors almost every scene. She looks beautiful in her long dresses with high collars (locally called ""Cheongsams"").

49,crossbow0106,Just Great,10,10 February 2008,"Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung give the performances of their careers in this film. The film, set in 1962 as we meet the two main characters, shows a dark Hong Kong. Ms. Cheung, as Mrs. Chan, moves in with her husband next to Mr. Leung's Mr. Chow. They suspect their respective spouses of infidelity and grow closer. The film unfolds slowly but brilliantly. Even the original music by Michael Galasso and the songs by Nat King Cole (how much more romantic can that be?) carry this film. Maggie Cheung looks amazing, beautiful and devastatingly sexy. You really cannot take your eyes off her in each scene she is in. The movie has a sly mystery attached to it, the speculation being how far these two main characters went in their relationship. That is at least part of the genius of this film. Done in a art house style, sometimes moody & ominous, it also portrays perfectly the loneliness in some relationships. See it, its a classic.",In the Mood for Love
50,sharky_55,Agonising,10,10 September 2015,"Maggie Cheung's Mrs Chan and Tony Leung's Mr Chow are husband and wife, but not to each other. Cheung is dressed gorgeously in no less than 46 Cheongsam dresses, each vivid and ornate, and often descends from the shared apartment in this formal dress and make-up to purchase noodles for a lonely dinner. Leung's hair is always immaculately gelled and styled, and he wears his one wrinkled grey suit with a sense of modesty in his presentation. They are in the mood for love, but they do not consummate it, for fears of becoming just like their cheating spouses. Wong Kar-wai's direction ensures that Mr Chan and Mr Chow are never quite clearly sighted face to face, through precise blocking and composition. In one transition, we see Mrs Chow, her back facing towards us via mirror, making another of her excuses over the phone to a lonely Chow at home. We then cut to the same mirror, with Chow now inquiring at her wife's work, his face full and revealing, flushed with honesty, sincerity, and looming heartbreak. The first of the those evocative slow motion moments, where the tender and mournful strings of Yumeji's Theme and the rhythmic Pizzicato plucks rise, has Mrs Chow then Mrs Chan enter the dining room, both with a sense of elegance and beauty. These recurring musical motifs signal each little moment of weakness, of coincidence, of intimacy through unspoken words and emotions. They brush past each other whilst purchasing meals for one in the alleyway, they work closely (but not too closely) on the martial arts serial, they lament their separation and missed opportunities. One time, her hand flirts away when he tries to hold it. Later, they fully wrap around each other and provide comfort in the bottom lit taxi. They belong to their respective spouses, but in that first scene we are already shown an inkling of what is to come. There's a clever moment where we open with a OTS shot of a man and Su having dinner, where she brings up those fateful accusatory words. The confrontation is allowed to continue and simmer with denial, before we finally cut to reveal that they have been simulating the whole thing. But it's remarkably authentic - they choose to wound themselves with imaginary dialogue, too scared to face reality. Doyle's (and later Ping Bing's) cinematography plays plenty with depth of field, often framing Chow and Su's moments from behind curtains, or blinds, or shutters of a cupboard, which are in the foreground and blurry whereas the pair are crystal clear in their emotional intimacy and lack of physical intimacy. This voyeuristic aesthetic works within the context of socially conservative Hong Kong of the 1960s - the supporting cast do well to create an aura of gossip, judgement and scrutiny of every tiny detail of the pair's lives, even more so in the shared proximity of the apartment. Mrs Suen misreads the recipient of a letter from a spouse abroad, and that little mistake is enough to create a storm of doubt and fear within both Su and Chow. My parents lived through this period of HK, and by all accounts the cramped, claustrophobic set is pitch perfect, right down to the fly screen cupboards that served as makeshift fridges. It's limited in scope and size, encapsulating the lack of space and privacy of urban Hong Kong. But it's not grimy; these families live in relative financial comfort in spite their domestic strife. Lush reds, browns, yellow and greens saturate and seep into the screen and work with the bold multicoloured dresses and the noir elements - in one scene a lonely Chow retreats at night to his office, framed by the single overhead light of his desk, the swirls of cigarette smoke billowing in the light and shade. Doyle cuts off the heads frequently and lingers on the body language and the attire, on the pretense of innocence and naivety. A simple dolly of the camera from wall to wall emphasises each lonely soul, so close and yet so far apart. In a lesser film, the presence of convenient downpours of rain might be criticised for a plot device in bringing together a couple. Here, it becomes tragic, because although they have the opportunity (the whole double spouse cheating plot is pretty much a rom-com script waiting to be written), they can't bear to take it. When Su finally gains the courage, she is too late, and the film slows down to an agonising pace where Chow waits for no one in the corridor, the same place Su later stands still, the red of her dress matching the curtains. A hotel, ripe for infidelity, is the location for innocent activities, unable to bridge the gap. In that final scene, Chow travels to Cambodia, finding a hole into the stone of the Angkor Wat Temple before whispering a heavy secret and covering up any presence of his visit with an earthly mound of soil. We then cut, and the soil is now sprouting blades of grass - he has carried this secret with him beyond time. In the Mood for Love is about two people, wrapped up in intimacy yet so full of guilt and sadness and despair for what they have done, and what they haven't. My heart breaks for them.",In the Mood for Love

53,AhmedSpielberg99,Thank god I postponed watching this movie until I am in the right..... mood!,8,11 November 2018,"I always wandered how a WKW film would be, if it was less focused on atmosphere, and more concerned about its narrative. And In the Mood for Love is definitely this movie. The plot of this movie is more cohesive than of the other Wong Kar-wai films.The rest of his films don't have a conventional plot, but rather disjointed beautiful and hypnotic sequences that allow emotions to flow through them. This is not the case here. In the Mood for Love still doesn't have a linear narrative in the traditional way, I mean it's still a WKW film, but the movie has a more contained narrative to say the least.Unfortunately, the movie didn't hit me emotionally as much as it should. Don't get me wrong, I was moved by the movie even more than every WKW I've watched so far, with the exception of Chungking Express. The issues I had with Days of Being Wild and Fallen Angels are what kept me from being fully emotionally engaged, but as for In the Mood for Love, it's the over-control upon the movie's story that deprived me from being entirely connected emotionally. It may sounds strange, but that's what I felt, and in all probability that's what many people also feel if they have been already familiar with Wong Kar-wai style.I don't want to seem as if I'm just creating problems, or make some flaws up out of no where, but I felt that some emotions and feelings passed quickly without hitting me hard.On the other hand, having control on the narrative aspect of the movie, Wong Kar-wai's poetic visual style became more mature. You can easily identify his trademarks, which the movie is full of them; playing with the time, using elliptical editing, and repeating songs, but they are utilized in a more beneficial and purposeful way, hence more delicate and exquisite way.Even the beauty of the cinematography is different from those of Wong Kar-wai's other works. Here the beauty comes from the sumptuous colour palette more than anything else. In the Mood for Love is unquestionably one of the best movies in cinematic history in terms of using colours. The colours here set the mood, and keep enriching it throughout the film's fleeting runtime.However, the characters of this movie along with the performances are the real pleasure I got from. All the subtlety of the characters are brought out by a magnificent cast. Tony Leung Chiu-Wai is quite possibly one of the most talented actors ever. His performance is simply ingenious. Maggie Cheung is equally terrific, if equally, perhaps marginally inferior in comparison Leung, but it's her character that astonished me. Unlike Days of Being Wild's Su Li-Zhen, this character her is jaw-droppingly multi-layered. And the way the brilliant script delves into her is just mind-blowing. Every time Leung's character, Chow, shares the screen with her unravels a new layer in her character, while showcases the talents of the two lead, especially Leung's unique gift.The masterful combination of the ingenious symbolism of Wong Kar-wai, and the movie's sprawling and elaborate narrative is what makes In the Mood for Love stands out, either from Wong Kar-wai's oeuvre, or from the Romance genre. In the Mood for Love is undoubtedly worthy of being hailed as Wong Kar-wai's masterpiece, but Chungking Express is still my favorite among WKW's cinematic gems.(8.5/10)",In the Mood for Love
54,Blue-Grotto,"Stylish and Exquisite, 20th Anniversary!",10,2 October 2020,"In ancient times if someone had a secret they did not want to reveal, they went to a distant and beautiful place, whispered the secret into a hole, covered it with mud, and left the secret there forever.In Hong Kong, 1962, Mo-wan has such a secret. He is falling for the woman next door, Li-zhen. Each of them is married to an absent and cheating spouse, but neither wants to sink to that level. ""We won't be like them,"" vows Li-zhen. They spill their hearts to each other but try to avoid intimacy and infamy. ""I often wonder what I'd do if I hadn't married,"" asks Mo-wan. Li-zhen answers ""maybe be happier?!""It is a classic introvert romance. Li-zhen and Mo-wan look for excuses to be with each other but cannot stand the spotlight or the control. Even though they are strongly attracted to each other, they make it seem like their meetings happen by chance; intentionally misplacing an article of clothing so they can retrieve it later and dressing up for when they know the other will pass by. Instead of asking each other directly they tease one another and attempt to get reactions that reveal underlying emotions.Exquisite and romantic, In the Mood for Love feels like a puzzle in many ways. Only bits and pieces to the story narrative are revealed. The audience is kept guessing. The faces of the spouses remain hidden. Secrets and favors are whispered, and we do not hear what they are. We notice and understand things, in the film as well as in life, only by paying attention.The cinematography is oblique, mysterious and playful too. Like a shy child the camera hides behind plants, peaks around corners, and peers through glass and spaces between fixtures. It romps in light, reflections from mirrors and in shadows. The focus falls on backs, faces, arms, behinds, curves and movements of bodies in slow-motion. It is erotic without being lewd. The intriguing angles, raindrops, haunting looks, drifting smoke, close-ups of intriguing antiques, and elaborate dresses and suits are mesmerizing. The images are so colorful, deep, detailed and alluring, that each frame is art.Stylish and fashionable, In the Mood for Love is one of my favorite films. The film helps you learn about and understand other cultures and places; the importance of saving face, for instance, and the realization that loudly slurping noodles in public will not cause a second glance. Tony Leung (Mo-wan) and Maggie Cheung (Li-zhen) are magnificent and beautiful to watch.",In the Mood for Love
55,the red duchess,Unbearably moving and beautiful ghost story. (possible spoilers),9,8 November 2000,"'In the Mood for Love' is the cinematic equivalent of a Henry James novel, in which a slight story (two neighbours, whose spouses are having an affair, dither over doing likewise) is subjected to a complex battery of style and analysis, every detail, gesture, mood, evasion, slip, gap, uncertainty made to carry a number of weights, not just narrative.  Two of James' great themes were confinement and consciousness, and both are the essence of this film.  Wong's visual register is that of a 1950s melodrama filtered through Fassbinder.  And so the elegant, elaborate Ophulsian camera movements find themselves brought repeatedly up short, their freedom curtailed, by decor, as characters are hemmed in by their surroundings, their cramped rooms, corridors, stairways, even clothes (see how the patterns on Mrs. Su's dresses later appear on the walls); or are fragmented within the frame, the camera cutting their bodies into pieces, or framing it within a cluttered multi-frame space that tends to minimise their importance.  Often we just see the back of the protagonist we're focusing on, sometimes we don't even see them at all, just a disembodied voice.  Although characters talk to one another, we rarely see them together in the same frame, one character talking to a voice.  A typical scene has Mr. Chow walking down alley steps; instead of following him, and after all he is one of two main characters, the camera keeps panning to the right, forgetting the hero and making prominent a wall.  This has obvious symbolic value (the different walls (personal, social, temporal etc.) that prevent Chow and Mrs. Su consummating their relationship), but also shows how difficult these characters find it to dominate their own narrative, especially when they are acting the roles of other characters, effacing themselves.Fassbinder was not the only European auteur to absorb the great melodramatists; Godard was another, and 'Mood' sometimes reminds me of his haunting 'Le Mepris'.  Both films are about disintegrating marriage and the impossibility of relationships, impossible because of some communicative, or personal, paralysis.  Both make the labyrinthine mise-en-scene an active, malevolent character, constantly blocking any possibility of real communication.  But the main link is stylistic, not just in the gorgeous, Sirkian colours, the dazzling primary colours as a background for rich turquoise etc., but in the use of music, the punctuating of intolerable, interminable silence with shards of unbearably sad, romantic music, almost like a refrain here, slowing down the action to a dream-like trance, creating an abstract beauty of music, colour and movement, transcending a time that prevents these characters coming together, but also extending it, delaying the inevitable rupture.  They are as startling and moving as the musical sequences of 'Dancer in the Dark'.Like 'In the Realm of the Senses', the private, ritualistic nature of the relationship is at odds with the surveillance culture it hides from.  In one scene, Mrs. Su is even lectured by her landlady about social propriety, and Mr. Chow finally has to leave Hong Kong because he can't take the gossip. Like Oshima's film, 'Mood' startlingly opens up at the end, revealing a political context the solipsistic relationship had previously denied. 
There have been debates and dissatisfaction about the nature of the ending, that is is merely tacked on, but it is vitally important for the second main theme, that of consciousness.  It is here we learn that what we have been watching is somebody's memories, that the colourful mise-en-scene wasn't an 'objective' displacement of represssed emotions, but a filtering of one man's sensibility.  This accounts for much of the provisional nature of the film, the huge elisions (who is the father of Mrs. Su's baby?), the contradictions, repetitions, improbabilities, alternative accounts.  You almost wonder who's playing with us - Chow or Wong? - in one scene, as Mrs. Su hides in Mr. Chow's bedroom, the objects are full of doubles (beds, lamps, mirrors etc.) mocking the impossibility of the central pair. 
I don't think Wong is making a grand statement of justify the triviality of his subject matter, but a Marker-like observation on time, memory and history, about the little stories that make up life, and yet vanish, leaving only empty ruins with unreadable codes, and grainy footage of gangly French presidents.",In the Mood for Love
56,Imdbidia,Grand Class,8,21 May 2011,"The Mood of Love, called in Chinese ""The Flourising days"" or ""the Age of Blossoms"", is a stylish sophisticated movie about the golden era of Hong Kong in the 1950s and the tricky paths of love. This is the prequel to Kar Wai Wong' 2046.Journalist Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) rents a room in an block of apartments, next door to secretary So Lai-zhen (Maggie Cheung), who moves in the same day. Although both are married, we never see their partners, but soon we learn that they were having an affair and have escaped together. The abandoned couple wonders how that romance started and developed, and try to reenact the paths that brought their ex-partners together.This is a movie about how important timing is in love, to be ready to accept love and be loved, and movie about silent secrets. A movie about being unloved despite loving. This is a slow cooking romance with a traditional courtship with barely any flesh or sex on display (just one of the bonus images in the DVD show something), still it has a great sensuality. Dialogues are less important than glances, body language, touch and old courtship codes are.Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung have a great chemistry in camera and this is very important in a movie like this, that relies on physical attraction, unspoken and understated gestures to develop the romance. All the supporting actors are fine in their respective characters.As all Wong's movies, the visual style is stunning, with intense yummy warm colors, luscious personal characterization, decoration and attention to the detail, from the music to the dresses, from the food to the attitudes of the characters. The Hong Kong and Singapore of the 1950s is magnificently brought to life here. The cinematography is full of artistry. The music is beautiful, a mix of Latin-American boleros repetitively sang by Nat King Coll, which were very trendy in Hong Kong and Singapore at the time, mixed with some Chinese classical pieces. The music truly helps to build the mood of the movie.Food is very important in this movie. In fact, Kar Wai Wong, intended to focus on that, and call it Three Stories About Food, but ended just focusing on the story A Story About Food, which is the one in this movie. You will notice how important are local eateries in the movie, both as a way of socializing, meeting new people, and eating. Moreover, many of the dishes prepared and mentioned in the film are seasonal, related to specific periods of the calendar, and therefore they act as a culinary almanac of the movie. This is very difficult to notice if you don't know much about Chinese culinary culture.One of those movies that really gets under your skin, and stays with you for a long time, despite its apparent simplicity. A classic romance movie that men will love to watch, too. Beware, this is a slow movie. Be patient and you'll be rewarded.Grand class.",In the Mood for Love

58,ruby_fff,An affair of the hearts; nostalgia pervades,8,22 February 2001,"The Chinese film title of ""In the Mood for Love"" is ""fa yeung nien wah."" It can be interpreted as ""those blossoming years (that once were).""
The whole film is a well-composed piece. A complex love story told in simple visual approach. Writer-director Wong Kar-Wai has choreographed a dancing of the hearts - it's she, it's he, it's love. I can hear Galasso's theme: dum dum-dum, dum dum-dum, and the strings - almost like heartbeats. A piece with prelude, stanzas, and epilogue.Director optimized the use of music (Michael Galasso's score, Nat King Cole singing in Spanish, and Chinese songs/tunes). The rhythm and lyrics prompt viewers to what she and he is feeling/thinking rather than verbal dialogs. I can hear Nat King Cole giving us the clues: ""Aquelloojos verde"" (that thing, fling, eyes green) plays when the two meet, and ""Quizas, quizas, quizas"" (perhaps) when she's undecided.Nostalgia pervades throughout the film. Design details plentiful: handbags and ties; Japanese rice-cooker novelty; the ridged pattern green glass cups & saucers and plates (I remember Dad treasured those at home); mahjong session; kitchen area; bedroom furnishings; the thermos for the take-out noodles that she swings when she walks. Maggie Cheung, slender and shapely, looks exquisite in those fashionable patterns & colors of the traditional Chinese woman clothing - 'cheung sam'. Every change of her dress denotes another day, another time in the story. Wong Kar-Wai is resourceful that way.The scenes may be of the same place, but it's of a different mood, advanced to the next stanza. Up and down the stairs to the won-ton noodle stand. Standing by the wall around the corner to the apartments as the rain pours. Along the corridor, back and forth, to his writing corner.Trivia: So she helps him with his writing of his martial arts novel. Maggie would be able to help as she's been in kung fu/martial arts movies. ""Eastern Three Heroes"" 1992 is a fun action movie with Maggie Cheung (Thief Catcher Chat), Michelle Yeoh and Anita Mui as three super heroes fighting evils.
If you appreciate Tony Leung's performance, don't miss ""Chungking Express"" 1994 (in the second segment - romance rhythm with a difference), and ""Happy Together"" 1997 (an intense, emotionally colorful painting of friendships, faith, and fate), both written and directed by Wong Kar-Wai.Being able to understand the Cantonese and Shanghainese dialects, and having visited the official site, I realized the epilogue was not quite completely translated. Here's sharing my version of the Chinese captions:
It was kind of an unbearable encounter   All along she has kept her head lowered   Giving him a chance to get closer   He didn't have the courage to be closer   She turned around, walked away.That time and place had come to past. All that belonged, no longer exist. _______Those vanished years, seemingly separated by a glass   gathering dust, can see, yet cannot grasp.All along he has longed for all that's past   If he can break through that dust-gathered glass   He will walk back into the times long vanished. ________Wong Kar-Wai's ""In the Mood for Love"" brings to mind the simple poetry and wisdom of Rumi, the Sufi philosopher - the 'inner and outer,' the 'spirit and body' of life, love and living.[Resend.

60,TaylorYee94,One of those movies critics praise and audience wonder why,6,30 April 2021,"Cinematography is great, but there is no story development at all, all of which chopped up like clips of music videos patched poorly. The whole movie is an empty shell, no foundation but full of embellishments. I had to watch the scenery of Angkor Wat for two minutes for ending which is not connected to all the previous 80 minutes of the movie. Wong Kar-wai is one of the overrated directors. He likes to give somewhat abstract mise-en-scene and leaves it up to viewers to decide what it means. That itself is recommended for audience to use own imagination and to draw empathy from him or her. However, Wong himself does not have any intention or direction of every single cut of the movie. He just throws them out so irresponsibly and tells the world 'See? I'm this mysterious, so you figure out the meaning.' Then, critics obsessed with the director's name create the stories and add meanings, making the movie look bigger than it is. 'In the Mood for Love' deserves 5, but Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung's acting earns an extra point.",In the Mood for Love
61,zzhhhqing,Golden years,9,11 June 2020,"It's not too late to watch it for the first time. At the time of making this film, Wang Jiawei was 42 years old, Liang Chaowei was 38 years old, and Zhang Manyu was 36 years old. It was indeed the emotions that could only be understood after the heyday, with the self-control and implicitness of the middle-aged people, without the warmth of his youth. But why is it called ""The Mood for Love""? Maybe for them, this is the best time? Not reckless, but not yet aging",In the Mood for Love
62,WhimsicalVonia,A film with no love is somehow one of the most romantic films ever made,9,14 December 2017,"In the Mood for Love (2000) Kar-Wai Wong has indeed created a masterpiece here. Not only created it but orchestrated it. I cannot think of a more accurate word to describe what he did here. ""In the Mood for Love"" should be included in the definition for mise-en-scène. I suspect that everything was deliberate. Every angle, every camera movement, every color choice, every glance, every song, every word. It was a slow film, yes. But for once, it does not feel that way. It feels that it had to be exactly the pace it was. Prepare to be charmed, intoxicated, mesmerized, transported. I have to be honest, I have not seen this for the longest time because I was convinced that it was another art film that was completely overrated. This time, it was warranted. The camera work. The movement. We peek around edges, we peer through holes, we pan across hallways, we zoom into apartments. We are able to see into the neighboring apartments, as each of them sits, lonely. As we pan back and forth, a wall reminds us. Almost the entire time, the photographer in me was admiring what great angles these were and imagining myself taking them; making a move to take a still every few minutes. The music. The only other film I remember that uses one song so stylistically is Garci's ""Volver a empezar"" from 1982- which in my opinion was overused and became annoying at some point in the film. Here, it is Yumeji's Theme. In contrast, Wong mixes it up on the score and we do not tire of the theme. Instead, it signals yet another emotionally intense scene filled with longing, waiting, loving, wishing. This is the power this film has. To elicit so many emotions with a few minutes, a handful of glances, one song. The costumes. Most notably, Mrs. Chan's dresses. Ever changing, ever gorgeous. The set design. Oh, the lush and saturated colors. If one can call colors yummy, now is the time. We are almost exclusively indoors. It seems that every time we are outside, it is raining. The lovers run to get out of the rain, they wait for the rain to pause, they talk in the rain. Alas, no kissing in the rain. My complaints? I wish the film was in Mandarin, not Cantonese. For two reasons. One is selfish, because I would be able to understand it without subtitles trying to accurately translate. Two, Mandarin is a less harsh, more fluid language. As far as beauty goes, it would have matched the film's tone better. I also feel as if the film was lacking character depth. That I still felt so much for them, therefore, is even more a testament to Wong's skill. I felt like I did not really know them; that I knew little more than the them strangers saw. Although this may have been a stylistic choice, that does not change the fact that I was left feeling like something was missing. ""In the Mood for Love"" is as much about what we do not see and what is not said. Silences mean everything. One glance tells us more than words ever could. A minute shift in tone makes all the difference. For example, we never see the adulterers, Mr. Chan & Mrs. Chow. They remain off screen as other characters talk to them. We spend full moments focused on a character's face, watching them as they begin to cry or as they struggle internally. Missed opportunities. Missed moments. Misunderstandings. Misconceptions. Wrong place, wrong time. A theme Wong uses in much of his work, such as ""Chungking Express"" (which I did feel was completely overrated). Wong was in the mood for love. The audience is in the mood for love. Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow are in the mood for love. She might not admit it, but Mrs. Chan is in the mood for love. Mr. Chow is in the mood for love. Alas, still no love. He calls her. ""It's me. If there's an extra ticket... would you go with me?"" No answer. Later in the film, their roles are reversed. She wants to know, ""It's me. If there's an extra ticket... would you go with me?"" Ironically, it is this film about a love that could be but never was that is named as the most romantic by many. This is one of the reasons I appreciated the film. Had this been filmed in this country, I can almost guarantee you the two of them would have ended up together. Wong did not take the easy way out. Not throughout the film- where he focused on the two being cheated on rather than the ones doing the cheating- and not in the ending, where they continued missing each other, over the years. He garners my respect for this decision. Because this is closer to reality. Often times, love is not enough. Life gets in the way. Circumstances, miscommunications. Excuses, maybe. But that is life. Unfortunately. Some gems of relationship truth: ""I didn't know married life would be so complicated! When you're single, you are only responsible to yourself. Once you're married, doing well on your own is not enough."" Mrs. Chan asks, ""Why didn't you call me today?"" 
""I was afraid you won't like it,"" Mr. Chow replies. 
Her response? ""Then don't call me ever again."" ""In the old days, if someone had a secret they didn't want to share, they went up a mountain, found a tree, carved a hole in it, and whispered the secret into the hole. Then they covered it with mud. And leave the secret there forever."" This is something Mr. Chow says to his friend Ah Ping. In the exquisite final scene, filmed in Thailand with ""Angkor Wat Theme"" playing, we see him peering into a hole; we then see it covered as he walks away. From right after the title cards: ""It is a restless moment. She has kept her head lowered to give him a chance to come closer. But he could not, for lack of courage. She turns and walks away."" From right before the end card: ""He remembers those vanished years. As though looking through a dusty window pane, the past is something he could see, but not touch. And everything he sees is blurred and indistinct."" Mrs. Chan says, ""You notice things if you pay attention."" Indeed. The perfect tip to truly appreciate ""In the Mood for Love"".",In the Mood for Love
63,OttoVonB,The most disarming romance ever filmed.,10,29 November 2004,"In 60s Hong Kong, a man and woman move in the same day into adjacent apartments with their respective spouses. Soon they suspect their ever absent spouses of having an affair with one-another. A strange bond emerges between the man and woman as they cope with their sadness by taking turns playing each other's spouse, before a more complex bond emerges...No summary can do it justice, for Hong Kong auteur Wong Kar-Wai's ""In the Mood for Love"" is nothing short of a miracle. A story about sadness that manages to be touching and at times funny. A romance that never feels forced or fake. No doubt the director's method has a lot to do with that.Directed from an inexistent screenplay (though the concept largely flows from a Japanese short story) to favor improvisation, the film is immediately set apart by the freshness of it's performances. All the film revolves around that and the rest is pure enhancement. At the core of the film are two characters that will ease into your heart and stay there long after the end credits roll: Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are simply amazing and no language barrier undermines a single fragment of immediacy and truth they display. The additional material is also top-notch: the films is magnificent to behold (in part lensed by ""Hero""'s Christopher Doyle) and the music is heartbreaking.This is something everybody must see, if only because it is by far the most heartfelt, mature and authentic ""love story"" out there.

The light and the color schemes are carefully treated and put in every scene in a detailed approach. There is really nothing there just for the sake of it. Everyittle detail in the set means something into the film, so yeah, In The Mood For Love requires you to pay a lot of attention as well.

It's a little restrained and repetitive if compared to Wong Kar-Wai's other films, but from an aesthetic point of view, it's definitely one of his most refined and mature works. The lack of action is purposely stressed out, as the characters are being constantly held back by their insecurities and chronic loneliness. The same camera angles, the same actions, the same music are obsessively repeated to mark the passing of time, with the images speaking more than the words. Su and Chow are often shown through windows, curtains, or other common items, as if the viewers were one of the couple's invasive neighbors who are spying on their clandestine relationship.",In the Mood for Love
66,ilpohirvonen,"Smooth, Elegant and Serenely Beautiful",9,6 January 2011,"Fa yeung nin wai or In the Mood for Love, directed by the acclaimed filmmaker Wong Kar Wai, has earned quite a reputation and can be seen in several 'best of the decade' lists. It's a good example of what happens when a genre, typical for the western world, is transfered to the east: they internalize it and give something of their own to it. The smooth, subtle narrative of In the Mood for Love has something that European and American melodramas had in the 1930's-40's, and the film has also got a great number of references to these classics. In the end, the film grows out to be a touching story about memories, time and inoperative, doomed, love.A man and a woman live in apartments next to each other in Hong Kong during the early 1960's, both of whose spouses are quite a lot away from home. Soon they start to suspect their spouses for having an affair; it doesn't matter whom made the first initiative, it has already happened. They start acting scenarios about how it might have happened, how would they react if their spouses would admit it and about them leaving each other. Both, the man and the woman, realize that their love is doomed and will never work. Now they are separated, and as the years go by everything changes, the place has changed, the building they used to live in isn't what it used to be and the woman has got a baby with her husband. After a few years the man goes to the ruins of a temple, whispers his secret to a hole and leaves it there. ""He remembers those vanished years. As though looking through a dusty window pane, the past is something he could see, but not touch. And everything he sees is blurred and indistinct."" Film is art of state and many filmmakers of today don't seem to understand it, but Wong Kar Wai is one of those who do. The construction of state in In the Mood for Love is brilliant and the meaning of it is tremendous. The buildings, the places, the clothes. the wallpapers and the architecture mean a state of time (1960's) -- a state of memory. In the film by Wong Kar Wai, the camera is moved like an improvising musician plays his instruments. The severe and precise delimitation forces the viewer to focus on what is most relevant and interesting. We are trapped into the narrow state where small details of aesthetics become more than important. In the end the audience is released from the tight delimitation; we see the ruins of a temple; history -- the past has turned into an unreachable memory.There's something in the visual narrative of In the Mood for Love that I'd like to call Hitchcockian voyeurism: we see the man and the woman behind walls, bars and curtains, through windows, mirrors and shadows, from a closet. Just as in many films by Alfred Hitchcock the viewer gets, and is forced, to be a peeping tom; we peek into the lives of the characters -- and there are more similarities to Hitchcock. Wong Kar Wai has said that the character of James Stewart in Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958) was the inspiration for Tony Leung's. Tony Leung has a sympathetic face just as James Stewart; the audience doesn't want to believe that he is 'sick' and 'evil'.The state of the film also means a state of time, 1960's, which the filmmaker has built precisely. The state also means a state of past and memories -- the small things; details, clothes and items build this state and become extremely significant. There aren't many films from which one can find a deep meaning for the specific wallpaper, piece of decorative and clothing. The delimitations are precisely considered and important as well: the rooms, the doors, staircases and the narrowing halls are beautiful art of montage. The hypnotic repetition: music, Spanish songs, sentences, images, rain and places, is something which drills down to pure emotion. David Lean's melodrama classic Brief Encounter (1943) also drills down to it and has made many of us cry. But there's something quite similar with the story lines of these films as well. In Brief Encounter a married man and a woman start having brief encounters on train stations, but know that their love can't last and will not work: ""Nothing lasts really. Neither happiness nor despair. Not even life lasts very long.""Voeurism isn't the only perversion in In the Mood for Love: the acted scenarios of getting caught and relationships. Do the man and the woman really even love each other? Or do they love their idealized images of their spouses, which they project on each other. The spouses are never shown to us, their characters are defined and built by voice-over; they turn into only extras who don't exist. In the Mood for Love is one of the rare modern films which have truly achieved poetry; it drills down to pure emotion. The smooth narrative, precise delimitation and construction of state, the hypnotic repetition of music and dialog turn into beautiful poetry of cinema.",In the Mood for Love

In this rumination about love and the passage of time, Wong Kar-Wai presents himself as a perfect interpreter of film language and there are so many levels of analysis to choose from it's almost impossible to know where to begin. Everything onscreen and in the text is completely under Wong's control, from each exquisitely structured shot (his use of walls to frame narrow passageways is astonishing) to the graceful, perfectly placed tracking camera (the cinematography is by Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee), from the subtle mix of neon and natural colors to the gorgeous costuming (by William Chang) intended to highlight so many moods and desires, from the straightforward storytelling to the ambiguities of movement and action (every nuance  is open to interpretation and every interpretation has merit), from the soundtrack's use of a doleful string quartet to the tropical simplicity of Nat King Cole's Spanish crooning, and, finally, from the truly sublime performances of Maggie Cheung Man-yuk and Tony Leung Chiu Wai, playing neighbors whose spouses' affair unintentionally allow them to find a true but painful love to their wonderful supporting cast (particularly Ping Lam Siu, Rebecca Pan and Lai Chen).

68,yris2002,sublime,8,11 July 2011,"Intense, delicate, profound picture by Kar Wai Wong. Oriental movies are often said to be too slow, or boring, but they have no equals when trying to enter the deepest chords of human sensitivity. ""In the mood of love"" is one of them, I define it sublime in the romantic sense of the term, in that tension towards an unattainable condition of fulfillment and infiniteness. The two protagonists discover that their spouses (significantly out of screen) have an affair and, while comforting each other, happen to fall in love but decide not to become unfaithful like their mates. They spend much time together, even in the secrecy of a secluded room, but never give in to their attraction, being their inner moral consciousness too strong, their relationship remains pure and perfect, because unfulfilled, not contaminated by experience, although there is a kind of subtle pleasure in tending towards, but never attaining. An unlikely condition, but the interest lies exactly here, in that tension between morality and passion: love needs physical contact, and their condition cannot last for good, however, for the period it lasts (months, years, don't know, time does not seem measurable), it gives incomparable and deep emotions. Maggie Cheing as Mrs. Chan is sublime in her refined grace, her thin and wiry figure, enveloped by those wonderful silk Chines dresses, makes her character so deep, elegant, absolutely delightful. The soundtrack (above all the Yumeji's main theme), delicate and assertive at the same time, represents an emotional added value to the picture, capable as it is to touch some sensitive chords of the human soul. Obviously, it's not an easy movie, you have to be ""in the right mood"" to enter its mood, but if you are willing to be overwhelmed by it, you will be gently rewarded.",In the Mood for Love

70,asifahsankhan,"If You're In the Mood for ""LOVE"" - Watch This!",10,2 June 2017,"Or if you need to just set up your mood for ""LOVE"" - watch this! Seriously!The opaque and ashen ache of stolen moments, and the often painful passage of time hangs heavy upon Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-Wai, particularly in his masterpiece from 2000, In the Mood for Love. As anthem to the agony and ecstasy of close-lipped affection, this film, more than any other in Wong's considerable oeuvre, is a Proust-like conjuration of memory and misgiving.The second instalment of a rather loose trilogy that began with Days of Being Wild (1990) and concluded with 2046 (2004), The Mood unravels in Hong Kong, 1962, cantering on two neighbours living in a close quarters tenement house.Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung shimmer as Su Li-Zhen and Chow Mo-wan, the neighbours in question, who rightly suspect their respective spouses are having an affair. Leung and Cheung, it must be said again and again, are wondrous in these roles, and are every bit as iconic as Bogie and Bacall before them. The fugitive motions and fleeting looks of chiming clocks, the whirling of smoke rising from a cigarette, and the sentimental croon of Nat King Cole super-abound Wong's elegant period drama. Mr. Chow is something of a journalist, Mrs. Chan is a secretary for a shipping company, and soon the two of them will find themselves in the ephemeral fog of anguish, contrition, and the sweetest nostalgia. As next-door neighbours in close approximation they soon discover that their spouses are always absent at the same time. Their lives intersect more and more and soon a strange and strained relationship forms between them both. As a sensual memory piece In the Mood for Love is luminous, and the slowly simmering romance therein is an inextricable blending of physicality and formalism.Initially, it was supposed to be made fast, dirty, and on the cheap, in a fashion not unlike Chungking Express (1994). Maybe it was inevitable that this project, a long gestating follow-up to Days of Being Wild, concerned with pain and longing, should inflict similar damage on its designer, for Wong's anguish is palpable in every loving, wistful, and spectacularly detailed frame. The bright colours and unconventional compositions that Wong's name became synonymous with in the 1990s is here faultlessly fulfilled, even when hemmed in. The film renders on an intimate scale the intersection of misery and euphoria, of romance in retrospect, and makes it into cinema's saddest song of love lost to history.Just so you know: The film's original Chinese title, meaning ""the age of blossoms"" or ""the flowery years"" – Chinese metaphor for the fleeting time of youth, beauty and love – derives from a song of the same name by Zhou Xuan from a 1946 film. The English title derives from the song, ""I'm in the Mood for Love."" Give it a watch, you will regret nothing.",In the Mood for Love

I was so disappointed.First, you have to know that there are severe culture issues that make an American quite confused. Two couples move into an apartment complex, but, not in their own apartment, into the bedrooms of other persons apartments. Weird. How does that even work? How can a married couple have sex? Then the way the movie is shot is jarring ... almost childish. Every scene is about 2 lines and then abruptly cut to another scene - over and over again. Sometimes, I could not even tell what was going on.But what you really need to know is that this is a love story where we never see any of it. It is never fleshed out. Just a lot of handsome people looking sad and forlorn -- and then, at the end... she is living alone with a 5 year old child. As if that tells the tale. I guess it is supposed to.I don't even really buy that the main couple is in love. Both seem utterly lonely and just happy to have someone to do things with (since their respective spouses are never around)Given that it is a China film I am guessing someone wanted to suck up to them.

73,Ziya90,"A response to crowd pleaser romance movies, even if it is a bit too naive",8,11 December 2009,"In the Mood for Love is great, not only because it is quintessential art or has a mesmerizing cinematography. It handles men and women relationships by a fresh and realistic way, in other words by a different way. I hate and get bored of those romantic comedies (by only watching their trailers !!!) because of dozens of reasons and watching this movie relieved me. Except a few art house films, In the Mood for Love was the first attempt. In romantic comedies, the stories are always the same, almost. Similar sense of humor, similar situations, similar tricks and a mediocre cinematography (and style) Remember, Definitely May be, Music and Lyrics, Made of Honor, Ghost Girlfriends from the Past, The Proposal etc. However, most audiences want to see such kind of movies and they find the movies like In the Mood for love dull and they don't enjoy also. Now, a lot of people go and see romantic comedies and they don't complain about anything. By the way, I haven^t seen any of the movies I wrote above, I just watched their trailers (I had to), but even this was torture to me which is another story. People accept that they are not artistic, but to me, they are not entertaining either, because the only purpose of these movies to make their audiences glad and not to make them say I want my money back. In romantic comedies, there are almost three kind of stories, just cast and director are different The first story is that there are two lovers. They argue each other because of something and they break up. Will they come together again? At the end, after some bad events, they realize that they love each other, so they get married or continue to live together. The second story is that there is a woman. She meets a man. At first, they do not like each other or she has a boyfriend even if love at first sight is the matter. However, they encounter a few times and start to fall in love with each other. At the end of the movie, they get married or live happily together. The third story is that two people meet because of their job or hobby, for example both are interested in sport or music. At the beginnings, they hate each other, because they dissent from many things. However, they don't know that they are made for each other. And there might be one more story. A man and a woman have to pretend to be lovers or husband and wife, but later it turns into reality, they fall in love with each other. In the world of these romantic comedies, people fall in love too easily. Almost all friendships turn into love. Wow! To me, this means to fool us, because it is absolutely unrealistic. That's why I love In the Mood for Love (but this is not only reason). It is a revolution in the romance genre. Two people meet, but they don't fall in love with each other. They start to like each other. At first, it is a platonic love, the man starts to fall in love with the woman, but the woman is not exactly. It seems that the script writers of romantic comedies hate this and I can guess the reason, they want more audience. In the film, these two people just talk each other or go out for dinner, never make love or even kiss. See? This is revolution. Mrs. Chan is not one of the women who always think about sex or shopping (The Sex and The City) Mr. Chow is different from the characters in the romantic comedies by far too, so very realistic. The rehearsal scene was one of the most touching and sad romantic scenes of all time. As said, this is quintessential cinema, especially music, one of the best musics and editing. For example, in the dinner scene, Mrs. Chan speaks and the camera shows her, Mr. Chow speaks, the camera shows him by sliding. And the final. It makes me petrified, extremely sad and touching. You don't want to look at the screen not to see Mr. Chow's situation. What a bad ending for the people who value typical romantic comedies that always conclude with marriage. The only problem of the movie is that although, they are respectful for each other and very shy and although they are a little bit narrow minded, their relationship seems too pure.",In the Mood for Love
74,karl_consiglio,A modern love story,7,6 May 2006,"The story takes place in early sixties Hong Kong where Chow, the editor of a local newspaper, moves into an apartment across the stairs from Li-zhen, a secretary for an escort firm. Both are married to their spouses, who are frequently away on business, and as a result the pair form a friendship discovering a mutual fondness for martial arts stories. When it dawns on them that their partners are involved in an affair, Chow and LI-zhen are drawn to each other for comfort, until a romance of their own seems inevitable. This piece of work is more than a shallow victory of style over content, such criticism would miss the point. Yes it is a stylish film beyond question and every viewer seeking only dramatic twists or profound moral insights is likely to be disappointed. What we get instead is pure emotion, breathtaking in its honesty and sensitivity. This is never better illustrated than when Chow admits his feeling for Li-zhen. The screen becomes nothing but a blur of colour, the only sound is that of Li-zhen's tears. Its a moment which cuts right into the soul. We never see Chow and Li-zhen's partners, and this adds to a feeling of abandonment for the two leads, leaving them to carry the film alone, a task both rise to admirably. This is quality acting, hyper-vivid images of rain-soaked Technicolour loveliness, spectacular use of location and perfectly chosen musical motifs, this is pure cinematic seduction.",In the Mood for Love

In the Mood for Love is set in early-1960's Hong Kong. The entire film is set in china-Town. The two main characters are neighbours in a tenement who begin to suspect that their respective spouses are having an affair. Eventually they confront each other with their suspicions without having the courage to confront their spouses. Their discussion turns from friendship to love which is ultimately doomed because of their culture and values.Each frame of this film is beautifully shot, the slo-mo shots, the lighting, the lingering smoke from a cigerette - it all evokes an era long ago and helps give the movie a touch of the classic, eternal kind of love.

76,Artimidor,Invitation to a dreamy dance of sensuality,9,15 June 2012,"Kar Wai Wong's ""In the Mood for Love"" could be seen as the Asian version of David Lean's classic ""Brief Encounter"", dealing with the emerging relationships of people married to others, relationships, which should never have happened. But both takes on the same theme bring their own distinctive accentuations and make the films enjoyable for very different reasons. Kar Wai Wong's movie is a period piece, set in Hong Kong in the 1960s, with a strong emphasis on style, elegance and subtlety. It bears a fascinating auratic - or let's say for the sake of word play - erotic mix of poetry, nostalgia, melancholy, framed by society conventions and daily routines in which an impossible romance against a backdrop of loneliness is quietly thriving, causing longing, desire, hardship and demanding painful decisions.""In the Mood for Love"" has a couple of artistic touches and cinematic patterns which add considerably to the enjoyment: Kar Wai Wong e.g. intentionally keeps the story of Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow to themselves. It's not about their spouses, and all conversations with them are handled with the married partners entirely out of frame. Camera positions, conversations, walking paths in shots are repeated again and again to intensify the every day feeling that permeates lives, only the emotional charge between the romantic protagonists increases. The music (also recurring and only varied) by Michael Galasso and Shigeru Umebayashi, especially Yumeji's Theme, make up one of the most unforgettable soundtracks you will come across - a dreamy dance of sensuality, as is this exquisitely beautiful film.",In the Mood for Love

79,kurosawakira,"Their Secret, Our Secret",10,7 May 2013,"""In the old days if someone had a secret they didn't want to share, they went up a mountain, found a tree, carved a hole in it and whispered the secret into the hole. Then they covered it with mud and left the secret there forever."" This film is the hole in the tree, as illustrated in the last scene of the film. The film that, for Mrs Chan and Mr Chow, was originally about finding out the secrets held from them, which then becomes their secret, our secret. This is beautifully referred to in the opening shot of the ""sequel"", ""2046"" (2004), where we in fact emerge from the tree hole.I've become more and more inclined to see this not only with the aforementioned masterwork ""2046"" but also Vigo's ""L'Atalante"" (1934), since somehow the free-flowing visual mood of that film, especially the use of interior space, and the way it visualizes love, fit so well into place next to this. It's amazing how the film flows the way it does, considering how all of it was based on improvisation and constant experimentation, meaning that it must've been an arduous experience full of moments where one simply doesn't know where to go. The film, however, is a masterful showpiece of rhythm: both in the movements of the camera, how it moves carelessly, and in the editing and how it structures the sequences. 'Effortless' is an appropriate adjective.I've already referred to the deeply self-referential narrative structure in the film's fabric. The film is basically about a created fiction based on a lie and a hidden truth that in the end becomes a lost reality, a kind of ""could have been"" that's the very stuff love and longing are often made of.Summa summarum, this ranks among my absolute favourites: it's perfect in every way, so nuanced, profound, inviting repeated viewings. It's a bottomless well of inspiration, a designation I would be bold enough to give to only a few films I've seen. This is one of them.",In the Mood for Love
80,Shostakovich343,In the Mood for Love,7,29 June 2020,"If a serious list of the 'Greatest Films Ever Made' stretches into the the new millennium, bets are ""In the Mood for Love"" will be on it. I would personally not heap such praise upon the film, but it is hard to deny it boasts one of the most nuanced and subdued relationships in modern cinema.The film plays like an Asian ""Una giornata particolare"". Our Loren and Mastroianni are Maggie Cheung and Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, known for playing action heroes and lovers, (or both, together, in the case of ""Hero""). Here, they play everyday people: an editor and a secretary, both married, neighbours in a narrow Hong Kong apartment building.Their respective spouses are never fully seen. More often than not they are absent, always at the same time. It is hard to say when they begin to suspect, but before long our leads are faced with the fact that their partners are having an affair with each other. This discovery brings the two of them together in need of consolation and, perhaps, love. They are visibly attracted to each other, but agree to keep their relationship platonic.It is the smaller things that earn ""In the Mood for Love"" its place on the 'Best of All Time' lists. The acting, writing, and directing are so subtle that describing the film in terms of events renders it meaningless. The great touches of drama lie in the way a person slightly turns his head, moves weight from one leg to the other, or closes a door.That being said, ""In the Mood for Love"" suffers from too much of a good thing. The film's central fifty minutes follow the same pattern over and over again: our protagonists make an appointment; they meet; they decide not to have sex; repeat. Sometimes there are minute variations -- he decides to write a newspaper serial; one time it is raining -- but the basic pattern of meet, cut, repeat does not change.This repetition is intentional to a certain extent. Whenever characters retread locations -- the street, the stairs, the hallway -- they are always filmed from the same angle, like rhyming stanzas in a poem on mundanity. However, these scenes stop adding new arguments before long: the film doens't deepen their pain, it just shows more of it. We already know the relationship between these people is not going to change, yet are put through the motions another five or six times.It is one of the medium's great tragedies that nobody cares about one-hour films. We have accepted that novels can be 100 or 3,000 pages long, that paintings can be the size of a matchbox or The Night Watch, but motion pictures of less than eighty minutes do not qualify as feature films. ""In the Mood for Love"" certainly would have benefitted from being an hour long. Its intimate filmmaking demands to be seen, but for a 98-minute film to be this long-winded is a flaw too prominent to disregard.",In the Mood for Love
81,quinimdb,In the Mood for Love,9,8 May 2016,"""In the Mood for Love"" is a bittersweet, delicate film that shows that the simplest glance or touch of hands can be the most romantic thing imaginable.Mr. Chow is a married man who has just moved in to an apartment next to Mrs. Chan, a married woman. Despite being married, they both are very lonely people due to their spouses having jobs which demand them to work late or abroad, although they may each be cheating as well. We never see the faces of their spouses in the film, and that's to demonstrate how absent they are in the characters' lives and minds. The characters catch glances at each other once or twice (or come close to) early in the film, and these moments are shown to be important to them through the use of slow motion, which is used in the film to show the moments that they don't want to end. The characters begin meeting with each other which seems at first to fill the void left by their absent spouses, but they begin to realize it's something much more than that.The use of frames within frames and blocking in this film is used to suggest the loneliness of the main characters and how close they are to being together, yet the ever present wall between them that forbids them to. For instance, whenever they meet outside at their usual location, the camera is situated behind a fence, and they seem to be separated by a thin bar despite how close they are.As the film progresses, the characters each feel the feeling of love has suddenly snuck up on them, and they can't get rid of it. They start thinking of each other more and more, despite their promise to remain platonic. When they suspect that Mrs. Chan's wife is cheating, they begin to have a ""rehearsals"" for how she should react to it. She does it once and Mr. Chow says if he outright confesses that she has to be more mad. They do it again, but when Mr. Chow (acting as Mrs. Chan's husband) confesses to cheating on her, she simply can't react. It is this moment that she realizes that she lives Mr. Chow, and, although she never truly cheats on her husband, she now understands it if her husband were to cheat on her. They both now understand how they first fell in love with their spouses, who they now don't feel much for. Love crept up on them without them even realizing, and even though the feeling isn't going away, they are forbidden to be together. Soon enough they are ""rehearsing"" for when Mr. Chow has to leave, and after he does, the feeling still lingers, but the timing is never right for them, and eventually those moments, those feelings, are lost forever.",In the Mood for Love
82,crculver,"A poignant tale of an ambiguous affair between a man and woman in early 1960s Hong Kong, shot with incredible visual splendour",9,12 April 2017,"Set in early 1960s Hong Kong, Wong Kai-wai's 2000 film IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE chronicles a brief affair, and one that is poignantly ambiguous.As the film opens, we see two married couples move into rented rooms in the house of an elderly matriarch (living space is at a premium in Hong Kong, and the claustrophobic sets reflect the reality). Two of these new neighbours strike up a friendship because they feel similarly neglected by their spouses. The husband of Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung), a traveling businessman, is often away for weeks at a time and probably seeing another woman. Meanwhile, newspaper reporter Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) quietly suffers his wife's betrayal as she stays out night after night with some other man.Chan and Chow begin spending time together, wondering if their actions mirror those of their unfaithful spouses: ""Is this how it started?"" Their exact relationship remains ambiguous, as Chan suggests that any physical intimacy would be stooping to the level of their spouses. Even if their friendship is platonic, they struggle to keep it hidden from the conservative society of the time, adding considerable suspense to the film.Tales of adultery are pretty old hat in art cinema, but the storytelling here is fresh and IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE proved a moving experience for this reviewer and his wife. Cheung and Leung play their parts with such painfully sad faces, as if the betrayal of a husband or wife is a natural disaster that can only be born quietly with dignity, never undone. It's not unbearably oppressive, however, and a little bit of comic relief is provided by Mr. Chow's coworker Ah Ping, played by Ping Lam Siu. Strikingly, Ping Lam Siu wasn't a professional actor at all, but rather a prop man, but he's a real character and I'm glad Wong Kar-Wai brought him in front of the camera.Besides the memorable acting, another strong point of this film is its exploitation of the medium. The colorful sets with 1960s period detail and Ms. Chan's changing succession of cheongsam dresses are absolutely gorgeous. Furthermore, the viewer is dazzled by cinematic slight of hand such as a rapid succession of near-identical shots in the same location, representing in an instant how these characters had been meeting over weeks or months. Shots from under a bed or behind a curtain make the audience feel like a voyeur; we are no longer innocent spectators but almost implicated in the protagonists' affair that they are desperate to keep secret. The husband of Mr. Chan is never directly shown, while the face of Mr. Chow's wife is always turned away from the camera, an effect that strengthens the viewer's identification with these protagonists and leads us to sympathize with their feelings of neglect.Wong Kai-Wai shot something like 30 times the amount of footage that ultimately made it into the finished film, and some of this cut footage can be seen on various home media releases. Knowing how the film was made will definitely elevate film editing in your eyes to the same level as the initial writing of any screenplay -- which Wong Kar-Wai doesn't even do, working intuitively without a script. Wong Kai-Wai filmed a number of directions for the story to go in (like a final meeting between the lovers, scenes of their spouses, etc.), only to cut them out, and the end result is so much stronger for it. The 98 minutes that was finally shown to the world is utterly convincing with not a minute wasted and not a single element extraneous. It is as if the director was a sculptor revealing a masterpiece out of a huge block of marble.",In the Mood for Love
83,thedarkhorizon,"Nostalgic, poetic, extravagantly narrated story about love, distance, isolation and burdens of longing.",10,25 March 2020,"This film captured me form the first second to the last.The story evolves around two married neighbors who slowly get to know each other and turn their platonic relationship into love as they slowly get to unravel their marriage partner's affairs. We are taken into the 1960s of Hongkong, which is stunningly well recreated: authentic, unadorned, cramped, melancholic.Apart from the grand acting, scrip and directing, the film is a visual feast for the eyes unlike anything I have seen before. Colorcodes, set design and just SUBLIME cinematography capture an exquisite narrative. Here are some highlights:Very soon the viewer is presented with the everlasting FEELING OF ISOLATION, and distance... and a strong longing to break these feelings down. Although the spaces seem extremely tiny, crammed (like Chinese architecture is and was compared to the western one I am used to natively), the actors dance in them like in a choreography. Even though (or because?) the space feels so small and tiny, cinematography hides the actors from viewers sight, partially or in whole: we see only the backs of 'irrelevant' personas (which are nearly everyone except the main leads) or they are even cut/left out from the frames. We see shots through curtains, walls, around corners and through windows, mostly hiding most of the scenes and rooms. The viewer is left with a slight dis-orientation just like the disoriented and lost feelings of the lovers as they understand their marriage partners commit adultery: there are nearly never wide-angle or establisher-shots to help the viewer understand the locations completely: we are completely sucked into the world of the actors.Also the leads themselves are framed in 'uncomfortable' angles with 'too much' headspace or else, showing their slightly uncomfortable displacement in their own emotional worlds.This film basically re-invented RED. The sets, props, costumes and native color-sensitivity of the used analoge film create a nearly unreal world. EVERY COLOR IS CODED and filled with SYMBOLISM and intentionally placed.The most significant scene: After Mrs. Chan and Mr. Mo-wan get more engaged and finally meet in a love hotel to complete their bond with physical interaction, the walls, curtains and costumes turn from earth tones to bleeding red, captured beautifully on film.
But also as they sit after in a restaurant, also bloody red, they speak and as soon as they mention their marriage partners, a sense of sensibility is added to the screen: suddenly they drink and eat from green plates, contrasting with the emotional color red. Also their office spaces and the 'outside world' are pathed in green wall or dark brown stones, wood and tones, creating a more muted world representing responsibilities and rationality.
The various other color tones like sandy yellow or feminine pink melt into each other, Mrs. Chans various patterned dresses repeating lines and compositions from her surrounding many times: in her own flat, in the office, on the streets.
On a very depressing, rainy day, where you can feel their sad resentment towards their broken marriage, both walk to the soup kitchen and both are in grey costumes... like the grey cloud over their head.
The list is endless and deserves more than one watch to get all the details.The cinematography always features a SENSE OF VOYEURISM: we witness something we are not supposed to.. they do something they are not supposed to. Many shots are taken through windows, curtains, mirrors (and multiplying their reflections like they are torn into pieces and more versions of themselves), through window bars and hallways. These visuals nearly never chase, except for the scenes where they truly submerge in their love for each other and forget the outside world. In the end the film ends with a epiloque stating ""(...) memories like through a blurred window(...)"", which is represented throughout the whole film: he becomes a voyeuristic memory, filled with melancholic, secret longings.Also the film nearly continuously presents a DREAMLIKE FEELING and sense of BLURRED MYSTERY, strongly related to the blurred voyeurism: the camera is often floating, panning, following the characters at unusual angles, floating bodiless through doors, windows, streets. Also the CUT/EDIT TECHNIQUES add to this: several times the chronological order is broken to insert 'alternative' endings of situations: first we witness him taking the first step towards her by touching her, suddenly the scene repeats and we observe her taking the lead in the same situation with him saying ""It does not matter who took the first step. It already happened."" (this is repeated for example when we see him breaking up with her and then find out it was just a 'rehearsal' for them to cope with the anticipated loss of their love).Cinematography provides CONNECTION between the main actors although they keep their distance: Effective editing like juxtapositions or pans 'through walls' create a strange feeling of connecting between them: We see him and her listening to music in their rooms, melancholic and emotional burdened, while the camera moves to him and her in separate rooms; we see him picking up the phone and listening, then cut to her, hanging up the phone. No word is spoken but it is evidently she finally ended their relationship. Cuts from the same perspective from rainy nighttime to cloudy daytime; shots from Mr. Mo-Wan asking for his wife to his wife crying over her telephone (supposedly bc. of her affair). The beautiful images remain bodiless, floating, like a link through space and time - connecting both lovers in their hopes and despair.The whole film is a great choreography between love and being lost, longing and hoping, isolation and wondering where the road will take them. We never are presented with physical love interaction or nudity, yet the sense of connecting, longing and romanticism is overwhelming. This is, for me, one of the strongest movies I have seen in a VERY long time, beautifully executed from beginning to end, filled with poetry to the brim.This is a masterpiece and deserves to be watched endless times.",In the Mood for Love
84,wandereramor,Beautiful but cold,7,8 September 2011,"What Wong Kar-Wai is basically dealing with here is reality and artificiality. The two neighbours in this film begin their romance by imitating their idea of the romance between their spouses -- but the line between imitation and reality is always in question. As filmgoers, we believe in the fake romance and unconsummated adultery more than the real thing, as both spouses don't appear in the film. But there's also a dreamlike tone to the film and its cinematography that quashes any idea of reality.With that said, I think it's this slippery idea of reality that made it so hard for me to engage with the film. There's not much traditional narrative to grab onto here -- the characters are ciphers and the story is slow and frequently interrupted by musical sequences. Kar-Wai is most obviously drawing on Sirkean melodrama and Ozu-esque slow family drama as influences, and I'm not a huge fan of either. It's a beautiful film, especially visually, lingering over the colours of 1960s China and often getting unorthodox, such as the long takes of just one side of a conversation. And it's given me a lot to think about, but the actual experience of watching the movie was kind of a drag. Maybe I'm just not a mature enough cinemaphile.

85,p_radulescu,In symmetry with 2046,10,15 April 2010,"This movie represents a moment that separates two distinct periods in the artistic creation of Wong Kar-Wai.The movies made before In the Mood for Love offer kaleidoscopic images of today's urban life (with a notable exception, Ashes of Time); all of them (Ashes of Time included) are splendid post-modern works.With In the Mood for Love the focus is passing on a single dimension of life, eros. It's not the mechanic of sex, it's the mechanic of desire and dream: reality and imagination blur their borders, feelings burn everything and move the compass back and forth between what it is and what it should be.I think In the Mood for Love should be watched together with 2046: they are somehow symmetric. The feelings burn everything up to explosion in 2046, and time is no more, there is not a succession of love stories, because each love story in 2046 exists on its own and doesn't care about the rest. In the Mood for Love offers another outcome: feelings burn everything down to implosion, the whole becomes so dense that it vanishes in a black hole.And maybe it's not only about eros in these movies. Maybe it's about time as an illusion; or maybe it's more than that, about reality (our reality as we feel it) as an illusion. And, at this level of understanding, the two periods in Wong Kar-Wai creation are only apparently distinct.And coming back to In the Mood for Love, when does the action take place? In the sixties, or later in the seventies, when the personages remember their past (or just imagine a past that wasn't)? Or is 2046 already present?",In the Mood for Love
86,isaacsundaralingam,What's not to like here?,10,23 May 2021,"I can't count the number of times I've had the filmography of filmmaker Kar-Wai Wong recommended to me; often complimented with an essay long endorsement of his contribution to the medium and how missing out on him would amount to as big a sin as any cinephile could commit. It's often this amount of praise that has kept me from ever approaching the man's work, mostly out of fear of either being disappointed by what others call a ""masterpiece"" as has so often happened in the past, or by coming to love it so much that I might find myself wanting to see more and more of what is a finite catalog of works to choose from. But then a cold and rainy night against the comforts of a warm blanket can convince you to give it a shot; for better or for worse. And by the end of it, you're only disappointed in yourself for not watching it any sooner.Kar-Wai Wong's In the Mood for Love is everything great about this medium done right. Wasting no time at all introducing the players, and so the conflict, it presents on screen a work of soulful poetry aided by an array of talent both on and off the camera. The world is so alive and radiantly present that something so small and insignificant as the ceramic tableware feel nostalgic and memorable. I'd also have never imagined the ""girl from Police Story"" could leave such a lasting impression on me the way she did in this movie. And I could go on and on about every little detail that made me love this more and more, but I feel like everything that could be said has already been said before by some many others and so my remarks would therefore come across only as blatantly repetitive.I'm glad my first encounter with the work of Kar-Wai Wong went as well as it did, because usually recommendations of such nature have a tendency to be ""pretentiously artsy"". This however, was perfectly as simple and loveable yet loaded and sublime a film could be.

88,w-71474,Golden years,10,3 May 2020,"""The Mood for Love"" is called a nostalgic classic. As far as the story told by the film itself is old and ordinary, there is nothing new. It is nothing more than a love story about extramarital affairs. As far as the plot of the film is concerned, it is neither tortuous nor exciting. So why is such a film with a common story and a simple plot as a classic? The key lies in the clever and unique expression technique used by director Wang Jiawei in the film. Through these artistic techniques, this ordinary story is given a deep and novel theme, which makes the film achieve the perfect form and content. Combine.
1. The implicit beauty of the film's theme performance.
Art is subtle, and film art also has this art rule. The subtle expression makes the artistic works more rich in content, and makes the theme of the whole work more charming and memorable. ""The Mood for Love"" has such artistic characteristics. Director Wang Jiawei added a metaphorical and symbolic expression to the film's inner charm. Just like a hazy poem, every word including every punctuation has its symbolic meaning, and it is also like a freehand drawing, with each line implicitly metaphorical. The use of distinctive metaphors and symbolic expressions makes this work both implicit and deep in the expression of thematic ideas. The film not only reflects the misfortunes of Zhou Muyun and Su Lizhen because their lovers are derailed, but also not only reflects the sincere emotions between them, but also reflects the general emotional life and moral concepts of people in that era, that society.There are no ups and downs from the beginning to the end. It is precisely because of this gentle narrative rhythm that the film has sufficient time to portray details, better express the protagonist's rich and complex psychology, and increase the lyricism of the film. At the same time, leave the audience with imagination and thinking time.
The coordination of the action of the characters in the film and the theme music is perfect. In the soothing three-beat rhythm of the theme music, Su Lizhen walked alone while carrying the lunch box to buy food, Zhou Muyun 's facial movement when eating chaos on the stall, the movement of sitting in the office while smoking and writing, etc., whenever the theme music When it sounded, the character's movement and the music ""slap-da-da"" three beats moved slowly in rhythm, as elegant and co-coordinated as a dancer dancing in the music, intoxicating. Wang Jiawei used slow-motion to perfectly combine the movements of the characters and the theme music of the movie, and the movements and the music were in the same rhythm. Strongly expressing the character's inner world, listening to the theme music and watching Su Lizhen's slow walking in the dim and long corridor, we can't help but feel her inner loneliness and depression. Seeing Zhou Muyun silently leaving the hotel room, we all felt the pain and helplessness in his heart deeply. There is also a slow shot of the two writing novels together in the hotel room, and also presented in a soothing rhythm under the theme music melody, showing the memorable good time spent by the two together. The director shot these movements in slow motion to match the melody of the music. The soothing rhythm is very strong. Increased the lyricism and artistic appeal of the film. In a gentle rhythm, we feel the emotional thoughts that the film wants to express, and the love process of the two from loneliness to falling in love and then leaving. Whether it is right or wrong is already unclear.""The Mood for Love"" has shaped a novel, refined, rich and ambiguous theme from a new perspective. It shows the ""that era"", the contradiction between morality and emotion, the conflict between the colonial culture and the traditional culture in the 1960s, and the complex and delicate nature of human nature. Zhou Su's love story of wanting to ""love"" but not ""love"" makes people feel the complex relationship between human nature, society, and morality, giving people a touch of regret and helplessness. Wang Jiawei did not position the content of the film only in the love of men and women, but added a period of color, national color and human nature to it through a series of unique expressions. This is the success of this film.",In the Mood for Love
89,lingmeister,Another great film by Wong Kar-wai,8,7 July 2002,"Wong Kar-wai gives us another masterpiece full of mood, atmosphere, color and music.  While not quite reaching his pinnacle in Chunking Express, nevertheless, it is still excellent.  He seemed to have done a turnaround and slowed things down a bit, instead of giving us the atmosphere of hectic coolness and mood of uncertainty in some of some of his prior films, he went with the slow and sullen pace for this doomed romantic encounter.  His use of slow motion for many of their encounters adds much to the slow build-up of the sexual tension in the film.The characters Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan played out all their interactions with subtle facial expressions or body motions, along with the partner's reactions to it.  It makes their encounters even more erotic than if they had hopped into bed together.The set and cinematography captured the romanticized Hong Kong of the 1960's very convincingly.  Plus the many scenes are shot from behind doorways or as if peering from someone's back, giving us the sense of voyeuring into their private life.As described before, the film is on the slow side.  So those that wants a romantic film delivered on a plate for them might find it boring.An interesting deleted scene in the DVD includes the whole ending that occurred in Cambodia.  It describes a little more of the reason for his final action and leads to a better closure, but it also lifts the mood of the ending up a bit with their cordial encounter and polite inquiry of unanswered questions.  It would have been a mixed bag to add the scene, but I guess if the sombre mood of the ending is to be preserved, then the scene was left at the cutting floor for a purpose.",In the Mood for Love

91,Sinnerman,Sensual mood pieces,10,1 December 2000,"I would have preferred films with a more narrative energy. We go to the cinema, very often for the sole reason to be told, a story.But most of Wong's works does not gain my support because jerky manic editing and innovative framing of shots just don't succeed in engrossing our mind nor encourage us to look for a story strain throughout in his work, What we most of the time get are labrythine mumbo jumbo posing as avant garde mood pieces that pander to the 'acquired' taste of Euro Art House enthusiast.Not me, I'm a simple man, I like Comrades, almost a love story, I like Notting Hill and I like Twelve Monkeys.All that said and done, I must finally say this is latest 'masterpiece' by Wong Kar Wai managed to click with my mindset(intentionally or other wise). He has dispensed with the need to have pacing and jumpcutting tricks thereby lowering the risk of losing audience for the sake of stylistic overkill.I like both lead who understand their character's background and LIVE THAT LIVE as 'naturally staged icon of societal repressed soul mate'Subtlety is Beauty, Sensual cinematography and soundtrack is Beauty, Simplistic emoting of character's feelings is beauty. In short, this was a beatiful film. My take on it, a Pan Euro influenced Oriental tale highlighted evocatively by the nuanced movement of the characters.",In the Mood for Love
92,IamROCKAS,Romantic and melancholic,7,18 February 2021,"This was the movie I chose to watch alone on Valentine's day this year. At first, I didn't really understand what's going on, I caught up to all the hints way too late but, by the end, I was left speechless by the performance. I wouldn't say this movie is for my taste, as the movie is really linear - not a lot happens and it moves really slow with the story, there are no ups and downs in the tone, and the only things that kept me through it all was the sensual overload that his movie brings. Yes, I really liked the chemistry between the two lead roles and they have that charisma that kept me from quitting in the first part of the movie.The atmosphere that the movie presents is both melancholic and slightly somber with a sprinkle of passion and lightheartedness. The setting that brought our two leads together is depressing, to say the least, as it hurt both of them in more ways than I could imagine but the way they handled this newly discovered painful connection is cute in my eyes. Neither of them expected to fall in love at the end except for us, the viewers. At that moment I was finally starting to enjoy the movie and I'm kind of happy this is not a happy ending that most romantic flicks are known for but a melancholic one, which feels more real to me.",In the Mood for Love
93,Alcaminhante,Possibly the most romantic movie ever made.,10,13 November 2001,"I don´t where to start, for everything that has been said of positive in the other reviews posted here, i agree totaly. I could go on and speak one more time of the incredible photography, the perfect soundtrack but i won´t. Every other person who felt the movie already has done that.
And this is where this movie is so special, it´s a movie to feel, not just a movie to watch and go home. I have seen ""In the mood for Love"" a couple of months ago and i still think about it. About its images ,music and incredible atmosphere.I guess some people only want to chew some popcorns and go home, most of this people will never get the beauty of this movie, because they´re incapable due to an overdose of Hollywood-pop-corn-Julia-Roberts-clichéd-romance-movies. People are so acostumed to Hollywood crap, that when they watch something that doesn´t follow the same over used plot over and over again, they imediately think there must be something wrong with the movie. Or worst they call it an ART-House movie. Or even worst a movie for intelectuals. Just because it´s diferent.""In the mood for love"" may be ART but it´s definetely not an anti-comercial movie, it´s just a diferent style of comercial (and that´s not bad). It´s a comercial film for people who are sick of Hollywood crap and are open minded to diferent styles. And for the people who think this is an empty movie because it has no plot, well i guess we the ones who love this movie can only feel sorry for them, because there is no doubt in my mind this is one of the most romanticaly ""real"" stories ever filmed. It´s realy a movie that you love or you hate it. It just depends on wether you feel it or not. As i said, this is a movie to feel, not to chew popcorns.Even the movie trailler is a little work of Art by itself, it´s definetely one of the most fantastic movie traillers i ever saw, and the best combination of music and images i saw in recent years. Watch this movie, love it, and buy the collectors edition dvd with two disks filled with all the extras you ever wanted. A dvd as good as the movie. And the perfect romantic movie, if ever there was one. On par with Casablanca. And i don´t even particulary like the genre. Anyway miss this and you´ll be missing one of the best movies ever made. The Oscars ? What´s that ?",In the Mood for Love

95,davidals,"Gorgeous and moving drama, slowly revealed",9,9 December 2003,"One of the finest Hong Kong films in quite some time, IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE is - at the surface - about the link between tension and desire, and the allure of what is (theoretically) forbidden, as it examines - in subtle fashion - the complex relationship, early 1960s, between a man and a woman (neighbors in a Hong Kong rooming house) who have discovered the infidelity of their respective spouses, and shortly thereafter begin to explore their desire for each other. Had they given in to pragmatism, cynicism or a perhaps justified taste for revenge, they would've simply fallen into the sack together, and that would be it. Instead Wong surrounds them with limitations - close neighbors in the rooming house, and cultural sanctions against infidelity (ignored by their spouses, obviously) - forcing them to play-act and tiptoe their way into a relationship that evolves slowly and sweetly, managing to combine the illicit and the courtly. The end result highlights the delicate theatrics of romance, with the intensity of genuine affection justifying the solemnity of the love-as-play story line.Magnificent, slow-moving and well-told, IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE offers no intense drama, preferring instead a slow accumulation of subtle moments - shifts in color or seconds of eye contact - to express emotion and detail in the story. Such small, easily missed moments are surrounded by an eye-popping visual style - elegance is raised to unearthly levels throughout. An excellent film which - though it demands patience - has much to reveal.",In the Mood for Love

97,Det_McNulty,Passionate Longing Held Behind Closed Doors,9,23 November 2007,"Asian cinema director Wong Kar Wai received a triumphant amount of critical acclaim throughout the '90s with works such as, Days of Being Wild, Chungking Express and Happy Together, but it was not until 2000 that he had unknowingly crafted and successfully executed his magnum opus, In the Mood for Love. Four years later, Wong Kar Wai released 2046 (a follow-up), which I consider his unsurpassed masterpiece, further proving himself as an artist who gradually improves with age. While I am not particularly fond of his debut feature, As Tears Go By and mid-90s ""music video"", Happy Together, I still consider him one of the most reputable directors working today. Filming In the Mood For Love took time, fifteen months to be exact and when it premiered at the Cannes in May 2000 it had only just been completed. The reason for such a huge amount of time being spent on one picture was due to the director's appropriate love of improvisation, something which should be noted upon viewing.When an American film deals with romance, sex often becomes a strategic selling point. In the Mood for Love somehow manages to avoid this by keeping a restrained and highly sensual milieu in constant view, while still remaining subtle. Essentially, In the Mood for Love is about trapped memories and the yearning to follow one's instincts. Set in Hong Kong during the '60s, a newspaper editor (played by Tony Leung) and neighbouring secretary (Maggie Cheung) develop a close, yet momentary friendship on finding that they both doubt the loyalty of their own lovers and share a similar sense of urban alienation. Nonetheless, it becomes noticeable that the two so-called sociologically middle-class- ""friends"" do not just relate, but each hold an overwhelming and unspoken desire for the other. Unlike their extramarital lovers, the two ""friends"" confine themselves from becoming impulsive, however the film argues whether or not this is for the better. It would be naive to not recognise the fierce almost foreboding- lust they both have for each other. With all the implications and suited loose-ends, In the Mood for Love carries traditional film-making procedures and leaves the viewer in an almost paralytic awe through its transcendent and always relevant photography. Wong Kar Wai has an expert ability in making every little thing count; nothing can be deemed inappropriate, but only fundamental in developing the themes. Evidently, In the Mood for Love suffered a great deal of pre and post-production stress, fortunately none of this can be seen on the film's radiant surface.It might just be me, but the film seems to have a worn look about it, whereas its successor has a noticeably more polished look. Could this be a way of representing the varying kinds of memories, or an added bonus towards the grand, lyrical set-design; personally, I believe so. Arguably, memories change with time -and therefore fade-, so subconsciously one's mind manipulates the past, only to make the original memory more distorted. I feel that this theory is similar to how the film is presented (e.g. the sudden fade-outs and strangely positioned cuts), and Wong Kar Wai's intention was to depict a story through recollection, rather than from the present moment. The claustrophobic staging is also a means of characters implying their feelings for one-an-other. Toned down shots (sometimes in slow-motion) of cramped alleyways, noodle bars and offices show characters attempting to merely greet the other in unity, while often intentionally allowing the opposing individual the chance to share a brief moment of intimacy. In this case, restraining emotion is the performer's most significant factor in capturing the loss, regret and struggle of acceptance for that of the protagonist. After all, it is a tale of doomed romance, told on an epic scale and the art of physical expression (body language) is a prominent and textbook feature for such situations. Yet in the end the film is ultimately a replaying of events, possibly through the subconscious. In the end, who knows, only time will tell, and in reference to memories dare I quote those immortal, final lines from the Rutger Hauer in Blade Runner? Indeed, films of this sort are so scarce that the pontification of romance and sensuality will linger with you for days ensuing the original viewing. It may be a strenuous viewing experience, but there is no denying the cathartic sensibility found in what is a snapshot of the fragile memories we so strive to retain.",In the Mood for Love
98,jimi99,insignificance,9,18 August 2002,"SPOILER... What is this movie really about?  On the surface it's about something that just about everyone can understand: unfulfilling marriages, infidelity, and the attraction, sexual and otherwise, between a man and a woman.  It is also about the mundane natures of our lives, the idle chatter, the friends and acquaintances all with their own vices and virtues, entertainment, eating, gossiping, etc.  We think that the movie is about two likeable and sympathetic people who have been wronged by their spouses and feel a deep attraction for each other.  We are led to believe that they spend many hours alone together in a creative endeavor (writing) and form a profound friendship, but never express any sexual feelings.  For all but the last 20 minutes of the movie, we are immersed in their lives and caught up in the evergreen plot device of unfulfilled sexual tension.  Then the real theme seems to be revealed, as time is fast forwarded, from the early 60s to the late 60s, beginning with the political changes and then the spiritual foundation of the film.  The sadness and longing of these two individuals for each other in the years since their last parting is made clear, and then whisked away forever in a Buddha's compassionate smile.  Their/our individual lives are insignificant beyond the love that we take to our graves, the secrets of our lives whispered into a tree or a sacred wall. The eternal hears the mundane and has great compassion for the suffering heart that belongs to us all...",In the Mood for Love
99,ALauff,Longing for clarity,9,1 April 2014,"One of the greatest films about romantic longing, In the Mood for Love details the missed opportunities and self-deceptions that block consummation. Redolent of emotional opacity and consisting of resisted moments of fulfillment, a sort of love purgatory is created through the elliptical, space-fractured editing, faces reflected through kaleidoscopic glass, and shots blocked by hazy foreground objects; obscured views that evoke the undefined nature of Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung's love story. Their affair is based on a woeful premise of commiseration: they role-play prior domestic situations to overcome their shared grief, rehearsing what they'd say to their adulterous spouses. Consummation is constantly teased. Leung reveals that he's fallen in love with Cheung, but the same lines are restated as a rehearsal, a recurring narrative device that archly toys with convention. This repetition motif is central to the mood of time lost and inhibited passion, as in a recurring slow-motion interlude backed by mournful strings, which wordlessly conveys what they've agreed to suppress. Still, this fragile emotional vortex that Wong, Doyle, and Pin Bing Lee have so masterfully created might dissipate like vapor if not for a poetic, resonant ending that affixes a tangible context to its maelstrom of motifs. Taking a page from Tarkovsky, the film's virtual mourning in a ruinous Cambodian temple demonstrates that where love may be short-lived, regrets and second-guessing own a permanent place in the memory.",In the Mood for Love
100,zolaaar,Satellites,9,13 November 2004,"SPOILER ALERT!!!You can listen to Wong Kar-wai's movies like a radio play: Invisible vibrations between the characters, the rooms where they stay in, the rhythm that presses them ahead, attraction and dislike - the whole spectrum of the atmosphere is played back by the sound track. The dialogue is mostly completely unimportant.The narration is similar to a childish amorous look at a beautiful woman and a sad man whose sorrows are noticeable, but helpless. ""In The Mood For Love"" is told from a child perspective, but the child never appears as a narrator. The aesthetic of the film is developed by an extreme light and color dramaturgy, harsh cuts, an unattached, almost documentary camera and a complex, unobtrusive sound.The genius use of Nat King Cole's ""Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps"", whose mysterious power grows the more often it is repeated and the melancholic waltz helps in the graceful choreography of the two protagonists. Maggie Cheung in her beautiful dresses is brilliant, the perfect vis-à-vis to the handsome, stylish Tony Leung. The audience assumes a romance between them, but Wong just sees sad resignation. The two potential lovers are revolving around each other like satellites, knowing that they never will share the same orbit. You wish that they will find each other. They won't and the emotional power of their non-love-sex-relationship makes the movie immensely fascinating.It is about broken luck and unspoken love. In all of Wong's films these are the leitmotives. Love, whether it comes too early or it comes too late to take the one and not the other person. The yearning of the characters that is never satisfied, their loneliness, the mourning, and the luck that they experience when it is too late.",In the Mood for Love
101,cafescott,Neckties and dress collars,9,10 August 2015,"***Recommend the comments from Ed Gonzalez (""Possibly Wong Kar-Wai's best film"", Ed Gonzalez, 17 December 2000)***""In the Mood for Love (Kar Wai Wong, 2000),"" a whispered secret in a hollow​, is oozing with style. Visually and audibly, it teases the viewer into believing the platonic relationship between two married Japanese neighbors is about to go horizontal. Poetic and somewhat dreamlike, ""In the Mood"" is still erotic, even though the two leading figures are keeping their clothes on and often just holding hands.Set in 1963 Hong Kong, Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung) and Chow Mo-wan (Tony Chiu Wai Leung) are both married and living in the same apartment building. Their respective spouses are both absent. (They never appear; we only hear their voices.) The estranged pair believe the missing spouses are having an affair. Tony Leung's character is a journalist, and rather stoic. While his wife stays away, Chow continues to see Mrs. Chan frequently. He gradually becomes interested in Mrs. Chan, a proficient secretary for a shipping firm. During a heavenly rainstorm he makes a move: A gentle hand touch, even when expected, arrives to the other hand as a question. Minutes later she has a clever response. Her blink-and-you-miss- it, well-placed finger touch on his dark slacks (just below his belt) happens to speak volumes to the man's central control. Even though Mrs. Chan routinely shows interest in Chow, she has no plans to adulterate. Chow eventually leases an apartment for them and they spend a lot of time together. A favorite game is play-acting that one or both is the missing spouse of the other. This always leads to the same question: If they are, why can't we?Whenever their relationship seems to cool, Mike Galasso's exquisite music arrives and the principal characters move in slower motion. These moments are really invigorating. The best part is when Gallasso's music is playing and the two are passing each other on their nightly noodle run. They are an attractive, well-dressed pair. Both dress fabulously. He habitually wears business clothes; i.e., a suit, (minus the jacket), dark slacks and a white dress shirt. He perpetually wears a necktie that varies in its degree of perceived torture. The stoic Chow enjoys smoking, and the silky clouds of spent tobacco often linger over him to become his only visible sign of frustration. Curiously, while Mrs. Chan's dresses vary in color, they all have high collars. (Her wardrobe apparently only consists of dresses with high collars.) Ms. Cheung's neck is so habitually covered that it appears to represent her fidelity. (Is this commonly used in Eastern culture?)Kar Wai Wong wrote the narrative, which is filled with ordinary conversation made interesting by the appealing actors. Wong also directed. Along with his cinematographers, the visual aesthetics are elite. The color choices, the lighting and the moments which look like they were actually filmed in 1963 are very impressive. One simply gets taken away with ""In the Mood""'s jazzy vibe. The closing scenes unfold masterfully. Don't fret cinephiles: Your first date can be Monday night screening of ""In the Mood"". However, never forget that there are always two sides to every love story--or failed love story.",In the Mood for Love
102,AlbertCinefilu,"A movie for the subconscious and how I felt about a movie abounding in finesse, about a flower, about a mood.",9,3 February 2021,"''In the Mood for Love'' is undoubtedly the best doomed romance movie I have ever seen. It made me remember a period in my life, around 13, when I'd be stuck in a near-depression state for the rest of that week after seeing ''Never let me Go'' or another tragic/dramatic story. A time when everything was felt intensely, when every single unhappy ending felt like your puppy has just died .Now, I want to note sth. for me in the future: To be honest, I was very immersed in ''The Mood for Love'' but, at the cost of sounding like a madman, I have to confess that I wanted to cry in the end but just couldn't. I had all the reasons to but I couldn't. I'm now 19 and since I've last seen a similar movie in the 9th grade I've changed much. 4 years ago I'd have been drowned by sorrow and sadness. What I feel now at the end of the movie, on the other hand, is a certain bitterness, not tearfulness. Maybe I'm right and the nature of the movie is not a lachrymogenic one, but still, I wonder if Allison Reynolds was partially right in the Breakfast Club when she said ''When you grow up, your heart dies''.I have another theory. I think this is the perfect example of a powerful story that has everything necessary to reach the farthest corner of your souls and make your face and eyes express what you feel, but still, it doesn't have this effect. Instead, it's your subconscious that is affected. The mood enters your subconscious. It's not your body functions, not your eyes, not your face who are affected, it's the deepest corner of your mind.

But he could not, for lack of courage, she turns and walks away.I don't know why this didn't click with me the first time, as far as romance and style go this is right up my alley. An excellent exercise in subtlety and restraint, Kar Wai Wong's poignant drama is about those who are hurt and left alone rather than those who hurt and leave. The people getting hurt are Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan, two neighbors in 1960s Hong Kong, abandoned by their spouses, who are presumably having an affair. The spouses are never shown on screen, as if to accentuate the sense of isolation and loneliness of the protagonists. Meanwhile, Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan develop feelings of their own through mundane chance (or are they?) meetings in hallways and rainy streets. Trying to be better than their spouses, they hide their forbidden feelings from both themselves and those around them; as a visual representation, the two are often shot from strange, obscure angles, and in most of the scenes, you only see one of them (or neither) at the time, as if showing both their faces at once would be too intimate. Also, their little role plays, designed to practice how they would react if their partners actually admitted to cheating, subtly double as a metaphor for the façade they have to uphold for the rest of the world.Emotions or (futile attempts of) a lack thereof are in the foreground, but you can't not mention how this is a stylistic feast as much as an emotional. Lone raindrops poetically dripping on wooden boards, walls soaking in deep red, and that stunning L'eclisse-esque ending, all set to the nearly cartoonishly sensual theme, provides the perfect setting for a story as much about hands touching each other as hands pulling away.",In the Mood for Love

I mean, i still really liked it, but considerably less than any of his others. It's the only one of his that i didn't find completely brilliant. Of course, by most standards it's a great film, but i expect utter transcendence from this guy. Needless to say, the visuals were amazing, but as a whole the film didn't move me nearly as much as his others. It seemed less psychologically complex somehow, more surface level. I missed the voice-overs from his other films, and just in general the characters didn't seem as well-defined or real. I didn't get as good of a sense what these people were feeling as i did in ""Happy Together"", certainly. A lot of people like to compare this to ""Lost in Translation"" and like to say how much better this film is than that, but i, for the first time concerning Wong Kar-Wai, have to disagree. So sue me, i think ""Lost in Tranlsation"" is better than this. Which is not something i even like saying, considering how previously all of Wong Kar-Wai's films were clearly superior to Ms. Coppola's, and if anything make ""Lost in Translation"" seem more amateur than it really is. At their best, Wong Kar-Wai (and Tsai Ming-Liang) both make ""Lost in Translation"" seem sort of second-rate. Which it really isn't i don't think, it's a great film in it's own right, but i can't help but feel like it's sort of a streamlined, watered-down version of what they do. It's very much the same way i feel about Jim Jarmusch's ""Broken Flowers"" compared to Vicent Gallo's ""The Brown Bunny"". But anyway, sadly, this is not the case with ""In the Mood for Love"" when i really hoped it would be. That said, Wong Kar-Wai is still probably my favorite filmmaker out there",In the Mood for Love
109,nikxatz,Love and Pain,9,3 July 2019,"Love is a ""thing"" now. Every commercial, every song, every film... is more or less about it. But, even if love is ""everywhere"", we live in a society were we ""love"" everyone and consider love a piece of cake, something simple and easy to obtain, thus something utterly shallow, something like a sweet to feel better and show our happiness. We want to look nice so that they love us and we are loved. In the end we are transformed into that superficial and non-authentic beings that only care about what others ""feel"" about them and consider that the more they are being loved the more good things they'll say about them, the more famous and likable they tend to become. Alas, though, form time to time, certain films and works of art pop out and make us reconsider what love and emotions and our self truly are. These are films like ""Her"" by Spike Jonze or ""Lost in Translation"" by Sofia Coppola and ""The Lobster"" by Yiorgos Lanthimos or every single song of ""Radiohead"" or... a
sweet and intimate film called ""In the Mood for Love"" by Wong Kar-Wai.It's about two people who realize that their spouses are having an affair, so they decide to test how they managed to do that by acting like them and meanwhile they create their own affair and form a strong bond, but choose to follow a platonic relationship so as not to sin like their spouses.The reflections of the characters form mirrors, the close-ups to their looks and smiles, the smoke of a burning cigarette, a narrow stairway, a look from the window, a walk into the dark streets, a hug to ease the pain, the reds and the blues... all these ARE the film. It is a really astheticly preside film that creates a hallucinating and lovely tone, but never feels too much. It gives attention to the small moments. That glance of happiness, a small for an instant, a look of pain, a tear in the eye, Love is about silence. About speaking and feeling one without even talking, The glares, the touches, the eyes. Love can be transported through all of these.
This film is also really different in its storytelling and that is because of the characters, They are single-layred. They acquire ethos and have a moral code so they never give in to their natural and justifiable temptations and desires to be loved and kiss and make love and be one. They are controlled and also stand up for tragic figures who have found ultimate love but because of their character and loyalty cannot reach it. This is masterfully depicted through the constant denial of the lovers to be like their spouses.
Also, these film serves a story of pain. One of the main characteristics that brings the 2 together is the identical pain they both suffer from. They have been betrayed and trying to see what their spouses' affair seemed like made it even more harsh. The pain of their lost love but also of their inability to form a bond of love now is beating the characters too hard, We see it in their eyes, in their constant and immutable sadness.
The mood and tone are those of love and desire and sadness and pain and it all perfectly depicted on the screen. The directing is spot on, so subtle and stylish. The acting is superb.
I only had one really small issue with the film. First, there is a certain track which is repeated 8 or 9 times in the whole film and although I loved it I felt that they could have used another track in some scenes, I mean, the soundtrack is really great and there is a variety of different types of songs... why didn't they use another lovely track? And the director has said that it is because of the theme of the film to repeat itself and I really respect that, especially during the room sequences but I felt that at times there was no reason to play that particular track.But that is a really tiny bug for which I did not bother that much.The result is a mesmerizing and heartfelt film about passion, our inner wants and needs, about how complex and weird can love be, about pain and sorrow and lost love and longing for it. It is a secret kept deep in the bole of an old tree. But it's not a secret to us. I will never forget this deeply moving and passionate story and I will always be coming back when I am in the mood for...Love",In the Mood for Love

I love movies like this that don't rely on plot, where the director takes a relatively small idea (here, two neighbors finding out their spouses are having an affair with each other) and develops it with style, never filling our minds with too much unnecessary information.As the two neighbors' relationship develops, we're treated to a number of pretty cool things. When the two are dining and they realize what's going on behind their backs, the camera whips from side to side between them, and when she inquires as to what he's getting at in the conversation, it whips to his face from behind, like something in the back of his mind has just been brought to the front. Whoever is responsible for the camera movement -- whether it's Wong or cinematographer Doyle -- is something close to a genius. And the gorgeous cinematography is lush without the colors bleeding into each other. Precise showiness. And some of the editing, like one sequence with her walking up stairs, is a wow.The moment when the two decide to reenact how their spouses made the first move on one another is inspired, and how it evolves into their own relationship making its first appearance is very crafty. Some of the imagined situations, or ""rehearsals,"" are pretty funny: ""If he admits it outright, let him have it."" ""I wasn't expecting he would admit it so easily."" And the moment following that, where she softly implodes, is heartbreaking: ""I didn't expect it to hurt so much."" But we also have to ask, how much of this is a rehearsal? Since we never really see their spouses....aw, I'm reading too much into this!We're given two splendid, restrained performances aided no doubt by Wong's weird approach of letting them in on only so much. And the entire delicately assembled structure is looped with a repeating theme: pouncing strings in the background, with one in the foreground holding a long, evocative melody -- like someone teasing us, as if they know our secret.Do our two characters ever have sex? Well, we see her meet him in a hotel, and there's an unexplained boy at the end... But I like to think of the boy as a concrete representation of something that never was. As our man whispers his secret into the always-there Cambodian ruins, and the camera tracks through those lonely, empty corridors, the ending brings to a close the idea I was left with: it's about that time in one's life that you'll never have again -- or, like writing kung fu serials, it's the opportunity you never took. All in the time it takes for the hands of a clock to make their trip. 9/10",In the Mood for Love

It was done in a similar manner to an English period piece, good photography, good cinematography, good looking leads, but they sort of drift through the story, and THE THEME. OVER and OVER. Pluck pluck wheeze wheeze, sounded like an excerpt from a well worn European piece, the same exact musical phrase. It became an earsore.

112,joeravioli,In the Mood for Love Without Love,7,29 April 2020,"Depictions of romance in the movies are dominated by expression. Kisses in the rain, longing gazes, seemingly innocent conversations with an undercurrent of desire so obvious that they're either surrogates for or precursors to passionate lovemaking, these and other actions with varying degrees of subtlety comprise the bulk of how filmmakers go about portraying love. This is what makes In the Mood for Love, the most celebrated film of Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-Wai's esteemed filmography, so unusual. It is a romance without romance, a love story with such a meager amount of expressed love that it feels inappropriate to classify it as such.The film follows a man and a woman who discover their spouses are having an affair with each other. Though interested in each other, they promise to keep their relationship strictly platonic and what follows is a tragedy of repressed feeling. The man, played by Tony Leung, is writing a martial arts serial; the woman, played by Maggie Cheung, provides him with ideas and support. Leung maintains a weary, often precarious kindness, while Cheung puts forth an incredibly complex performance with pride, elegance, and rare outbursts of vulnerability. Both are good people, but not unrealistically so. Though they hold off against impulse, their promise never to stoop to the level of their spouses is put to the test.Wong-Kar Wai frequently depicts his two main characters through windows or mirrors or thin fabrics, which almost feels like a reminder that we can't truly know these people. We can watch their eye movements, their facial expressions, their changes in posture, and guess their feelings towards themselves and each other. We can say that their gazes are full of repressed desire, that both are reluctantly falling for each other, that when they seek each other out it isn't, as they say, anything more than a platonic attraction. But the film provides little in the way of certainty. Until those feelings are confirmed, all you can do is guess.It's the film's respectful restraint that is both its greatest asset and, at least for me, its undoing. Maybe I've been spoiled by the candour of American romance, where the parties involved make their emotions clear and the events of the narrative follow from those emotions. Maybe Wong Kar-Wai's approach represents something more realistic than what I'm used to seeing. But In the Mood for Love, unlike what I'm used to, keeps both the narrative and its characters obscured and in that obscurity the individual scenes feel almost aimless. Do we want them to end up together? No, because that would force them to violate the honour that keeps them apart. Do we want them to be apart? No, because they deserve to be together. And of course, this all assumes they even want to be together in the first place. As the film proceeds, its refusal to peel back the mystery surrounding its two characters leads to a series of long and ultimately repetitive staring contests.That said, the movie is startlingly beautiful at times. Cinematographers Christopher Doyle, Mark Lee Ping-Bin find beauty in the film's otherwise nondescript apartment interiors and hallways, capturing a 1960s Hong Kong with unexpected vibrancy. Smoke clouds against bright lights are made hypnotic. Common body movements are made elegant. The two main characters, already beautiful, are made mesmerizing. Some transitions and camera movements are jarringly abrupt, occasionally damaging the continuity of certain scenes, but this is a minor concern. Many frames are so rich with colour and light that they feel like paintings, an illusion bolstered by the relative stillness of the characters on-screen. The repeated use of Yumeji's Theme, a moving, sorrowful piece is yet another beautiful addition to an already tremendously beautiful film.In the Mood for Love is a film so broad and vague that it feels like a canvas for the viewer to project their own emotions and desires upon. A narrative as open as this one seems a risky undertaking for putting the bulk of its impact in the hands of the viewer. For the most part, it seems Wong Kar-Wai's gamble has paid off, as this movie has received almost universal critical acclaim and is viewed as among the greatest films of the last two decades. But your experience of this film depends greatly on what you bring to its quiet, melancholy table.",In the Mood for Love
113,ayubnor-89685,Richly detailed masterpiece,10,29 May 2021,"In The Mood For Love showcases incredible performances from Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung while offering the moral question: What is the point of a doomed romance?

114,stodruza,"In the Mood for Love is an honest film, with gorgeous and generous cinematography worthy in all respects of the best that Almodovar has to offer...",8,7 January 2006,"For a long time I did not know weather I liked this film or not. This is surprising, because I usually do know, but because the film did not go anywhere, I was a bit confused.Two people move into a somewhat communal household setting. Finding their spouses constantly working or away on business trips, their attention, out of sheer loneliness, wanders to each other. After a platonic love affair, the male lead played by Tony Leung Chiu discloses that he has a mistress on the side. Su Li-Zehn, played by Maggie Cheung is hurt, even though their love affair has not been physically consummated. Chiu leaves the country, only to come back years later, when everything has changed.For the cynic's part, the film is correct. By never actively or actually touching the part of love, but only approaching it, the film, admittedly says more than so many others have on the subject. It is also true, I think, that nothing good could have come if they did go on to have the affair. At least that's the feeling I get.If we are to believe it, however, when Garica Marquez writes that ""...love is a state of grace; not the means to anything but the alpha and the omega, an end in itself,"" then this film falls miserably short of this, as do all others. Or, if you are inclined to entirely incomplete minimalism, hits it right on the mark. What films in history have achieved, approached, or sustained this phrase, if for only a short while? My honest feeling in memory is that about two. When Harry Met Sally suggests effectively this romantic perfection; and the getting is all in just getting there. It is interesting that in When Harry Met Sally, this is done in the course of wooing, rather than in its attainment. Can't anyone say anything good about love after it has been achieved by two individuals? Nicholas Spark's recent film The Notebook comes closer to this perhaps than any other film; are we to believe that once love is achieved it flies of the radar only to exist in perfection in some other dimension, or, more true perhaps, becomes latent vehicle for other ends? In the Mood for Love is an honest film,with gorgeous and generous cinematography worthy in all respects of the best that Almodovar has to offer, yet all it manages to say in the end is that ""Life is sometimes like this."" Now this is by no means a diffident thing to say, especially if said well, but the problem really comes at the end of the last act when Kar Wai Wong tries to round out the film by relating, only for the second time, a broader historical theme that plays in the background of the relationship which has just taken place. This is a worthy effort, and the variation on the musical motif played throughout the film is rather brilliant, but the theme's relatively spare indictment plays too little to have much more than a superficial effect on the holistically inclined audience, leaving the viewer to split the difference, a mistake in any film. A director should know where he is going, and how to get there. But in all honesty, it is only one wrong turn. However, as anyone knows, all it takes is one notable imperfection to spoil the perfect barrel of honey.The effort, though, is definitely worth while; trying to let a historical theme broaden and round out the film and raise it beyond the micro-meaning of the couple, but without any real foreshadowing, it is the crucial mistake. In a word, and unfortunately, it is too little too late. It is also, I think, too much of a challenge for the non-Asian viewer not familiar enough with China's history to appreciate completely this sweeping stroke.",In the Mood for Love
115,Preston-10,Hong Kong claustrophobia and Maggie Cheung in that dress.....,10,19 September 2001,"I have never seen a love story where the two lovers hardly hold each other's hands less kiss onscreen. This as anti-Hollywood as ""out of the mainstream"" movies get. The reason why I saw IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE is because I am a huge Maggie Cheung fan and she was amazing in this one. She really gave the most photogenic role from 2000 (despite the superfluous amount of praise toward Julia Roberts' work). Everything about Maggie is perfect in this movie from the way she reacts, to the way she wears her clothes, to the way she says certain things. Her romance is complemented by Tony Leung whose work is also very good. In fact, he probably has the best moment in the movie, which involves the discussion of a mistress. It is such a perfect scene I don't want to spoil it. Nor will I spoil the beautiful ending which has to be one of the best endings I have ever seen in a film. Another interesting thing about this movie is that the movie is about THEM, it does not give unusual focus to one character. It's interesting how everything you know about these two characters is really not in the dialogue but in their faces. There are many, many close-ups in this movie, I really think this gives a claustrophobic atmosphere to their romance. This comes as no surprise since the movie does take place in Hong Kong and we get the impression that this is a place where everything is cramped and everyone knows everything about everybody else. It seems like they give as much concern to seeing each other as they are to keeping their relationship within the confines of social standards as well. This may very well be the most atypical romance to come to the movies in a long, long time since it is the opposite of the hot, sweaty romance that so many filmgoers are use to. Nevertheless, I really liked IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE.",In the Mood for Love
116,pickle-92642,"Overrated, yet still possesses the aspects of a great movie.",8,6 August 2021,"Wong Kar-wai is one of the most unique and interesting directors I've ever seen. The three movies I've watched of his so far are different from any movie I've ever watched. They're stories are told in such an unusual way, sometimes out of order, sometimes 2 different stories that have nothing to do with each other, you never know. It's a style of film that I like, but am not used to at all, therefore after watching I feel a little confused, underwhelmed and awestruck all at the same time. This particular film however, left me the most underwhelmed. It is my least favorite out of this, Chungking Express and Fallen Angels. Let's start with the positives: Absolutely amazing cinematography, really good music with great slow motion montages, a great concept, great performances. This is obviously a good movie, and I can recognize and appreciate that. But... this movie just isn't for me as much as I want it to be. I watched this yesterday, and barely remember anything that happened. Nothing special or memorable, nothing shocking or interesting to me, happened. It was just honestly a great story that bored me to the core. It was a little tedious at times as well. I don't think I've ever zoned out this many times during a movie. I always found myself drifting off thinking about something else when I'd realize that people had been talking for like a whole minute without me noticing. This is not a good thing to happen while watching a foreign language film, so I'll probably have to rewatch it someday to get a true viewing experience.So why an 8/10 then? The description I just gave at the end of that review doesn't seem like it would add up to an 8/10. Well, I clearly missed something here. One day this movie will have my undivided attention, but this first viewing was not that time. This is 1000% a movie that gets better on rewatch (all of WKWs films are). Hopefully someday I will change my mind and not think it's......OVERRATED.",In the Mood for Love
117,p-seed-889-188469,An audio-visual extravaganza,8,18 July 2014,"The films of Kar Wai Wong are something of a problem to me. When I see one of his creations for the first time I am totally blown away and declare it a masterpiece. Then, when I do my research, I find it has been made in 2 weeks, is largely unscripted and is a technical exercise to explore some lighting technique. I find it hard to reconcile that any work ""of art"", movie, painting, book or whatever, conceived under these conditions could ever be considered a masterpiece, yet I feel that despite all this, somehow that it is. Then again I don't suppose Mozart or Van Gogh regarded any of their works as masterpieces either so I guess I can see both sides of that argument.I have titled this review an ""audio visual extravaganza"" for that is surely what, in essence, it is. It is not so much a story as a sequence of breathtakingly composed and processed shots in which such a mundane act as smoking a cigarette can almost knock you over. There are many, many achingly visually beautiful scenes, so many it is almost overwhelming. In my heart I know this is mere seduction rather than cerebral depth, but that's enough for me. As if the visual feast was not enough the use of Yumeji's theme, frequently repeated, and generally a cue for the most dazzling visual sequences, is a layer of icing on the cake a foot thick. In any context or movie this piece of music would be a knock-out but in this one the pizzicato strings so thoroughly evoke the tip-toeing of the two protagonists around each other it is just sublime. The combination of the visual and the aural assaults on the senses is almost unbearable.This is not a movie for everyone, you will either fall in love with it or fall asleep in the first 5 minutes, and neither view is wrong. It has to be said that without the visual and aural treatment the story itself, albeit a charming one, is slight, and I'm not actually sure I could sit through it in its unedited, unprocessed, raw form. It doesn't hurt that Maggie Cheong is such a luminous presence, playing a woman of indeterminate age somewhere between 20 and 40. Tony Leung plays her craggy featured counterpart and the two of them sizzle quietly between themselves in a dreamlike atmosphere in which their affair is more of an understanding.Masterpiece or not I'm still not sure but the effect on me was jar-dropping.

The film's pace is numbingly slow and precious little actually happens between the two.  Yet the backdrop of Hong Kong in the early 1960s and director Wong Kar-Wai's keen sense for capturing the beauty of the setting as well as the principal characters make this film a joy to watch.  Actors Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are both excellent and Wong Kar-Wai has done an extraordinary job in capturing the feel and nostalgia of the past (something so many films and directors try to do but usually fail miserably).  There are so many little details that add charm to the film (a trademark of the director) and the colors and cinematography are what send this otherwise simple story over the top as a marvelous cinematic achievement.  9/10.",In the Mood for Love

121,j30bell,Wonderful Hong Kong Art-house.,9,23 June 2005,"Two people living in the same flat complex find their partners are having an affair with each other. As they try and piece together how it happened, they also embark on an emotional journey that aches for a resolutionBuilding on his previous success with Happy Together and Chungking Express, Wong Kar Wai gives us this rather old fashioned and marvellous story of reawakened passions, yearning and unrequited love. Possibly, In the Mood for Love is not to everyone's taste. It wanders in rather lazily at 98mins: not particularly long for a film, but it appears longer because not a lot really happens. But this lazy feel conceals a quite tightly constructed film. Most of the story is cunningly woven around a series of set piece role plays, where the characters act out presumed scenarios between their respective spouses, trying to work out how the affair started. I say cunning because, of course, this makes it difficult for the audience (and the characters) to tell what is ""in-role"" and what is genuine. If all this sounds rather arty and self-conscience, that's because it is. Unashamedly so. And it is played to perfection by two of Hong Kong's finest, Maggie Cheung and Leung Chui Wai, with some excellent support from Ping Lam Siu and Rebecca Pan.It is also a virtuoso performance by Wong Kar Wai, who treats the audience to a sensory, and sensual, overload. Bringing together Christopher Doyle (who later deployed his lush, over-ripe style on Hero) and Pin Bing Lee (whose beautifully understated style can be seen on Springtime in a Small Town) was cinematographic genius. It has all the bold beauty of Doyle, without, frankly, the Athena-poster cheesiness of his work on Hero. The music, as always with Wong, is prominent. From Nat King Cole singing in Spanish, to the haunting strings of the main theme, it perfectly matches the eclectic beauty of the images. All in all a top film, whether judged on plot, acting, cinematography or soundtrack. Similar to, but more accessible than, Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, this is a beautiful, old fashioned story about love lost and regained. And watch out for Tony Leung's hotel room 2046, which presaged Wong's recent film of the same name.",In the Mood for Love

The director overused the music, but honestly, that was such a deliberate choice that it only enhanced the cinematic style. A couple more things he overused in such a way were slow motion shots and frames within the the main frame. The frames gave this film a real Ozu feel... And the music was strange, strange because beside the beautiful soundtrack, Wong Kar Wai also used some Spanish music. And I just kept trying to understand: why? Maybe he wants to make sure we don't think the film is purely meant for Hong Kong, but rather extends to the rest of the world too, as such a love affair could really happen anywhere.There was definitely social context about all of this, maybe even political but I didn't catch that part too well. Socially, both of the people were oppressed by the society such as the neighbors who it seemed, had their windows wide open to see and comment on all the characters were doing. Hence maybe frame within a frame? This makes lots of sense because a frame not only shows you what the world is, but it shows this world to you from a certain perspective. Like when the girl is sitting alone reading a newspaper, and the man goes behind her, we already associate them together just because of the framing.Wong never showed the faces of their spouses, maybe again, saying that it does not really matter what they look like because they don't really exist in the protagonists' lives, hence they shouldn't in ours either.Overall a greatly made fim.

I thought this film captured the elements of love and betrayal in a way I never would have thought of. This shows the true pain a person goes through when someone has betrayed their trust in love. The music Wai uses in the scenes when Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung pass each other is very effective in capturing the moments leading up to their somewhat repressed love for each other.There's somewhat a feeling of withdrawal in the film, as we witness two characters who are searching for happiness, and having seemingly found it with each other, are still bound to their original partners, perhaps in the hope that love is still once what they found originally.

I'd also seen Chungking Express from the same director as this movie and I quite enjoyed that..While technically well made, with some beautiful cinematography, good cinematography does not a good film make.. You could equate it to a photo realistic painting of a stone wall, while the skill is impressive in doing that, it would still be a boring painting.The dialogue was boring, and the plot was thin to say the least!

128,ilikepuppies,Liberated.,10,23 January 2006,"This is perhaps the most elegant statement about creation I have ever seen. About the essence of artistic creation itself. And for a film to aim that high and to be an extremely artistic creation itself warrants a rare 10.First of all, it is a story about a creator, and his relationships with three creators: his co-creator (Su Li-zhen), his literary creator (Wong) and his Creator (God).At the lowest level we have him writing a martial arts serial, with the assistance of Su, which also manifests their creating fictional spouses at the next level (their lives). Third level, we see that our main character is really Wong, or rather a conception from his own creative mind. It concerns him, as a writer himself. Finally, there is God, who created for him the opportunity to create in the first place.There is also the matter of how this thing is presented visually. Every shot is extremely confining. There is barely enough space in the room for the camera (and in some cases there is no room at all and we are left peering into rooms through tiny windows or out from under tables). The locations include tiny rooms in apartments (shared of course), narrow hallways and staircases, small offices and restaurants, and that wonderful little canopy, which is often the only hiding place from the rain. Suffocatingly tight quarters throughout. That is until his creations are complete and presented to God.So we have all matters of creation taking place, forming in extremely cramped environments, until at last Chow is able to whisper them into the hole (where only God can hear), at which point the world is flooded with beautifully lush open space as the camera floats away, finally free.",In the Mood for Love
129,seandchoi,"Nostalgic, elegiac tale of doomed romance",10,6 March 2002,"I think that New York Times film critic Elvis Mitchell wrote the best one line review of In the Mood for Love when he said that it is ""dizzy with a romantic spirit that's been missing from the cinema forever."" How true those words are! Truly romantic films are so rare these days, while films that include plenty of sex and nudity (which are often portrayed in a smutty and gratuitous manner) abound. So, given this cinematic climate, Wong Kar-wai's latest film feels like a much needed breath of fresh air. In the Mood for Love is about the doomed romance between two neighbors (""Mr. Chow,"" played by Tony Leung and ""Mrs. Chan,"" played by Maggie Cheung), whose spouses are having an illicit affair, as they try ""not to be like them."" But after hanging out with each other on lonely nights (while their spouses are away ""on business""/""taking care of a sick mother""), they fall madly in love, and must resist the temptation of going too far.Several factors are responsible for making In the Mood for Love a new classic among ""romantic melodramas,"" in the best sense of that term. First, the specific period of the film (i.e. 1960's Hong Kong) is faithfully recreated to an astonishing degree of detail. The clothes (including Maggie Cheung's lovely dresses), the music (e.g. Nat King Cole), and the overall atmosphere of this film evokes a nostalgia for that specific period. Second, Christopher Doyle's award-winning, breathtakingly beautiful cinematography creates an environment which not only envelopes its two main characters, but seems to ooze with romantic longing in every one of its sumptuous, meticulously composed frame. Make no mistake about it: In the Mood for Love was the most gorgeous film of 2001. (It should also be mentioned that Wong Kar-wai's usual hyper-kinetic visual style is (understandably) toned down for this film, although his pallet remain just as colorful.) Third, there is the haunting score by Michael Galasso, which is accompanied by slow motion sequences of, e.g. Chan walking in her elegant dresses, Chan and Chow ""glancing"" at each other as they pass one another on the stairs, and other beautiful scenes which etch themselves into one's memory. The main score--which makes its instruments sound as though they're literally crying--is heard eight times throughout various points in the film and it serves to highlight the sadness and the longing which the two main characters feel. Fourth, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung both deliver wonderful performances (Leung won the prize for best actor at Cannes) and they manage to generate real chemistry on screen.The above elements coalesce and work so nicely together to create a film that feels timeless, ""dizzyingly romantic,"" and, in a word, magical. In the Mood for Love, perhaps more than any other film of 2001, reminded me why it is that I love ""going to the movies."" And I guess that is about the highest compliment that I can pay to a film.",In the Mood for Love

The strong stab of betrayal slices your heart open like a piece of paper, you can't put it back to it's original form with tape or glue. The paper will always remain damaged no matter what. The story itself is based off on a short story that those who own the Criterion version can read for free. (It takes up 90% of the booklet which explains why the booklet is 48 pages long) The story and it's philosophy is something worth understanding. I watched this as a child, I can never understand the story again and I should've hold onto this film for a little later when I am an adult. But, the past is always the past. It's not like other Wong Kar Wai films and this one is the one that you must take seriously compared to his other works. It has a very interesting meaning about true love and its haunting.",In the Mood for Love

132,redcanofevil,One of the best Romantic movies out there,7,28 November 2019,"I doubt I can do this movie justice as I was neither in the mood for love or in the mood for watching artsy movies but I've been pushing this movie aside for a long time and figured better now than never.I am aware that this is a critically acclaimed film well known for its elegant cinematography and poised theme. And it does just that but I do have a few gripes regarding this film and overall it somewhat ended as a mixed bag for me. But even the parts or direction of filming I didn't like were intentional choices by the director and even if I didn't like it I will honor his work regardless.Let's get the gripes out of the way as there are tons of merits to go over. The editing in the 1st act was absolutely atrocious. The quick fade to black after each masterfully crafted frame really bogs down the whole immersive experience. This might be a personal issue as I am notoriously strict on editing and frame changes but as I said the constant fade to black after each short sequence was unbearable to look at. The movie was mostly shot on single take fixed shot basis and the director obviously went for immersion in those but it completely baffles me how the director thought it would be a great way to abruptly cut a scene and move on to the next.These constant fade to black becomes almost nonexistent in the 2nd act of the film and that is when the film truly peaked. But it all goes south at the 3rd act for reasons I'm coming to in a second.Another major issue with the film is its lack of consistency in its pace and its incentive to time jump which is mostly present in the 3rd act. Now it's not exactly a bad choice to show events converging in 5-6 years but it disrupts the already hyper stylized pace of the film.The horrendous and abrupt screen cuts and the inconsistent pacing and occasional time skips comprises most of my major gripes with this film. So let's move on to appreciate the telling of a mundane story in a masterful way.The theme the film deals with are: Love, infidelity, adultery and loneliness. Each subtly yet very powerfully presented and etched into the continuity. The plot is very mundane but this is where a film claims its place as a film and not a generic forgettable love story of boy meets girl. I always said this about artsy masterpieces that ""they are relatively simple stories portrayed as masterful crafts with elegant cinematography and a hauntingly eerie score to bind it all together to form something transcendent"". This film is just that and more as it starts as a simple moving-in story of two different families that gets sullied with the unfolding of rather sad events. I will completely skip spoilers as I intend you watch the same way as I did going in completely unaware.This is the work of a director completely in love with his craft and it pops out through the gorgeous cinematography and somewhat narrow claustrophobic shots of relatively poor financial setting. The slow camera pan and the still one take shots are a sight to behold. The use of color and the lighting is also superbly done and works beautifully with the current setting.The score is another aspect that shouldn't go unpraised in any way. Every time the melodious score started you get a sense of romanticism and can't help but root for the hopeless cast.Speaking of cast both the leads were fantastic and absolutely nailed their respective roles. There was a scene where the lady goes from anxious to sad to crying and I remember saying ""wow that's some good acting"". But it may be hard to judge for some as the Chinese are really conservative and very subtle in expressing their emotions. They are the farthest thing from needlessly loud and obnoxious and really do take pride in maintaining etiquettes.I have so far blabbered on about the technical aspects and the acting and now it's time to get in on what transpires in the film. The film draws a thin line between friendship and adultery. Both the cheated and heartbroken leads confide in each other for averting loneliness and become more and more attracted to each other. In the end this hopeless pair decided to not be what hurt them in the first place and be better than their foes. It is a strong concept and unusual for a movie marketed as a romantic one to not feature much hands-on romance. But this is a welcoming aversion as it not only shows the masterful direction of the director but also distinguishes itself from the rest of genre sharing films/movies out there.Don't get disheartened when I said there isn't any hands-on romance in this romantic movie. I had no idea a movie without much physical contact could evoke romanticism on such heights. As I said there aren't any usual genre clichés in this film and it still manages to be better than the ones floating in the market. The strong chemistry between the leads definitely helped portray this ""silent love"" that stems from loneliness to wanting a likeminded companion and it works brilliantly. I'm struggling here to express myself as I steer clear of the romance genre and having to rely on some buzzwords here and I apologize for that.I can't say I'm particularly a fan of the insanely fast paced finale but I totally get what the director tried to go for and that is probably the best outcome. It is somewhat painful for the viewers riding the wave of a tightly wound romantic ride but it is what it is.All in all ""IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE"" is a hauntingly beautiful tale of a simple forbidden love story that ticks all the boxes to be branded as masterfully crafted. The rudimentary theme, poised cinematography, masterful directions and an eerie score makes it a perfect romance story and easily makes its place among some of the most beautiful yet contained works I've seen.",In the Mood for Love
133,Firas,Another marvelous movie of Wong Kar-Wai talking about loneliness and feelings of a man and a woman in Hong Kong of the sixties,8,4 December 2000,"Two hours ago I was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography. It is quite understandable how it won the prize of Best Camera in Cannes 2000. Close ups predominated it. Close ups of walls, humans and of many other things. The warm colored lighting (which is also usually by the director) gave the movie a warm atmosphere. Only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it. An interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time. Each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie. Silence and slow movements characterize the movie. Some scenes were extended moments or a serious of close-ups. Not only Tony Leung deserves a prize for his superb acting since Maggie Cheung was also so brilliant. I wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes. The story was  also connected somehow with the history of Hong Kong and the region the 1960s. This prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end. In short I would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema.",In the Mood for Love

136,thebeautifulones,Smoking and Chasity has never looked so sexy,10,19 January 2006,"Wong's film makes smoking and chaste walks look more sexy than having sex, I'm being serious here! Mr Chow (played by TLCW) is a journalist who dreams of becoming a martial arts novelist. Mrs Chan (played by the ever beautiful Maggie Cheung) is a secretary in a shipping firm, who, (surprise, surprise, likes reading martial arts films. Is it coincidence, or fate that they would end up moving to the same apartment, separated only by unit numbers? Is it fate that the room Mr Chow actually meant to take, was taken up first by Mrs Chan? At first, everyone is all nice and neighborly. Mr Chow works late, but loves his wife, wanting to take her on a holiday. He buys handbags for her on his trips overseas. Mrs Chan loves her husband, and is loyal to her boss, Mr Ho, whom she knows is having an affair with a certain Miss Yu. She asks her husband to help her get 2 bags, and whether they are the same color, it does not matter. We all know who the bags are for. The hints of infidelity are there, what makes this film a masterpiece, is that Wong does not make everything look too obvious. For example, Mr Ho wears a rather showy looking tie, but before he leaves to see his wife, he changes his tie.When Mr Chow asks Mrs Chan out for dinner, Mrs Chan finds it odd. Then in a conversation, it is revealed, that both know that their respective spouses are having an affair. The faces of their spouses are never shown, their voices only heard, at times we only see their backs, a testament to the message: the affair between the spouses is meant to be secret. No one outside ever sees an affair, it happens behind closed doors.Then, what begins as an experiment between both Mr Chow and Mrs Chan to trace how the affair between their respective spouses began, ended in both of them falling for each other. Yet both these lovers never made a decisive move to be with each other. Mrs Chan would never leave Mr Chan, so Mr Chow decides to move to Singapore.Mrs Chan: We'll not become like them.Yet in trying not to be like their respective spouses, they had invited gossip.Mr Chow: It's me. If I have an extra ticket, would you come with me? This is followed by the song, Quizas, Quizas, Quizas.Pure genius Mr Wong, Mr Doyle and Mr Umebayashi! It is as though the song is answering Mr Chow's question.A quiet tragedy opens before very eyes. 2 lovers with no courage to pursue the love between them.

137,Masoo,Perhaps perhaps perhaps,10,15 November 2002,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSWhat a perfect title! The two main characters are most definitely in the mood; they also don't ever get beyond being in the mood. Repressed emotions have rarely been so charged as they are in this movie ... probably the best comparison would be those British films where a couple of stiff-upper-lip types lust for each other in socially-acceptable silence. While on one level, ""nothing really happens"" in the film, Wong Kar-Wai does a great job of making us anticipate what is about to happen. Of course, our expectations are shattered repeatedly, or rather, they go unfulfilled (""shattered"" is far too showy and emotional for what we see on the screen, which is quiet and, well, repressed). A Nat King Cole song that turns up late in the film (sung in Spanish!) says it all: ""perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.""Maggie Cheung is as beautiful as any actress ever, and it's always nice to see her when she's not being wasted. Tony Leung isn't exactly chopped liver in the looks department either, and both of them give exquisitely moderated performances.The DVD is terrific as well (Criterion strikes again).",In the Mood for Love
138,Nog,Pretentious Junk,2,2 January 2006,"The best thing I can say about this film is the art direction, which conveys the claustrophobic inner world of its characters. Virtually without exterior shots, possibly due to budget constraints (i.e. trying to recreate early 60s Hong Kong), the film relies heavily on its lush, over-saturated interior surfaces to create the mood. Yet I would suggest that beyond being representational of the repressed passion of the characters, there is little more to see here besides the sets. The performances have been outlandishly overpraised by the ""less is more"" crowd. In particular, the often-wrong Cannes judges bestowed a best actor award for a performance that in fact does not even create a three-dimensional character, but focuses on long pulls on cigarettes and blank staring into space. Yeah, great stuff. Both my wife and I have seen thousands of films combined, and we both thought it underwritten, underacted, repetitive, and akin to watching paint dry. Beautiful paint, yes, but that's all.What is more intriguing is the praise the film has gotten. At least one critic mentioned how he thought the film would have been dismissed as laughable if it had been Western actors in a less exotic locale. Could be. It is baffling that so many can be taken by something with so little merit. I could only find one major critic who panned this film: Peter Rainer in New York Magazine. His comments are spot on, in case you want a more thorough argument regarding its self-conscious aesthete mindset.",In the Mood for Love

140,Karfoo,To cheat or not to cheat,8,13 February 2001,"The notion of marital fidelity portrayed in the film seems outdated today, but it is exactly the main characters' adherence to that notion which makes the entire story so touchingly tragic. It is this notion that ennobles them and allows them to stand out, to, as they refer to their respective spouses, ""not be like them"".As Tony Leung said in the film, love just happens. There doesn't need to be a rational explanation as to how it happens, it simply does. Despite their not wanting to stoop to their respective spouses' level, it happened. Fidelity, social mores, and timing all conspired against this relationship coming into fruition. Simply being in love is far from enough.I had the misfortune of sitting beside a young couple (still in university from the snippets of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the entire film, and uninitiated to the pains of lost love and missed opportunities).

The stylish cinematography, the careful framing of each shot, and the tracking and camera placement are meticulous, a testament to Wong Kar-Wai's talents.

The settings, the lighting, the props... all add to the mood for love between the main characters. A whiff of smoke from Chow's cigarette tells us his state of mind, the ever-changing tight-fitting cheongsams of Lizhen reflects the constraints of decision-making, the ruins of Angkor Wat ties in with the deteriorating relationship of the two leads.The excellent use of mis-en-scene gives the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters' relationship.

All four are completely different but superb examples of their genres.  No one seems to think Mood for Love' is ok they either love it or hate it.  Some say that it's to slow and there's no plot, what are they on about? It's a character film and the story goes by at a perfect pace.  Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are both fantastic and Christopher Doyle is simply the best cinematographer in the business watch Temptress Moon' (perhaps my favourite ever film) for more evidence that what I say is true.  Plot points are sometime vague in meaning, but I read it the same way as an earlier post.  That they slept together and that he is the father of her Child.  To sum up, this is a great film, story, acting, directing, look and style are all top notch.

I can say:I wasn't bored.I did find the atmosphere, cinematography, and style interesting.I didn't mind that there wasn't really a plot.The one thing that really did end up sticking in my craw however, besides the fact the characters are fairly boring individuals, is that I just didn't find their behaviors believable.*spoilers*I don't know anything about 60's Hong Kong, but I don't think I should have to in order to make sense of their behavior.  Like another reviewer wrote, the setting is what WKW makes it, and there wasn't anything there to make me think these people would or should have this bizarre sense of obligation to these terrible spouses.  The facts are: their spouses have abandoned and cheated on them, their lives are amazingly isolated and boring, and they (apparently) love each other.  I just don't buy the unrequited stance in this particular scenario and I don't see any validity in arguments trying to make sense of their behavior.

The second time I ran into it... I was in a different mood, no longer had any expectation ... and had more patience, more relaxed mind to ""see"" the film... and as soon as I opened my eyes, I discovered the love... the beauty of the film. I went beyond the language and the love story and saw the acting (not even for a moment did I ever felt like they were acting!) and the cinematography. The first time I heard a definition of what a film is, I was told that it should be a chain of perfectly balanced photographs (shots) and this is the film to match the description.

Actors come and go like tango dancing.
(Hollywood bashing ahead) Hollywood film  always portrain women as wives, mothers, girlfriends not as individuals with their own need and intelligence.  If they want to portrait women as individual (e.g. Bridge of Madison County), they somehow tell you flatly from viewpoint of others (e.g. ""Gee, I never knew mom had a lover, I guess she was not happy with dad"")
This film treat both male/female charactor as human, in fact, it doesn't show their spouse's face at all.  You don't see them as husbands or wives, even they were locked in traditional moral code, instead you feel their character transcends their time, profession, marital role, hobby (reading martial-art novels), it became you. (sorry, maybe a little cliche)It was said that this film took 15 mon. to shot, and during the time there was no script, and actors never know what role they are playing.

155,repulsion,Possibly Wong Kar-Wai's best film,10,17 December 2000,"It's easy to see why many people consider In the Mood for Love to be Wong Kar-Wai's best film. The toned down appeal of the film, centering on the studied view of a relationship put through an emotional ringer, is a retread into Happy Together territory but without the hyper-kinetic patchwork of jarring film stocks and hyper-saturated sequences that have become a trademark of Kar-Wai's films since Chungking Express. Like Soderbergh's The Limey, this is a different kind of curio for Kar-Wai; where dialogue and plot are forsaken by mood and composition in order to create a tale of two delicate lives in a seemingly confining emotional stasis.It's a testament to the genius of Kar-Wai that he is capable to making such a simple tale so resonating. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move in next-door to each other within the same apartment building. He's a journalist who dreams of publishing martial-arts novels and she is a secretary at a shipping company. Their eventual coupling is obvious from the beginning but the pleasure here is the way that Kar-Wai ambiguously paints such a journey with his grand masterstrokes.The key to the success of the film is Kar-Wai's use of the interior space, playing with foreground and background planes in ways that are similar to the works of Polanski. During the wooingly sensuous first half of the film, Kar-Wai isolates Leung and Cheung within shots in such a way that the second person in a conversation is never visible. Kar-Wai is concerned with environment and space here, creating a cramped emotional dynamic between his characters. It's also telling that Kar-Wai never chooses to focus on the physicality of Mo-Wan and Li-zhen's spouses. Their faceless partners are noticeably absent from the film, as they are tending to their own love affairs with each other.This is not to suggest that In the Mood for Love is a confining experience because Kar-Wai manages to inundate his film with broad splashes of hypnotic camera movement and sound. There is one shot where Cheung's slow, sensual rise up a metaphorical stairway turns into Leung's descent down the very same stairwell; their movements perfectly compliment each other, bookending the shot and creating a sense of erotic duality between the two figures. Their souls have connected but they have yet to physically unite. The erotic displacement of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating, as two star-crossed lovers reject physical consummation due to their humble fidelity.Other scenes in the film are punctuated with brief slow-motion shots of Cheung erotically moving through her interior surroundings, set to Mike Galasso's hauntingly beautiful score. Cheung's dresses beautifully compliment her exterior space as she moves slowly through her surroundings. Her movements slowly build up to what seems to be an inevitable fusion between Li-szhen and her dream lover even though the seduction process seems to be entirely sub-conscious.If I make it seem that these two characters are more like two birds unleashing pheromones on each other, it probably isn't that far-fetched of a statement. The tight bond these two characters have with their internal spaces is almost as intense as their relationship to the exteriors. The film rarely moves into an exterior space and when the camera does it is usually to peak through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like confined animals. Kar-Wai continues to tease us even when the lovers get close enough to touch, shattering the couple's proximity to each other by shooting them through mirrors or through gaps within articles of clothing located inside of a closet. Mother Nature even seems to respond to their love lust, often unleashing a soft crest of rain over the characters after their bodies have glided near each other.Kar-Wai's hauntingly atmospheric shots of a waterfall allowed Leung's Lai Yu-Fai to experience a cathartic release in Happy Together, even if Leslie Cheung's Ho Po-wing was not there to enjoy it with him. By that film's end, love was so inextricably bound to the act of war that a third man's muted declarations of love signaled Yu-Fai's realization that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace, even if it would not bring him back his lover. Mo-Wan's journey terminates within the confines of a crumbling temple. His own emotional depletion is paralleled nicely with the political climate of his country, and the absence of Li-szhen is only made tolerable by the fact that Kar-Wai allows Mo-Wan to experience a release of sorts. Mo-Wan caters to an ancient myth and his secretive release into a crack in the temple leaves him capable of living his days with the hope that all his loss and heartache somehow served a higher purpose.",In the Mood for Love

In this film there seems to be enough going on ""between the lines"" to make a Hollywood trilogy. The film twists and turns through quirky scenarios. A little dose of comedy followed by drama followed by joy followed by sadness. It's almost Shakesphereian in it's style. The characters are well developed. The dialog is believable (this is a problem with so many modern films). It also looks very low budget with most of the film taking place in the same 5 or 6 locations. This is a fantastic achievement and I recommend every one should see it. I can't wait to see 2046!",In the Mood for Love
157,mopar-50246,Watching pretty paint dry,4,18 May 2021,"""In The Mood For Love"" has a commonality with Wong Kar Wai's other films. As in they really don't have much of a point to the story, if you can call them stories. Although I do manage to watch the movies in their entirety because the styling, cinematography and scores are beautiful. I didn't care much for ""In the mood for love"". Maybe because their aren't enough oddball characters to mix things up like in ""Fallen Angels"" and ""ChungKing Express"". I think everyone plays it too straight which makes the characters blend and come off as the same. Visually it's a beautiful movie with the 60's Hong Kong styling, but it's just not that enthralling.",In the Mood for Love
158,jamesnicolay,Elegant!,10,22 July 2007,"I was fortunate enough to have seen the Philippine premiere of Wong Kar- Wai's ""In The Mood For Love"" back in 2001. I have never heard of this director prior to seeing the film. I was with Sealdi, my college bestfriend, and we had close to zilch expectations when we sat ourselves in the not-so-crowded theater, waiting for the show to start.It was love at first sight. The movie struck me in so many ways that no other single romance flick had ever done. The musical score sets the pacing of the movie, setting the two lead characters who live in the same area in Hongkong in the 1960s in a romantic mood-- unfortunately, being both married, they're not easily going to give in to this atmosphere of romance. Wong Kar-Wai deceives the audience with his playful use of the environment and the circumstances to conjure a poignant love story which, technically, never started and never concluded. Everything sways to the lulling tune of ""Quizas, Quizas, Quizas"" (literally meaning Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps) and hypnotizes and excites the audience set to the mood of love--the sheer elegance and suaveness of the clothes of Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan, the way they brush past each other while walking along the rustic and raw corridor and stairways of their apartment, the smoke slowly slithering from Chow's cigarette, and the mere taboo that surrounds and reminds them of their social standing and reputation as decent married individuals--these are the aphrodisiacs being fed upon us by the master chef WKW who ultimately leads us back to the reality of things--a world which is not in love, unsympathetic, jaded, and judgmental of our human weaknesses. The mood for love intoxicates us and promises a catastrophic hangover. Chow and Chan chose to remain sober--and there's a certain beauty to their unconsummated story. But why do we, ordinary mortals, give in to the insane, enigmatic, foolish world of love? Because we just do. In the real world of love, we're stupid and bored--and we try to make our own sullen/romantic/deceiving blue funk called love.",In the Mood for Love

Since seeing it, I am sure I have been annoying everybody I know by talking endlessly about it.The film is breath taking. The use of the slow motion to show how everybody experiences time differently, the music that accompanies it so well, and becomes almost synonymous with it. Not only is the music unforgettable, so too is the acting. Both Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung play the parts in such a believable way.Since watching this film not only have I appreciated ChungKing express more, which I would also recommend, but I have also made it my mission to watch more of his work.

It leads us into a world of delicacy and impossible desires. It tells a love story with short scenes, focusing on details, playing with the feelings. The use of music is exquisite, accompanying the movements and feelings of the characters at all times. Visually prodigious. And the actors, magnificent, with special mention of Tony Leung and the look that contains the deepest feelings. I can not find the exact words to describe the beauty of this film, it is an absolute preciousness. One of the advantage of this film lies in its visual, In the mood for Love will attract you from the beginning with its rich color, small details, the repressive feelings, the romance between the two loners and many more.

The main thing that took me out of the movie was the editing, of all things. The way it was done, changing between cuts and fades seemingly at random, often made it very difficult to tell when we were changing scenes, and whether a scene was supposed to be taking place right after the last one or the next day or something. Also, the repetitive soundtrack got a bit irritating, and the epilogue went on for far too long. That's all.",In the Mood for Love
164,samsara761,"A lyrical, poetic, Art-house feature, something all too rare these days.",9,22 July 2010,"This fantastic movie, released in 2000, is Wong Kar-Wai's most successful work to date. Elegant, subtle, beautiful, a poetic tale of suppressed feelings, forced to bow down to peer-pressure. Masterful storytelling, accompanied by a vivid and inspired photography, expressive costumes and poignant acting, contribute to place this movie amongst my modern favourites.The movie is composed by a myriad of small scenes, each one advancing the tale slowly, thus helping the plot to develop subtly, yet keeping the momentum always high, plunging the viewer a step deeper each time. The scenes are interspersed with a large number of slow-mo interludes, accompanied by the perfectly apt main music theme, and the effect they have on the film brings to my mind, by free-associating, a sentence spoken by Chow: ""Feelings can creep up just like that"". In fact, the slow-mo helps the story to advance discreetly but relentlessly; it helps it to creep up on the audience, just like the feelings creep up the on-screen couple (and maybe their respective partners, too). These two even re-enact the betrayal of their partners, and those scenes are rich with emotions and feelings bottled up till then, almost like an exorcism, or a successful psychoanalytic treatment; a chance, for the characters, to come to terms with their sorrowful past, and their present. During this re-enactment, the actors even repeat the scenes they are not happy with, in an emotional trial-and-error process. Their involvement is so deep that many times we are not sure whether what we see is real life or just acting and, so it would seem, neither are they. We notice this, for instance, when they meet for dinner for the first time, she is having a hot dish, he asks ""Like it hot?"", and she says ""Your wife likes hot dishes"".In the Mood for Love is full of symbols, predictions, prophecies, sentences said by each of the main characters, giving subtle clues as to what will actually happen later in the story.

Wong Kar Wai's gorgeous poetic love story captured me throughout and even after the film. I must admit this is one of the best love movies, maybe the best of all, I have ever watched. The content and the form overlaps perfectly. As watching the secret love we see the characters in bounded frames that limits their movements as well as their feelings. Beautiful camera angles and the lighting makes the feelings and the blues even touchable. I want to congratulate Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee for their fantastic cinematography which creates the mood for love. Also the music defines the sadness of the love which plays along the beautiful slow motion frames and shows the characters in despairing moods. And of course the performances of the actors which makes the love so real.

This is a film driven forward less by plot and more by imagery and mood. The cinematography and art direction on display is highly impressive.There are scenes here that remind me of the languid shots of the spinning space station in ""2001"", or the approach to the Tyrrell Corp. headquarters in ""Blade Runner"". Slowly developing vistas, beautifully scored, giving us time to savour the visuals on display. Maggie Cheung in her beautiful dresses slowly ascending a narrow staircase. Tony Leung seated at his desk with cigarette smoke slowly swirling overhead. A chance meeting in the pouring rain in an old Hong Kong back alley. Gorgeous.And as in any sensual feast, the music really helps set the mood. Michael Galasso's haunting violin score is mesmerising. I find myself watching the entire end credits every time just so I can listen to the main themes once more. Even if I've heard them several times already and can't understand a word of the Chinese credits. The occasional Nat King Cole song, in Spanish, helps vary the mood.While the film isn't driven by its plot, that's not to say that the plot is bad. The love story is quite captivating in its restraint and there are plenty of emotions on display. I wouldn't call it a happy film. Neither is it depressing though it is certainly melancholy.

169,mikecalla,"Beautiful, Elegant and Restrained",10,29 January 2005,"I won't bore you with story and plot lines, as they have been presented many times already on this page, so It's been along time coming since I have seen such a film. Beautiful, elegant and restrained, with a narrative pace to match. A film with sensitivity and understated qualities that is rare in these times of clichéd plots. The beautifully subdued photography, saturated in rich luxurious colors, and for lack of better words, each frame is filled with an air of tension. The settings and locations are used repeatedly but the film manages to breath new life into them each time they featured, there always seems to be a key prop, light fixture, or set piece to slightly clue the audience as to where we are in the characters world.The acting reminds me of the ""The Bicycle Thief"", not the style, but the fact that you forget that you are watching two actors engaged in their craft. There is meaning behind every gesture and almost every movement has assigned significance to explain the inside world of the characters, the relationship, the feelings, and situation of the two lovers. The dialogue is sparse but like the rest of the movie, is imbued with meaning. Speaking of meaning, the soundtrack is infectious. Used here it becomes a story telling device. And although the film is of Chinese origins, even a song sung in Spanish by Nat King Cole imparts the film with subtle meaning. The orchestrated soundtrack is repetitive, but the repetition is what makes it comfortable. It is used in conjunction with the story, and not just a means to put music to action, or to cue the audience to feel a certain way at a certain plot point.I would not recommend this film to anybody, I fear most people would be jaded by the calm flow of the story, but I would recommend it to someone who is looking for an alternative to the romantic schlock that fills the multiplexes on our side of the world. I must say that I was completely taken by this film, and continued to watch it night after night.

171,dilip_tuli_20,Reality is a cruel narrator,10,26 May 2020,"Amidst the exiled Shanghainese community in 1962, we experience the cruelties of fate.The story begins when two people have an encounter after they move in next to each other. Their lives intertwine during their daily visit to the noodle shop to escape their overbearing neighbours.What begins as a casual conversation soon becomes a case of curiosity when they find out about their spouses' infidelity. A time when morality is not a subject of debate, but rather a ritual, we find our characters questioning the affair's inception.Loneliness can be a difficult thing and when you find someone who understands, falling in love becomes inevitable rather than a choice.The beauty of the movie is the delicate way in which the director, Kar-Wai Wong, handled the relationship. The growth in their relationship is not so much expressed through words but through visuals and music. The music is an essential part of this movie. It's beautifully composed by Michael Galasso and Shigeru Umebayashi and gives you the somber feel which enhances the experience even further. The cinematography by Christopher Doyle and Mark Lee Ping Bin is absolutely gorgeous.Our leads, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung do a great job in making their emotions and affections believable.A simple scene involving heavy rain and the lady's refusal to take an umbrella offered by her neighbour just because it may stir rumours, gives you a very clear picture of the era they lived in.Maybe if the time was different or maybe for once if the courage of desire could have overcome the fear of morality. Just maybe. Well reality, as we have all experienced, is often a cruel narrator. This story is no different.

173,theoryhead,Lushness and loneliness,9,26 July 2001,"Having seen many of Wong Kar-Wai's other movies (Happy Together, Fallen Angels, Ashes of Time), I knew what to expect coming in to the theatre; the cinematography would be lush, the use of space and perspective would be varied, the acting would be superb, and at least one of the characters would be consumed by an ineffable loneliness. These are, after all, precisely the techniques that make Wong Kar-Wai's art what it is. What I was not expecting was the degree to which I was drawn into a film that some reviewers dismissed as ""unfinished"" and compelled by characters who ""seemed consumed by ennui.""I find it interesting how people can be so utterly unmoved by a film that so vividly displays emotions and settings many of us take for granted or work ardently to forget: the overwhelming sense of grief stemming from being betrayed; the guilt aroused by the thought of becoming no better than the betrayer; the mundane yet profoundly intimate moments of relationships, where the need to express oneself verbally is utterly superfluous. This is what Wong Kar-Wai attempts to portray in the film and what he achieves so well.Too many Americans are consumed by the need to have every moment of a film filled with stock dialogue; witty banter, disaffected sarcasm and overwrought confessions seem to be the pinnacle of the ""best"" American film has to offer. Wong Kar-Wai sees things very differently. Instead of the character needing to keep the audience apprised of her every feeling, perception or belief, Wong's characters make their feelings and understandings known clearly by facial gestures, body positioning, and, yes, silence.If viewers merely contemplate this film from the standpoint of character development and action, then they may be disappointed by what it has to offer. If they are willing to let themselves try and intuit what the characters are feeling, then they may feel quite differently about what Wong has to offer them.",In the Mood for Love
174,gswanson17,In The Mood For Desert?,7,19 April 2007,"Set in front of the conservative backdrop of 1960's Hong Kong, Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for Love tells the intimate tale of two people who, by fate, seem to land themselves in each other's company due to the common bond of the absence of their spouses. The plot of the film, by no means anything original by the year 2000, is however, deeply accentuated by the style in which the film is shot. With unconventional camera angles, an inconsistent musical score, and deep, luscious colors, In the Mood for Love brings a seemingly real perspective to a very personal story.Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Chang (Maggie Cheung) coincidentally, move in to their small neighboring Hong Kong flats on the same day. Mr. Chow, a newspaper editor with an unseen, but presumably traveling, wife, and Mrs. Chang, a secretary, also with an unseen business executive husband. The two often find their paths crossing as they frequent the same streets, restaurants, and noodle shop. It is when they discover that their spouses are having an affair that they begin to see each other. Unlike very fast paced, show-all, American films, the relationship that blossoms between Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chang is not one of immense passion and love, but more of a deeper unsaid understanding. It is the simple gestures such as the conversations, the gazing into one another's eyes, and the holding of hands where the real relationship lies. This could not be clearer when, in a climactic moment of the film, they briefly caress each other's hands in the back of a taxi.The film is accentuated by the unconventional, but highly innovative camera work throughout. Often times the camera remains stationary while the characters move about, and sometimes out of the frame! It's as if to remind the audience that we are looking through a peeping hole rather than through a true television, and that there are things that we will not be able to see. Throughout various portions of the film, like the rice cooker scene, for example, you can hear the characters speaking, but you will actually have to visualize what they are doing. The position at which the camera lies throughout the movie is also noteworthy because of the strange angles it is put at, such as under a bed, over a person's shoulder, through metal grating, and in general, low to the ground. It seems that Wong Kar Wai is telling us ""no, that's too easy. You need to look at this from a more difficult position, as if you were eavesdropping on these very private moments"" The rich colors and costumes of the film play a very large part in how the story is told as well. In the first scene, at the appearance of Mrs. Chan and her very colorful dress, the audience is immediately drawn to her and continues to watch her throughout the rest of the film. From then on each dress, one right after the other, begins to astonish the viewer with its lush colors and interesting patterns. This immediately sets Mrs. Chan apart from any other character, especially Mr. Chow, who dresses in relatively the same attire every day, creating a very physical contrast between two characters who are emotionally similar. Not only does the costuming add emphasis to the film, but the lighting of most of the scenes adds another layer onto they already thick stylized coat of the film. Much of the film takes place on the very foreign and almost enigmatic streets of Hong Kong, usually during the night, and we are provided with not quite enough illumination to see everything perfectly. This adds a heightened level of mystery throughout the entire film, especially in the first half, before the characters really meet. The warm colors, in a sense, add quite a bit to the slow pacing of the film. These are not very cold, vivid, or fast colors, but rather ones that let the scenes take their time, in a place where conversations are not hurried and friendly games with neighbors last into the late hours of the night. The editing also does its part to slow down the movie, making the shifts between days seamless and slowing scenes down into slow motion to literally ""juice"" the magic out of them.However, much, if not all of the aforementioned material is simply technique none of the true bread and butter of movies is covered. This is simply because there hardly was any. Is the plot original? No, not really. Is the script solid? Well, considering there was no actual script to begin with, no. But is the way in which all of these, otherwise boring, elements filmed beautiful and interesting? Absolutely! It seems that the true core of this movie is missing, but who's to say that every movie has to follow a standard formula? This film epitomizes the golden rule in the entertainment industry which is presentation, presentation, presentation, and while this may not be the chocolate cake of film, it certainly is the crème brulée of film, presented magnificently, with a spectacular outer crust covering a much unadorned interior.",In the Mood for Love
175,duelek,The Soft and Gentle Wind from the Orient,8,30 October 2010,"In The Mood For Love was a totally different experience for me. I'm not sure if I even liked it or not. I think both. The characteristic mise-en-scène is very experimental. Wonderful costume, lighting, camera effects, use of music, smoke and rain and the insistent repetition of thematic scenes were very impressive and deserve praise. The contextual setting, the lives of two white-collar workers in the marginal environment of early 1960's Hong Kong flat-sharing community was a really interesting subject. While Mao's infamous Cultural Revolution continues in China, the island evolves into a cosmopolitan outpost of Western civilization, resulting in the amalgamation of Chinese traditions together with ""degenerate"" values of the free market society. The collective mentality and the rigid approach to morality by the Chinese, embedded in the old culture of the country going back to the teachings of Confucius and Lao Tse, are brutally contested in the 20th century by the increasing need of individuality of the people, who don't continue with their older modes of living. Business trips, employment of women (buying food rather than cooking at home or eating together with the neighbours), tolerance to adultery are all novelties introduced by the more complexly urbanized life and the growth of service sector in metropolis. The use of contemporary music from China together with Cuban hits by Nat King Cole was very successful, reflecting this liminality of cultural life. My only dissatisfaction is with the love story itself. During the whole movie the physically distanced couple are portrayed as moral people, since they don't want to betray their respective wife and husband just as they do. They are ""different"". This idea sounds very romantic and sweet but ridiculous. A love can exist without sex of course, but this couple gives us the impression that they only don't have sex, not because they actually want a relationship like that and are satisfied with intimate sharing of thoughts and moments, but as if they are only forcing themselves to refuse it in order to despise the unfaithful couple, which I call ""the invisibles"". This careful invisibility of the ""bad wife"" and ""bad husband"" was reminiscent of the sensitive avoiding of showing Mohammed's face in the classic movie The Message (1976). It is obvious that the characters are not looking for sex but for a partner to share their lives, which they cannot do under the framework of marriage. They are both gentle, emotional and live next to each other, so for the time being they are a perfect couple. But their stance is self-contradictory. If relation without sex is what they want and how they truly satisfy themselves and they continue this in clandestine occasions knowing that it is wrong what they are doing, these people are not really different than ""the invisibles"". This doesn't mean that their relationship is wrong but their concern with morality is groundless and the movie's objective narrative is somehow lauding their apparent honesty and purity.",In the Mood for Love

At the end of the day, what the Tony, or Chow, meant to reach was that some sort of understanding in struggling to see the point where the woman he loved had wrongly reached, such irrationality. On the way in reaching to the point, Chow diverted his way and found himself in reaching to his rationality. Tony, Chow, finds that, in digesting hate/anger, aiming at reaching to the point of irrationality is no use since Tony wants to love, not hate. He wants to love in rationality. But he faced with another why at the time when he thought he found and determined divert from irrationality to ANOTHER rationality. Chow digested his hate and surprisingly cherish remained after his hate in his body. His cherish was crossed-over with love.... near of the love which reminded him/her the love paralyzed him/her before. She, however, just confined herself into the feeling of cherish because of fear.

Why this film received critical acclaim is beyond me.It was painfully dull and I was checking for dirt under my fingernails after about 10 minutes. I really wanted the film to develop into something worth watching, but it never did. It was not exciting, it was not moving and it was not thought-provoking.

186,fireflyhill,Moving minimalism,10,16 November 2000,"Beautifully shot, ""In the Mood for Love"" obsessively circles around two people as they tentatively circle around each other. Brought together by a mutual source of hurt and betrayal, they reach out for something stable, for some shred of affection. Or perhaps their connection is maintained only in an effort to prepare each other for dealing with hurt. Or perhaps their only function is to act as stand-ins for each other so that they can reenact fanciful scenes in which they will lash back at those who have hurt them.
Predominantly set in interior spaces, there is an overriding sense that the world outside is changing. We get the feeling that the outside world might come crashing in on these two characters at any moment.Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are two of the most attractive actors in the world, and together they are...well, unbelievable. Their performances in this film are incredible. The furtive, loaded looks that they share heighten the tension. Nothing is explicit. It is all percolating under the surface. This lends itself to the feeling that the chaos of the world outside is mirrored by the chaos of their own hidden emotions. On the surface everything is calm. They try to keep up appearances. Meanwhile the world outside comes rushing in.",In the Mood for Love

The movie is very beautifully shot, the cinematographer did a good job on this one. I just loved the slow motion montage scenes with a very interesting use of music. The song the director uses for these scenes was just amazing, it really gets to you, the song makes you focused on what is going on with in the scene, when there actually is not much going on. Except for the beautiful motion of the camera and the shot in the frame. The film has a very beautiful Mise-en-scene. ""In the Mood for Love"" is a some what beautiful love story between two charters, and a little touch of comic relief. Though this is not the typical love story, the director has used a different approach to show the story between the two characters. this film is like candy for your eyes and ears. defiantly a must see for film lovers.",In the Mood for Love
188,Soroush_Jozani,about a guilty pleasure,9,12 December 2010,"Kar Wai Wong's film gives us a different view about love and affairs in other cultures. What stroke me about this movie was that even though we don't see much about the couples' relationships, the movie flows very sensual. Although the characters and their words and actions all seem the same throughout the movie,We feel the love between them very present. I loved the production design which gave us clues about each set of character, their relationship and mood by giving elements of color and patterns. Also, the cinematography is very well done, with vast, but useful use of slow motion. The constant fade in and fade outs in this movie makes us feel like we are a nosy neighbor, watching the couple's relationship from behind a door or window. The only down point of this film is that it doesn't introduce its characters very well in the first act.",In the Mood for Love

The aesthetics and acting are also great. The soundtrack is also great. However, I found the relationship between the 2 protagonists to be empty and lacking in character development. We the audience were ""teased"" quite a bit, which may be the antithesis of the usual, impulsive, unbridled Hollywood passion that we are used to, and to make it even more achingly poignant their love finds no ultimate expression in the end. I also felt that the pacing was a mess. Very, very slow, and suddenly we jump years ahead several times. This alienated me as a viewer. Overall I felt that the movie tries too hard to be poetic and comes off as pretentious instead. A few drawn out camera shots do NOT a great movie make- even when those shots can be interpreted as deeply symbolic and/or stand-alone beautiful. And just putting a scene into slow motion doesn't make it great either. That's like putting the pedal down when you play piano just to make it sound ethereal when the same notes by themselves might not be as ""dramatic"". In other words, it shouldn't be necessary to do slo-mo all the time just to get your point across. 6/10 from me.",In the Mood for Love

191,mllora3,ITMFL inhabits that liminal space of promise!,10,26 December 2005,"This is perhaps the sexiest movie ever made - ironically, there is no nudity. Kudos all around to Wong Kar-Wai for delivering this movie classic; wondering why he reversed himself by releasing 2046, which is the exact opposite. Wong Kar-Wai sends us on a tailspin by using the camera to do his work for him instead of using lurid exploitation scenes.Yearning and possibility is one of the great emotions of the human experience. Perhaps I was seduced by the very thing that has driven poets to write sonnets, artists to create great works of art, and musicians to wrench our comfort. It is a feeling that almost everyone who has not been, should be touched by, either through unrequited love or the deep pain of strong emotions that can not be fully expressed - by word or otherwise. Hong Kong movie maker Wong Kar-Wai, whose resume includes such great features as Chungking Express and Happy Together, has a deep understanding and pathos turning this insight into the mise-en-scene of longing and an unexplainable sexiness that does not just come from the panning of Maggie Cheung but the tension set forth by not being able to just do what one feels like doing. In this feature (as opposed to 2046), Wong Kar-Wai brings to presence a transcendence that cannot be copied by any other film. In the Mood for Love is a classic as he brings to presence that deep sense of longing so missed in current offerings.The plot is uncomplicated. War Kar-Wai is pure genius as he takes the time to detail the scenes as the whole movie takes place in 1962 Hong Kong, were Tony Leung (Chow) bumps into Maggie Cheung (Li-Zhen) where by some twist of fate end up next-door neighbors in an apartment building. I don't believe that it is just an excuse to place two good looking people together but rather it is a modality to set up the scene to explore veiled emotions and cloaked feelings. They are two struggling characters - he a journalist; she a secretary. The two develop a close friendship, and the link between them develops into something deeper and more lasting than a casual affair. Limited by cultural oppression and feelings of profound guilt, and this is where I feel the film is sexiest, they never act upon those physical impulse. Mind you, don't get me wrong, I am not an advocate for love going unrequited but the scene of self-denial and the closeness as well as the tension lends itself to such a reaction. Both Chow and Li-Zhen remain true to their marriage promise despite the cost to themselves.Irony all around - despite the fact they are not doing anything wrong, they both engage in stolen whispers, longing looks, and clandestine meetings. Craving smothered by decorum. Wong Kar-Wai's absorbing, mysterious In the Mood for Love is a power play in desire and denial. It is the sexiness of the tension that is played out only in the mind and not in the flesh. The film inhabits that liminal space of promise - which is why I was so taken by it. It is artistic because we are left to imagine what is possible and what is not, see why things that are suppressed and why they should not be. Not to mention that Wong Kar-Wai weaves an erotic web around two of Hong Kong's most exciting stars, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, then lets us the audiences write or imagine our own story. Bravo to Wong Kar-Wai and the Criterion Collection for making this possible.Miguel Llora",In the Mood for Love

I can only feel sorry for those people, that they cannot see the ultimate beauty of this film and the tenderness of the love story.

193,filmfox,"Pretentious, deliberately opaque and terminally dull",3,17 February 2001,"I approached ""In the Mood for Love"" with great anticipation; after all, the film had received glowing reviews in the major print media and garnered some notable awards. Much to my surprise, I found the film to be extraordinarily self-referential, with tricky camera angles and shots, time-lapsed and out-of-phase location jumps and irritating tics, not the least of which was Maggie Cheung's unending stream of the single dress in multiple fabrics contrasted to Tony Leung's wardrobe of blue silk suits. This monotonal, if not monochromatic approach was reflected in the non-romantic romance, most frequently depicted by two actors staring meaningfully(?), longingly(?), achingly(?), lustfully(?) into the middle distance. And the overweening pretension was sublimely manifest in the scenes at Angkor Wat -- of no relevance whatever to the confines of the bleak and grimy Hong Kong depicted in 2/3's of the film. What a bore!",In the Mood for Love
194,clara007,In the mood for a great love story,8,3 August 2009,"As its title mentions, In the Mood for Love (fa yeung nin wa) is a love story. Set in the 60s in Hong Kong, it tells the story of a man and a woman, both who move into two apartments on the same floor of a building. Wong Kar Wai shows us how, as time passes (keep an eye on Mrs Chan's dresses), these characters encounter heartbreak (his wife cheats on him with Chan's husband) and love (they fall for each other) and heartbreak again.When they find out about their partners' infidelity, Mr Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs Chan (Maggie Cheung) vow ""not be like them"" (their spouses), a task that at the beginning seemed so easy, but as the time they spend together increases, the more they find themselves trying to repress their feelings for each other and keep their relationship on a platonic level. It isn't your typical romantic movie, where the characters meet, 15 minutes later they're in bed and in the end, after several break ups and make-ups, they end up together. There are several ways the audience discovers the mutual attraction between these two flawed characters: First, by way of the beautiful and haunting score by Michael Galasso that accompanies Kar Wai's slow-mo and continuous shots of the characters glancing at each other or walking by, and even more when Nat King Cole sings ""quizás, quizás, quizás"", we are aware of the characters' emotions, longing for each other while trying to suppress those feelings. Secondly, although they hardly touch each other, Wong Kar Wai makes sure we see it, by doing close ups of the action, paying attention to every single detail, no matter how small, that could mean a lot to the story (first time Chow grabs her hand in the cab, she takes it away, but the second time around, she doesn't). It is a slow moving film, but the beautiful cinematography and direction mixed with great music and acting makes this a film that shows that not all great love stories end with a happily ever after.",In the Mood for Love
195,jeremy-giroux,"Incredibly splendid film about melancholy, sadness and love...",10,22 October 2006,"The first thing you can say about this film is that it's absolutely splendid. Though ""splendid"" is a powerful word, it fits perfectly this incredible movie about a love affair between the husband of an always-gone wife, and the wife of an always-gone man. It's about how love born from boredom, from loneliness and in fact, it's all about the beauty of woman (and I can tell you that Maggie Cheung represents that perfectly...) and the tragic of human love. When you see the character played by Maggie Cheung, you can only think about François Truffaut and his way to describe a woman's walk ""The legs of women are like compass which draw the surface of Earth"" because everything in the film is made to show the splendid aspect of life and to make everything beautiful. It would be a vain exercise if it wasn't to show splendid feelings and the beautiful birth and death of a magnificent love affair. The work on image is really great as the music. It all creates the universe of Wong Kar Wai, probably one of the best Asian director.Though a lot of people say ""2046"" is better, I really prefer this movie because it's focused on only one relationship and time takes his part in the fascination you can feel for this film.The only word you can use for this film is probably ""grace"", you know, this kind of feeling which make you think that life is more beautiful, more interesting, more intense... like in one of Mrs Bovary's dream...",In the Mood for Love

I found this interesting since it was what helped the viewer's keep track of time throughout the film. On another note, I also found Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan's decision to not be like their spouses a great ironic choice in the plot because no single individual wants to walk down the path of those who have made mistakes before them. However, that also makes the ending of the film brilliant because even though Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan fall for one another, they choose not to be together in the end, separating them somewhat from the unfortunate affair of their spouses.",In the Mood for Love

May I begin by saying that the cinematography, design, wardrobe, and music really brought the award winning heat out of this movie. In the midst of all it's creative beauty captured behind and in front of the lense..you have an amazingly well written story of true love. Two couples fall in love out of a result of suspicions which would seem very common if it wasn't for the huge twist Wong Kar-wai wrote in. He is the amazing writer and director behind this masterpiece...hands down one of the greatest I've been introduced to yet (I may be bias...because I'm a true romance freak). This movie drove my emotions from one level to another...I wanted soo much at times. When Chow whispered into the hole..I was breathless. From So and Chow's magical encounter, true love in it's symbolism and true form was understood.

I was able to essentially relate to some of the characters in the movie, as I have experienced such things in my own life. The use of vibrant music, to illuminate the dark romance between the couple that knew what was going on, but did not make it apparent until later in the film. The continuous growth of the characters, being not only heart-broken, but also love struck ads to the romance. The choice of multiple colored dresses that were worn allowed the viewer to better determine which day certain things were occurring on. This was helpful because at times it became rather difficult to follow what was going on, and on what day it was occurring.

Even when they both try not to fall for each other they get attach to one another without realizing it. I think that this is a true love story. At the end, they do not really say good-bye to each other. Perhaps because they will always have each other in their mind. They conserve the love that they both feel towards each other.Not only is this a great film but it also contains such great music.

They are so close together but yet do not see what is passing them by. When ""Aquellos Ojos Verdes"" plays while the two are together reenacting what their spouses do or did when they were together, I felt sad because the two were together but not, they were all each other had and yet still alone. The line ""We won't be like them"" is fantastic. It opens my eyes to realize not everything is so black and white, love is not easy and you can't always be with the one you love.

203,mgbecket,Honest As The Movie Title,9,3 August 2009,"Honest as the movie title, In The Mood For love allows your unbridled emotions to fill in the blanks, carefully placed by Kar-Wai. Though this film really touched me, it also allowed me to have a pair of fresh eyes regarding the hardships of modern day love. It squeezed dry the drama of typical love stories, allowing the author to play out a truthful love story of two married neighbors. Both of their spouses are so often away on travel or business, and find themselves lonely, passing one another in the hall or in the streets. The sexual tension is incredible, you aren't sure which part of yourself you want to give into. My favorite parts in the film are these moments of yearning the characters experience, as an orchestration plays. Normally a sick romantic song that makes your heart skip a beat. These are the blanks I spoke of, where you let your unconscious fill in the rest. I really adored this film and know I'll be seeing soon to come.",In the Mood for Love
204,jnine31,great Asian auteurs,10,3 August 2009,"YAY! for amazing Chinese directing. Wong Kar Wai is a true gem of a director. This movie knocked me off my seat. His style, is trade marked by the slow mode long shot. Every little detail is noticed and taken in by the audience. How a characters fingers linger on a door frame, the delicate smoke billowing above another character. All your five senses seem to take play in this movie, you feel like the story is literally unfolding before your very eyes. I felt like I was in Hong Kong, not a classroom watching this film. It was amazing!!! Truly authentic, the characters and their dispositions and social customs to the T are followed by Wong Kar Wai. Mrs. Chans' costumes, are absolutely amazing. The audience is left wondering if it is fate that brought Chow and Mrs. Chan together? or if it was planned by their spouses? It was a little hard to follow, at first I thought when a scene occurred twice it was ""his"" and ""her"" point of view playing out, until I was told it was time that was suppose to be followed through their wardrobe changes. But the emphasis on detail is astounding. Wong Kar Wai masters the close-up profile, hardly seen in movies. He meticulously gets Chow's face on screen telling the audience so much of what is going on inside of him, yet how much is left a mystery because its only half of his face that is shown to us. I have fallen in love with the story, and feel like I am part of it. The heart break that they experience is breath taking. Even the small suspension of disbelief that occurs when Wong Kar Wai does a montage of what is going on in Cambodia, and with china and the general is amazing. The ending is just as beautiful as the entire story itself, of Chow whispering his secret into a wall of the most sacred temple in Cambodia. It is definitely a movie that needs to be watched more then once so that you can really take everything in. Watching the movie only once, does not do justice to the film maker!",In the Mood for Love
205,decembernaghi,A Romantic and Meaningful Work of Art,9,8 August 2009,"My first reaction to Wong Kar Wai's ""In the mood for love"" was purely emotional. As the credits rolled by on the screen, my mind raced to make sense of the roller-coaster of desire, frustration, and aesthetic awe my body was going through. At times, I would find myself smiling, and at times, I would find myself almost overwhelmed by tears. I know all this might sound cheesy, but this film truly affected me on all levels. With almost no exception, all the factors that make a movie great were not only present here, but crafted to perfection. Although the English translation was definitely pretty horrible, and it sometimes became slightly hard to follow what exactly was going on plot-wise, I was never lost because Kar Wai's expert use of music and cinematography created a magical atmosphere that communicated everything I needed to know. The surprising, yet effective use of the Spanish songs gave a teasing romantic feel to the connection between Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow, the two main characters. The other musical theme of the film, an exquisite instrumental piece, has character and meaning of its own, giving the tension between Chan and Chow even more power. I don't usually go out and buy movie soundtracks, but I'll definitely be getting this one. As for the camera placement and cinematography, I loved how every object had a meaning. Every shot had a purpose. Of course, that meant that I had to pay close attention to the little things, but that wasn't very hard to do! The love story isn't a conventional one, that's for sure. Watching ""In the mood for love"" was like looking at a wonderfully complex work of art. You could stare at it forever and always find some new and exciting symbol in its design. You could come back and look at it time and time again and get something different from it. Maybe it'll make you happy, or sad, or angry, or even confused, but it will always make you think and feel, and hey, that's what a movie is supposed to do.",In the Mood for Love

A and B then fall in love and wonder (at great length) whether to have an affair themselves).This is Cantonese Visconti. Story there is none, but what you DO get is a succession of wonderful images and poignantly trivial music which convey the slow passage of the central characters' emotions. There is also the chance to see one of the world's most beautiful women in a succession of stunningly elegant outfits. For my money, it's worth seeing for that alone.

As simple as the story goes, many English speaking viewers didn't get the whole story. Three old ladies next to me keep yapping and have no clues about the movie.Spoiler; They were surprise when I mention that Mr. Chow did sleep with Mrs Chen and they have a son. She went to Singapore trying to tell him but didn't.SpoilerThe mandarin translation of the movie title actually means flowery like moment or memory. The phrase usually used to describe beautiful and wonderful memory that was inpermanance and short. The whole movie pretty much fit the title. Not to mention the flowery ""Cheung Sam"".
My favorite scene was definately the street corner in the alley. It looks so beautiful, the sun shining on the old and faded wall, at night in the dark, in the rain,  truely a poetic moment. I felt a strong sense of intimacy of their relationship seeing them standing against the wall and talk quietly. I felt a terrible heartache when Mr Chow was rehearsing his departing moment, and Mrs Chen cried on his shoulder.... Bravo Wong Kar-Wai!As much as I like this one, Chungking Express still top my favorite. However, I'll give this one a 10 as well.

It was rather dry and very slow paced. I'm not too much into these types and I wonder if the whole point of the film could have been done in about 15 minutes and got the point across better. The acting was solid and done fairly well, nothing that really stands out. Actually it's quite hard to concentrate on the acting and expressions when your reading subtitles the whole film.

212,jonnajureen,In the Mood for Love,10,3 August 2009,"In the Mood for Love, is a story about two people that by an unusual incident finds an unexpected passion, and takes the chance to experience love, maybe for the first time in their life. They two are brought together by rather special circumstances, moving in to the same apartment house where they spend most of their time alone, waiting and dreaming about love. Without knowing exactly how it all started, but at the same time sensing that something is out of balance, they finds out that their spouses are having an affair with each other. While this is going on Mrs. Cheng and Mr. Chow tries to understand the situation and spend more and more time with each other. The movie has many long takes and slow motion pictures. Every scene of the movie is very stylized. In one scene the picture is covered with flowers; the lamp, the glass, the dress, the curtains, the earrings and even the outside on which Mrs. Chan is staring out in! This is a very beautiful scene, hard to miss and very hard to forget. The movements are often very precise accompanied with music and with slow motion scenes. Looking at this movie, one is stuck immediately with the contrasts of yarning and loving, the ambiguity, and the complexity of love itself. One may have expected that the two that meet would develop a very revengeful affair with each other knowing that their respective spouses are having an affair with each other. So is not the case. Instead, they develop an honest and very true friendship that has nothing to do with giving back, neither one obliges a role of victims. What's also is interesting is that their spouses faces are not shown one single time in the movie, something that enhances the fact that their relationship is not based on being a fatal accident. There is a lot of attention paid to small details in this movie, for example are there subtitles that pass in front of our eyes. These have no largely significance for the movies narration; rather they fulfill a premise in the movie that also is stated in a key scene saying: ""If you pay attention – you really see things"".

213,marcelloltg,Wait. You mean real love isn't always happily ever after?,8,3 August 2009,"Perhaps the only thing I could say bad about this film is that the subtitles were frustratingly awful. Of course, the film is stunningly gorgeous visually and musically. Wong Kar Wai is a really amazing director and his vision came across wonderfully. The style of this film is what makes it stand out, but what I loved was the story. I've been taking a History of International Film class which has made me even more painfully aware of how cliché and misleading American films can be. We grow up watching so many cliché movies about true love where we've come to EXPECT perfect ""happily ever after"" endings; it's no wonder the United States has such a high divorce rate and an overwhelming majority is deeply dissatisfied with their love lives. In ""In the Mood for Love,"" when Mr. Chow(Tony Leung) whispers his secret in the hole in the wall, it is such a heartbreakingly beautiful way to end the film. I recently saw ""500 Days of Summer"" in the theater, and although I loved the movie, I was disappointed that even in an American movie that is the anti-""happily ever after"" love story, they still couldn't resist clichés and the need to tie everything up in a nice little bow at the end. In real life, there are a million moments where something as simple as not taking a person's hand at the right moment can be the deciding factor on whether a relationship goes forward or not. The beautiful ambiguity of Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan's relationship in ""In the Mood for Love"" has lingered with me long after the film ended and the lights went up; just a wonderfully true and heart-breaking film.",In the Mood for Love

Wong-Kar-Wai is indeed an auteur as he has successfully developed his own sense of cinema.In the mood of love is perfect in its every department.Wong-Kar-Wai have scripted it very distinctively, in a way that the film completely focused on the inner self of the character and at the same time there exterior were depicted on the conscious level. The film takes you on a ride which amazingly portraits conscious as well as subconscious level of its character.Cinematography supports the mood of the film; every frame is lit in a way that it brilliantly captures each and every emotions of character.Actors were not at all acting; they were real in a way that they have become immortal in my subconscious.In the mood of love is not a story; it is a poetry with its rhymes and rhythm which is adapted on screen. The film seduces you with its music, slow motion camera movement and character ridden camera angles. It seduces you emotionally as well as sexually. It is a film which plays on a sub-conscious level of the viewer. Only a person who is completely possessed by love (or at least by lust) would have made this, and Wong- Kar-Wai has achieved an incredible cinematic height with this film.My overall experience of the movie was like a dream and I am sure that it will haunt me at least till my next watch.",In the Mood for Love

I noticed that the music was on the same pace on some parts of the movie which gave it a romantic and relaxed feel to it. Though the situation of the characters were not really relaxing. Also I noticed how the filmmaker uses the medium by compressing almost every scene. The hallway in the complex seems compressed as well as the bedroom, the staircase/stairway, and the office. The filmmaker doe not use wide angles for this film. It makes me wonder if there is a reason why he does this? I mean I have never been to Hong Kong, but does he want us to feel how it was in Hong Kong in the 1960's, crowded? This was a beautiful love story without all the sex scenes that usually Hollywood movies have to add and it just makes the movie tacky sometimes. This film did not need that because you just felt the romance. Neither do all love stories have to end in a happy ending because that is not reality.",In the Mood for Love

Once you heard ""Yumeji's Theme"" it never leaves you after the film ends. A unique experience for romantic theme. The noodles scene, the smoking scene, the camera works made me fall in love with this art house cinema by WKW. There's no sex scene and there's no dramatic scene but we can feel the love in this film. The film itself nothing more than a tragedy and ironic even though sometimes there was funny scene between Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung characters.

The cinematography is good, and I've grown quite fond of the main actor, but I thought the story dragged. There wasn't enough going on in the movie for my liking. However the very different style of movie was enough to keep me hooked, I especially like the single light source scenes and the repetition of the songs in the movie, both very anti-Hollywood. All the scenes and the music is well thought out, and the characters are rather enjoyable. I found myself hoping throughout the movie that they would end up together in the end; probably exactly what the director wanted, so I suppose it was pretty immersive. I'd highly recommend this movie just so you can understand what's going on in 2046.",In the Mood for Love

There are tons of reviews highlighting positives and I agree with some of them.The screenplay is just too slow paced and subtle for a 99 min movie I felt every minute of it. I have seen Irishman and other longer movies it didn't feel this slow to me.In the first 20-30 min of the movie we get to know the main plot point and then most of the movie is just them glancing and pondering over either looking at each other or objects lying nearby.The idea is to not show what the leads are feeling but it was too too subtle and hidden to the point it looked unnatural in certain moments that characters with such deep attraction would remain perfectly neutral and not even by mistake make a gesture or expression that shows their inside.The side characters are also nothing special, nothing memorable about them or the side actors performances.Overall it's a good movie but I don't think it belongs in such high rating ,with all due respect.I might change my rating later if I view it again.",In the Mood for Love

223,m_para_dis,A Beautiful Buildup that Leaves You Less Than Satisfied...,7,11 December 2010,"Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood for Love is hauntingly beautiful, but hallow, like a beautiful woman without substance. The film's ending leaves you feeling empty and a little sad, not to mention left longing for something that you can't quite understand. In the Mood for Love is all foreplay and no climax. I say this with no judgment, with no negative connotations involved. It's not good or bad, right or wrong, black or white; it simply is.In the Mood for Love is stylistically stunning. There are moments where the screen is bursting with such palpable emotion and such immense beauty. It's an unbelievable accomplishment and a testament to the power of the film language and the potential of a great director. The images of Maggie Cheung framed in shadows, slowly moving down the stairs, with Michael Galasso's moody yet impossibly romantic tracks suffusing the moment, are unforgettable.The Chinese title of In the Mood for Love is Fa yeung nin wa which is translated into ""the age of blossoms"" or ""the flowery years."" The expression is a Chinese metaphor for the fleeting period of youth, beauty and love. And that is exactly what the director manages to convey. The film leaves you feeling wistful and yearning for another era, a more elegant, more graceful time.As stirring and moving as the film is and as much as I like desire and foreplay, I can't help but admit that I personally prefer to end with a good climax.",In the Mood for Love

225,Polifemo,Nearly achieves cinematic perfection.,10,5 November 2002,"Kar-Wai Wong's In the Mood for Love is an intensely romantic, if elegiac chamber piece that reaches inside the souls of its main characters, and gives us a glimpse of what might be. The relationship between Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) and Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leong) evolves with such quiet restraint, that we expectantly await its ultimate conflagration, hoping they will leave their cheating spouses and cave in to their passion. We want them to run away together and set the screen on fire. Instead, they remain sexually shy, but intimate friends, who continue to address one another formally, as though they are afraid of turning into their wayward spouses. With the passage of time and the intervention of circumstances, they gradually drift apart, although their love never dies. Christopher Doyle and Mark Lee Ping-bin's striking cinematography perfectly captures Hong Kong in the 60s, and Wong's skillful use of music hypnotizes us. The editing by William Chang is exceptional, as are his contributions as set and costume designer. The film is about true love, though ultimately, it remains unrequited. When the film is over, its compassion resonates inside us. In the Mood for Love very nearly achieves cinematic perfection.",In the Mood for Love

Like ""Inception"", which is directed by Christopher Nolan, some films really need analyze. However, some film, we don't need to analyze because we just feel the mood of film and it is enough to enjoy. ""In the mood for love"" is definitely this style. We cannot get exact situation both male and female's love process, but we can get their emotion of love. Although there is no making love scene or kiss scene, we can feel how they love each other just showing catching hand or leaning to shoulder. But, an important thing is that we don't have to try to know these details. When just flow in our feeling with ""In the mood for love"", we can recognize what love is. Also, they restrain express their emotions to make that we can recognize they really love each other. If we can see their expression for love, we cannot feel their emotions when they separate. Something is not complete make to regret and expectation. However, they really love each other and we feel this emotion.

There is a shot in which we see the room number 2046, foreshadowing one of Wong Kar-Wai's future films. The story itself is inventive and imaginative. It is not often we see a love story between two dejected spouses that are involved, having an affair themselves, or rather, for much of the film attempting to resist inevitable. The acting in all its subtlety is superb. I found myself being transported to another world, one of longing and desire that I did not want to end.

Woman( Mrs. Chan ) gradually change her mind because of her husband is always not close to her, and she find him ( Chow ) who also feel sadness because of his wife is always far from him. the interesting point of this movie is that this movie doesn't show Mrs. Chan's husband and Chow's wife. this movie always represent the movement of Mrs. Chan and Chow' heart which is changing often. I think that's why people who watch this movie can not stop watching. some movie sometimes make a lot of story in one movie and pack all story in one movie forcibly.

At times scenes seemed to be moving rather slow, and seemed to have no end. the main characters seemed to be into each other, but over all this movie showed many ups and downs.

This is the beauty of this movie, and is also the reflection of the culture of modesty. The mood creates everything. There is no unnecessary dialogs. People form West may feel frustration because what you see in this movie are mostly abstract images. The movie makes you feel what the movie is trying to say. The shots of Mrs. Chan going up the stairs are sensual pictures I ever seen. How she walks and dresses Chinese tight dresses, the ennui-but-exciting mood, and the music create the image of pure eroticism. I think the shots imply how Mr. Chow sees Mrs, Chan. Wong Kar-Wai's creation is much sensual and erotic than an actual sexual activity in a Hollywood movie. The point is the shots give us also beauty, but not only sexuality. You barely see their happy faces. The mood of the movies overall is even sad. Moreover, the storyline faithfully reflects real life. They know that they are not supposed to be together. Mrs, Chan tries to reject Mr. Chan, but she can't. The forbidden relationship makes them even more be enthusiastic.

However, I thought that it was kind of obvious that they both had mates who traveled aboard most of the time and of course their relationship were going to grow closer where they were going to experience extra-marital affairs.

It was very beautifully made and of course I could see that love grew between Mrs Chan and Mr Chow Mo-Wan. This may only be my interpretation but I felt like Mrs Chan was clinging on to her husband and still loves him so her seeing Mr Wan was just an act of loneliness and if she had the choice, she would rather have had a happy marriage with her husband. It was sad to see her dressing up every night to go out by herself and you could tell that she was miserable. They both tried really hard to keep the facade of their supposedly happy marriages. I thought it was very interesting how Kar Wai Won chose to show their spouses, you never see them in the movie and that really illustrates that they are never there for them. Maybe I have a little bit to modern perspective because I found myself to be very annoyed through the movie that they did not just get a divorce. I really liked the fact that they did not actually cheat on their spouses, it was interesting to see a love story without all the physical part of love. It is very unusual and the director has to work on making the audience believe the love without that and I think he really made their love believable even though it was complicated and filled with mixed emotions.",In the Mood for Love

Later on I search this movie on IMDb and read few comments and then after a month or so had a chance to watched it again. This is my first Kar Wai Wong's movie I didn't know that much about the guy expect the first Chinese director to win Best Director Award at Cannes 97. The movie is very plain yet very thorny and it's hard to realize the overall conception. Though we all agree that it's a romantic movie but a very simple and imperceptible romance. A man and women living next to each other's apartment, both committed and yet very much involved into each other's life through the life of there spouses, discussing them even pretending them and even making some moves. The credit must be given to the director that he showed some complex human expression of both Tony and Maggie in a very simple way, the idea of pretending each other spouses, Maggie spending the night at Tony's apartment and few other sequences at the end were captured brilliantly. The overall pace of that movie was quite slow infect the only fast paced thing in that movie was the rain. After watching this film I truly believe that love is not a hard-wearing, radical kind of a thing, every one loves some one in their daily life routines and that magical moment when a person falls in love with some one must have to be a normal passing moment of his/her time. The romance in this film is between two individuals which is very simple, normal yet very much inspiring. Even though the film wasn't end on a happy node but both of the characters were satisfied because they seems to be valuing life more because with out this life they wouldn't be in love, and its this life on the basis of which they will be able to cherish their love.

The beginning of the film starts with a two different people moving into an apartment. This is scene that most people get lost in and then can't understand the movie. The theme of the film is about a two people who find out that there spouses are cheating on them with the other spouse. This is where the film took a unique path from the other Hollywood films, it follows the journey of them falling in love. The film is not about cheating, it is about the struggle and the tension created by Chow and So can be felt. The film is not about a sexual affair, but it is about an emotional affair. The story has a perfect ending for this film. The film is not like the rest of the other Love Film genre. The best thing about the film is the way it was filmed. The movie is ALL about tone. The tone is created by the songs and by the color of the scene. The music compliments the scene so perfectly, that the songs could have been a character in the film. The slow motion is overly used in many other films, but it is used perfectly in this film. The color of the scene and dresses is used to show the emotion that the two characters cannot show to each other. This film is an example about how film about romance can be shown without sex. This is a perfect example of why film making is an art work. The film sets a great tone, that the song ""Yumeji's Theme"" haunts me at night.",In the Mood for Love
248,Jakah,My take on this film,7,13 September 2006,"For me, this film was Kar Wai Wong''s redeeming grace. I believe a great deal of my attraction to this film is that it was a bit more of a period piece than ''2046'' or ''Chung King Express'' and it also happened to be one of my favorite periods of time. I really, really dig on the 40s and 50s and this film hit that period on the head. For a change, the typical theme song that Wong uses in his films happened to be one that I really, really wanted to hear over and over again simply because I dig on Nat King Cole a great deal. In addition to this wonderful choice for a theme song the script was excellent. I really liked how the two main characters were portrayed as always so proper and polite towards one another as well as to their landlords, bosses, coworkers, heck everyone! Yet, within their personal relationship there was a great deal of sexual/emotional tension running just under the surface of the vengeful and necessary affair. It seemed to me that for both Mr. Chow and Mrs. Su their own affair was definitely something that both needed to maintain a sense of sanity through the difficulties that I would imagine come with broken marriage. Oddly enough, the fact that they abstained from actually having sex together through the film aided in keeping the relationship smooth, steady and just taut enough to keep it going. I enjoyed the cinematography a great deal in this film as well, but I do feel that it wasn't quite as strong as Wong was able to use in ''2046.'' The colors, however, specifically used within ''In the Mood for Love'' were indeed I think a little richer and deeper than ''2046.'' My one complaint with this Wong picture was that the ending was once again dragged on for too long. It was something that I think would have been more impactive had the last 20-30 minutes not been included. At least, Kar Wai Wong is, if nothing, consistent.",In the Mood for Love
249,scarylion,Wow. Mind-blowing.,9,27 February 2002,"WHAT AN AWESOME FILM!!!!!!!! I came out of the theatre feeling stunned. The film that I had just seen was one of the best films I have seen in my life. I had my eyes glued to the screen. It's very symbolic, visually lush, beautifully shot, and gorgeously told. It's basically about two people who move into a flat and live next door to each other with there partners, who are assumed to be having an affair with each others partners. Assuming this, our two heroes act out what they think their partners are getting upto. There is an obvious repression of feelings for each other, with the use of vouryistic camera work, body language, and symbollic stairways. It's a visual feast, and hard not to like. Some of the story gets slightly confusing but that's nothing. The ending is one of the most beautiful (and anti-hollywood) endings I have ever seen in my life, and visually amazing. The films haunting score adds to the mood. I highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind, and respect. What a superb film.",In the Mood for Love
250,SomeOtherUser,"Pretty visuals, confusing content, great acting.",8,14 February 2009,"This film, one of the most interestingly confusing films I have seen, feels like a group of intermingled fuzzy memories from a number of years. The plot is rather thin, but the visual beauty and interesting time line make up for that tenfold. The two main characters are each married, and around the beginning of the film realize that their spouses are having an affair. The two then decide to embark on a path leading definitely to friendship, and quite possibly to a physical relationship. Most of the plot concerns the two attempting to not ""be like them"", as to say they will not betray their oaths of marriage as their spouses had. They go on like this for a number of years until finally parting ways because the strain of the relationship had become to much for either to bare. The film is mostly about restraint, a seemingly big part of the culture in the far east, and how such restraint can affect relationships with family, friends, community, etc... As said earlier, the plot is rather thin, but the visuals, and interesting concept make up for it with out so much as causing a sweat. One of the most interesting parts of the film is the fact that the time line can be traced by costume changes, instead of easily discerned events in time. The acting here is top notch, filled with unrequited desires, and the already mentioned and re- mentioned restraint. Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu Wai do an amazing job as the ""couple"" brought together by their respective marriages falling apart. The supporting cast also does a great job making up a cast of characters that we can all relate to, the mooch friend, the gossiping neighbors, etc... The English translation on the DVD I watched was kind of well... bad. BUT the film itself makes up for that, while even though I do not understand the language of the film, I could relate to the characters through their physicality and universal language of emotion. I, while not a lover of Asian cinema, thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I would suggest to see it, if just to see an interesting take on relationships, love, and memories.",In the Mood for Love

The movie is very emotionally stunning and has fantastic cinematography. Emotionally, it affects a string in the heart as the audience craves that the main characters release their restraints for one another. Cinematography wise, the lighting and framing was so enchanting, I felt like I was in the movie as an extra.The movie, directed by Wong Kar Wai, has a strong sense of eroticism and plays a high note of emotions throughout the film. The subtitles were a bit stagnate at times, but it shouldn't discourage the audience from experiencing the simple awe in the each of the scenes. Maggie Cheung, who plays the main female role, delivers an unforgettable performance of lust and restraint. The movie is about two characters who meet by fate caused by their spouses. Their fate leads to a 'forbidden' romance and their difficult restraint on each others relationship. This is definitely a movie I would recommend to anyone who has felt the troubles of love.",In the Mood for Love
252,raymond-padua,Sound Editing and Style Makes the Film,8,16 February 2009,"Wong Kar-Wai tells his story entitled, ""In the Mood for Love,"" through a film with a pair of spouses who find comfortable companionship with one another, after discovering that each of their significant others are cheating on them. The director uses a formalistic approach to the realistic scenario, as he uses emotional cuts in his editing process to accentuate the romantic story line. This is evident throughout the film, but one scene sticks in my mind - the two are separated from each other. On the set, they're most likely within personal proxemics from one another, but when filmed seem to be a world apart. This is due to the way in which the camera films the wall separating Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan - the thickness of the wall is shot at an extreme close-up for a few seconds making it seem as if it were 2 feet wide, giving us (the audience) the sense of the extreme distance between them.Additionally, Wong Kar-Wai uses a total of two major song pieces in his sound editing which also accentuates the feels and the storyline of the film. He uses a Latin song sung by Nat King Cole as well as a violin instrumental played by an unnamed composer. I feel that because of these two composed pieces serving as the main songs of the film, that it helps us sympathize with My. Chow and Mrs. Chan. We get a sense of the sorrow, time & distance felt when the violinist instrumentals are playing; the movie also seems to slow down through the editing of tonal cuts when they're apart. On the other side of the coin, we feel the magic in their companionship when Nat King Cole sings his heart out on the Latin music piece.",In the Mood for Love
253,MagnumUnanimous,Great work of art,5,16 February 2009,"In the mood for love is a fun movie about relationships, being cheated on, and falling for someone else, but there is a twist. The story analyzes the way people interact with each other through sexual tension. The movie is quite frustrating to some people because it never finalizes a main point. Although shot with beautiful music, coupled with great sound editing, which displays wonderful, out of reality experiences. The production design most notable achievement is the exquisite dresses Mrs. Chan (played by: Maggie Cheung) wear's throughout the film. The high turtleneck pieces give the film a feeling of entrapment. Plus the sets are based in small rooms and allies, which gives the whole movie a sense of additional confinement.The acting is a seamless dance between the two protagonist that conveys strong longing and attraction, but self-restraint. The metaphorical scenes of eating dinner are done with superb camera pans, which give a strong understanding of emotion to each character in a different way. The cinematography displayed great insight to each character through beautifully crafted manipulation of camera movements. The message is not clear, and the editing clearly shows a multitude of jump cuts during one particular scene that will confuse the audience tremendously. This is obviously intentional and effective in displaying the whole concept of the movie. The feeling conveyed through sharp, erratic, and confusing editing gives the emotional and twisted relationship a sense of understanding and visibility.",In the Mood for Love
254,zookini-1,In the Mood for Love,7,15 February 2009,"The film ""In the Mood for Love"", directed by Wong Kar-Wai is not your average romantic love story. Through his genuinely creative directional talent, Kar-Wai brings a whole new meaning to the essence of relationships. Keeping in mind that Kar-Wai is trying to portray the manipulative role the brain plays in the process of creating memories, it is no surprise that at times, the viewer will find his or herself in a state of déjà-vu. To the inattentive eye, the film may seem repetitive due to the lack in change of setting, but more importantly, it is the change in time that keeps the movie flowing forward. I found it very interesting and unique how Kar-Wai utilized wardrobe and production design in order to convey the passing of time. The acting in this movie was absolutely on point, and the protagonists demand your eye's attention in every frame. Without Kar-Wai's choice to use smooth and slow camera movements, the audience would certainly find it difficult to appreciate his very cool and mysterious approach to lighting and mise-en-scene. Though Kar-Wai's film is heavily influenced by a formalist approach to cinematography and elliptical editing, the acting and subject matter are highly realistic, resulting in a wonderful balance between raw personal experience and a more whimsical dream-like state. If you're searching for a unique film that dives into the immeasurable and murky waters of memory and emotion, you must see Wong Kar-Wai's ""In the Mood for Love"".",In the Mood for Love
255,rnau001,Confinement and Intimacy in Fa Yeung Nin Wa,10,15 February 2009,"The environment of the film Fa Yeung Nin Wa is simultaneously intimate, yet suffocating. Most of the scenes are nighttime, dark interior shots that are tightly framed, compressing the space between characters, bordered by the walls and doorways of the small rooms which they inhabit. For some time in the film, it appears to bring the characters together, and personal space is at its minimum. Other shots appear to be looking down a hallway, or some long space, in narrow shots, like we the audience are being voyeurs or gossips looking in the world of Chow Mo-Wan and So Lai-zhen, and their almost disciplined, platonic love affair.The director Wong Kar-Wai has mentioned in an interview that the life during his youth of knowing your neighbors (early 1960s), a time when you can leave your door open and enter anytime you want to visit them across the hall, is a time long past. I believe that the extreme tight framing of the interior scenes were meant to suggest a closeness and a bond between family and neighbors. Every gathering in a room, whether they eat a meal or play mah-jong, is framed by doorways and walls, strict, dark lines bordering them, like a family portrait. On the other hand, the close spaces could suggest confinement. Chow and So often worry about the gossip of the neighbors, and eventually meet outside the tight, close-knitted apartment they inhabit, for more open spaces. The illicitness of their affair also builds tension between them, enhanced by the small, tight rooms where they meet. I believe that the directing choice of a more closed, suffocating environment was a good choice in bringing a more effective visual element to develop tone and texture of this film.",In the Mood for Love
256,NoobTheFunkmaster,Love is,8,15 February 2009,"The lighting for this film sure set the mood. I appreciated the way the director drew our attention to a love that couldn't be. For a subject matter of extramarital love affair, you sure rooted for that which might be wrong. The music for this film was awesome and well suited the subject moment perfectly and perpetuates the story even further; it was like the characters were doing a dance (though they weren't dancing) and the camera itself was flowing along with them. Sure, love is a universal language, but music is too just the same. And with both paired up there is a pretty good one-two combo to tell a story. The acting was great! You really had to rely on it (the acting) because the subtitle was way off.I did however get lost towards the end of the flick. The time shifts within the storytelling moves you to notice the subtle changes in the wardrobe and composition so you would understand what was going on. Though there were times I got lost on the subtlety; dang role playing threw me off. Well I guess I can't get spoon fed all my life. Still, I enjoyed watching this movie.",In the Mood for Love

He visibly and audibly allows us to relive the emotion and memory of love. With every camera lenses and angle he chooses he enhances the confusion the characters feel during this movie. Even though the dialogue is spoken in mandarin, the meaning and the emotion behind each look, reads clearer than any language. The director shows us who the main characters are by refusing to ever show us their cheating spouses and though the affects of a slightly blurry focus or circular filter on the lenses he takes us more and more into the movie. The sound design and sound track create the musical beat of the heart as Nat King Cole takes you into the memory of these two characters as well as tapping into your own feelings and memories. The acting I would pinpoint one scene when the female protagonist didn't go to Singapore with the male protagonist. She gets to the hotel room after he's gone. The quiet and intensity of the acting at that moment takes anyone who has ever felt their heart break back to that moment. That is the affect of the acting the whole movie. The editing created urgency and confusion when needed with jump cuts and quick edits; and slowed down when needed illustrate the, mood of the love.

This movie, like many distinguishable works of art, may however require a deal of patience to fully appreciate. This movie is double sided in that it can be viewed as both a love story, or a lesson in restraining oneself from loving. As such, director Wong Kar-Wai puts the viewers of his film (in many cases, classical cinema viewers who yearn for happy endings and indisputable closure) through much of the pain that his protagonists experience. Much of the movie consists of a seemingly never-ending amount of very close, tender moments that end with the characters no closer to a goal than before. Many scenes are left emotionally unfinished, and it is up to the viewer to fill in the blanks, which can easily lead to many different justifiable situations. The plot can be considered anticlimactic, but it is because the lives of the characters are portrayed in such a realistic way that one would finish the film with maximal empathy and understanding.",In the Mood for Love

The male protagonist finds a hole to put his secret into and covers it with mud, that scene was enchanting and mystical. This movie makes me happy and sad. The main color in the film is red. Red is rich and lively yet it made me feel sad. The red curtain floating outside of his new apartment made me sad because they both love each other and that's why the curtain is red to resemble their love but the hall is long and lonely.

The most important components of this movie are the photographing, the acting and the music. The Photographer uses a lot of close form scenes, tight frames, all kinds of angles, and a lot of hold hand shots.

The plot revolves around the relationship between the two characters. Many of the film's scenes have limited dialogue which allows greater flexibility in editing. This also illustrates how the characters are able to have an intimate relationship through body language, though we never see them in intimate love scenes. Wai leaves the content open for the audience to figure out, therefore, a lot of the scenes are ambiguous. The film raises many questions as to what actually happens off screen that the audience must comprehend. The majority of the shots uses closed forms and tight frames to create a sense of insufficient space. The characters feels isolated, but at the same time close together. The vivid colors of the female character's outfits in addition to the decor of the apartment is reminiscent of the 60's era.

I was always trying to figure out what was the characters true motive behind certain actions.I also was anxious to see what was going to happen next which was a gift in a romance film. The angles and shots of certain objects and body parts was a good way to tell the story without it being so obvious what was going on. The cinematography was brilliant and the other elements of this film complimented it very well like the costumes,set design, music, and color schemes of the film. Ms. Chan's costumes revealed so much about her character and insecurities inside because she always dressed up and presented her self in a beautiful way to make sure people did not feel sorry for her loneliness. Her dresses reminded me of a soldier's armor because of the long neck and two sleeves and she seemed to be well covered and protected but beautiful. The music was so slow and at some points it dragged the film along to help us understand the frustration of two people in love holding back their passion for one another. It creates a frustration so you can relate to what the characters are feeling. The use of color made it gloomy in their apartment building which helped me understand that Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan's mysterious emotion for each other is about the only excitement around in their life and surroundings. Very artistic and challenging to watch because it challenged me to be patient and allow the love story to unfold and it grieved me of how I expect in a romance film for two people to fulfill their selfish desires regardless of their immoral choices for the false illusion of love which is emotion.",In the Mood for Love

What man wouldn't fall in love with her? We notice her very early on in the film. Chow-Mo Wan is her lover. The film presents Chinese people as being very classy. I was amazed by the level of beauty and sophistication the film manages to present about the people and culture being depicted. The filmmakers manager to give the film some suspense. We wonder if their spouses will ever find out about their affair and what the consequences will be. But the film never turns into a thriller. It manages to be interesting even as nothing dramatic ever really occurs. It's beautifully shot with expressive colors that enhance the romantic side of the film. Mrs. Chan wears several dresses that help convey just how beautiful she is. The level of intimacy the film manages to capture is also very wonderful. It's important to note that there are no sex scenes. It seems like the film could head in that direction. But it never does. I think that's very respectable for a love story.

264,smthach,I hated this movie.,4,14 December 2010,"My American perspective allowed me to peek into the, apparently clandestine, lives of these seemingly model Hong Kong citizens. I thought Wong's portrayal of this tale of exaggerated infidelity was a prime example of Asian morale. As, (I'm sure) the world knows, 1 out of 2 marriages in this land of the free and the home of the Whopper ends in divorce. So, as of the start of this movie, my self-diagnosed Restless Leg Syndrome as well as it's associative yawns and a case of anxiety that could write it's own prescription, kicked in. And then...the dreaded slow-motion (what seemed like) ten minute scenes kicked in. I've only lived 18 years in this world, but I can honestly say that Wong must be the ONLY director that has a continuous slow-motion shot that extends beyond one scene. And is it just me or was the Spanish Tengo music in the background of an Asian movie comical to anyone else? (I did appreciate that sexy, yet sinister walk Mrs. Chan demonstrates ;D) And do i even have to mention the repetitiveness of the slow motion?! Please Mr. Wong, if you're going to repeat a style of shot, PLEASE use a different song! Maybe it's just my America-induced A.D.D., but i thought this film was overall petty and irritating. I'd also like to take this opportunity to tell Mrs. Chan to take heed the words of the all sagacious Blondie, ""once i had a love, and it was a gas.""p.s. sorry Mr Wong, I know; EVERYONE'S a critic",In the Mood for Love
265,clairetianqihou,camera movement for this film,10,18 June 2014,"In ""In the Mood for Love"", the director Wong Kar wai uses the only kind of lens movement pattern: shift shot. Compare his and other director camera movement, for example in film ""Swallowtail Butterfly"" -- the classic period of South Sea Girl shift shot . Wong Kar-wai's approach more simple and standard multi - there are pieces from their drop rate, middle-shift process is very stable, but is not fancy. The foundation of shift lens is field. That means between two scenes 's shift , or a new scene from the black scenes. This shift lens combined with Maggie Zhang beautiful dress, that may illustrate different places and time. Meanwhile, the shift lens also gives us a steady rhythm: time is goes to our peaceful life.Another foundation of lens shift is rendering the plot. At the first time, Maggie Zhang and Tony Liang date in a restaurant . They are talking about her husbands 's tie and his wife 's bag. The director uses shift lens but faster than before. This sudden change in rhythm give the audience visual impact. We can understand about most of events happen in our daily life, we feel surprised and sad, but those unpleasant feeling cannot destroy our whole life. That is because of the back grand and their personality. We can see that Mr. Zhou smoking unless in order to control his complicated emotion .   Wong Kar-wai loves fixed shot, no push shot , no pull shot, and no pan shot. This is the whole style of Mr. Wong 's film. Mr. Wong loves to express emotion use depth of filed. For example, Mr Zhou walks into the hotel room. At the beginning of that scenes, the audience can see the end of hotel corridor. All curtain are red, and Wong uses oblique angle to present this shot. Then director turn to use Zhou 's foot close-up shot . I think most common shot is the camera follow that main characters and then the main characters stop.All of those will be by full shot or medium shot. However, Wong Kar-wai uses different way to present the salve with depth of filed. In other word , he try to give the audience choice a deep space, and then let your vision will remain at the end of the space. Wong was so careful, and he seems afraid you'll bother to go into the old stories of the characters. He loves close-up shot with depth of field in this film . When he wants you to see a person's face and eyes, you can not miss. because you never see them before. However, the tone of the whole movie is always free, just little talking , and also the director always remind you that this is yesterday's story, not your story. Be careful them , don't touch them .

266,pierreschlum,Remarkable usage of slow-motion,9,17 June 2014,"I cannot begin to describe how refreshing it was to see a slower-paced romantic film. In comparison to the predictable US romance stories, it's easy to find comfort in the soothing and respectable actions of the characters. Kar Wai Wong outdoes himself by taking the slower pace of the film and adding some slow motion footage combined with an original soundtrack. In a world of traditions, limitations, and judgement, these slow-motion moments allow the viewer to hear the unspoken words of the two lovers, whom which don't allow for their relationship to exceed a physically platonic state. Comparing it again to most US films--where the lovers give into their passion, regardless of what the societal norms are--would make anyone feel that it's in films like ""In the Mood for Love"" that viewers identify content as form (regardless as to how present the director is in his choice of mise-en-scene), allowing for the films synthesis to form inside one's mind without having it served to him on a silver platter.",In the Mood for Love
267,emilylippman,A Unique Love Story,9,18 June 2014,"Wong Kar-Wai's ""In the Mood for Love"" is a love story unlike any other I have seen, and I am very grateful for that. In this well-executed film, Kar-Wai portrays loneliness, despair, and heartbreak in a uniquely profound and beautiful way. The plot revolves around two neighbors, Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow, who begin a platonic, supportive friendship after realizing that their spouses are having an affair with one another. These friends begin by finding solace in each other from their loneliness, however, their emotional intimacy and vulnerability inevitably cause them to develop romantic feelings and they ultimately fall in love.The romance between Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow is, unfortunately, plagued by the sociocultural realities of life in 1960's Hong Kong. Even prior to their romance, when they truly are ""just friends,"" they have to exercise much caution and secrecy so as not to face social scrutiny, as respectable married women and men are not supposed to socialize alone together. This points to the most devastating hypocrisy of the film, as two people genuinely in love are unable to act freely, whereas, as a viewer, I got the feeling that their spouses' affair is, perversely, more acceptable. Kar-Wai masterfully handled the film's ending, which I found to be a poignant demonstration of the unfortunate, inescapable plight of Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow. All in all, ""In the Mood for Love"" is a beautiful, even lovely, film that manages to depict star-crossed lovers in an innovative fashion, steering clear of clichés. It is a complex, multifaceted love story that stays with you, since it is much more realistic than the common triteness that I would usually associate with the subject matter.",In the Mood for Love
268,briannadevons,Unorthodox at its Finest,10,17 June 2014,"Having never seen any of Wong Kar Wai's films before, ""In the Mood for Love"" was a refreshing piece of work that instantly drew me in. Constructed in a string of beautifully depicted memories, the director's unorthodox way of storytelling is synonymous to the unorthodox story of love between Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan. Although the plot itself isn't jam- packed with intense love scenes and jaw-dropping climaxes, the non-linear structure of this story intrigues the viewer as we try to piece the last recollection with the next. The chemistry between these two characters, highlighted by the cinematography, is so compelling that their body language does most of the talking. Wong Kar Wai brilliantly compliments his story with an original score that becomes the theme song of romance for the couple. With beautiful composition, subtle intimate moments, and an unforgettable soundtrack, ""In the Mood for Love"" lingers in my mind the same way as the memories of love lingers in Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan.",In the Mood for Love

In ""In The Mood For Love,"" there are repeating scenes of Mrs. Chan goes to buy noodles, and the scene would suddenly turn into Hong Kong Noir-like slow motion and this memorable song, ""Yumeji's Theme"" is played. And many of Nat King Cole's songs are played during the film, since Nat King Cole was the most popular singer in the 60s in Hong Kong. The story of ""In The Mood For Love"" seems like it is based on memories and impressions, so it feels like the audiences get to see only the fragments of the whole story. Scenes would repeat and ellipsis would occur often, and thus the audiences are left with confusion of narrative time and the meanings of them. Most of the time, the repeating scenes are slightly different each time, but when they are exactly the same, the only things to tell it's the different story is the qipao that Mrs. Chan wears and the necktie that Mr. Chow wears. 'Time' is recurring motif in Wong Kar Wai's films. We can often see close-up shots of a clock in the film that gives sense that the characters are imprinting that instant moment.The original title ""Fa Yeung Nin Wa"" is translated as ""The most beautiful moments in life.""

Just because of the professional work of a famous director? You call it romantic, but which part of the story is specially romantic? Such a story is so common that you can find in a lot of films. Actually I find the story itself is quite all right, but the artificial ""slow moving"" of the directing really spoil the story. Good acting? Well, do you really know how to speak Cantonese? If you know Cantonese, you probably will agree that the acting and the dialogue are rather artificial and pony. Believe me or not, if you have watched more films of the two leading actor/actress, you will notice their way of acting and the way of performing dialogue are always the same, especially Tony Leung.This year I have the chance to watch 2046 in the Dutch TV channel, as a film fan I remain being objective and looking forward to enjoy the film. However just the same ,after 15 minutes I did not want to waste my time. I have watched good films and bad films, but it seems that the way of Wong Kar Wai making film is simply not my type!

273,rivera_edwin_m,Loved It,10,18 June 2014,A beautiful movie that captures your attention from the moment you see the first scene. The film revolves around two characters Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen that are in a sense abandoned by their significant others. Living in the same apartment building they create a bond. One that becomes an escape for their loneliness they feel. Each of them believe their spouses are having affairs. Their relationships through out the film could be seen as an emotional affair than a physical. They wanted the urge of being wanted and loved. They use each other to relieve their despair. Both of them knew this isn't right way to deal with their problems but they just cant stop until Chow Mo-wan moves to Cambodia. The director used the soundtrack superbly. Its integration into specific scenes was perfect for me. This films brings attention to the simple human need of love. And it does a great job. Any real film lover would know this after they watch this movie. I have to recommend this movie to all my family and friends.,In the Mood for Love
274,anastasiiapodrez,Genuine Love Story,10,16 June 2014,"""In the Mood for Love"" is such a great love story. Wong Kar-wai created a beautiful romance so genuinely portrayed by Maggie Cheung (Su) and Tony Leung (Chow); it makes us very emotional. I loved the slow motion montage scenes. The music was something special essentially connected to the film. For me, the songs that played in the movie will forever be associated with this Hong Kong love story. Love is portrayed in a very prudent, platonic way. When Chow leaves Su, they just exchange a handshake and this touch is something tender yet really powerful. Cheating is hard and the characters are trying to survive it together. At first that just connects them but then they start to have feelings to each other. The movie is very contemporary, it will be interesting to everyone. I am surprised there are no Hollywood remakes on this movie. Definitely must watch",In the Mood for Love

Chinese film director Kar Wai Wong did a great job in this film.One of the things that makes this film a great film is the way Kar Wai Wong directed the film. Kar Wai Wong was a teaser throughout the whole film. He made sure that the audience closely follow the protagonist by slowing the shot with music, having a very smooth style, and having forbidden affairs.Another thing I enjoyed about this film was the idea that it was simple. The story was easy to read. We were able to see the conflict and see the development as the film went on. Above all, what I enjoy most was the way the audience can relate to the film.This is a must see film. My personal favorite Kar Wai Wong film.",In the Mood for Love
276,henricproduction,Good take on a beautiful love story,9,17 June 2014,"I have seen 2046 and My blueberry nights - I can single handedly say that this is Wong Kar-Wai's masterpiece among them. Already from the beginning we get a notion that something is wrong in Maggie Cheung and Leung's relationships. Both have husbands and wife's that are gone away, and they are left alone to suffer from loneliness. Soon, Maggie and Leung start to meet, and ultimately develop feelings for each other. It is not an easy road though. Leung must defeat her fear of confronting her husband and abandon her feelings, while Leung seems to have an easier time of doing so. They do get closer, but Leung realizes that a relationship will not be possible, in terms of how Maggie is treating her feelings for her husband; she is simply not ready to let go. Leung takes of to Singapore for an environment change; away from all the gossip between them two. Maggie tries to contact Leung, but can't find the courage to talk to him on the phone and hangs up. The film ends in a very memorable way. In fact, I shiver every time I think about the ending. It is an ending which should be seen, and not revealed.The movie affected me strongly and also reminded me of the movie ""bicycle thieves"". It is a love story anyone can relate to, who has been unluckily married. You feel you are inside a trap, and can not enjoy life the way it is supposed to be. The movie also touches on the subject trust. Do we know what Maggie's husband is doing abroad? How can we trust people.Acting is spectacular and very memorable (which can not be said about the other two movies I mentioned in the beginning...Starring Judy Law...well that explains it.) Leung does an incredible job of conveying his feelings for Maggie. He is perceived as a ""Smokey"" character. With that I mean, it is something you have to see to understand. It really does set the mood of how the film plays out.Camera work is again, excellent. I absolutely loved how the film makers were able to go around every corner and sneaky angles and film their acting. It just made the movie so much more interesting and somehow believable.",In the Mood for Love
277,Junglist-london,Very grammatically and visually well-done drama,6,16 June 2014,"In the Mood for Love is Chinese movie made by Wong Kar Wai and shot mostly in Hong-Kong. Movie is love story of two neighbors with interesting twist. Lovers have pretty much similar faith and life situation, they both have their fiances out of the town and eventually they end up spending time with each other and since both are alone without their couples dealing with themselves in their daily routine they falling into very weird appreciation between each other. I found movie a little confusing at the begging so until like 40 minutes of it I didn't know what is going on, maybe director did it on purpose due to enormous amount of different editing techniques such as jump-cuts for example. I found this movie a little similar to Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"" because of feeling that whole story is just a big dream, but in this case Wong made it look more as a dream by using slow-motion, fading and unfocused shots and a lot of dutch angles. Story happens basically in 3 places: their house, her office and his office and also a little of the hotel room and we also see very visually great made sequence at the end in Cambodia temple which for me looked like some sequences from movie ""Barraka"" because it's purely visual without any dialogs but music. Viewers are not getting bored because even if movie takes place in 3 places, scenes changes very frequently so sometimes it was hard to catch where are they and what is going on. Music plays big role, songs chose very wisely but honestly there were like 3 different tracks throughout the movie so it made it a little boring. After all ""In the Mood for Love"" is pretty interesting movie that I would suggest to watch to those people who interested in good cinematography or for those who just want to watch something unusual and different, get a coffee, it might get a little boring.",In the Mood for Love
278,joeylohman,Mysterious love story,9,17 June 2014,"Kar Wai Wong's in the mood for love was a very powerful feature. The bond that Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow form is amazing. Almost as though the whole thing was destine to be. I felt as though it almost picked up in the middle of the story though. We never see Mrs. Chan's husband or Mr. Chow's wife through out the entire movie. However i did not like the fact that most of the movie seemed as it was all one scene. The only thing letting us know its a new scene is when Mrs. Chan changes her wardrobe or when Mr. Chow is wearing a new suit or tie. One thing this movie did contain was an astonishing, unexpected turn giving the movie full sense. I thought this was a very well played out mysterious love story with a great twist.",In the Mood for Love
279,santiago_jose_ivan,It's mysterious and i wanted more,10,17 June 2014,This story had many scenes in confined spaces. from the hall ways to the rooms the only wide open space was the rendezvous for the two lead actors. I also noticed that after every three scenes the fourth scene had the recurring music and was shot in a much slower pace than the other scenes. The filming itself was fun to watch. There were instances where some part of the lens was either blurred or obstructed so that we couldn't view the whole picture. It was odd to see a drastic change in scenery when it was set in Hong Kong and later on in Cambodia. I didn't get any sense of why that was done. In terms of why that specific place instead of the mountains where Mr. Chow slightly suggested. I would strongly suggest this movie to people who are critical when it comes to viewing a film piece.,In the Mood for Love
280,gmsilvana2012,Metaphores,10,17 June 2014,"I want to comment on the metaphors I found (maybe reading too much into the film itself) in Kar Wai Wong's film. The cinematography in this film is astounding in my opinion. The fact that most shots of the protagonists are through the reflection of a mirror is reminiscent of the fragmentary reality we live in, in which each perception and definition of the situation shapes the reality of the otherwise objective event; mirrors that can be metaphorically interpreted as the windows to our memories by the fact that they (as memories themselves) are blurred, cracked, and even stained symbolizing the gaps and even ""black holes"" that the unimportant events create in our conscious mind when we remember. They symbolize an opaque reality that is distorted not only by the passing of time, nor by the perception of each one of those involved, but by the needs and desires of the protagonists. A story that delves with the existential dilemmas of our era; the resolution of solitude, the acceptance and defiance of loneliness, the need for company and therefore love are echoed in Mrs Chan and Mr Chow's journey to one another. It is this common element and dilemma what drew them together in the first place and continued ruling the rest of their existences. Another incredible moment of the film, at least to me; is the final scene in the temple. It was very interesting to see how from the whole in which Chow ""whispered"" his secrets, a plant grew (from the mud we assume he puts after wards to seal the secret in) as if life and redemption would come out of any misfortune, or as a metaphor for the resilient condition of humanity and the capacity to be reborn in the presence of a painful situation. In this particular case; a metaphor o the love that grew from the hatred, sadness, and deep solitude felt before between the protagonists. Lastly but not least, what caught my attention was the depiction of a plate of apples set as a decoration in the beginning of the film, that were set in juxtaposition with a painting of still life (apples in fact) on the wall. I found it very interesting because again it is reminiscent on how each ones perceptions and definitions of a situation can determine the objectivity of a memoir, and affect the reality; and because it evoked, again, to the idea of the present and the past (in the end, it seems as if that painting made previously was created revolving around the apples seen in the present).",In the Mood for Love

282,jia_kehan,In the Mood for Love,10,18 June 2014,"If you carefully, seriously watch this movie, it is hard to deny that this movie is definitely a master piece, and classic. This movie can be considered as a retro classic, based on the plot, it was ordinary enough, nothing special, nothing more than a story about the affair and marriage. For the plot, it was neither tortuous nor cliffhang, we can metaphor it as the taste of a glass of water. But this is the one glass of water with no taste that you can not easily forget after you drink it.This first element that Wang Kar-wai use to make this movie special was the metaphorical expression. By this technique, we can know that the dim streetlight can be seen as the metaphor for Mrs. Chen's lonely emotion, and the scene of the blue sky and tree can be seen as the metaphor for Mr. Chow left Hong Kong, the time was from 1962 changed to 1963, and it also means that the love between them was falling apart. The use of this technique make audiences virtually feel that two people who married can not falling in love freely in the 1960's Hong Kong.The second element that he used was the hint of bright and dim colors. Most of scenes in this movie were in dim color that make audiences feel retro, sad emotion, and also bring audiences into the regretful emotion for their love. However, the most special color expression would be the cheongsams Mrs. Chen wore in the movie. In this movie, there were 22 cheongsams that Mrs. Chen wore, and each of them represent her mood. The most classic would be the one she wore to room 2046, where Mr. Chow Wrote his novel. It was a plain cheongsam with a red windbreaker coat, it actually metaphor their sadness ending somehow. The red cos represented how Mrs. Chen felt for Mr. Chow, but she is a traditional woman, she was afraid and also not able to break the cage for love. So just like that plain cheongsam she wore inside of the red coat, and the end, all they can do is keep this love deep inside their heart and mind.",In the Mood for Love
283,iwalksmall,A spectacular auteur.,9,18 June 2014,"There is much to be said for this film, as well as for Wong Kar-wai, a spectacular auteur. What intrigued me over all else was his ability to break so many conventions of production. While Su Li-zhen - Mrs. Chan and Chow Mo-wan are eating dinner for the first time, we see the style of dysfunctional editing, crossing the 180-degree line several times. It most definitely served the narrative. In this case, the cinematography and editing are just as confusing as the tense and uncomfortable situation these two are undergoing eating for the first time. Therefore, we really do feel what they feel.The grandiose, repetitive music that would only play over slow motion sequences appeared to develop into a motif in its own right—or even potentially an allegory for mundane life and repetitiveness—a sort of ""life goes on"" feel. I also enjoyed the choice to disperse bits of information in a fragmented way, not to mention repeating the same shot twice for emphasis. Certainly, this film was not made in a classical Hollywood style, but, in this case, Wong Kar-wai succeeds in breaking the rules to get his message across.",In the Mood for Love

The solitude of both Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan makes it inevitable for them to spend time with each other.

Not wanting to stoop down to the level of their spouses, they never consummate their love. They both feel trapped and daunted by the secrets they hold about each other, however, neither of them confront their spouse. What is it they fear? The recurring motif throughout the film is Mrs. Chan's qipao dresses. Every dress symbolized all the times that her and Mr. Chow ran into each other. They themselves had their own little illegitimate affair filled with innocence and sadness. Wong Kar-Wai, the director of this film chose for there not to be a happy ending in which they live together forever in happiness. Instead, the ending is a little ambiguous when Mr. Chow whispers his secret (their secret) in the Angkor Wat in Cambodia.

Kar Wai Wong shows a delicate love between two characters and relays their story through filming them similar to memories. Scenes cut quickly, and some are very similar with only the costume changes giving it away that they aren't. On first watch it's hard to grasp these quick changes and similar scenes, but for the observant viewer it becomes easier on the second viewing.This film is not for someone who doesn't want to sit completely engrossed in the film. The viewer needs to be cognizant at all times or plot points are going to be missed. As someone who appreciates slower films with character development, this film was still difficult to get through the first time around, and there were points in which I felt completely lost.The director does do a good job in showing the tension between these two people and also the love they have for each other even though it is a forbidden one. His camera techniques and use of repetition establish a somber yet tense feeling throughout the film. On my first viewing, I knew nothing about this film or any accolades it had received, but after multiple viewings I slowly began to understand why the film had done so well.

Unlike most American cinema that ends with a predictable happy ending, Wong Kar-wai pushes the envelope and creates film that shows the hurt that comes with affairs and the nobleness that comes from upholding your values and not stooping to the level of a cheating spouse. Chow and Mrs. Chen both reveal that they significant others are cheating with each other and being to develop a friendship because of this. They are there for each other for moral support and comfort rather than sex/revenge (which would most likely be the case in American cinema). Together they create a beautiful pure relationship that is based solely on compassion and empathy for each other. No exterior motives driven by money, power, or revenge like most movies nowadays. Chow and Mrs. Chen never engage in any physical activity. Although they are very fond of each other, they put aside their desires in order to respect for the sanction of marriage and to ""not be like them"".

Kar Wai Wong directed ""Fa yeung nin wa"" (In the Mood for Love), which stars as Maggie Cheung (who plays Mrs. Chan) and Tony Chiu Wai Leung (who plays Mr. Chow). Cheung and Chiu has a lovely chemistry on screen as they portray a woman and a man suspicious of their significant others' love affair. Wong keeps a fluidity to his camera movement, using the changing of wardrobe to represent a passing of time, which was a clever editing trick. What would you really do in a situation? Would you be able to speak out? Would you be able to abhor all the details in your life as ammunition? And what would happen if you happen to run into someone you start to care about, but unsure if you would really leave the life you are living? Wong does provoke questions to us in a realistic manner. I thought the film was beautiful. The only concern I would have (being a film buff) is the static audio that transitions from Mr. Chang (who is never seen). For some reason, he's voice has a different frequency that it made me think of a error glitch that happened in the sound engineering section.

The cinematography is beautiful, and the acting, although subtle in delivery and dialogue, is engaging and thoughtful. The use of repetition in both dialogue and music creates a familiarity that binds the audience to what they are watching. Similar to Asian culture, the costume and production design are equally ornate as they are simplistic. The story-line moves gradually with elegance, and you begin to connect to these two individuals, whose hearts begin to feel so kin to one another.

Both Chow and Mrs. Chan have reason to believe that their significant others are having extramarital affairs. It is through this common ground that the two bond and form a very unique relationship.

This is also my first review on this site. I didn't even intend to write it in the first place, because until now, I still don't believe my words will do justice to the sheer beauty of this movie.The first thing that catch your eyes when watching the movie is probably Mrs. Chan's ""cheongsam"". This also seems to be all women's sole costume choice throughout the entire movie. The ""cheongsams"" are elegantly designed, highly complementing of Maggie Cheung's lithe body, for it accentuates every curve and edge of the body. Mrs. Chan, like her dresses, is always immaculate, in her hair, her graceful gait. All of this deliberately adds to the sensuality of the movie, without being crude. Moreover, the ""cheongsams"" also indicate time pass by, every time a new one appears on-screen, we know it's a new day.The next thing that is highly prevalent and which I greatly revelled in is the use of window shots. The brilliant use of this techniques creates a sense of observation to viewers. It felt to me that I was watching something secretive yet enticing in its own way, and the general mood this technique actuates is simply beautiful.There are a lot more, my words do not do any justice to this movie, the use of colours, slow shots, silhouettes, the soundtrack (Oh how I love the soundtrack)... The absolutely breath-taking corridor sequence, the brilliantly filmed conversation in the restaurant (I had never witnessed a more consummate handling of a scene). This movie is incredibly, heart-throbbingly sensual, yet, there was never a need for an explicit act of sexuality.As I once said on Quora, while I was watching this movie, there was a lump in my throat, a swell of almost overwhelming emotions and sentimentality in my body that felt like on the brink of bursting out, yet it did not, and for the first time in my life I felt frustrated and defeated that I don't have the command of as intricate and sophisticated wording as writers like Vladimir Nobokov, so my words simply will not do In The Mood For Love any justice.",In the Mood for Love

298,PMascetta,In the mood for love,9,16 February 2009,"In the Mood for love is a heart breaking love story brought forth by Filmmaker Kar Wai Wong in 2000. The story unfolds in Hong Kong around two characters, Chow Mo-Wan and Su Li- Zhen whom are brought together through the infidelities of their spouses. Kar Wai Wong, brings together this love story in a formalistic masterpiece that breaks the heart at almost every aching moment, and leaves all important answers subject to audience interpretation. The tone is set from the get go as we our withheld information through the use of off camera space when being introduced to our main characters. When we meet Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow, we see them in conversations with their spouses, who we never see. The movie continues down the path of this idea of bits and pieces, seeing things only to a point, and never getting all the information we expect, seemingly always cutting before the content curve has reached its high point.Culminated with his wonderful shooting style, this magnificent film holds its own in its unique way. Constant wardrobe changes in what appears to be a single scene, closed camera framing, slow paced cutting, hard contrast lighting, and the use of long lenses combine to give a beautiful romantic feel to the film, all while making us feel as an audience we are seeing something in secret. The power of the story is that us as an audience stand outside from an objective viewpoint while watching these two characters never fully able to come together in what turns out to be a sad love story that almost was. At every moment you want to reach in and give the characters advice on how to make this thing work, but cant. Kar Wai Wong's ability to tell the story in his unique way is daring but the story wouldn't have worked without it. And in the end so many unanswered questions causes you to think about the story long after it has been told, and with little effort, lets you make your own decisions about what did and did not happen, and where and how the characters will ultimately end up.",In the Mood for Love

Frames of Mrs. Chan's shoes, their food in the restaurant, Mrs. Chan's coworker in front of the stairs, these all had a purpose. This can be said as well for the camera work, most notably in the first restaurant scene of the main characters, when the camera quickly panned back and forth between them. Even the choice of always shooting the two main characters in a frame of any kind and always having them in narrow spaces is very symbolic for the kind of environment Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan are living in. More than showing the audience that they are constantly being watched, it is also symbolic of being imprisoned, of having no space to move and to be themselves.Costumes, lighting, and set design for this movie are also great. Mrs. Chan's dresses were used not only for their beautiful colors but also as a tool for signifying the passage of time in the movie. I mean, I'm color blind but even I appreciated how well they shot that corridor with the red curtains. The close-ups of their faces in room 2046 were also great. Certainly, this is one of the most beautiful films of the 2000s.The actors were exceptional as well. Maggie Cheung was great as Mrs. Chan. I think it takes an expert actor to portray a character as complex as that. Mrs. Chan is a very conservative and reserved character but within that tough, seemingly cold exterior is someone who also has a great capacity for emotions (love, dare I say) and Maggie Cheung played the role perfectly. Tony Leung also did a good job in playing Mr. Chow. Though he doesn't display the same range of emotions that Maggie Cheung demonstrated, I think the character of Mr. Chow necessitated that from him.The only problem I had with the movie is actually them not ending up together. I don't know what was running through Mrs. Chan's mind when she left Mr. Chow's room in Singapore but after all they've gone through, I think they both deserved to be happy. Since the start, the movie has shown how ""normal"" it is to cheat on your spouse and how dirty people are but the two main characters are so proper that they allow such behavior to persist in the people around them. However, when it comes to them actually being involved in such an affair and even though they have really strong emotions for one another, they just can't do it because they said to themselves that they won't be like their spouses.This is my only problem about this movie. But then again, if the ending were changed, this movie wouldn't be as impactful and as beautiful as it was.",In the Mood for Love

Let's face it guys, it's nothing stunning... The film drags on endlessly, the film theme with strings is tedious and repetitive, there's no real plot, the film is edited together with bits and pieces. I agree, it is beautifully filmed and the cinematography is done very well. But if you compare it with 'Il Postino', another 'slow' movie with more or less the same main theme, then 'Il Postino' definitely is the most intriguing film.

I went in with the highest hopes after liking Chung King Express and was quickly disappointed. As for some of the production, there where several scenes in which the lighting was very well done, many darkly lit almost film noir like scenes throughout the movie. There were also several great camera angles used throughout the entire movie. On a scale of 1-10 i would give this about a 4. On a positive note i did like the performance by Tony Leung and can only hope that 2046 is a little better sense he stars in both of these films.

I however did like the cinematography as I did in the in ""Express"" but it was a very different visual style. The colors were very vibrant and vivid. I thought it was well acted and the direction was great, but I need a movie to grab my attention from the get go and this movie was just to slow in my opinion. Being as in I don't like foreign films I have trouble watching movies with sub titles, So if the story doesn't grab me I have trouble following along. I'd have to give this movie 3/10.

""You mean you're about to have one?"" ""No, I've never had one."" It's sexually explicit (and very sexually honest), bordering on amusing, bordering on and, in fact, firmly rooted in, serious. And on top of it all, it's got heart. You owe it to yourself to not judge it in the first ten minutes. You might have to bring your open mind to the screening, it will serve you well.

In the Mood For Love calls for the very care she is referring to. As you pay close attention to the details it grows into a magnificent tale, the tale of an unlived affair.
Mrs Chan and Mr Chow infinitely postpone yielding to desire despite the strong magnetism pulling them together-maybe because they ""do not want to be like them"" or maybe because they want to be sure they are not doing this because they are angry with their spouses.The rehearsal scenes where Kar-wai Wong plays a game of deception with viewer are ingenious. Before Mrs Chan is told by Mr Chow that ""they were merely rehearsals"" you are fooled into taking them for real.

So often films are let down by the hype which surrounds them - In the Mood for Love is definately not one of those films. If you have heard that this film is touching, tender, heartbreaking, sumptious, superbly acted, brilliantly directed and photographed then just believe it!If you are after a typical Hollywood formula love story then forget it - In the Mood for Love stays with you long after. Perhaps only Brief Encounter and Casablanca can match the emotional power of a love that was never meant to be...high praise indeed!For what it's worth my advice is to let yourself go with it, be absorbed into its story and perhaps the world won't seem so cynical afterall!",In the Mood for Love

I can listen to Yumeiji's Theme over and over again, it creates such a mood for love as suggested by its English title: ""In The Mood For Love"".

The music and slow motion shooting which makes this movie very artistic. The mental love between him and her formed the whole romantic story. The director used many camera movement to give audience this slow and romantic emotional feeling. Also the reflection on the mirror which the camera was placed at the back of the character so me only see their face through the mirror. Which we could never see them both at same time. There are always a gap or wall between them.A mist of love. At beginning the chance which brought them together as they move into the same apartment and became neighborhood. When he first said ""we are not same as them"" and later they just not something different as ""them"". There is a scene when they are in the car and she lean on him and she said ""I don't want to go home tonight"", which is a clue that they are going to have sex.

They slowly develop feelings, but decide to part in the end all for the greater good. However, what makes this movie such a masterpiece does not lie in the story, but rather in its effortless capability to convey emotions and mood. We are put in the main characters' perspectives throughout the movie.The characters' desire, pain, empathy and connection can be felt through still images and camera movements. Every frame tells its own story. The long, silent shots create a sense of longing and loneliness. Subtle body movements - sideways glances, slowly intertwined hands, the way they weigh their questions and drop their eyes or repetitive actions and conversations are never boring, because they make the audiences yearn for more.This movie is utterly delicate, beautifully layered, masterfully crafted to be brimful with feelings.

It's almost like a ride that you have to go on;you never know when there's going to be a drop,a turn or a twist. It also feels like a dream, like certain events never took place, but then again it did. It makes you wonder, it makes you question, and yet there's still no answer. It leaves the viewer questioning himself ,"" What did I just watch"" but in a good way. It's poetic , romantic and REAL. The events that had taken place in the film are no less than the situations in real life.

320,Super_happy,Eastern Romance,10,13 March 2019,"This film is full of Chinese aesthetics. Maggie Cheung replaced 27 different cheongsams. Liang Chaowei and Maggie Cheung repeatedly walked up and down the stairs. The story is simple, but their exquisite expressions and movements and Zhang Shuping's praiseable clips make every shot of the film worthy of repeated play.
The soundtrack is also very good, mainly composed of jazz, but also in a different style, some traditional Chinese music and Barsano of Ono Lisa.
Although the storyline is weak, it not only embodies the delicate and intense emotions of the film, but also reflects the characteristics of the director Wang Jiawei's works. This work is his sixth work. He completed the transition from a description of the love prodigal to a description of the person obsessed with a particular love. In his early works, emotions are like being dispersed in the air, released from one person, but always ignored by the object. In such works, there is often no fixed comedy or tragic ending, because the focus is placed on the emotions floating in the air. His work after ""In the Mood for Love"" will put the emotional focus on a fixed relationship. These works began to show some common romantic elements in popular love movies, beginning to appear and specific storylines.
""If I have a ticket, will you follow me?"" The timeline of the previous work of the film was emotionally driven, and the timeline of subsequent works was driven by the plot. This work is obviously a combination. It embodies a very integrated promotion, where the emotions of the male and female owners meet here. Eastern love is more like a game, and active people tend to be more passive. Guessing the other's mind is often the only way to win in a subtle emotional game. Here, we need to pay tribute to Wang Jiawei, because as Zhang Manyu said when she received the award, she realized what she was doing when she saw the film.

The acting and chemistry between Tony Leung (Mr. Chow) and Maggie Cheung (Mrs. Chan)is refreshing and tastefully done. Like the scene when they pass each other on the stairs and the frames go slow motion pulling you into their internal attraction. Accented by Mr. Wongs direction with closed forms and tight framing has you feeling claustrophobic and squirming in your seat to breath. The cinematography by Christopher Doyle is excellent. Although the 180' rule was broken many times (a montage of jump cuts with Mrs. Chan walking up the stairs left to right down the stairs right to left) was a little confusing but the plot along with the subtext kept the movie interesting.This was a different kind of love story for me and I would like to see this movie again to capture all the things that I missed.",In the Mood for Love

I've looked at several reviews in the IMDB since seeing the movie and much of what is said in the reviews is true - it just took a very long time to say it.  No one in our group understood the last 15 minutes of the movie - where did the young boy come from?  Why did we spend 5 minutes doing a panoramic tour of the temples in Cambodia (or wherever)?

332,gasmaskpeacesign,"Can't say I hate the film, it's too well done. But it's missing something.",5,12 September 2006,"In the Mood for Love is a rather boring, repetitive film, in my opinion. Although ambitious, I think Kar Wai Wong takes too much time to express himself through cinema. We get to see a character's deep, heartfelt reaction to some terrible event taking place in their life, only to watch the exact same scene replay itself a half an hour later. It wouldn't be too much of an issue, except that the scenes tend to go on and on forever, as if they just refuse to end.It really is nothing like it's acclaimed 'sequel,' 2046, which is more of a science fiction / psychological thriller / romance. In the Mood for Love I loved and hated the cinematography. I hated the slow-motion nonsense, it dragged on and on and on. Scenes took way too long to wrap up because of it.There was also a certain melody that was played throughout the entire film every fifteen or twenty minutes. I got so irritated that a major movie like this, with seemingly every tiny detail mapped out and choreographed, would rehash the same melody throughout the film, scene after scene. We were introduced to a wonderful little film overture, and then reintroduced, and re-reintroduced, and so on and so on. Why? I don't buy anyone telling me Kar Wai Wong isn't talented enough to figure out how to stick another audio track on top of the film. I just don't buy that. That nearly killed the atmosphere-but luckily, Kar Wai Wong is a brilliant atmosphere-setter. You could feel some of the scenes like they were unique, untried experiences that were happening to you. The balance of colors, strange camera angels, and the pace at which the characters would interact with one another (as in, the carefully chosen pauses and introspective moments) were just lovely. In the Mood for Love is a perfect title for this film.The couple seemed as though they were having an affair (in addition to each of their own spouses' affairs) but I'm not sure that's what happened. It seemed as though they were more at an understanding than into any sort of romantic feeling-or, at least it seemed this way for most of the film. It seemed as though the two characters really grew on each other, which was interesting to watch. I thought it'd be some kind of cliché romance, they both end up madly in love, running away together without much delay, yatta yatta But in the beginning, the emphases in the two character's interaction was more focused on each one's individual marital problems than on any sort of romantic infatuation. I like that, because it really gave the film a sense of realism. It seemed like, if a situation like this was going to occur, it would happen the way Kar Wai Wong did it, and not the way some big-budget Hollywood production company would have manufactured it. But besides the film surpassing my expectations for a Hollywood film, I still feel that there were major areas in need of improvement. But I can't say I hate the film, because it's simply too well done. 5/10 stars.",In the Mood for Love

335,Atria_,Beautiful time just like flowers,10,29 August 2021,"In the mood for love is one of the most popular movies in the mood, and it has done a great job in this vote. In the mood for love was wong kar-wai's 2000 drama, winning best actor at the cannes film festival (if not for the year to be redecorated, at least best director). In 2012, in the eyes and listening to the vote, I won 42 votes from the film critics, 9 votes from the director, 39 on the mixed list and the first in the Chinese language. It can be said that in the mood for love is the most popular and acclaimed Chinese film in the world.In the Mood for Love is the second part of Wong Kar-wai's ""Su Lizhen trilogy"". In the mood for love is the old story of a betrayed man and woman. But he adds a new element: the actor and actress use a ""crime scene re-enactment"" method to investigate an affair, which gives the film a suspenseful edge. How did the affair begin and develop? Zhou Muyun and Su Lizhen retraced the process unconsciously. The suspense keeps the audience hooked: Will they eventually fall in love? What will they eventually do with their love? This sense of fatalism is like an emotional black hole, constantly attracting us, of course, also attracted to the protagonist, let us watch a little bit of them towards the deep love.Su Lizhen is still su Lizhen in Days of Wild. Her life was a constant pressure on her and torture her. His boss derailed, but need to help deceive his wife, do not know Su Lizhen has suddenly thought of, his husband is also such treatment of their own; Meeting Zhou Moyun at a hotel to write a wuxia novel (nothing happened yet) and being persuaded by his landlord to pay more attention; Even the cheongsam he wore when he went out to buy noodles was said to be ""so beautiful when he went out to buy noodles"". Her beauty, her freedom are restricted, doomed to her best in the prime of the year unable to be with his lover. I once read an evaluation of Su Lizhen, ""young and unfortunate, restrained and painful"". This sentence is so accurate that I can not help but cry every time I read this sentence.The cheongsam is one of the features of this film. Maggie Cheung's graceful posture after wearing the cheongsam must have been deeply left in the hearts of everyone who has seen the mood for love. A lot of people say that the cheongsam has achieved the mood for love, but I think it is the mood for love that has achieved the mood for love. Are the 23 cheongsam really beautiful? No, some of them are tacky. But when they appear in the mood for love, they are not just cheongsam, they are Su Lizhen's ""flowers"", her beauty, but also her prison cage. This mutual sublimation makes the cheongsam extremely beautiful, which in turn makes the mood for love even more charming. Sometimes, the cheongsam in the film is also a tool for narration. For example, the cheongsam is changed three times in the scene of eating in a restaurant. Ostensibly, it is a meal, but actually three or even many parties are compressed into one. This is also the editing method of ""delivering a lot of information in a short time"" mentioned earlier.The character of Zhou Muyun is also interesting. Many people say that he deliberately made Su Lizhen fall in love with him out of revenge. But I don't think so. He had such an idea in the beginning. It was he who asked Su Lizhen out, proposed the role play, and rented the hotel. But later, he also fell in love with Su Lizhen. He said many times: We're not going to be like them. This is for Su Lizhen, but also to remind him. He did not tell Abing, but also from the side that he did not want to and Su Lizhen real emotional feterings. In the end, he hid the secret at Angkor Wat, which was proof that he felt the relationship was shady. But the act he tried to forget failed. All memories were moist and sticky, and he could never forget Su Lizhen. Keeping secrets at Angkor Wat is a kind of farewell ceremony, and ""in the Mood for Love"" is a passing water that cannot be grasped.Mr. Wong plunges the audience into an ambiguous mood. For example, in the hotel scene, almost all the furnishings are warm colors, and Su Lizhen's windbreaker is red. These colors pull the emotion to an intense state. Most of the environment in the film is narrow. The corridor of the apartment and the steps leading to the noodle shop compress our feelings and give us a sense of oppression. However, the empty scene at the end is the outbreak and relaxation of emotions. Ephemeral and permanent, vast and small. The soundtrack of this film imitates ""Floating Clouds"", many times sounded, like delimiting a love paragraph.Repetition and symmetry are a major feature of this film's editing. The pinnacle of repeated use of this technique, in my opinion, is Jean Nadimane. Repetition in the mood for love does what Nadirman did: make the audience more immersed. The use of symmetry makes love a delicate work of art, a movie that can be watched countless times.",In the Mood for Love

This movie can not be watched once, but must be watched over and over again to truly understand it, and even then it may surprise you. Kar Wai's genius presents itself throughout this film- especially in the subtle aspects of the film design. The music- though neutral- holds deep meaning in the situations it presents itself in. The colors, the way the light drops, and the directed interactions of the characters load the images- making it feel complete, yet mysterious. International film makers have the innate talent of telling a story through their art- this idea has manifested itself into Wong Kar Wai and he tells a tale so beautiful that one must reflect after watching it. His camera direction, use of actors, realistic environments yet formalistic style greatly influences and furthers international media, and film makers. This move is a must see.",In the Mood for Love

I feel so refreshed and good after watching it. The movie is actually a literature in its own right. Everyone will get something out of it and reflects on their own life and experience, perhaps their parents or their own. Tony Leung Chiu-wai's performance is subtle and excellent. The unnatural part is with Maggie Cheung's always immaculate look. I don't know why her hairstyle and clothing would be the same style and in the same good and wow good throughout the movie, when the sentiments have gone on a roller coaster ride for a woman in her position. It shows the director knows man better than woman. For a woman who knows her husband has an affair, she would behave nothing like Maggie Cheung was shown in the film. Her anguish and jealousy and sense of uselessness are nowhere in sight, except in Cheung's expressionlessness. In that kind of loss mood, at least loose hair and chaotic make-up could help strengthen the feelings. In return for hatred, she might even contemplate revenge and use Leung as her bait for vexing revenge on her unfaithful spouse. The chance is lost on the way Cheung looks and dresses. But the qipaos that she puts on throughout the film are excellent, and make good statement about the traditional dresses.",In the Mood for Love

A deep view in the human nature, painted with elegance, sensitivity and power. Touched everywhere by perfection. Visually, the most crystallized and colorfully rich noir film; stylistically, feels like a crime movie without a crime ever been committed. But spiritually, it's a passage of lifetime, covered with dreams, regrets and longing, where something that was pure stays covered with dust of the days forever gone by, but enough real to shape the present and distort perception of what should have been in an everlasting tragedy. Wong Kar Wai has the ability to make anything look incredibly sexy and this film is no exception. The sexiness and beauty is practically dripping from every frame of this film. A magnificent exercise in restraint. The colors of the decor and Mrs Chan's dresses scream their passion throughout the film, but we only see a reflection of it, a still frame, an old photograph bound to yellow with the passing of time.",In the Mood for Love
342,lear0,The best film about longing ever made.,10,8 September 2005,"Countless films have been made about love, whether it's being in love, losing love, or even the feeling of love itself. However despite its title, ""In the Mood for Love"" isn't about love at all, it's about desire and longing. These are feelings most of us know better than love because people usually want more than they eventually get. It's easier to make films about being in love because it's a universal feeling, and watching people fall in love on screen can be fun and heartwarming. Making a film about longing is much harder, since though it's just as universal as love it's neither as heartwarming nor as easy to convey, and directors tend to avoid the unrequited love scenarios so common in real life.As you've probably already guessed from my summary title I consider this film to be the best movie ever made about longing. While there may few movies to compare it to it's an unqualified success nonetheless. The plot, what little of it there is to speak of, involves two neighbors who find out their spouses are having affairs, and two main characters trying to decide whether to conduct one of their own. However the film isn't about the plot, it's about the characters, the music, and probably most of all the absolutely gorgeous visuals. Out of the literally thousands of films I've seen this is one of the most visually stunning ever created.Wong Kar Wai is probably the single most erotic director working today, and while this film doesn't have the amazingly passionate kiss of its sequel, 2046, nor the breathtakingly erotic airplane scene of Chunking Express, it manages to create an amazing sense of eroticism with no nudity or sex. Again it's a matter of longing over love, or in this case desire for physical contact over achieving it. Since the characters can only dream we're left in the same state, and this creates a sense of understanding and mutual longing the audience wouldn't get otherwise. In the absence of revealing outfits or sex scenes Maggie Cheung's various colorful silk dresses become objects of desire, proving nudity or even revealing clothes isn't a necessity to provoke arousal.Overall definitely a 4 star effort, one of the better works of one of the best living directors.",In the Mood for Love

344,trishhani,The tired strain of suppressed melancholy,10,8 May 2020,"In the Mood for Love is a story that follows two couples who move in to apartments next to each other. The main characters Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chen eventually come to realise that their spouses are cheating on them with one another.The true depths of this film cannot be described into words, the pain is too much. These people are friends, trapped in their perverse reality as they attempt to reenact how they think their spouses cheated on them. The film creates a sick parallel reality of their spouses as Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chen develop a certain camaraderie with us as viewers never really understanding the nature of this unusual alliance.This film touched me to the depths of my soul in ways I could not even begin to describe because it painted a very painful picture with the most undeniably beautiful brushstrokes. I could watch this film for admiration of its artistry or plunge headfirst into the story at the risk of realising that this film is based on everyday life. The things of which we intend to do yet convince ourselves it is not and then we proceed to create our own justifications for our actions is what Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chen represent.The fact that we don't even see the faces of the spouses gives further confirmation that their actions are their own choices, nothing to do with anyone else.This film begins and ends with a certain strain we cannot place yet have an understanding that it is there. The depth of melancholia this film portrays is almost too jarring to accept yet almost thankfully, it is just a film. Beautiful, enriching and yet, so frighteningly restricting.

348,jeremyh-2,"An elegant romance, with the heart of a mystery.",10,1 October 2000,"This 96 min. film begins with a series of vignettes that run about 1/2 hour. These scenes show how a man and woman who live next door to each other meet, and slowly learn about each other's lives. Each scene is short (most are less that 1 minute long), and each presents a sliver of the characters' daily lives. We see each of them interacting only with their coworkers, their landlords, and each other. They pass each other as they enter and exit their house and a restaraunt. They return borrowed items. For the 1st 1/3 of the film, they never stop to talk to each other for anything other than a practical reason. We never are shown either spouse, as they are both away on frequent business trips.This is the most incredible sequence of the film, because the characters never stop and talk to each other about anything related to the eventual plot. Everything grows organically from these sequences. The film is almost Hitchcockian in the way it presents clues about their lives, and we put together the pieces as they do.*****Possible Spoilers -- though it's really no more than you'd find in ANY review of the film***** Soon, both are suspicious their spouses are sleeping together. They eventually confront the issue, and through each others' suspicions confirm their fears. ******** Spoiler end*******The film is really amazing in that it allows these two characters to lead fully believeable lives, but creates a compelling plot from them. Before I compared it to Hitchcock, but the movie it's most like is Chabrol's La Ceremonie. After the 1st 1/3 of the film, they begin talking on normal terms. They meet as characters in a normal film do. The movie becomes less cinematically dazzling, but more emotionally compelling at this point.I don't want to give away the plot to those who haven't seen it, but the love story contained within is executed wonderfully. That it is accomplished without showing 2 major players in the plot only accentuates it.The film was pretty fantastic. I found it to be amazingly touching. In addition, the film was drop-dead gorgeous. I doubt I'll see a more elegant looking film this year.

351,akhilvadan,"A prime example or the proverb ""Show but Don't Tell"".",9,22 October 2020,"The plot develops around two couples newly move into a single bed roomed space in a congested housing complex, it is there our two main character meet Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan meet for the first time.Though both of them lead contrasting lives there seems to be more in common between them than they first realized, such as the mutual love for martial arts literature / comics, their frequent visits to the noodles shop down the street and spouses who are almost always away on business trips.
As fate would have it, they eventually develop a mutual friendship out of loneliness and the prolonged absence of their spouses. After a significant time had passed both Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow notice their spouses odd behavior and increasing frequency of their trips respectively,though they had suspected an extra marital affair to be the reason but never confirmed their suspicions until one fine day they decide to confess their findings to each other, it was this interaction that leads them to accept the reality.
It was their mutual interest in finding the reason and their promise to each other that they wouldn't make the same mistake and keep the relation between them platonic that they embark on this journey of enacting different scenarios that may have been the cause for their spouses infidelity. Though they are not able to arrive on a concrete conclusion but during the process Mr. Chow ends up breaking his promise and begins to from a emotional attachment for Mrs. Chan, this leads them to breaking their friendship and resort to distance themselves from one another.
At no point in the movie does it explicitly tells us about the extramarital affair between the spouses, rather it is insinuated by their actions, gifts they give each other, and their lack of availability. Similarly the cinematography manages to convey the pass of time, the mood and the loneliness of the protagonists with the meticulous framing and great detail. Throughout the entire duration of the movie we as viewers are not given any indication of the plot and where it might end up but rather forces us to form an opinion and interpret the scene as it is presented to us, from its minimal dialogues and amazing framing, we get a view into the characters internal feeling and their emotional condition at that particular time.",In the Mood for Love

The dialogue is sparse, and in keeping with the 1960's Asian culture, there is little overt expression of the powerful emotional undercurrents. The camera frames the players in wonderful tableaus with evocative foreground details - or guides the viewer through the very compressed spaces of the Hong Kong housing in the 60's. Technical production value is very high, and the amazing musical soundtrack is worthy of independent review. Not for the younger viewer - mainly because it draws on life experience for its richness rather than because of what it depicts - the PG rating is on point.

In The Mood For Love, is kind of complicated that it could not be understood easily. Probably, it is the slowest movie I have ever seen before. Is there anyone who can imagine that Maggie and Toney even never stop to say hello to each other during the first one-third of the whole movie? Usually, however, they could meet each other in the long hall or on the stairs in their high-rise at least three times per day. It is an exact example to educate our married generation to be faithful to their spouses and never make up their devious mind to seek another mental or sexual partner.

358,yaseensaifullah,Poetry for eyes,10,20 July 2020,"When I started watching Wong Kar-wai's 'In the Mood for Love',
the first thing I wrote was: meaning that every single shot feature characters not only framed by the rectangle of the film itself but by smaller internal shapes as well. Now this is a visual technique that film makers have used for decades
my favourite example is the great last shot in John Ford's masterpiece, ""The Searchers."" But seldom is it used so ubiquitously. As the film went on, I had to cross out 5 from my little note and change it to 6, 7, 9. It wasn't until minute 12 that I saw the first shot without some foreground obstruction. This shot, which crucially doesn't feature either of the two main characters but wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. 'In the Mood for Love' is the story of two married couples who happen to rent rooms in the adjacent homes of older couples in 1960's Hong Kong. The film focuses on the husband of one couple, Mr. Chau and the wife of the other, Mrs. Chan as they both gradually discover that their spouses are cheating on them with each other and then, how those two innocent victims of infidelity come together to deal with the pain of that the film manages to be unsentimental with its subject matter while couching the events in sumptuous, painterly cinematography. The narrative skips and jumps forward through time at an erratic speed as one might recall the story in memory and the viewer is often left entirely confused as to how much time has passed between scenes. This prompts a strong engagement with the film, a need to pay attention but it also reflects how the film was made. There was little more than an outline when Wong Kar-Wai and his crew began filming a process that took a long 15 months
in which the script and the individual scenes were written on the fly by the director and the actors together, which is surprising because watching the film you can't help but feel that you're in the hands of somebody with complete control. Visually and emotionally, 'In the Mood for Love' is fully consistent. The film is so self-contained that it only features a handful of locations each filmed from the same angle so that you experience a kind of circular effect of returning again and again to the same things This technique, far from feeling sluggish or repetitive instead isolates against fixed backgrounds, the things that actually are changing in the film - the inner lives of the two leads. And for the most part, these inner lives are explored wordlessly. The real action of this movie is in postures, glances and touches and by restricting the language, Wong Kar-wai echoes the restriction of action that plagues Mr. Chau and Mrs. Chan in 1960's Hong Kong where they are under constant threat of gossip, a kind of surveillance from their landlords and the community at large. This is one reason why everything is doubly framed. By placing objects in the foreground the director enhances the feeling that the characters have, of being observed, not to mention our own feelings of being observers. Observed and observing, seen and being seen, what we desire from others, what others desire from us - these are major themes of 'In the Mood for Love'. I think the most extraordinary element of this film is what's introduced just after the two main characters admit to each other: that their spouses are cheating. Instead of confronting the situation head on, their primary goal becomes to understand exactly how it happened. So we get this incredible scene where they re-enact the seduction of their spouses in which each attempt to embody the spouse of the other while being coached by the other on what they think the spouse really would, or wouldn't do. This makes for a really complex, but also kind of perverse interplay. Though the film aggressively focuses on only Mr. Chau and Mrs. Chan to the point of never even showing the faces of their spouses, we're always aware that four people, not two, are involved here. But it's not four real people, it's two people and two phantoms. Think of what's being asked of Chau and Chan in the seduction scene. In the guise of understanding what happened, each victim attempts to seduce their own spouse in the form of the other's spouse. A task that has to be doomed from the start because the fact of the affair itself means that neither Chau nor Chan can any longer illicit that kind of desire that they're trying to recreate You could describe this course of action as masochistic, and Wong Kar-wai lets us feel this by not making it obvious when Mr. Chau or Mrs. Chan are being themselves or being each other's spouses. Often we're a minute into the scene and interpreting it one way, before the reality or perhaps the unreality of the moment hits us, like a gut punch. But because each player is constantly coaching the other, they're able to construct a fantasy in which they control their own betrayal. And by never consummating their own budding love for each other, Mr. Chau and Mrs. Chan can infinitely delay the moment in which they have to see things as they really are. They can stay in their fantasy. It's a tragic and twisted state of affairs, and Wong Kar-wai has said that if Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung weren't such beautiful actors the darkness at the centre of their characters and their fantasy would be obvious. Of course, they can't keep it up forever, and in the scene where Mr. Chau finally admits his love for Mrs. Chan most of the fantasy comes crumbling down. As he says they are like their spouses, which means that the thing they've been refusing to see, their own lack that they've ceased to be an object of love for their loved one rushes into consciousness, like a wave. And yet still, they don't act on it. They can only let the brutal truth in so much. In order to survive, in order to move forward, Mr. Chau and Mrs. Chan doom themselves to missed connections. This is why at the end, the film jumps forward to see them just missing each other twice. Just missing each other, the mere possibility of a connection, not the connection itself is what sustains them now. Everybody lives within fantasy, within frames. Sometimes the frames are made by us, sometimes they're made by others. Sometimes we need to believe that those made by us are made by others. But whatever the case, there's no way out of the frame. When fantasies rupture or crack or breakdown completely, that's trauma, like living temporarily in a storm. Wong Kar-wai's 'In the Mood for Love' is a gorgeous, quiet and painful exploration of what happens when the fantasy you create for yourself is a perverse one, when it only serves to keep you from the pain that it was created to avoid. And, the reason the film is so heartbreaking is because this kind of perversity is really quite common to all of us.",In the Mood for Love

From reading other comments and reviews it seems that many viewers and critics missed some very important details which may have prevented them from enjoying this delightful tease of a movie.We are so use to seeing blatant SEX in narrations that we forget that there was a time when filmakers would suggest the ""dirty deed"" by simply showing the slack-mouthed couples ride off in a sleigh or haywagon only to return into the next scene with a bulging gut or a fat toddler stuck to the hip...""Meet your child"".The director chose the same nostalgic approach in telling the story of Mr Chow and Mrs Chan.  Last warning...SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER
Mr Chow fools Mrs Chan into showing her real emotions when they rehearse his departure forever. Next scene: Mrs Chan leans her head on Mr Chow in the taxi and says ""I do not want to go home tonight"". Translation: ""Let's Do It""Why then did the couple just not do the modern thing of dumping their cheating spouses,get a divorce,raise their love child and live happily ever after?

I can see there are no relationship, no expression to each other... but scene after scene, evidence after evidence, I can see a gradually of their emotion involved..How they first appreciate each other relationship, compliment other loyalty and understanding to their spouse..How they begin to suspicious to other spouse.. This is explained a lot by Maggie Cheung's boss who have a affair.. I think this made Cheung smell about an affair.How they find out about the affair their spouse have and try to overcome it by their silence..How their feeling to each other grow gradually and how they try to hold the feeling.. I can feel all of the feeling... although not much conversation in the movie.. but we can see from their expression, from their gesture, from the excellent atmosphere build by excellent cinematography..really really great movie.. I was captured by the movie until the end of the movie... the movie is so beautiful that I want to know more about their story...Wong Kar Wai Really did a great job.. so did all the crew and cast... 10/10 from me",In the Mood for Love
364,alexlai911,Love and Memory,10,17 December 2007,"After watching this movie again, it feel so different from my very first time. How do you determine love is love, when and where it's begin. Does it matter you if there isn't an end. ""For all the passing years, as if it is separated by a glass window which is covered with loads of dirts. You can see through but you can't touch. He is still missing the old days, if he can break through this barriers, he will return to the years that passed away.""People may found it is hard to understand and impatient to it. A simple story, love seems to be never happen, without life and death. But why, why was it so? Both of them are in under the control of their fate. Even their spouses left them alone, even they are living next to each other, even they work together.... ""Nothing have happened"", ""We will never be like them."" Can't you taste the feelings behind this solemnly vows? There is a kind of concinnity in this movie, which it is not belong to this era. Nowadays, we do thing as straight forward as possible as we could. Even love affair, we won't be that prunes and prism. In my opinion, though we are living in this bustle and flutter world, among us deep in our heart there are still a corner where concinnity still exists. Try to recall yourself, somewhere in your memories, you will see in the same old days we may have been through all of this.",In the Mood for Love
365,ssmolassy,Perfectly beautiful and full of seduction.,10,19 July 2002,"While most viewers will point to the lack of plot in this Wong Kar-Wai's In the Mood for Love, others will defend it with the argument that the film is not about plot at all.  Wong's films have never been about plot, and that is how he sets himself apart from the rest of the directors who depend on innovative stories to achieve dramatic tension.  Wong captivates viewers with the perfect blend of theme songs, Christopher Doyle's masterful camera work, and two attractive and talented leads. The story takes place in Hong Kong during the sixties; the affair between the spouses of Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung lead them to rely on each other, and to ultimately fall for each other.  But it is the attitude that ""we're not like them"" that prevents their love.  Anyone would be sympathetic to them in their respective situations, and had this been any other film, the two would have become lovers.  But it is the fact that they won't, they don't, and they can't have an affair that gives the story its feeling of romance and tragedy.  Sounds like Shakespeare? Well, the great bard was able to evoke these types of feelings, and ITMFL being able to do the same is a great credit to it. What puts this film apart is its aesthetics.  Each frame is shot giving character, emotion, and feeling to its subject.  The way the camera follows Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung even as they just walk alone or even past each other is scintillating to the visual senses.  Maggie Cheung is simply elegant in every thing she does - her character is strong in her ability to keep herself standing through her life, while her goodness and morality seems to be the detriment in her life.  But then again, this is what gives her character life. Tony Leung is simply a masterful actor, though he doesn't have to act too much in this film.  Still, his acting similarly evokes the pain and love that Cheung's does. All in all, there is nothing in this film if details are meticulously noted except for the perfect cinematography.  That alone is enough reason to watch this masterpiece.",In the Mood for Love

There is a definite emphasis on mood, the unhidden, subtly, and this is one of the rare works in cinema that manages to combine everything into an exquisite package. The use of music (the repetition of Yumeji's theme is the most stunning) as well as the astounding fashion and gorgeous cinematography. Maggie Cheung may not as mysterious and captivating as she wants to be, but perhaps this is a good thing, as it adds a layer of forced restraint to her performance that fits into the overall plot..

Most of the elements of visual story telling(I mean primarily 'cinema') is at its finest in this film. Wong Kar Wai once again collaborates with Christopher Doyle to create mesmerizing visuals which is beautifully enhanced by the music of Michael Galasso & Shigeru Umebayashi...The way Wong handles the narrative is wonderful & this film has some of the most romantic scenes ever captured on celluloid... they are not cheesy at all, they just leave you breathless...

370,edu-tirtadji,In the Mood for Love - A look into Hong Kong culture and forbidden love,9,13 December 2010,"This movie represents one of Asia's most prominent figures in film, it also shows that Asian directors have a vast range of abilities, that is not constricted to martial arts movies. Wong Kar-Wai uses a sort of voyeuristic approach to this movie, making it seem like we (the audience) are eavesdropping the lives of the protagonists. He does such a good job at this, that you feel as if you are actually peeking into the lives of the character, which creates a great connection between the audience and the characters in the movie, because we discover their secrets and lives. The director does a great job of showing us simple daily routines that the characters perform to give a deeper understanding of who they are. I feel that this movie is very different than your average Hollywood romances, In the Chinese culture people's perception of you is very important, and things such as affairs are considered taboo. However, it is very common that these things happen, which allows many of the audience members to be able to relate to the film, I think one of the most important characters that does this is Ah-Ping, because as the audience our first impression of him would be that he is a disgusting character, yet people like him are everywhere around us, and he shows a very realistic example of the average man. What I feel is great about this movie is the way Wong Kar-Wai creates a story about forbidden love and also share the culture to in this movie. He restricts himself in showing nudity/sex in order to make the audience share the feeling towards things that the culture feels is taboo to really immerse the audience in the feelings that the characters have, because in their affair they are very much immersed and in love but yet they know that what they are doing might not be right, and they try to hold themselves back but at the same time they can not stop themselves from continuing their relationships. Overall Wong Kar-Wai made one of the most beautiful Asian movies I have seen, but as the viewer not only did I get entertained, I felt as if I went through the experience and life of the Mr. Chow, and Mrs. Chan.",In the Mood for Love
371,yogurt63105,most over-rated movie I have ever seen on IMDb,2,7 January 2006,"This is my first review of any movie on IMDb; I am a busy person and I can never find the time to write such reviews; but this time it is different; because I always check IMDb ratings before I watch a movie; and generally it gives me a pretty good idea about the movie that I will be watching; BUT THIS TIME IMDb REALLY FAILED TO DO ITS JOB!I watched this movie last night with my wife and we both felt like we had wasted 2 hours of our valuable time. This movie is one of the most boring movies we have ever watched. First of all, there is no plot in this movie. Music is romantic. It ends stupidly.. you never understand why the movie shows some historic documentary about Cambodia. Now, this is one of the most confusing moments I have ever had in my life. Because, I went ahead and started reading the comments to see what we are missing. Page over page, I read glowing praises about the movie and its artistic value. I have to confess that, I am not an art major, but I am really curious if the people who wrote the reviews are all art critics and they know something that I don't. ... Hence, one important task before me is to be able to explain why this movie got soooo many glowing praises and recommendations. Until I can do that, I will live with an inferiority complex due to the lack of art appreciation in me.One question to IMDb moderators: why did you put all of the negative reviews on the very last two pages!! Is there something intentional for doing it?",In the Mood for Love
372,gooldenwending,An exquisite erotic dance,10,12 January 2004,"First of all, if you thought this movie was boring, either you weren't paying attention or this isn't the kind of movie you should be watching.  Go see The Last Samurai....For anyone else, this movie is superb.  It requires multiple viewings to fully appreciate, as does any film worth its weight (especially those with subtitles), but everything about this film is done beautifully:  The acting, editing, music, rhythm, cinematography are all masterful.  Wong Kar Wai proves again that he is one of the (if not the) best directors working today.  I can't wait to see 2046.Fa yeung nin wa (roughly ""years like flowers"") is admittedly a film that is intricately bound up in the active processes of memory.  It was brought to fruition by Wang Kar Wai's memories of his youth in Hong Kong in a predominantly Shanghainese community, and he was attempting to capture something of the flavour of his early memories of what that time was like.  The movie, like memory herself, is one long, erotic dance, inching towards consummation.  Like the recent Lost In Translation, the interest is not in the consummation of the relationship, however, but rather in the intricate evasions inherent in desire and the sublte power of Eros.Top notch.  10/10",In the Mood for Love

Trying to describe the procedure that the director manages to accomplish in this film means , to some extent , to limit , to diminish, to damage it . The representation of pure feeling experienced by the two protagonists, the meeting of their souls , is only hinted at, becomes clear with what seems to be out of the frame , is enhanced through a specific analysis of details, postponements, recurrence of speeches and behaviors . The wonderful texture of the work rests on a very delicate balance, elegant journey into the mechanisms of love and loss . Difficult to talk about a movie like this , shining jewel that should not be tarnished with breath but enjoyed with eyes and heart wide open, preserved in the treasure chest of our cinematic memory . Kar Wai , in a state of ineffable grace , entrusts the characters' emotions to wonderful images, makes perfect use of fading, slow motion , and of the moving music of Galasso , of the actors' bodies , creating a series of paintings of inestimable value : spaces framed , saturated colors , the swirls of smoke from a cigarette , figures glimpsed in the grinding of a glass .

377,lamthanh,A silent love... with restraint emotion,10,26 April 2005,"""In the mood for love"" might be Wong's most accessible work to date. This beautifully crafted work of art tells the platonic love between two painful souls: not only were they betrayed by their spouses, they couldn't have each other also. And if this makes you feel like the film is full of cliché, I'm so sorry for my bad English expression as that's just not the case. Just remember we're dealing with a Wong Kar Wai's film. The acting, the situation and the tiny details develop the story in the way we cannot imagine it would be. The protagonists never said that three words but we always witnessed their growing passion and restraint emotion through their every moments with or passing each other.Highly recommended.",In the Mood for Love
378,swastikchoudhury,The Art of Cinema,10,14 December 2018,"IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE - will make you fall in love with Wong Kar Wai, especially, if this is his first film that you are watching. My thoughts on this sumptuously crafted and subtly woven film can end here for certainly that is the summary of it all. But there is a lot more to talk about the film.(But before that - in a city like Bhubaneswar there aren't any public avenues to watch World Cinema. Certainly the larger demographic is oblivious to what World Cinema is. To most here Hollywood represents World Cinema and what could have been more disturbing than this? One can argue in favor of Netflix and Amazon Prime, but watching a thought provoking film in a big screen along with other curious mind(s) is an experience that no argument can counter. In such a scenario the Film Society of Bhubaneswar is the only savior. They screened Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for Love along with Days of Being Wild as part of their June screening. I experienced Wai for the first time with ""In the Mood for Love"".)One would instantly notice the detailing that has been maintained in every scene throughout the film. The slow panning has been interestingly used to bring the subject into frame, rather the frame onto the subject, thereby driving your empathy gradually towards the predicament the subjects are in. The other thing that has also been very uniquely used throughout is the screenplay from behind veils, translucent curtains, through gaps found in the back of chairs and such. It always gave into a mystery and mystic feeling about the characters who are in focus yet out of focus - signifying a lot about the many confusions that cluttered their minds: emotions and the natural urge versus the high moral standards they want to uphold to.The film's main narrative is nothing different if one would say it in plain text. But like an auteur's film, IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE wins you through its screenplay, usage of light, cinematography, acting and music which takes the entire context of adultery and morality deeper with a higher philosophical undertone. Set in Hongkong of sixties, the film is about two characters - Chow Mo-wan (played by Tony Leung), a journalist and Su Li-zhen (played by Maggie Cheung), a secretary from a shipping company, both of whom rent a room in an apartment of a building on the same day. Their encounters on the streets or in the stairs were limited to exchange of pleasantries but both of them shared together a lot of loneliness and pain separately in each of their apartment rooms. Chow's wife and Su's husband are most of the time out of the town on their work assignments thereby leaving their better halves to lead a monotonous life in an otherwise crowded city.There are beautifully shot motifs with lovely background scores showing both these characters carrying forward with their mundane jobs with a smile in their face and hollowness in their heart. During the course of time both gather that their spouses are almost always out (of town) during the same time eventually realizing that they were having extra marital affairs. Chow and Su feel devastated to acknowledge this in front of each other, initially thinking, that only one of them knew about it. [Generally, had the film been made in Bollywood/Hollywood there would have been some very obvious direction that the narrative would have moved. Wong Kar Wai's mastery lies in exploring beyond the obvious even in such a straightforward plot.] Both Mr. Chow and Ms. Su become curious to know why their spouse's cheated on them or how it would have begun. Their conversations used to be ""What would they be doing now?"" followed up by some role play to understand their respective partner's psyche. While it was a futile exercise to do, they made a point - ""We would not be like them"" and they agreed, rather promised, to each other.Mr. Chow nurtured few other aspirations, one of them was to write his own comic books series but never found inspiration. Ms. Su wished to have somebody to talk and share with but never had a soulmate beside her. For each other they filled these empty slots and they felt happy about it. But were careful about the fact that both had agreed ""not to be like them"". With passage of time, however, conversations became - ""Why did you call me today?"", ""I wanted to hear your voice"". They come close to each other literally, when Ms. Su in a reflex leans on Mr. Chow's shoulder and cries about her failed marriage, yet a dignified respect keeps them apart. The film actually goes on a high from here speaking a lot about the unspoken. You feel you have entered into a terrific drama (minus the melo) where both secretly craved, loved and desired for each other but wanted to uphold the other person's moral character. It's so suffocating at one level - where as an audience you also feel for their situation and want them to express their love for each other yet the film and filmmaker has a different plan. There could not have been a better emotional beating than this.There are coincidences and narrow misses - which both understand and acknowledge - like the burnt cigarette with the lipstick mark in Mr. Chow's apartment in Singapore (where he had moved to so that Ms Su doesn't have to suffer since he has now developed feelings for her) informed him that even after a year's gap Ms. Su has not forgotten him. She had come all the way to Singapore just to see him, waited for him (to return) yet left without meeting him. And then many years later both turn up into the same apartment where once they lived, to look for the other, yet they could not meet.Wai also touches upon the political issues of Hongkong in those days and how the society was conservative enough to dismiss a lonely married woman's late night outs or friendliness between two separately married man and woman. This would have also offered psychological resistance to Chow and Su from succumbing to their urges.The film is filled with nuances and it ends on that note. The narrative becomes subtle and deep just because it never attempted to show any of the ""obvious"" action, throughout, yet you end up feeling obviously that's how it should have been. Though you cringe for their love to blossom, you know the beauty of their relationship lies in their mood to love each other without the obvious physical expression of it.A must watch!",In the Mood for Love
379,hemadrahimian,In The Mood for Lovley masterpiece...,10,8 February 2021,"This movie is for my whole life. I will always watch it in times of nostalgia. Wong Kar Wai has created a unique masterpiece in the romance genre. Poetic and subtle, of course, has a tangible sadness that is intertwined with the individual in all the sequences, the bitter truth of love, the confrontation of courage and doubt. All the framing and color combination of this work is admirable, excellent directing,magical music ...
A woman became a victim because of her honesty and pure love and a man who may not have known that love requires reckless courage, not a calm, shy and peaceful personality ...
Maggie Cheung has perhaps best played her artistic career with all her being and indescribable emotion, and Tony Leung, whose acting has always been of a high standard.

Deliberately paced, the narrative takes a back seat to unconventional temporal devices. The score alone could make you cry.

382,yphilip1166,Brilliant soundtracks,9,2 March 2015,"In In the Mood for Love, probably the best movie Wong Kar-wai has ever produced, music is a key component with which Wong has successfully transformed the social contexts of 1960s' Hong Kong, the tension between the two main characters, and the collision of western and eastern culture into a sensible and touchable feeling. In his article ""Just play yourself, 'Maggie Cheung'"", Dale pints out that the Spanish songs in the movie serve both a purpose of showing ""Westernized influences on Hong Kong culture"" and a purpose of evoking memories of the old Shanghai. (Dale, 192) In the scene that Mo-wan and Li-zhen have dinner together in a western restaurant, while they drink coffee in jade cups and eat steaks placed on jade plates, Cole's Aquellos Ojos Verdes, a slow-pace Spanish song expressing a subtle sense of nostalgia feelings, is playing in the background. On one hand, when Chinese elements, such as jade cups and Li-zhen's Qipao, are intertwine with western elements, such as Spanish songs and western food, the social context of Hong Kong is then artfully revealed, for Hong Kong was under the influence of the United Kingdom but located within China. On the other hand, the exotic and semi-joyful feeling of the song conveys a sense of uncertainty and desire between the two characters. As they both are deeply hurt due to their spouses' betrayal, they yearn for a genuine relationship which could rescue them from their sorrow. However, since such a relationship is morally forbidden, while they desperately want to embrace each other, they also intentionally keep each other at a distance to avoid hurting each other. In another scene, as Mo-wan is waiting for Li-zhen in a hotel, Li-zhen first arrives at the hotel but eventually chooses to leave. The song playing in the background is Cole's Quizas, Quizas, Quizas, meaning perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. Both the tile and the melody of the song indicate the fate of their subtle, splendid and yet fragile love: the beauty of the love could only stay in a specific period of time with a particular group of people. Everything at that time could trigger their best memories, and everything at that time was in uncertainty. As Mo-wan once said to his buddy, the secrets of the past are forever buried under a handful of clay.",In the Mood for Love

386,lihao443160509,Review,8,19 May 2014,"In this assignment I want to introduce a film named In the Mood for Love, I choose this film because I like its director, Wong KarWai is a very famous director not just in China, he also got many awards on the world stage, I like his own shoot angle and the edit mode. He has his own way for a film and his way is influencing the new generation directors, many young directors try to use his mode and imitate his style. His films influence so many people so I try to use this film as an example and try to explain why he is so popular and successful.In the Mood for Love describe two people moved into an apartment, they have their own family and job. At the start their relationship is very normal. But on day they find out their partner already stay together and have extramarital love. From this, they try to start talking and exchange. This talking not just likes 'say hello', they try to talk some thing about their partner and their love and the content is more deeply. But when they find they can not leave each other every thing is too late, they beginning love each other but because they are married so they can not stay together, that is very excruciating for them. At the beginning, my thought just likes every people which first watch this film. This film is very long and boring and I do not know what is the director exactly wanted to show to audiences. But because of this assignment I think why not just choose this film, it is a good opportunity, so I watch it again and try to find out what the director want to express.Then I found out that is not just a normal city story, although the picture of the back ground is very common and the story is not very classic, do not have many circuitous like Roman Holiday, the heroine not a princess and the hero not very handsome, they are just average people like us. That is why this film will successful, this is a film for ordinary people and the story is ordinary, I mean every body will might be face with betrayal from partner or fall in love with another person, that story will make audiences feel more closer with this actors. Now I want to introduce some nice details about this film, the director try to use these details to magnify actors' mood through this way to let audience feel it more clearly. At 14M, 47S in this film, we can listen the back ground music is starting play and heroine walk in the screen, the music is slow and have a little sad. In this part the actor have no word but it can let audience feel what her feel, her husband have date with another woman but use work as excuse, audience can feel her aloneness from this part. And in the 36M, 10S, when they are in the taxi the hero try to hold heroine's hand we can see the heroine dodge his hand that means in her mind her husband still loves her and she think betrayal is not right thing, she do not like these people and she also do not want become person like that. Their partner betrayal them that are the same part for them but the different is the hero want intimate relationship but the heroine do not think so. Some times she wants to rely on him but some times she want to draw out from this relation, she seemed hesitant. She like the date with the hero, she like the feel when she is alone he can around her, that make her feel peace and genial. But when the landlord told her when she husband not around she should not frequent contact with other man, then she told hero this relation should be stop. In the film these tow people try to performed each partner and talk with each other, at the beginning of this relation the hero try to use this way to contact with the heroine and he told her the thing is happened, they can not redeem. That is very hard for each other when she said they should not keep this relationship, because she found she start to love him, although she do not want to connect with him but he is still in her mind, that is a kind of torment. So the hero chooses escape, he find a job in the oversea and no connect with heroine. She can not stand the missing so she tries to call him but she does not speak, she just wants to hear his voice. These things make me feel they are the true love. The hero said a story to his friend, when some person have a secret he will find a tree and excavate a hole on the tree then he can told his secret to the hole then he just need envelop the hole use dirt, his secret will keep in the tree forever and no one will knows. And at last, the hero fined a hole on the wall then he tells his all secret to the hole and envelops it. I think may be he let his missing go, finally feel at ease.",In the Mood for Love
387,tedmc1791,Beauty Amid Disappointment,6,11 August 2014,"An amazing portrait of temptation and the disappointment that often follows with gorgeous cinematography by Christopher Doyle and Mark lee Ping Bin. The happy lovers of the film never face the camera, instead long steady shots let us gaze into the faces of the spurned spouses. We notice the heartbreak in their silence and then the desperation in their best efforts to do the right thing. For a time they're just together in pain, rehashing what their spouses may have done then they're together too much and must hide from the rumor mill. In The Mood For Love gives us an honest picture of how people can pass in the night.The movie is definitely worth a watch, but afterwards, I needed a bit of catharsis and cut this Love Stinks music video from the film. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovNCWv0ZKeo",In the Mood for Love
388,lukungranger,Minimalism through Kar Wai's film,8,1 October 2014,"There is a technique that Wong Kar Wai always use in his work , that is Voice-over. Yet, In the Mood For Love has no any Voice-Over. we have to learn the story by ourselves, think along it by ourselves, if we get lost, we have to come back by ourselves as well. Many piece of Kar Wai's work often deal with a ordinary plot, normal plot. just like in this film, it is just about 2 couples move in to the same building and they think that their spouses have some affairs with others and they accidentally fall in love with each other. that's it ! Kar Wai use not many locations, not many characters and not many songs. (actually we could remember the only one score song when it is played again somewhere) That is Minimalism idea it Wong Kar Wai's film. dealing with some ordinary thing but expand it into limitless details. Less is more, always be elegant.",In the Mood for Love
389,miguel-angelo-sa,It amazes me,9,7 January 2016,"You will be amazed how gracious love story it is. The most impact for me was how we ""see"" the movie, some gracious movements as the interaction camera / actor, that will make us judged, even more, of what's happening. One curious thing, you won't see some faces of the husband and wife of the main characters, why? I leave it to you to decide. ""In the Mood for Love"" it is really a simple love story, full of longing and very romantic in soul. Interesting thing is the it should, in the beginning of filming it, be called ""Sumer in Beijing"" but as the changes was made during the recordings, by the director Kar Wai Wong, they change the title. Resuming: beautiful movie as romantic and sensual at it's one way.",In the Mood for Love
390,peteparta,"Gentle, sweet film.",7,15 April 2016,"It's kind of like someone decided to get Peter Greenaway to direct Brief Encounter in Korean - what's not to love there?! The film is ever so wistful and longing, acted superbly with a whole range of believable characters just being alive and living their daily lives oblivious to the building relationship of two people right in their midst. The two main characters especially are beautifully played; Maggie Cheung the very beautiful, slightly daydreamy wife, across from Tony Chiu Wai Leung, the hopeful, lovely husband... and then there's their respective spouses(!) I'd recommend this film as a thoughtful, sweet experience. It's no extreme thrill ride of excitement, just a lovely film; it feels real.",In the Mood for Love

392,premchakyadath,in the mood for love review,9,29 May 2017,"One of the finest film made by the director Wong kar wai. this film beautifully tells the story through marvellous cinematography and production design. every frame is like a painting for Wong kar wai as he has delicately planned and shot. Actors performance are based on the improvisation made on real dialogue/script written during the shoot which also comes as natural conversation. Wongkarwai has used his content and knowledge very well along with the detailing in the story such as change in the weather, talking about certain food items etc. Lighting of the film also addressed smartly the mood and emotion of the character and location. High contrast with good color make you really mad with your eyes. Approach of the characters towards the situation is also a key to set the mood correct.",In the Mood for Love
393,christianleepoulsen,The beauty is in the message,10,7 February 2018,"I am surprised by all of the reviews, they talk about the artistic way things were portrayed through cimetography through wardrobe etc. All great points and this is an artistic masterpiece for sure, however the real beauty I believe is in the message and how it is portrayed through the art in this film. I won't spoil it for others but I will try and stead you in the right direction. Look at what great pains the film goes through to help you see that this movie is about helping us all understand we are all vulnerable and capable of any of the errors or flaws we see in others. A great movie with a great message and what a beautiful way of showing it as well!",In the Mood for Love
394,marmolejo1489,"An astonishing film, that, ultimately, cannot live up to its own ambitions",9,2 September 2020,"I'd been looking for the opportunity to watch this film for some time. When I finally had the chance to enjoy it, I was truly impressed because of its flawless cinematic quality. However, I was also slightly disappointed as the film seemed to tremble down the closer the credits were about to roll; it gave me the impression that the filmmaker ran out of ideas towards the end, or that the focus he was trying to present didn't get fully focalized.
Overall, an extremely satisfying exercise on ordinary, but not simple, themes -such as love, loss, and time- viewed from an extraordinary and unique perspective.",In the Mood for Love
395,amungzy,Two people had sick on their lover.,10,17 September 2018,"The love story that is saved through love brokers who should not love, wong kar wai creates a very unique story to be enjoyed, the audience is taken to be nervous, where we can really express anxiety from both partners in the movie wong, with the mood of the film created so genius , and the addition of cinematography from Conan Doyle that is very doubtful in working on Hong Kong films, we really enjoy this film, this film is perfect for those of you who are feeling anxieties in yourself with your partner.",In the Mood for Love
396,ilyazorin,atmosphere and colorfull,9,23 September 2018,"""IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE"" - this is half-glance, barely perceptible and understandable only for lovers half-smile, silent walks suddenly filling the whole life of this characters.The picture has its own mood, atmosphere, color, speed and charm. The film can be compared with the painting of the Impressionists.Two humans, a man and a woman - the story is old, like the world. But like a real poet, the director manages to tell this story to the viewerSlow, stiff, melancholy frames from his films are framed in beautiful music that complements the characters' feelings and moods.In the mood for love that Karwai creates in his painting seems like an eternal mood. The dim light that breaks through the drizzling rain, the conversations in the kitchen, the sounds of the radio, the idle neighbor's gossip - all this is hidden from the attention of lovers. They live in their own dimension.The music in his picture is the bearer of emotional experiences against the background of the eastern restraint. It does not need extra words, it's enough to hear the first notes to feel the filmEXTRA:Initially, the film was titled ""Beijing in the summer"" (Beijing zhi xia) and was due to appear in the CPR (Chinese People's Republic). But, according to existing rules, it was required to provide the script for approval to censors, who, in the end, banned the shooting. After that, the main scene of the film and work on it were transferred to Hong Kong, and the script itself was significantly redesigned under the changed conditions.",In the Mood for Love
