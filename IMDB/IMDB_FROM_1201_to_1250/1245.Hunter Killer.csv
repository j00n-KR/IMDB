0,Leofwine_draca,Does its job,6,27 August 2019,"HUNTER KILLER is a serviceable addition to the submarine thriller genre of movie-making. It goes through the motions and delivers the goods in terms of action and suspense, although there's nothing here to make this particularly memorable or indeed for it to stand out from the crowd. The good news is that the story is involved enough for the two hour running time to never be a chore to sit through. Gerard Butler does his usual gruff stuff as the submarine captain and Gary Oldman shouts a bit as the top brass, but Toby Stephens brings most charm as the special forces leader. The action scenes and special effects generally work well despite the usual predominance of CGI effects. No classic, then, but it's a film which does its job.",Hunter Killer
1,SnoopyStyle,the submarine is ok,5,11 January 2019,"An American submarine is tailing a Russian submarine closely. They are both sunk. Rear Admiral John Fisk (Common) sends the USS Arkansas captained by Commander Joe Glass (Gerard Butler) to investigate with advise from NSA expert Jayne Norquist (Linda Cardellini). A four men special ops team is sent to spy on a Russian base where they observe the Russian president being taken prisoner in a coup. Admiral Charles Donnegan (Gary Oldman) is the hawkish Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Captain Sergei Andropov (Michael Nyqvist) is the Commander of the sunken Russian submarine.This seems to have aspirations of being better which only makes any missteps all the more glaring. Like one time, somebody calls the Russians the Soviet Union. I don't see why they send in the special ops team in the first place which just happens to see the coup in action. That's horrible writing. I like most of the submarine stuff. Butler is doing a familiar commander character. It's nothing special but I'm always a sucker for submarines. Submarine movies' best advantage is their claustrophobia. The problem in this one is that it keeps switching to the special ops section which is a different movie and more akin to Rambo. The CGI battles are not the most convincing although the green screen work is worst. I do like the use of modern weapons. The writing has problems and I don't know if it's the source material. It's a weak Tom Clancy movie.",Hunter Killer
2,boblipton,Who You Gonna Call?,6,10 February 2021,"When a submarine in Russian waters goes missing, the Pentagon sends in another to investigate. They find three submarines: the Americans, a Russian submarine, both sunk with living personnel, and a Russian submarine nosing around. On top of that, the Russians have just have a coup, and the SEAL unit has to deal with all that on top of the Cold War Submarine Plot.So with Gary Oldman playing the sub commander, who's head of the SEAL unit? It might be Liam Neeson, but it's not a missing daughter, but a head of state at risk, so it's Gerard Butler, it what might have been called MOSCOW HAS FALLEN, but this is Lionsgate Film, so they can't. There's also a reference to K19 THE WIDOWMAKER, but I suppose that's homage, and so fair usage.There are lots of the latest toys rendered in CGI, and people shouting about Defcon One, and stuff like that. It's a post-Tom-Clancy romp, with every man to do his duty, and lots of cooperation with the US Navy. The thing I wonder at is the roominess of the sub's interior, and the large percentage of pig boat crews who shave their heads. Still, it's fast and furous and filled with all the stuff you expect in this sort of movie, including the leaking pipes, the stuff on fire, and familiar lines.",Hunter Killer
3,Prismark10,A under-heated The Hunt for Red October,4,8 May 2019,"The Hunt is on.An American and a Russian submarine both sink in Russian waters. Both the Russians and Americans think they have been attacked by the other.Submarine captain Joe Glass (Gerard Butler) of the USS Arkansas is sent to investigate the disappearance of the US submarine. He finds some of the survivors of the Russian submarine and its captain.Meanwhile a US special ops team is sent to gather intelligence on a Russian base and they find that a rogue general is carrying out a coup against the Russian president. The special ops team have to rescue the Russian president and take him to safety on the USS Arkansas.This movie never reaches the heights or should it be the depths of the more masterful The Hunt for Red October.Gary Oldman chews the scenery as the hawkish military official, in fact he comes across as an incompetent warmonger.Toby Stephens who usually does posh types is having a hoot playing a macho special ops leader. He leaves no cliche uncovered and I would had loved to see him team up with Butler to do some action scenes in this film.Instead Butler channels his inner Sean Connery to play a more thoughtful role.The film falls between the two stools of trying to be an action movie and a thoughtful espionage thriller. Unfortunately the story is not deep enough and rather generic. The special effects also look cheap.",Hunter Killer
4,claudio_carvalho,Engaging and Full of Action Film,7,24 February 2019,"When the USS Tampa Bay submarine that is navigating in Russian waters loses contact with the American base, Captain Joe Glass (Gerard Butler) is assigned to command the USS Arkansas submarine to investigate. They discover the USS Tampa Bay and a Russian submarine sunk with survivors inside. However they are attacked by another Russian submarine hidden under an iceberg but they explode the enemy. Then they rescue the survivors, including the Russian Captain Andropov (Michael Nyqvist). Meanwhile a commando led by Lieutenant Bill Beaman (Toby Stephens) is sent to observe a Russian base and they find that a coup d'état is in progress with the defense minister Dmitriy Durov (Mikhail Gorevoy) overthrowing the Russian President Nikolai Zakarin (Alexander Dyachenko). Now Beaman and Glass are assigned to try to rescue Zakarin to avoid a nuclear war, but the only chance to the USS Arkansas reach the Russian base waters is with the help of Captain Andropov. Will he collaborate with Glass?""Hunter Killer"" is an engaging and full of action film with a good story. The plot has moments of ""Fail-Safe"", with the risk of a nuclear war and the chest game to the American military to avoid the war. This film is also the farewell of Michael Nyqvist in his last work. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Fúria em Alto Mar"" (""Rage in High-Sea"")",Hunter Killer
5,nogodnomasters,I have to go to work,7,11 November 2018,"Disclaimer: I used to be on a nuclear submarine. A submarine commander must make tough decisions that make Denzel Washington look like a sissy. The plot is too improbable to repeat. I didn't know submarines carry submarines. The write up calls our hero Captain Joe Glass (Gerard Butler). He could be technically called ""captain"" because he was the top ranking officer. However, his rank insignia was that of a Commander, typical for many submarines, but doubtful for a mission of this type. I am not sure how he worked his way from enlisted to Commander, but he did.Yes, there are a half dozen technical ""huh?"" I could easily spot. The film had a certain amount of machismo enjoyment.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Hunter Killer
6,kosmasp,Das Boot --- reboated,7,20 September 2020,"Let me be clear, this is not a remake nor would I overall call it a reboot of the classic movie ""Das Boot"" (ship). It does however include ingredients that the classic movie had. It does expand on that though and has some other elements to it - including working with the enemy ... which is quite refreshing, especially because it looked like just another cliche movie.Quite a good cast, dialog could be better, but the action is what counts. And it does score points in that regard. I don't think that bad reviews held this down or undermined its box office potential. It just wasn't what people wanted to see. You can't always predict what will make money and what won't. Though the Midway producers might have seen this and take some pointers ... we wouldn't have a nice looking patriotic movie then though.One last thing about reviewing. We all here have our opinion. Mine is not worth more than yours, though I thank you if you appreciate it. Just don't bully others if you don't agree with them. And also don't say things like ""people hate this movie because they can't deal with people being heroes and doing heroic things"" ... just to undermine your own point by saying ""it's a movie, it's not real!"" ... try to be consistent. Something this movie overall is, whether you can deal with the cliches it does deliver along the way or not, is up to you",Hunter Killer
7,classicsoncall,"""Looks like we're going ugly.""",7,25 March 2019,"Aside from the implausible plot and the impossibility of it ever happening, this was actually a fairly gripping movie, as an unorthodox American submarine commander encounters all sorts of difficult scenarios and guides his crew with stoic resolve. The first thing I noticed about Gerald Butler was his uncanny resemblance to Soupy Sales, a bit more intense to be sure, but close enough that it kept distracting me throughout the picture. Unlike Soupy though, there was no clowning around with Captain Joe Glass, selected for his mission due to being a non-Naval Academy graduate and someone who was able to buck traditional methods in order to get the job done. His first brilliant move was maneuvering a couple of Russian torpedoes into the previously downed American sub Tampa Bay, the one he was supposed to investigate when it went missing in the Barents Sea. From there on, the story resembles a James Bond project, with a Russian Defense Minister (Michael Gor) going rogue in an attempt to run a coup against Russian President Zakarin (Alexander Diachenko) and start World War III. Guys like that never figure on unintended consequences, and boy, did this story have it's share. I'm not buying any of it from a rational, real world point of view, but you have to admit, it was fun to watch. The one guy I kind of felt sorry for was the Russian sub commander, Captain Andropov (Michael Nyqvist), rescued from the downed sub Konek with a handful of his remaining crew. He looked out of it for much of the story until it came time to call the right shots to help Glass's cause. In a way, I wasn't too surprised when Glass handed over his lucky coin to Andropov at the end of the story. By that time, all the good luck in it had been used up.",Hunter Killer
8,zardoz-13,A Classic Cat and Mouse Thriller Aboard a U.S. Submarine,10,28 October 2018,"""Avenged"" director Donovan Marsh's nuclear war thriller ""Hunter Killer"" ranks as a polished, first-class, no-nonsense submarine saga that joins the ranks of those most memorable cinematic efforts about the silent service: ""Hunt for Red October,"" ""Crimson Tide,"" ""Das Boot,"" ""Ice Station Zebra,"" ""Hell or Hight Water,"" ""The Enemy Below,"" ""Run Silent, Run Deep,"" and ""Destination: Tokyo."" No, I haven't read George Wallace's novel ""Firing Point"" co-written with Don Keith, but if it is half as exciting as the screenplay written by ""Chain Reaction"" scenarist Arnie Schmidt and ""Street Kings"" scribe Jamie Moss, then I won't be disappointed when I get around to reading the 600 plus page novel. Clocking in at a trim 121 minutes, ""Hunter Killer"" does somethings few contemporary blockbusters accomplish. This seafaring yarn about a Russian coup to ignite a nuclear war with the U.S. is concisely scripted, and the life & death action zig and zags when you least expect either. Gerard Butler is cast as the skipper of the USS Arkansas, a hunter-killer sub, but he doesn't come with the usual pedigree. First, he didn't graduate from the Naval Academy at Annapolis! Second, he rose from the ranks to his captaincy. After he receives orders to take the helm of the Arkansas, he informs his seasoned crew that he knows their jobs better than they do, and he promises to run a taut ship. As a producer, Butler has surrounded himself with a sterling cast. Oscar-winning Gary Oldman of ""Darkest Hour"" fame co-stars as volatile Admiral Charles Donnegan, along with Lonnie Rashid Lynn, aka Common as Rear Admiral John Fisk, the late Michael Nyqvist as Captain Sergei Andropov, Commander of a Russian submarine, and former James Bond nemesis Toby Stephens as indefatigable U.S. Navy SEALs team leader Lieutenant Bill Beaman.White-knuckled suspense, adrenalin-fueled heroics, and a lethal chessboard game of cat versus mouse between Butler's patriotic but sympathetic Commander Joe Glass and the ruthlessly subversive Russian defense minister Admiral Dmitri Durov (Michael Gor of ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"") distinguish this audacious but formulaic nail-biter. A Russian sub sinks near Mother Russia under mysterious circumstances, and an American sub-USS Tigerfish--is torpedoed moments afterward. Over a hundred sailors perish, and Admiral Durov takes Russian President Zakarin (Alexander Diachenko of ""The Second Front"") as a hostage and mows down his aides on a dock. Unfortunately for Durov, a quartet of gung-ho Navy SEALs, led by Beaman (Toby Stephens), capture this skullduggery on video and transmit it back to the U.S. Navy Command Center where Admiral Fisk watches in horror. Meantime, President Zakarin finds himself under lock and key while the treacherous Durov takes advantage of his new-found power. Admiral Donnegan dispatches Glass with the Arkansas to serve as their eyes and ears. The first thing that raises Glass's suspicions about this situation is the hole in the sunken Russian submarine that looks like an explosive had been denotated within the hull. Eventually, Glass and crew discover that part of the hull of the sunken Russian sub has survivors. They rush to the ship and rescue two sailors and Captain Andropov. Glass struggles with Andropov who initially doesn't know whether to trust him. The action comes to a boil, and Marsh keeps this kettle boiling until its far-fetched but adventurous finale.",Hunter Killer
9,grantss,Over the top but entertaining,6,30 December 2019,"While shadowing a Russian submarine in Russian waters, the Russian and US submarines are sunk. The US Navy sends another submarine, the USS Arkansas, to investigate. While there the Russian defence minister stages a coup, holding the Russian president hostage and threatening all-out war with the US. The fate of the world depends on the Arkansas and a Navy SEAL team, sent in to monitor the Russian president.The movie looked like fun, but the general plot seemed so implausible that it was likely to just be another gung ho war-action movie. Plus, it stars Gerard Butler, and he only appears in incredibly bad movies. So I set my expectations quite low.Turns out it is quite implausible: many scenes are over-the-top and don't really make much sense, militarily. However, it is quite entertaining and the over-the-topness doesn't reach the extent where you're constantly rolling your eyes. The pace helps too: it is a cracking one and doesn't give you time to think how unlikely a scenario is, or dwell too long on one if you spot it.Hardly Apocalypse Now but it's good fun.",Hunter Killer
10,neil-476,Dumb but fun,7,30 October 2018,"A US submarine has been shadowing a Russian submarine in the Barents Sea. Two explosions are registered and no further communications are recived from the US sub. So Captain Joe Glass, something of a maverick submarine captain, is sent to investigate, as is a small clandestine surface force. It is discovered that a coup has been mounted against the Russian President by a rogue general out to start world war 3, so it's up to our guys to rescue him.Gerard Butler plays Joe Glass in this hugely improbably suspense action thriller. Improbably doesn't mean unenjoyable though, because this is fun stuff. But do, please, leave your brain outside the auditorium, because you will find plenty of stuff to have you going ""Oh, come on!"", not least of which is a nuclear submarine tippy-toeing between the cables of an underwater minefield. Glass' Executive Officer seems included solely to annoy the audience. Gary Oldman plays one of the most thankless characters for a while in a performance designed exclusively to boost his bank balance. And the fjord through which the submarine creeps seems to have transformed into open ocean by the time it is trying to make its escape.This is dumb, but fairly enjoyable.",Hunter Killer
11,deloudelouvain,For the underwater suspense it's worth watching.,7,1 February 2019,"You don't have to watch Hunter Killer for the script as that is the weak spot of this movie. It's the typical ""We're America and we're good, We're America and we are the keepers of world peace, We're America and we have to learn the evil Russians a lesson"" propaganda. It's all been done before and so it looks very cliché. We all know that kind of war movies so don't expect any surprises. That said, I didn't dislike the movie at all, and that's because there is that typical suspense you have when it's a submarine movie. I like that kind of suspense, maybe because being underwater in an enclosed space freaks me out. The acting is not bad and the cinematography is good. It's just the script that will make this movie having bad reviews. But if you like submarine movies, like I do, then I'm sure you will like this one as well. Without spoiling anything, as it's always the same ending, America wins in the end and world peace is yet again preserved.",Hunter Killer
12,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,14 January 2019,"Hunter KillerThe upside to being a submarine captain is your crew has no choice but to go down with the ship too.However, the commander in this thriller hopes to keep his tub leak-free.Unorthodox officer Joe (Gerard Butler) is assigned to helm the USS Arkansas on an investigation in to the disappearance of the USS Tampa Bay. When Joe locates the missing sub he also uncovers a plot by the Russian defence minister to overthrow his government by orchestrating WWIII. While his admiral (Gary Oldman) negotiates with the usurper, Joe and his Russian counterpart (Michael Nyqvist) try to thwart the coup.While the unlikely alliance between the two super powers is timely and the action is intense at times, this badly acted underwater white-knuckler is eerily similar to many other naval tales of its ilk.Nevertheless, submarine battles remain the best form of warfare because you don't see the casualties.

13,tabuno,High Intensity And Relevant Blend of Trust and Marine Bonding Integrity,9,15 July 2020,"Gerard Butler stars as well as being listed as one of many producers of this underwater, above-water action thriller. The suspenseful and action scenes are plentiful, all incorporating high sustained intensity. This movie rises above the typical shoot 'em thrillers with a more subtle, mysterious beginning sequence notable for its James Bond-like opening scenes. The difference in this movie is how the major characters while dominating the scenes also somehow allow the other surrounding characters to have a role in what's going on making this movie more of an ensemble movie than usual. There are also two major threads going on simultaneously throughout this movie making for a much more difficult photo, editing, and choreographic endeavor. This is a sharp, intelligent movie that offers up a clever twist and deserves watching. The unfortunate weakness of this movie was that there was enough material to extend its length by another 30 minutes making it into a non-James Bond classic. A minor problem is the attempt at a special ops rescue that almost borders on unbelievability in contrast to the rest of the movie that could have been rectified with more script revision. A very good movie that could have even been a great movie, nevertheless definitely worth watching.",Hunter Killer
14,The-Sarkologist,Another Thrilling Sub Movie,8,5 November 2018,"There is something about submarine movies that really grabs me, even if it is just the trailers. Then again I suspect that it probably has something to do with there not actually being all that many released - I can only think of three, or at least three that were set on a modern submarine, even though the subs in Hunt for the Red October are pretty dated these days. For some reason I've never been drawn as much to the ones set in World War Two, even though they might actually be pretty good, but these more modern ones seem to exist in a world of their own.
Well, this one is about a sub, a Hunter Killer class, that has been sent into the Barrents Sea because one of the American subs has disappeared. Well, they pretty quickly discover what happened to it, but there is actually a lot more going on, namely because the Russian President is heading up north to the Naval Base, and for some reason the Americans sort of want to find out why he is heading up there.
As it turns out things pretty quickly spiral out of control, since they discover that the Russian President has been held captive, and that they have basically stumbled onto a coup. Further, it seems as if the instigators of this coup are basically wanting to start a war with the United States, but engineer it in a way that it appears on the international stage that the US is the aggressor. Well, that probably wouldn't be all that hard to do, though I'm not sure if it would affect the US's reputation as bad as they claimed that it would.
I guess the thing with submarine movies is that the action tends to take place in what happens to be a tin can cruising deep under the ocean, and only some metal is preventing the entire thing from being crushed. Well, they don't seem to be as blind as they were back in the Red October days, since they now have drones that they can send out, but the thing is that pressure always a factor preventing you from going too deep. So, I guess that is why these films end up being pretty thrilling, because if the sub goes down, then there is little, if any, chance you are going to escape.
Yet this was more than just a sub movie because there was also a lot of action on the ground, particularly with a special ops force going into Russia to do a bit of spying, and then to actually rescue the Russing president, though rescue can be a bit of a lose term, especially if nobody actually knows that he he needs rescuing, which means that it could be interpreted as some form of regime change. Then again, it wouldn't be the first time that the US has used its military to facilitate a regime change.",Hunter Killer

16,cruise01,Delivers on the action but it is a forgettable flick that leaves you with nothing else on story.,6,29 October 2018,"Hunter Killer (3 out of 5 stars).Hunter Killer is a fair action thriller that takes the action with soldiers in a submarine battling with another and Navy trying to rescue a Russian president from a corrupt commander. Definitely, one of those movies were there is less story but focused on its action thrills.The plot follows Joe Glass (Gerard Butler) who is in charge of a submarine and has to find out what happened to the American submarine that went missing while shadowing a Russian sub. Admiral Charles (Gary Oldman) sends out the Navy to go on a search at the Russian naval base. When they find out a corrupt Russian commander kidnapped their own president and trying to start a new world war. It is up to the navy led by Lt. Bill (Toby Stephens) and Joe to face against oncoming torpedo's and destroyer ships from stopping them.There is barely much of a story. Besides, you have Admiral Charles played by Gary Oldman who would always point out the obvious with an overreacting performance. Which is more annoying than ever seeing his performance. When the American sub goes missing, and they need to find a new commander to take over sub Hunter killer. They reach out to Joe Glass who is wondering the snowy mountains hunting. Gerard Butler was decent with his character at least. Then, there is NSA analyst Jayne (Linda Cardellini) who is aware of the situation with the Russian's president and their suspicious commander. Her role felt undeveloped and she spent most of the time viewing drone footage. Last, there is Lt. Bill who is taking a group of soldiers to get a better look at the Russian Naval Base. And is assigned to rescuing the Russian's president.The script was lacking in characterization. There are many characters that are just there to fill their roles. Especially, when Joe Glass is walking through the sub and meeting everyone in their stations. Most of these characters are all forgettable.The action sequences are entertaining. The direction goes back and forth with Joe Glass in the sub fighting against another sub or avoiding underwater mines or missiles. While Toby Stephens character and his team are in a firefight on land trying to escape the naval compound.Overall, Hunter Killer is a fair thriller film. The action sequences are exciting and entertaining. The plot is boring and barely a story to make this movie memorable. The characters are forgettable. The acting was decent with Gerard Butler and Toby Stephens. Gary Oldman's performance was just terrible and annoying. The movie is a decent action flick to kill some time but it is forgettable once it ends.",Hunter Killer
17,Floated2,Terrible and no suspense,1,24 October 2019,"Was expecting something somewhat decent and thrilling but was not completely surprised following watching this movie. The trailers looked generic. Hunter Killer was released only a year ago and was an instant box office flop. This should have been a red flag towards Gerard Butler and his career. A few missteps in recent years has to question his latest career choices.There isn't much to talk about this movie. It is incredibly dull, bland and the acting isn't too strong. Boring and confusing most of the film and there isn't very much suspense or thrills along the way. It takes itself too serious and has a feel if very try-hard.One is quite surprised at the amount of positive top reviews for this film and the amount of reviews in general- especially considering how bad of a flop this was. Would not recommend this film. Was a waste of time.",Hunter Killer
18,eddie_baggins,An 80's like action/thriller without the fun,4,10 June 2019,"It's a question I've asked before and a question I will probably never know the answer to, but what happened to Gerard Butler?There was a time when the angry Scotsman felt like the next big thing, an actor that despite seemingly having a limited range was never the less continually popping up in films that were noteworthy for being far better than you'd thought would be or films that were downright entertaining.There was 300 in 2006, RocknRolla in 2008 and guilty pleasure offerings like Gamer and Law Abiding Citizen in 2009 but since then Mr. Butler has seemingly thrown it in for generic and tiresome entries, content with the fact he is no longer going to try be a part of films with any type of risk involved.Gone are the visual delights of 300, the energy of RocknRolla, the oddities of Gamer or the thrills of Law Abiding Citizen and instead they have been replaced by the likes of Machine Gun Preacher, Chasing Mavericks, Gods of Egypt, A Family Man and Geostorm, films that you'd be hard pressed to remember even existed and act as proof that Butler seemingly no longer cares.There's nothing wrong with aiming for low hanging fruit but with Butler having proved in times past that he has the ability to be an entertaining central figure and choose movies that are ok to enjoy, it's a shame his making films like he is at the moment, that includes Hunter Killer.Arguably better than it should be but also daft, over the top and filled with sleep-walking performances and early 2000's CGI work, this submarine action/thriller sees Butler kindly not kill a deer and his family and then move onto commanding an American vessel caught up in a dangerous game with Russia that could see World War 3 come to fruition.Teaming up with director Donovan Marsh, Hunter Killer is like a film straight out of the 80's, just done with less fun in mind as everything is very po-faced as the films too long run-time ticks by as Butler wanders his way through proceedings as mastermind captain Joe Glass.There's slight thrills to be had once every now and then as Glass and his crew get deeper and deeper into enemy territory but there's little to no imagination on offer here and with the action beats taking place around dollar budget effects and lots of loud noises, Hunter Killer faces a constant uphill battle to find its way to the surface, made worse by the fact Gary Oldman somehow was convinced he needed to appear in this film as a high ranking official.Final Say -There's no surprises here, Hunter Killer is yet another Butler outing that feels like it was made with zero love or thought and while its passable as a filler offering, its undeniably sad to see Butler once more partake in such a lifeless outing.2 bored looking Oscar winners out of 5",Hunter Killer
19,leonblackwood,Decent plot but only worth a one-watch! 5/10,5,27 April 2019,"Review:
This is yet another mediocre movie from Gerard Butler, which does have its intense moments, but it's nothing that we haven't seen before. I did enjoy the Navy Seal part of the plot, which I thought Butler should have played, and it did have a Hunt for the Red October feel, but without the Connery class performance. Gary Oldman should have played Butler's role, which would have worked perfectly in the submarine, but with that aside, I did like the whole ""American's teaming up with the Russian's"" concept, which is rare in this day and age. The film kicks off under-water, were the USS Tampa Bay vanishes while shadowing a Russian Akula-class submarine in the Arctic. Rear Admiral John Fisk (Common) sends a Virginia-class submarine, the USS Arkansas, under the command of newly-promoted and unorthodox Commander Joe Glass (Gerard Butler) to investigate. At the same time, a Navy Seal team under the command of Lieutenant Bill Beaman (Toby Stephens) is sent in to discreetly observe a Russian naval base, but their mission is swiftly complicated when Martinelli (Zane Holtz), the team's new designated marksman recruit, is rendered unconscious during the HALO drop. When they arrive at the naval base, they witness defence minister Dmitriy Surov (Mikhail Gorevoy) conducting a coup d'etat and taking Russian President Nikolai Zakarin (Alexander Dyachenko) prisoner and swiftly realise that Duroc intends to trigger a war. Meanwhile, Arkansas discovers the lost U.S. submarine, and also finds a sunken Russian submarine damaged in a manner that suggests internal sabotage rather than external attack. They are attacked by another Russian submarine that has been hiding under an iceberg, but Glass is able to destroy the ambushes and rescue Russian survivors from the wreck, including submarine captain Sergei Andropov (Michael Nyqvist). Now I know that it sounds confusing, but believe me, it's pretty straight forward when you watch it. Anyway, back at base, the U.S.government learns about the coup, and Admiral Charles Donnegan (Gary Oldman) recommends preparing for war, while Fisk suggests that Arkansas be sent to rendezvous with Beaman's team after they have rescued Zakarin. Glass manages to convince the reluctant Andropov to help, and with Andropov's knowledge of the minefield around the base, Glass navigates the Arkansas near the base undetected. Meanwhile, Beaman's team infiltrate the base and succeed in retrieving President Zakarin, but lose two teammates in the process. Beaman delivers the injured president to Arkansas's DSRV, then goes back alone for Martinelli, whom he was forced to leave behind due to prior injuries. As U.S. and Russian fleets face off for battle, Arkansas sustains further damage when they are attacked by Andropov's old ship. Andropov is able to communicate a message affirming that President Zakarin is aboard the submarine. When Duroc orders his forces at the base to fire missiles at the surfaced Arkansas, Glass refuses to take action, recognising that firing back at the Russians could start the war he is trying to stop. In the last seconds, Andropov's old crewmates defy orders and destroy the incoming missiles with CIWS before they can strike Arkansas, and subsequently destroy Durov's naval base headquarters with their missiles. With the war averted, Glass docks Arkansas to the Russian naval base to return Zakarin and Andropov's surviving crew to their country. Although the movie flopped heavily at the box office, even with big names like Butler and Oldman in the cast, it's still a well-written story, with realistic sets, but it's not the type of film that I would personally watch twice. It's obvious from the very beginning that Butler is going to save the day, again, but with the many twist and turns in the plot, it does make it watchable. It's just a shame that the director didn't take full advantage of the great cast! Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Donovan Marsh, who brought you Spud in 2010, Spud 2 and iNumber Number, which are all unheard of. He did do a decent job with a complex storyline, but I personally think that it would have been a smash hit if it went to an established director. With Butler's name on the producer credits, the failure at the box office must have hit everyone hard, especially after the amount of work that went into the 3 parallel concepts. As this film didn't get a big distribution campaign, I can't see it damaging any of the actor's reputations, but I still think that it would have been a better watch of Butler was in the action role, with Oldman controlling the submarine.Budget: $40million

20,imseeg,"Kinda boring submarine scenes. Better watch ""Olympus has Fallen"" instead, that's a much better action movie with the very same Gerard Butler.",4,10 December 2020,"The bad:
The submarine scenes are many in number and almost all of those under water scenes are quite boring to watch, because they are lacking in suspense and in credibility. There simply are many other and better submarine movies than this one. The above water action is okay-ish, but those action scenes (above water) are unfortunately not enough to make it an exciting action movie anyway...My advice would be to watch Gerard Butler in ""Olympus has Fallen"", which is a gungho, fierce, non stop action movie, everything ""Hunter Killer"" is NOT.Not any good at all? Well, Gary Oldman is starring in it, in a small supporting role however, for those who love this actor. He cant save this movie from being drizzling boring...The ""story"": Gerard Butler is submarine captain who is gonna rescue a Russian president from a terrorist attack.",Hunter Killer
21,stevendbeard,Good Submarine Battles,7,27 October 2018,"I saw ""Hunter Killer"", starring Gerard Butler-Geostorm, Dracula 2000; Common-Girls Trip, Now You See Me; Linda Cardellini-The Daddy's Home movies, Brokeback Mountain and Gary Oldman-Darkest Hour, Bram Stoker's Dracula.
This is an action movie about the US and Russia on the brink of war. The Russian president is kidnapped by an overzealous Russian general that is staging a coup. Gerard, a captain of a US submarine, is tasked with invading Russian territory and then try to rescue the President. Of course, he has a little help from the Navy Seals. Linda plays a person that has lots of information-you know how these government spooks can be-and it is way above Common's pay grade. And he is the American general in charge of the operation. Gary is Common's boss and he believes a war is eminent with the Russians. Only Gerard and his Seal Team buddies have a chance of preventing WW3. There are some good submarine battles, both with other subs and also destroyers.
It's rated ""R"" for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minutes.
I enjoyed the submarine battles and I would buy it on DVD.",Hunter Killer

That's why I really wanted to love this movie and why I'm so disappointed that I didn't.Headlined by two actors capable of carrying a movie like this (though Oldman barely rates above a cameo), ""Hunter Killer"" is ultimately undone by simply checking off genre boxes and aping other movies of its type, only doing so with far less skill and panache than the genre's best or even its second-tier efforts. At times it plays like a late 90's made for TV effort.If you wanna see the genre done right, check out 1990's ""The Hunt for Red October"", helmed by ""Die Hard"" director John McTiernan (Based on a far superior novel than the one ""Hunter Killer"" loosely adapts) and 1995's ""Crimson Tide"", directed by Tony Scott of ""Top Gun"" fame.

Just seeing the trailer for this flick being tacked on within the last few weeks I expected the worst of this action movie throwback from another era. The fact that its been sitting on a shelf somewhere for a while (I know this not because I read it somewhere but one actor in the movie, Michael Nyqvist, passed away more than a year ago) it must've been funny waiting for this particular round of double dutch to jump into. Maybe Goldman's Oscar win finally lit a fire under the filmmakers' collective asses to actually release the thing so I expected the worst as one would but it was not bad considering. A splinter sect of the Russian military plans to overthrow their president so the Americans in both sub & land are determined to rescue the held leader & free him. Not falling for cheap heroics, this film pretty much plays its plot as straight as possible w/probably the most controlled performance Butler has given yet.

There's been a lot of these kind of films on offer lately from a variety of nations and as always they are a mixed bag.Hunter Killer is a ""hail"" to US exceptionalism. The US is cast as the savior of the world, helping out those troublesome Russians, whilst heading off WWIII. Interesting too, to see a female US President on offer, who looks a lot like a certain someone who needs no introduction.The action scenes are well done and the acting is decent. On this front this film is reasonably entertaining with well planned pacing, that keeps things going. Cleverly, it manages to avoid being ""just another boring sub flick"" by breaking up the action between land and sea. A sensible move that keeps the viewers interest.On the downside the saber rattling is well past its due date. In my view this film and others like it, from any nation, are better off leaving the political messages on the shelf. That said, everyone does it ,so its not surprising to see the US taking the same approach.Watchable if you can see past the trite political message. 6/10 from me.",Hunter Killer

29,AudioFileZ,A Wooly War Game Scenario Becomes Real,7,31 October 2018,"In Hunter Killer the Cold War isn't dead. In fact it erupts. What you have here is a scenario whereby WWW III could become quite real...and fast. This movie plays it mostly smart over action, though it's tense with plenty of action. Put in an impossible situation the U.S.S. Arkansas submarine must find out what happened to both a U.S. sub and a Russian one. They both sank and it is thought the U.S.sub caused the incident. Nothing is as it seems as if a war game was enacted without stops. Captain Glass becomes, in short order, the line of defense when it discovers the whole incident is an internal Russian military coup.Submarine movies are a special and compact genre. Hunter Killer does not shame itself. The movie moves so fast that it's easy to suspend all reason for madness. This creates great tension to which the movie moves well with. It keeps the viewer engaged and, often, hanging on the seat edge. Is is plausible? Well, think of it as a war game with most of the stops taken out. In this realm it thrives. The story woven simply moves well enough as to simply be excellent entertainment that really doesn't insult. No action just for action's sake this is a war game come to life.I'd say this sub movie holds up to excellent true stories such as Das Boot more than it fails.

You don't scream at the man ""You just started WW3"", then 10 minutes later commend him. That is woeful writing. Also, Michael Nyquist looks awful. He only speaks a few lines.

(R)Instantly forgettable, by-the-numbers military actioner is a submarine thriller, Navy SEAL expedition, government coup drama, and war room chest-beater all rolled up into one. Butler is the new skipper aboard a nuclear sub that is drawn into a rescue mission on foreign soil after rogue Russian minister Gorevoy overthrows the powers that be; being that it's Butler, of course, it's a president he has to save (the Russian one, at any rate).

Meanwhile an unprecedented military buildup at the Polyarny Russian Naval base catches the attention of the NSA who arrange for a SEAL team headed by Bill Beaman (Toby Stephens) to go in and investigate. Once Glass reaches the site of the downed sub he rescues Russian commander Andropov (Michael Nyqvist) and when Beaman witnesses a coup by the foreign defense minister Zourov (Mikhail Gorevoy) Glass must form an uneasy alliance with Andropov to get into Russia undetected and help Beaman and his team rescue the Russian President.Based on the novel Firing Point by former submarine commander George Wallace and Journalist/Author Don Keith, Hunter Killer had a troubled journey in development and preproduction. Throughout its initial development the movie changed directorial hands multiple times with directors such as the late Tony Scott, Pierre Morrel, McG, and Phillip Noyce at one point or another being considered to helm the film. A version of Hunter Killer almost came out from Relativityand directed by GoldenEye/Casino Royale director Martin Campbell, before the company's bankruptcy ended up delaying production and tying the film up in legal hurdles. The rights were untangled by Millennium Media of The Expendables and the Gerard Butler action series Has Fallen and most likely wishing to solidify their relationship with the star helped to rescue the film. It's just a shame that with such a troubled and tumultuous journey the movie ends up being so underwhelming.Hunter Killer has all the pieces for a gripping geopolitical action thriller, but the movie has so many plot threads and characters that it never feels like there's any time given to establish relationships, personalities, or even letting the gravity of the situation sink in. We're told about characters and how they are personality wise, but we're never really given any scenes where these character traits are displayed because when the film doesn't have action scenes it's virtually non stop exposition. From the opening submarine battle to the 60 minute mark every scene is burdened with bulky exposition and naval technical jargon and it feels very much like we're getting the cliff notes version of the story instead of being allowed to experience it first hand. The movie's source book, Firing Point, is apparently 700 pages long and took a lot of effort to condense and while it does feel like we get a complete story all the weight and investment is missing.Gerard Butler was apparently attracted to the role of Joe Glass for being a tactical expert rather than a man of direct action, and while to a degree I understand that the movie doesn't really play to Butler's strengths. In movies like Den of Thieves, the Fallen films, Machine Gun Preacher, or even How to Train Your Dragon, Butler's biggest asset is the way he carries himself with brash intensity, here Butler never really gets to cut loose and works against his biggest strength basically being stuck behind a command console for 70% of the runtime. The movie also rather disappointingly has one of the final performances by gone too soon actor Michael Nyqvist, and aside from one brief moment toward the tail end of the movie he basically has the same issues as every other character in the movie where he's called on to espouse plot details and have has character talked about by others. It's a sad waste of Michael Nyqvist especially in a role that like many others in the movie is just so underwritten.The technical aspects are at least decently done, while some of the CGI in the arctic and the climax can look slightly under rendered, the action is staged reasonably well. While the movie is R-Rated, the violence in the movie is fairly tame (save for some rather telling post production bloodsplatter) but it's at least well established with good usage of spacial geography for gunfights and hand to hand combat.Hunter Killer is a middle of the road movie. It's competently made and has decent attention to detail, but it's overuse of exposition and technical details make for a rather hollow experience. Characters are flat and don't connect with the audience leaving you feeling nothing when they're killed at key moments and lack of established weight or context to events never conveys the tension that a movie like this wishes to provide. As it stands Hunter Killer is a bare bones imitator of films like Crimson Tide or Hunt for Red October but missing the commander characters and tension either of those films had.",Hunter Killer
40,MadamWarden,Massive disappointment,4,9 November 2018,"Honestly, I went to watch the movie based on the IMDb reviews. Sadly it did not live up to these at all. Terrible plot. Really not much originality. Way too many plot holes and ridiculous ""action"" scenes with repetitious inch perfect last second manoeuvres, underwater by a 40,000 ton submarine. Oh, and out-manoeuvring relatively tiny infinitely more manoeuvrable torpedoes every time. Later followed by machine gunners able to shoot down 4 missiles traveling at crazy speeds seconds before striking the sub.Aside from the ridiculous action, the ridiculous plot includes 4 US soldiers penetrating the defenses of a major military base deep inside Russia, carrying a few tons of equipment including scuba tanks! They then communicate on a frequency known only to the NSA yet miraculously they know to switch to it, whilst out of communication. They then record video and audio of the coup which no one thinks to communicate to the Russian authorities to avert war.The list goes on...

41,rockman182,Hunter Killer (2018),5,31 October 2018,"Gerard Butler. Somehow, in recent years he has become the go to guy for terrible b-list movies. Hunter Killer looked no different and the only reason I decided to see this was on a date and because I had already seen all the other wide releases. Still I held out hope that this film would at least be mildly entertaining and be aware of its own stupidity and run with that. That's not exactly the case with this film as it remains super serious. The good thing was that it wasn't completely unbearable. It's still bad for sure but at least it has some action sequences that were fun to watch. It's definitely not something I'm recommending at all though.The film is about a captain and his crew on board of a submarine called the USS Arkansas. This captain (played by who else but Gerard Butler) must investigate the disappearance of another American submarine. While trying to find out what is going on, the crew realizes that there is a mass coup going on amidst the Russians and their presidents. Butler and crew, must of course save the day as he enlists help from other operatives of his country. This film stars the late Michael Nyvqist and weirdly Gary Oldman is in it as well. Going from the Oscar to Hunter Killer, wow.The scenery in the film is great, and the action is serviceable but fairly bland. It's nothing you haven't seen before but it's one of the better aspects of an otherwise unremarkable film. A film about submarines? I'm just glad this film wasn't taking place entirely underwater and migrated to land action scenes as well. The villains are so cookie cutter and generic and the heroes are stoic and give that thousand yard stare of bravery. It's exactly what you would come to expect. I'm just mad this film wasn't as self-aware and just go with the cheese.I was hoping for Gerard Butler to deliver a dumb but profound one liner and there were so many opportunities for him to do it. Apart from all that, this is a film you don't have to ever see. I've done the job for you for some reason and it's too long and with little pay off. I think it's not as terrible as I thought it would be but that's still not a reason to catch Hunter Killer. I kind of hope somehow a sequel gets greenlit and it becomes a running gag, while going down in history as the biggest sequel no one ever asked for.5/10",Hunter Killer
42,bankofmarquis,Surprisingly good,8,3 November 2018,"Ever since he uttered the immortal line ""We Are Sparta"" as King Leonidas in the 2006 surprise hit 300, Gerard Butler has filled the screen with unadulterated machismo and virility. So I was expecting just more of the same when I went to check out the submarine flick HUNTER KILLER, figuring it was just a ""B"" action flick with Butler throwing up macho line after macho line and punching anyone who was in his way.But...HUNTER KILLER is, surprisingly, much, much more.Telling the story of a ""Hunter Killer"" submarine under a new captain that must go into enemy territory to check out the sinking of another American submarine, this adept action-thriller by South African Director Donovan Marsh is a pleasant surprise for only 1/2 of the film is about the action aboard the submarine, or the action back at HQ where a screaming Gary Oldman insists on less diplomacy and more aggressive action. The other part of the film is a very gripping, tense and exciting ""behind enemy lines"" war flick following the exploits of 4 Special Ops members (led by Toby Stephens) who must grab a person and then unite with the submarine.Color me shocked by this. While Butler and Oldman gave me exactly what I wanted, the Special Ops soldiers, the stakes and the action sequences are a notch above your every day effort. If you are looking for a fun action flick, that can easily pass a few hours on a rainy and cold Saturday afternoon, you could do much, much worse than this one.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Hunter Killer

Doubtless with that in mind, Donovan Marsh's ""Hunter Killer"" tags on several other aspects, most of which tend to give the film more scope and interest, if pushing regularly in the direction of implausible.However, the peak of implausibility is Butler on shore leave in a slightly-too-spectacular-looking Scotland (?) wondering about shooting a North American wapiti that has somehow found its way there (as opposed to a native Scottish red deer) ... and since that happens in the first couple of minutes, it's just got to be better from there on in; and it is!In any case, we're here navigating in that specific and presumably realistic territory of Cold Warriors being present (along with rational people who might intervene to stop them) in both Russia and America, and - here as in most places in which it occurs - this concept has its certain mileage, and in this case we even have a Russia that has done what Russia has done (in Crimea and Syria), albeit led by one President Zakarin - who has more hair than a certain well-known Russian leader - and is presumably sweeter than him (hence the invented name), but is likewise a bit of an action man as the plot develops (so I guess there's a measure of wish-fulfilment here).And, when it comes to avoiding all-out nuclear conflagration between East and West, the Russian President is prepared to be rational, and in that case ""our boys"" are prepared to break a few rules in order to allow him to be so - in the face of the activity of ""rogue elements"" in Russia, and also pretty much in the US - if we accept Gary Oldman as a hawkish US Navy type, who happily does end up accepting that war was best avoided.Oldman's character is a bit all over the place, but fellow Brit Gerard Butler does rather better as the Submarine Commander. He also has the chance to deal closely with a Russian opposite number played by the late Michael Nygvist in his last film - and that's sobering enough.To complete the line up there's a Navy Seal team headed up by a gruff officer who turns out to be kind enough - as well he might be given that this is another Brit called Toby Stephens, breaking new ground for him and doing so successfully enough. Poficient as the Seals are, one somehow wonders if a team of 4 of them can take on an entire Russian base, but at most stages of this portrayed conflict things go rationally enough, and here too we get a bit of help from a Pu..., sorry Zakarin, bodyguard who is prepared to help our lads in the interests of the greater good (of the planet).And so you see a bit how it goes (without too many spoilers), and it's mostly good enough. Indeed, while procedures don't always look too authentic, settings often do - the sub in particular. Presumably there was some USN assistance with all of that?Ultimately, in this film as in many a seafaring (or spacefaring) movie, it's the captain against captain(s), trying to predict the other's actions that makes the thing, and here too that is the case. When you're out at sea, the Pentagon decisionmakers are far off, and at times it's still the Captain's call.And I guess that's just how we like it.",Hunter Killer

Let's start from the beginning; if you liked HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER you will really LOVE this movie. If you did not you will love it even more because all the right elements are here but not dated.
The story is complex and is told from different sides as the good 80 and 90 thrillers used too. No superheroes here.
The complex script involves a few submarines destroyed in an attempt to hide a revolution; suicide rescue attempt and very complex maneuvers to survive for the many characters involved.
The acting is from very good to excellent; particularly from the late Michael Nyqvist who steals every scene is in and perfectly fills Sean Connery shoes and Gary Oldman and EGO free performance of a General who only caree about war but not to people.

The role of Butler was too subdued and no real tension was created in a story made for gripping anxiety.This is partly due to Butler not playing Mike Banning but Captain Joe Glass, a different character. Film editing was also not in the same class. But fear not Mike Banning will be back in ""Angel has Fallen"", another action-packed film soon.Understanding the above, one becomes sympathetic for Butler's performance in this still enjoyable movie.Update: I was able to see this film again from another source and the audio mix was much better and speech could be heard properly.

Nothing felt believable enough for me to care about. This also packed quite a run time, so by the second half I really got bored with it since the story was as predictable as it was stupid.The production looked and felt like a TV series from early 2000s, with CGI being barely tolerable yet chroma key effects were so poorly made and lit so at times it felt like you're watching a streamer acting in front of a green screen.The acting was bad, Butler was mostly chill and relaxed and Oldman was overacting most of the time. It felt like Common was the only one who actually cared and tried. Nyqvist, sadly, looked really tired. As for the other cast, I can barely distinguish one from another.I still appreciate some casting choices though, like casting real Russian actors to play Russians.The end credits indicated that this movie was dedicated to Michael Nyqvist and John Thompson. I liked Nyqvist's performances and some of the movies Thompson has produced are my favorites. I really hope that the intention to finish and screen this movie was mostly fueled by this idea of dedication.If so, I rate the intention - 10/10. The movie itself was 4/10 at best. If you want to see an ok submarine movie, watch ""The Hunt for Red October"" (1990), if you want a better one, watch ""K-19: The Widowmaker"" (2002) or ""Crimson Tide"" 1995.

I bumped up my rating of the flic in his memory.The cast, Gary Oldman, Gerard Butler, Common, Michael Nyqvist and a bunch of recognizable Russian actors all delivered good performances, none stealing the spotlight, which I appreciated.The synopsis would likely discourage movie fans to include 'Hunter Killer' on their 'to-watch' list, but the full storyline is a bit more hopeful while the actual movie was thankfully an easy to watch, fast pace action punctuated by the necessary hold your breath ""They're gonna die"" moments (hey, it's a submarine movie, it's a rule). Then the twists, the ""They're doing what?!"" and ""I'm glad I don't have to take decisions like that"" segments kept me watching until it was over. It could have been stretched a 15 to 20 minutes more because of the action on land, but whoever decided to cut the movie as it was edited, made a sound decision.",Hunter Killer

Commander Joe Glass (Gerard Butler) commanding officer of USS Arkansas, i thought for him as lead role he is really of great actor i can enjoy him in any hour of this movie. Admiral Charles Donnegan (Gary Oldman) iscommander and he is outstanding of performance he shows in this movie, Rear Admiral John Fisk (Common) is like good acting in movie nothing wrong with him in this movie he did really well. after Russians kidnap President Zakarin a Russian president. another bad military side of Russian Military. they take over base, Joe and his men found Captain Sergei Andropov, Commander of a Russian submarine (Michael Nyqvist) who is known for John Wick (2014), Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011), As It Is in Heaven (2004). he knows where Russian base where President Zakarin is he joined in to Americansubmarine side to help them to find president. another 4 military soldiers went to Russia to rescue the Russian president.

(Zane Holtz) known from dusk till dawn series was in this movie his character is a a brave and skilled member of the elite unit and with Michael Trucco and Ryan McPartlin also came aboard to play a weapons specialist Devin Hall, and an ex-SEAL and CIA medic Matt Johnstone, respectively. i thought the war scenes and action was so realistic as call of duty video game if you watch this and played call of duty it's like that feeling of it. i know people entitled to an opinion but come on what were they expect an Oscar-winning performance film? This is actually how a war style thriller should be and a well written one at that. well it's Oscar winning performance not every single film is going to be greatest film every this is a fun ride not a Steven Spielberg ride, this one hell of ride with full of thriller that keeps your mind awake keeps you curious this movie is worth it i hope it gets sequel.",Hunter Killer

59,stevenrotherforth,"Silly, makes no sense, but enjoyable all the same",7,27 March 2019,"Hunter KillerIf you can get passed the lunacy and the fact that this film makes no real sense then there is fun to be had with Hunter Killer.
It's a throw back movie to actioners of the late 80's and 90's era.
Gerard Butler seems to be the go to man nowadays for this kind of thing and I have to admit he is a likeable action hero.
Ok he may not have the muscles of Arnie or the charisma of Sly but he's still a solid act in a world of limp wristed action stars.Hunter Killer tells the story of Joe Glass (Butler) an untested submarine captain who is tasked with rescuing the Russian President from... well the Russians surprisingly.
Like I mentioned earlier this movie is a little silly but put this aside and allow yourself to indulge in the decent CGI and well staged action set pieces and this film suddenly becomes entertaining.
Sure you may need a six pack of beer and copious amounts of popcorn to help fuel the fun.
Think of this movie as a cross between any Submarine adventure made in the last thirty years with Lone Survivor and Olympus Has Fallen.
Ok it's not slick and sensible like Lone Survivor but the on land action featuring a group of soldiers tasked with getting the president to safety did remind me of that particular movie.
(Don't ask me why).Many critics have slated this film for its ridiculousness.
I however believe that you should just go along with it.
It's a no brain required movie. One that is easy watching. One that's never going to be memorable but it's fun while it lasts.",Hunter Killer
60,kgprophet,Pulp Military Thriller has decent Story,5,28 October 2018,"Although this is not a sequel to ""Olympus Has Fallen"" and ""London Has Fallen"", all the tenets of those types of pulp political thrillers are included. I have a weakness for pulp military and political thrillers. Authors Dale Brown and Tom Clancy (and those writing under his moniker) made hay selling novels about political intrigue at the highest levels. Clancy specialized in Russian (then Soviet Union) adversaries and books like ""Hunt For Red October"" made for good military yarns. This movie was based on a book ""Firing Point"" by George Wallace and Don Keith. I especially have a weakness for submarine movies, even something goofy like ""U-571"". One other reason that this movie got me out of my house is that this is the first real action thriller of the fall of 2018. The first one with a real budget since ""Mission:Impossible: Fallout"". (""Venom"" was released in the fall but is not a thriller like this movie).Gerard Butler is not exactly the same character as those previous ""Fallen"" movies, but doesn't stray far. Except this time there is no daughter, or any love interest for that matter. There are no scenes of Gerard talking about his daughter as the world is on the brink of armageddon. Leave it to a fleshed out thriller novel to be the basis for a relatively coherent plot. A Russian coup has kidnapped the Russian President (obviously a civilian leader not the current KGB leader), and want to convince the world that the U.S. has started a war with Russia. But protagonist Butler commands the USS Arkansas submarine and has great instincts about plot twists he may encounter along the way.I rejected both of the ""Fallen"" movies; the first movie because of some over-the-top sequences, the second movie because of the stereotyping of Arabs as villains. But since they were made to be action movies, there were plenty of scenes of fights, explosions, and mediocre CGI to keep the pace rolling. In this case, I could recognize the 'beats' of a pulp thriller, which will throw some new twist in the story every few pages to make the reader want to keep turning the page to see what will happen. So there certainly is enough depth to the story to keep it plausible and exciting. But that doesn't mean the film meanders into mediocrity once in a while. The film focuses on a coin Butler hangs on to. It's a coin with the name of a previous boat he was on. This whole coin thing pops up a couple more times, but sorry it just seems a little corny. Also there are moments of heightened tension that feel a bit over-the-top as the filmmakers push things just one step beyond credibility. Which is too bad, because this film could have been comparable to ""Crimson Tide"", but the acting just doesn't make the cut. Some atrocious acting comes from Carter MacIntyre as the XO. His character is a bit one-dimensional since all his lines are critical of Butler's decisions. His delivery seemed insincere when he was tries to be angry and excited.There are a good number of supporting characters, and most of them are adequate in their roles. Gary Oldman is a name moviegoers recognize, but he has too little screen time to make any long lasting impression. Michael Nyquist comes off the best as a Russian Sub Captain. Although he has few lines, he feels like a sober and intelligent man who can express himself effectively non-verbally. Another standout character is the head of Navy Seal team Toby Stephens. Although he is given horrible dialogue, he carries himself well. The group of Navy Seals adds a relative dimension of realism, making adroit moves to achieve their mission. It seems at times the bad guys fall into cliche by shooting thousands of bullets at them without ever hitting anything, but in truth there is some sacrifice, creating real sympathy for the members of the Seal team as they understand that they could be on a suicide mission.The bottom line is that although this film has relatively wooden acting and some slightly over-the-top moments, it is coherent action movie with enough story to keep you watching.",Hunter Killer

However, it was very good and anyone with a brain should be able to see that if the story was accurate, it wouldn't be a good movie. Would a passage to a submarine base really be mined so heavily to the point the subs would scrape the sides or bottom, or have sound mines? Even if say, all Russian subs passed over water, wouldn't the underwater passage be impassable with no gaps?Anyways, this was a solid movie from start to finish with great acting.

68,ginocox-206-336968,A bit contrived,5,17 December 2018,"Hunter Killer (2018) asks the question: Can diplomacy prevail over armed conflict, even after shots have been fired and both sides have incurred heavy losses? The answer seems to be: Anything is possible, if the screenwriters work from their hearts without overtaxing their minds. But don't expect it to make much sense. It's not diplomacy that prevails so much as inaction and the conceit that we're sufficiently smart and knowledgeable to somehow predict the actions of others.The premise has a lot of potential, but it's fully exploited. Rather than developing themes of trust and mistrust with a healthy measure of deception, duplicity and ulterior motives, there is instant trust between adversaries who have every reason to mistrust one another but believe everybody really wants the same outcome. ""We're not enemies; we're brothers.""The cast is excellent, with Gerard Butler, Gary Oldman, Michael Nyqvist and Common, but they are underutilized. Butler and Common spend much of their time posturing, while Oldman rants and raves. Caroline Goodall, who played Qualen's (John Lithgow) sociopathic gun moll/pilot in Cliffhanger (1993), appears briefly as President Dover, a younger, trimmer version of Hillary Clinton, in case the muddled screenplay fails to convey the filmmakers' underlying political message. Linda Cardellini plays the smart and confident female CIA analyst who knows more about warfare and geopolitics than all the guys who have spent their lives playing soldier and has a security clearance higher than a rear admiral.Production values are excellent, although marred by excessive use of jiggly-cam shots which shatter the audience's willful suspension of disbelief and remind viewers they are watching a movie. Some of the best shots look suspiciously like stock footage obtained from the Navy.The most effective scenes are the action sequences involving a Navy SEAL team. The action is implausible and seems better suited to a movie with an exaggerated cosmos of reality, such as The Expendables, but is more believable than the scenes that are supposedly more grounded.",Hunter Killer
69,joeyford-55342,Good story well told with a few funny missteps,8,29 October 2018,"Yes, sometimes it is bad when the audience laughs at stuff that isn't supposed to be funny. This movie falls down in two places, first they should have gotten a Navy SEAL to help with technical stuff because they made some laughable mistakes. The SEALS were using white flashlights and headlamps that could easily be seen for miles at night. Actual operators use a red or green light that doesn't travel. Secondly, when they cross a bay they can be seen running on the floor of the bay instead of swimming, making any military person or diver in the audience howl at the ludicrous scene. The other huge mistake was casting Common as a two-star Navy general officer. I guess Whoopi had a full schedule? Haha. This guy is a rapper who stands for everything liberal and wrong with the left, but they have him playing a war hero. Remember Trayvon and Brown? Those were both criminals that a long, painful and expensive process showed to be thugs and Common led the fight against that truth. And now they cast him as a two-star general, the top 0.05% of the military. Several times in the movie they call him a ""war hero."" It was laughable -- the audience had a collective groan when he came on the screen. But, all that to say that the Butler and his other supporting cast does a great job. The head SEAL, the team of operators, the sub crew, the Russians. Everyone is believable and compelling. The plot moves along nicely and keeps the audience engaged. This is the type of movie where nobody leaves for the bathroom until the final scene is done! As a retired USAF officer and American I would highly recommend it. It is ""Hunt for Red October"" lite.",Hunter Killer

83,mgruebel,"Sub-par? Naw, it's OK",6,3 February 2019,"I like Gerald Butler. He plays in action flicks like Olympus/London Has Fallen with just the right level of tongue-in-cheek to make the improbable plots enjoyable nonetheless. If Roger Moore had been as good at it, the 70s and 80s James Bond films would all be classics.Hunter-Killer is in that vein: Not to be confused with serious sub films like ""Das Boot,"" or Robert Wise's drama ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" (1958), but a fun one-time watch with a beer and some friends.The story is pretty straightforward: Evil Russian defense minister Durov wants to start his own Private Little War with the US, and to do so, takes the Russian Premier hostage, blows up a Russian sub, and then sinks a US sub to create a fake incident. In comes Gerard Butler as Captain of the Arkansas, who rescues Captain Andropov from the blown-up Russian sub, and then gets him to cooperate to rescue the Russian Premier, get the bad guys blown up, and generally save the world from World War III.The movie features four deftly interwoven story lines: The Arkansas, a crack team of Seals dropped into remote Russia to extract the Premier, the story around Durov, and the story in DC where generals tussle about who's making the right calls and who's not. One of them is Gary Oldman, and actor I first saw as the villain in ""Fifth Element"" and really like. He does a good job here as Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff making life hard for Rear Admiral John Fisk (played by rapper Common!).Everything in this film is professionally done, so it's easy to give it a 6. Where it falls short is in predictability and some badly chosen and improbable plot elements, generally introduced to create fake tension in slow-moving parts of the film. Really good films don't need to do this. A typical example among many: the first officer of the Arkansas loudly confronts his skipper in front of the men when Butler decides to recruit Andropov's help to make it through a mine field. I'm not a military expert, but I hear from my friends in the service that this would never happen. If Number One has a misgiving, he'd take it up with his Captain in the ready room, not in front of the enlisted men. Like in ""Star Trek The Next Generation,"" when Picard pulls his first officer off the bridge whenever the two have a little disagreement. (Star Trek generally gets this stuff right.)So this flick must remain in the domain of predictable action fare, congenially written, directed and acted, but not rising above a fun ""B"" movie worth a single watch. 6/10.",Hunter Killer

This was a movie that showed the tremendous burden of responsibility that officers have upon their shoulders.

They find their missing sub on the sea bed in Russian waters and it's not good news...it's got several holes in it and all crew are dead.Meanwhile a military despot has kidnapped the Russian president and this could lead to war...the US send a team out to rescue him and at the same time the rescue sub is briefed to go get them. It should be simple but another Russian submarine and a warship all get entangled along with the land team and the kidnappers and all hell breaks loose....Overall a great thriller that's busy start to finish and well worth a watch,Hunter Killer
91,ghcheese,Damn good story,8,30 December 2019,This was a really good story. The acting wasn't the greatest. But the story was good enough to look past that. I would recommend this for watching. Maybe wait until the kids are outside. They may not understand it and kill you with questions you don't want to answer when your watching a good movie.,Hunter Killer
92,Fudge-3,A formula adventure drama,7,21 October 2018,"Rogue military element kidnaps the Russian Premier and tries to start world war three. Special op' US forces are sent in to the rescue.Dialogue and character setup is very contrived. Most of the time the actors make good on a ropey script. Parts of the movie have a rushed look, there are continuity errors and some of the green screen shots are very unpolished but mostly it's OK.Good action, I particularly enjoyed the sub' vs sub' scenes. Not much threat or tension. There's lots of shooting and explosions. The on screen physical violence is moderate. Little in the way of bad language. No surprises.It's like a movie that has been sitting on the shelf for thirty years and they finally released it. I kind 'a liked it.",Hunter Killer
93,Svenstadt,Poorly attempted B-level actioner,3,10 April 2021,"This movie is fairly poor, even by Gerard Butler standards. There's not nearly the level of jaw-dropping action you would expect. The worst part is that, for military buffs like myself, this seems to be written by some 5th grader. The plot seems juvenile, childish, and overly simplistic. Gary Oldman and Common were given some very bad dialogue for their characters to work with! Neither of the previously mentioned actors did a very good job. Common was just basically reading his lines, and this is his worst acting job, even worse than Terminator: Salvation!! This movie leaves you with absolutely nothing to think about in the end. Pardon the pun, but this film is shallow. Much like Solo: A Star Wars Story, this is a movie to watch at home when you're not paying much attention some afternoon!!",Hunter Killer
94,Dr_Mark_ODoherty,"Great American-Russian film, promoting peacebuilding between those two fine nations.",10,7 February 2021,"I like this film, as it promotes good relations between Moscow and Washington - and that America will always stand by Russia's side in the case of an emergency.
At least that is my view on the matter of international policy - and I hope that President Putin will see it likewise - so that peaceful political reforms, rule of law and democratic freedoms can commence in Russia.
Also, for those viewers who are not so familiar with submarine naval strategy, this film gives a good insight what kind of stuff a US submarine Commander can do. :)",Hunter Killer
95,timeblank,Very Intense In it's Action and Political Story!,9,28 October 2018,Military/Political action thriller. Gerald Butler does a great job. Russia is having leadership issues and their minister of defense tries to start a war with America! While he does that he overthrows and kidnaps the Russian President.American rescue op is on the ground. Now they have to rescue the Russian President before World War 3 begins. What I loved was Gerald's Sub rescues a Captain from a Russian submarine. The Russian Captain helps them out.The most intense scene was their sub being guided through Russian Captain and they are in a mine field. The obstacles was intense! Did they survive? The only way is to watch the movie! Enjoy!,Hunter Killer
96,tkarlmann,Don't believe the 'critics'; great movie!!!,10,5 January 2021,"This film was way, way above average. The story was tight, and you never knew what was coming next. Gerard Butler has this habit of starring in films that I REALLY like.The interaction between the Russian and the American forces in this film, always skirting war, is incredible. This is far from those old WWII-era weapons, ships, armaments, etc.This is DEFINITELY worth your time to view this film.",Hunter Killer
97,Caleb_Everett,"Decent, but has a few flaws.",7,14 March 2019,"I went into this film thinking it was going to be a Hunt For The Red October rip-off and it really didn't feel that way, but that's isn't necessarily a good thing.Overall I thought the movie was pretty decent, it had moments of entertainment and then moments where I was scratching my head. First off, they never really give any backstory to Gerard Butler's character, we know for a fact that he didn't go to Annapolis. We also know that he has worked ""every"" job on a submarine and he makes it known that he can probably do the job better than most of them and that he was on the USS Wichita...which apparently was a bad thing. I mean wouldn't the U.S. military send a submarine with a crew that knew each other? Instead of finding a guy who is spending his free time hunting?Aside from that, Gerard Butler does a pretty decent job, I'm not going to say that just because his intro was questionable that he shouldn't have been in it, they should have just come up with a better introduction for him.On the sub-plot of the team that's on the ground...why did they send in a team that seemed like they were still in training? I understand that three of them are seasoned veterans, but this ""Preventing World War III"" type mission probably would have been sent to an already trained team. Not to a team that still is training a guy and who has never performed an operation of this nature. I could go on and on about that subplot, but I won't.The positives of the film are that it was entertaining and definitely has tense moments, on a personal opinion I always appreciate the movies that can take two separate sides and create a bridge between them. The work of binding Butler and Nyqvist was definitely entertaining and I think that the movie actually resolves very nicely.I would probably watch it again, I know I harped on a few points, but it really is an enjoyable movie if you can get past those.",Hunter Killer
98,gerry_barnaby,Solid performances in a well writen solid thriller,9,20 October 2018,"Reading some of the reviews for this film just boggle the mind, I know people entitled to an opinion but come on what were they expect an Oscar-winning performance film? This is actually how a war style thriller should be and a well written one at that.This film takes it time to build up the tension, it does it well especially when thing start to build up you get a sense of world war 3 is about to happen, it all starts with a simple unknown attack on a Russian and American sub, from there this film kick in to overdrive and the tension builds between the Russian and American naval feet that give you a real sense of something bad is about to happen..What we're given from this is an edge of your seat Suspense thriller that a cross between Hunt for Red October and Black ops neal seal mixture in this story with a solid ground movie that believable and intense throughout.The film keeps the audience entertained as well as solid performances from all involved in the film, this is the best thriller ive seen in a while, especial when you have season actors like Gary Oldman and late Michael Nyqvist (R.I.P) who never got to see this film hit the cinema, who sadly passed away last year June 27, 2017, at the age 56.As wartime, cold war era type of films go this is really good, not only with it cinematography with underwater shots of the submarines with great realistic CGI with tension build ups trying to run silence with the sudden moment that could put them in hot water really adds tension which gets you engaged in the film.When you put Gerard Butler in the right role he shows just how much of a good actor he truly is, with a solid performance from Common and Linda Cardellini with Oldman with his brilliant acting with a dynamic flair, Hunter-killer is a must to see if you love thrillers.",Hunter Killer
99,svhot,Good intelligent story told in a thriller style,8,23 October 2018,"Hunter-Killer is an intelligent action thriller. It features the story revolving around a potential threat of World War three. The movie begins with attacks on American and Russian submarines. The Russian president's life is in danger, and American navy officers team up with their Russian counterparts in order to save the Russian president and eliminate any possibility of World War three.This movie has a decent story and screenplay, good direction, and intense performances. The action scenes are also nice, although some CGI experts may claim that the sequences could have been more refined and polished. I loved it anyway. There is a lot of explosion scenes, and the submarine versus submarine scene was really outstanding.
The performances by all actors were great, but Gerard Butler and Gary Oldman really stood out and shined greatly.",Hunter Killer
100,seanhmoss6,Crimson Tide 2,8,7 July 2019,"I have no idea how I never heard of this movie! It is a fantastic watch. Between the score and the gripping tension, it reminded me very much of Crimson Tide. There are even two characters named Weps and Cobb. However it has quite a bit of The Hunt for Red October mashed into it, but does not in anyway feel like a ripoff. My only critique...not enough Gary Oldman. He has a sizeable role no doubt. Definitely watch this movie!",Hunter Killer
101,nightringer-76840,It Should Get Better Title,6,30 December 2018,"Is this a good movie? It's improbable, illogical, and a silly ending. Once the American submarine went to Russia, the story went down south way to far. It's like a bad rewrite of The Hunt for Red October in reverse. (Personal note: even the soundtracks have similar style)Is it entraining? Absolutely. The actors try their best to rise with what they have. The movie's action scenes were tight and exciting. Unfortunately, I would say that Hunter Killer should be categorized as B movie and should go directly to cable or streaming TV.Lastly, Hunter Killer is clearly the wrong title for this film. They should just called it ""The Day American's Submarine Saved Russia"".. At least audience will know what to expect.Additional note, This eas Michael Nyqvist's last movie in Hollywood. He looked old and tired. For those who enjoy Millennium's Trilogy, he played Michael Bloomqvist. He also played memorable villain in John Wick.",Hunter Killer

Hunter Killer trailer is going to be popular since it is played on screen every time we are watching a Hollywood movie in the theater. So, first of all, I am quite surprised that the movie is strong enough to wake you up, because the trailer already speaks the whole movie and everybody can guess the ending. Nevertheless, the finest acting of Gerard Butler, the cinematography, the editing result, the special effects, and the complex plots still entertain your brain, as well as having have fun to watch that kind of movie right now. We are in the middle of negative peace and without any guarantee that there is no big war. Big war is coming every 100 years old, especially within superpowers. In this story, there is big main plot for American soldiers to save Russian president, who is under coup d'état. But my critics goes to the main story that is going to simple despite the complex plots, well perhaps there is some reasons why the countries chosen is still USA and Russia, just like old-minded style of cold war. It will be more interesting enough if there is some coalition between countries, but I like the way Director heat up the situations, even though there are too many coincidence that we called ""typically Hollywood, coz it is USA that is becoming the hero"". We can still appreciate this movie because submarine war movies is not so many created these days, so at least this movie can awaken up about the awareness of the marine threats, the condition of American marine soldiers and of course the submarine ships, and also the defense policy in high risk situations.",Hunter Killer

107,n-mo,A passable waste of time,6,29 December 2019,"'Hunter Killer' is entertaining enough, in the vein of geopolitical action thrillers à la Tom Clancy. The problem is that it's so heavily derivative of Clancy's line that it comes across as a cheap knockoff.Nor does it help that, in 2018, this film should feature a homely old blonde woman as America's president as the troops rush to rescue the moderate Russian president against a warmongering military coup from his own. It seems to be some sort of desperate appeal to the afterglow of a ""Greatest Generation"" civic nationalism, though I'm not sure whether it's meant to try to offer an olive branch to the fake-cosmopolitan left to accept this otherwise typically jingoistic Hollywood military fare, or an invitation for the heartland to turn on Trump and get back to America's valiant liberal international mission. Either way, it's an eye-rollingly un-subtle ploy, and yet for precisely that reason it is highly amusing. (What's less amusing is the knowledge that this idiotic level of human intelligence is at work in the American ""intelligence-gathering"" apparatus every bit as much as in Hollywood.)All that said, the performances are about as decent as they can be for such a wooden script and the production values are top-notch. The film at least does a great job of putting us in the action, even though said action takes quite some time to start up. If you want an action movie with more of a human element that ""stays with"" or inspires you, you're better off checking out 'Midway' or even 'Hurricane' (aka 'Mission of Honor'), which granted do have the advantage of being based on non-fiction. For a quiet evening in, this one will do you just fine.",Hunter Killer

The graphics and detail are pretty good, yet slightly unbelievable at times, but good none the less.
The acting was fairly decent and you warmed to the characters relatively quickly.
I still can't stand Butler and his American accent, but I can look passed it due to the fact that we probably won't get another sub film worth watching for a while.

113,feyipuk,Military compassion wins the day,7,7 May 2021,"It's a Gerard Butler film; you expect lots of military machismo, highly improbable scenarios and last moment escapes. It may not be as deep as Crimson Tide or have Gerard running around as much as his Fallen films, yet all the other parts are there to make this an enjoyable film. Sure, for a film that's based in the real world (as opposed to, say, a superhero film) there are plenty of parts that require the suspension of belief - it's a Gerard Butler film, it's pretty obvious what'll eventually happen, and most of the critical scenes are included in the trailer - which actually helps the story, as you're wondering what's going to happen next.It won't appear in Gary Oldmans top ten, and he barely gets to express his full range of emotions, and if anything, seems to show his age. If anything, I was more distracted by Adam James; twenty plus years after Sharpe's Regiment and he's still a Captain. Common seems the most energised command officer, and his reactions drive the Washington based scenes. Adding to the UK contingent in this film, Toby Stephens is a suitably bearded special ops lead, playing the part Butler usually would. And that's because the Captain here has to show a more restrained, compassioned approach; as with many similar films, the opening scene sets the tone for the character, which is a shame, as the bad guys are suitably creepy but fortunately not that menacing.The CGI and cinematography are decent, if forced; they're all well lit (even scenes you'd expect to be dark) and for a film shot primarily on a sleek Hunter/Killer sub, they never feel claustrophobic.",Hunter Killer

📜 Plot : An untested American submarine captain teams with U.S. Navy Seals to rescue the Russian president, who has been kidnapped by a rogue general and wants to start another world war between America and Russia.
.
.
👨‍⚖️ Review : Hunter Killer is a modern day Cold War Thriller which packs a punch.Gerard Bulter as Joe Glass, the U.S Navy Commander of the Submarine USS Arkansas is the lone wolf and has played characters of a witty, smart and brave leader who fights the battle in the seas. While another team of US Navy Seal led by Toby Stephens do the groundwork to rescue the Russian President who is kidnapped by a rogue russian chief of army. Oldman plays the cranky US Admiral Charles Donnegan, Chairman Of The Joint Chiefs Of Staff who wants to wage war and believes Glass's mission is doomed to fail.The movie though adds itself to the list of another America saves the Day Movies but has loads of entertainment value for its audience. The Claustrophobic tension within the marines , witty decisions made by Glass being in war zone, the gripping action pieces of the Us Navy Seals on foot make this a class action package if you don't consider its originality in storytelling.Donovan , director of the movie drives this movie into gripping scenes with visually enticing VFX. Great entertainment and a Perfect movie for a Weekend.

I have to confessed I really enjoy the underwater battles, it's eye catching. Nice popcorn movie. I only watched a few military thriller before, I like the submarine fighting, but the plots are so illogical and unrealistic. Characters are not charming, the acting is like deadpan.ps.

And yes WAY TO MANY talk in this movie and so bland action scene. I just want drop it and go watch Operation Red Sea or Sky Hunter or Wolf Warriors 2. Its pretty sad for Hollywood.
Also its a pure cheesy fantasy, do not think in a second that this is a serious action movie about war. I don't know about USA army, but something like this NEVER can be happen in Russia. Scriptwriters be lazy not only with names, but at all aspects of russian culture. The even can't do subtitled russian speech - generals, president and commanders looks like some english-speaking elite that speaks exclusively on english among themselves and repeat command in russian for they russian speaking slaves - only when they can't understand them. Its looking so stupid and lousy. If this was something like democratic propaganda for russians - just kick off your writers and send for guys who write Homeland scripts.

124,BiiivAL,Mission: Save the President. Again.,5,10 November 2018,"It seems that Gerard Butler has the idea of fix, which regularly makes itself felt the last few years: he wants to save the presidents from critical situations. ""The fall of Olympus"", ""the Fall of London"", ""Geostorm"" vivid examples. And all would be well, if not for one thing but: the final product is always the most primitive, cliched and, of course, serious schah. ""Hunter Killer"" successfully (if that word is appropriate here) continues the appropriate number. Probably, I would pass by this tape, but here the trailer threw the interesting fact: this time will rescue the President of the Russian Federation.Director's chair took almost debutant Donovan Marsh, previously put only the infamous dilogy ""Malek"". One of the producers (and how differently?) and the lead role was played directly by Gerard Butler. Surprisingly, the script of the film was adapted: we have a screen version of the novel ""Point of fire"" by George Wallace and don Keith about the rebellious Russian Admiral, who planned to start a new world war.First, I would like to talk about the plot advantages of the picture, because they really were not template, and even burning, relevant. First, despite the fact that I do not like when politics and cinema are mixed in one bowl, ""hunter Killer"", in principle, not bad broadcasts the idea of the most favorable in the future relations between Russia and America: we are talking about cooperation. Secondly, the creators of the Ghost, but still visible hints make it clear that the feud is not the country, not the people, and the political elite, the powers that be. In General, the social and political message is timely and correct: thank you for that. An interesting nuance: replace Russia with some, for example, terrorists and movies will lose all meaning, will be very bad. Praise also deserves a cheerful ending: the long duration of action-Packed smooth dynamics, explosions, shootings: nothing innovative but a catchy. In the end, however, a little tired, but still the denouement works.But no matter how good the film is in the above, the disadvantages here, I think, outweigh. Open the standard set of typical gaps, which became boring to the viewer utterly, and find there: devoid of reason episodes (killed scene verification Russians lair American task force); a decent number of conventions, taken on faith; pathos of all the cracks; the General atmosphere of what is happening does not allow to consider the tape as an artistic canvas, with the degree of politicization is very high; pseudo-characters. Regarding the latter, it's not just a blank sheet of paper, which I forgot to prescribe the internal filling of history and the adequate explanation (please note that Admiral Durov), it went further: the Russian-speaking heroes among themselves mostly speak English (!), and the President of America, successfully following a feminist bias-a woman. It seems a new peak of craziness has been reached.Technical design can be noted for the well delivered action scenes, and which blended depressing music. From the cast most impressed me now the late Michael Nyukvist (one of the last roles), charisma and facial expression which speak more than words, from the Russian brotherhood remembered Mikhail Gorevoy, has a powerful negative energy. Gerard Butler almost the entire film goes with the same facial expressions, and appeared in a couple episodes of Gary Oldman here, rather, to attract audience.""Hunter Killer"" - a passable creation, which I would not recommend to go to the cinema: believe me, you do not miss anything, passing by another Butler save the world and the President at the same time. With a strong desire, you can always wait for home viewing.PS the curtain of the hero Gerard can hear the elegant and hardly a deliberate reference to the iconic words of Dominic Toretto from the ""fast and Furious"".",Hunter Killer

Captain Glass is assigned with the task of searching for the U.S.S. Tampa Bay which has fallen off the radar, unsure of its conditions. The U.S.S. Arizona teams up with a Seals team assigned by RA John Fisk (Common) who assigns Glass with a second mission, to rescue the Russian President from the hands of a rough Admiral Dmitriy Durov, and to over through a Coup.

126,gluonpaul,"Fine movie, not without its flaws but enjoyable",6,21 October 2018,"So I think this movie can be described pretty quickly as solid, predictable but perfectly fine.The acting was very competent and Gerrard Butler in particular did a good job which, considering most of the movie centers around him, makes a big difference.The script had a fairly generic plot line although I liked the fact that some thought had been given to logical reasons for all the people to end up where the script wanted them to be. The scripts main flaw was its character writing. Some of the people felt cartoonishly dumb and 2d, for instance the XO behaves in a ridiculous way throughout never listening to the captain until he 'learns to respect him' at the end. Similarly the admirals back at base also act like cartoonish ideas of warmongers right up until the end when they 'learn to respect' ideas other than blow everything up.Those flaws in the characters are not enough to be funny but also not enough to detract from the basic action.

The problem is that it is directed from the man who gave us Spud and Spud 2. No, I don't remember hearing anything about those films either.There is not an ounce of suspense or action in this film. Everything is cliche. The acting, script, photography and direction are all mediocre. Watchable, but nothing else.Sam Fuller said that if you don't engage the audience in the first fifteen minutes, then you will lose them. Ten minutes into the film I wanted to leave the theater.

The marines are doing there best and everyone is acting is a rational way. Even Gary Oldman who initially you are thinking is a bit crazy, makes perfect sence when he screams what he is thinking at a critical point of the film, and suddenly you understand every decision he makes.
Its up against some compeition with the Oscar season starting this week, and it was already down to just one showing a day. But if you enjoy intense submarine war films, like Hunt for Red October and Crimson Tide; check this one out as its put a smile on my face from ear to ear!",Hunter Killer
130,Hillius,Major Disappointment,4,11 January 2019,"I was very much looking forward to this film. As a fan of previous submarine/political/international thriller type films including The Hunt for Red October, Crimson Tide, U-571, or even Das Boot (original) I was thinking it was about time for a new good sub flick. Sadly this was not the case here.I try very hard to be as forgiving as possible to low budget films, films where there have been complications, & the occasional underdog movie, but I cannot think of one redeeming feature of this film.If I have found one thing to be truest lately of Hollywood films it would be that the more stars a film has, the worse it is going to do. That was the case here, just as it was in the disaster that was Everest. Even if you watch this film for a favorite actor the person only has just a few bits of screen time & most don't use it very well.I don't know that I've ever seen a film with absolute zero backstory or any sort of character development of any kind. Here there are no lessons learned, nothing is solved & no one has any motivation for what they do. Personally, I've never cared for Gary Oldman (in general) but he seemed to spend almost every scene performing a very convincing temper tantrum while appearing a bit too small for the outfit he had on.Not only do they fail to provide backstory, but the film also did a poor job of identifying anyone, so in this disjointed uninteresting plot line there is a good chance you might get confused, but if you're anything like me you probably won't care enough to notice.Sadly this lackluster offering seems to be the new trend. Make a film as cheaply as possible, the cast list is what matters most, the script & the story arc matter least, throw in a lot of CGI & green screen and market it like crazy.4/10 & that's me being generous. It's a pity too, this could've been something great. If only they'd had a decent writer. This feels like something a 3rd grader would make fun of.",Hunter Killer

Thing is, much of today's audience doesn't much care for these types of movies and storylines. Only people like my dad (in his mid-60s) can appreciate this, for whom I put it on for in the first place. And I was right. It was right up his street, as an entertaining action movie like those of old.
Personally, I'm a whole lot more critical and do not understand why Gary Oldman agrees to play in so many forgettable movies lately (is his agent that bad? Oldman used to be versatile and kinda great. Has his agent seen him in True Romance? And other stuff?).
As for Gerald Butler, I also want to blame his agent. If recent roles like Den of Thieves and The Vanishing are anything to go by, then he's also better than these types of B-movie action flicks.",Hunter Killer

That having been said, there are a lot of ""really!?"" moments. So be prepared to suspend disbelief right from the get-go. Gerard Butler carries the film admirably, as he always does, here with little or no fanfare, also as usual. One has to wonder why Gary Oldman - Oscar-winner and rightly much-lauded actor - had to take the role of the resident ""p...k"" - loud, boorish and obviously the ""villain on our side."" He does these roles well, but surely he must be beyond them by now. The part wasn't really a starring role (although second-billed) or even very important; it didn't even get that much screen time. And Linda Cardellini, so wonderful recently in Green Book, mushmouthed most of her lines. This couldn't be fixed in post? But those complaints are minor.

How many stories have been done about a rogue general trying to start WWIII? I can't count how many but suffice it to say that most are better than this dreck. And there are so many illogical and inconsistencies I lost count but here a few:1. Apparently people can be shot and immersed in freezing cold water and are then ""patched up"". After being ""patched up"", they can fight as good or better than highly trained and healthy soldiers.
2. Again, people can dive in to freezing cold water that would cause hypothermia in about 30 seconds but are just fine after several minutes.
3. Russian submarine commanders wear dress uniforms during normal tours and they wear medals from the USAF (including the good conduct medal and the AF commendation medal).
4. While looking for a hidden transmitter, highly trained soldiers shoot up into a tower and then discontinue looking for no apparent reason.
5. And why Russia - the current Russian president is likely to start WWIII on his own!And Gerard Butler cannot seem to find a good movie since ""300"". I like him but Gerard you have got to find something better. Only recommended for a rainy day with nothing better to do.",Hunter Killer
145,tom-456,It might as well have been a silent movie.,4,20 March 2020,"An interesting plot to be sure, and well done except for one thing. From start to finish the actors all whispered and mumbled. Continually. ALL of them. I kept having to turn it up so I could understand the dialog, then turn it back down again whenever gunfire or other effects entered the scene. I just don't like watching any movie when I have to hold the remote control in one end. The director is obviously oblivious to the need for the audience to understand the dialog. He isn't going to be winning any awards until he figures this out, because one thing that award-winning movies all have in common is that the dialog is easy to understand. Movies where this is not true never, ever win awards. This movie has similarities to ""The Hunt to Red October"", but if you think about that movie, and put yourself in the audience and watch it in your mind as you first watched it either at home or in a theater, you might notice that the the actors did not mumble or whisper. Every word spoken by Sean Connery was intelligible. The same goes for Scott Glenn, Alec Baldwin, and Jams Earl Jones. Every word that any of them spoke was easily understood, with no particular effort. And if you think it over, you will notice that with ever movie you ever saw that you really liked a lot, you did not have any problem understanding what the actors were saying. This falls squarely on the shoulders of the director. Even if it is the sound editors that screw it up, it is still the director's responsibility. It is sad, because were it not for this problem, this would probably have been a really, really good movie. Did Arnold mumble when he said, ""I'll be back."" I'm pretty sure he did not. Did Charlton Heston mumble when he said, ""It's people. Soylent Green is made out of people!""? I think not. Even when Brando spoke in that thick accent with his cheeks stuffed with something in the Godfather, you could still understand what he said, because he still enunciated. Good actors enunciate. Bad actors do not. Good directors tell the actors to enunciate. Bad directors do not.",Hunter Killer

For example, the plot, acting and editing reach 1980s levels of improbability. An historical event which never happened nor was actually told is used as the only background for the main character and the action happens at a time of year when there is snow on the ground in Scotland but not in Siberia. What time of year is that?The characterizations of the sailors and Pentagon staff are utterly appalling. The Russian baddies are bond villains.Also, while the surface action is supposed to be happening in a fjord, it's all clearly shot in open ocean.This film's greatest achievement is getting to film a decent sized flotilla of super cool hardware.If you do like this film, you may also enjoy A Company of Heroes.

Gerard Butler was actually reasonably reserved in the film.Honestly, the CGI is the worst part of it. For a 2018 film, some of the CGI and blue screen effects for the sub scenes etc looked bad.

(short answer: It sucked! Thats' why.)Well, that really isn't a proper review, is it? I'm going to put the same miserable lack of effort into this review as the script writers did for this movie. Why did I ""hate"" it? Because the dialog was childish, insipid and ridiculously unrealistic. Because each action that occurred in the movie needed to be pre-explained through dialog, as if the audience was 1.) five-year olds or#? 2.) never watched a movie about military intrigue before- in their lives. And all of the slick cinematography, cool gadgets, high-tech military lingo and great sets simply can't make up for bad dialog and over-acted, melodramatic machismo. There were scenes where you fully expected the characters to continue speaking to one another, but, inexplicably, there was dead silence! Times when it actually seemed that the director was out getting a skim milk latte while the scenes were rolling.Finally-In the realm of great submarine warfare movies ( and you know each one of them!), this FLOP-OLA of a movie should NEVER be mentioned in the same breath and shame on Gerard Butler's agent for ever presenting him with this role.",Hunter Killer
156,deanocware,A very respectable submarine thriller,8,20 April 2019,As has been stated I do not understand why this movie is rated so low other than I suspect it is from people who are not into the whole submarine warfare drama. As a big fan of Crimson Tide and U-571 this movie really scratched an itch I have had for quite a while now. I thought the cinematography and action sequences especially the explosives were excellent. I also enjoyed the combination of the seal team mission with the drama playing out on the submarine. The only reason I am not reading the movie higher as I thought some of the casting was a little off. I had a hard time excepting Common as an admiral. He did not seem old enough to be an admiral and just seemed out of place the whole movie. I thought Gerard Butler did a decent job as the Captain of the Arkansas but I had a problem with him trying to cover up his Scottish accent. I also thought there were a few holes in the plot such as how they were going to get the sub back through the minefield even if everything went as planned. However none of it was significant enough to spoil the movie as a whole. The funny thing is something very similar to this almost happened when Boris Yeltsin was president of Russia. I could easily see the US having gotten involved in helping to defeat the coup attempt made against him.,Hunter Killer

OK, i get it, the yelling, the klaxons, and the loud jarring noises are there to ramp up tension and adrenaline - and that would be appropriate in most other action/war situations - but NOT here. It's called ""silent service"" not klaxons service.And don't get me going on the plot. The script seems to have been pulled out of an 80s time-capsule. The ""rescue"" plan they concoct is suicidally dangerous. Hundred times less risky, not to mention much more effective, would've been to post the surveillance video on the social media (or release to the press).

163,yasiru1991,Exciting and Full of Thriller !!!,9,30 December 2018,This movie is certainly underrated according to my view and deserves much better overall rating between 8 and 9.Story line is not complex but it has twists and turns which the audience will not anticipate. It creates such a great excitement and thriller feeling in the minds of audience. Entire story looks real and not very difficult to swallow in hence we can bond with the story really well unlike more fantasy based ones. I would rate this story 9 out of 10. Really Intriguing and full of fire.Gerard Butler ( Captain Glass) and Common ( Rear Admiral Fisk ) has done a massive part in creating very curious & thrilling scenes and action sequences. They have contributed with one of their all time best performances to the success of this film. Gary Oldman is a very senior actor and has a not so complex and lengthy role. But i feel he has not done a real justice for his character.Donovan Marsh is the director and he has not came into my radar before. But he has done some work before but I feel they are not kinda breakthrough masterpieces. But he has done a scintillating job in Hunter Killer and has produced a real good movie. This should and will be his finest work of art up to date. Well done Donovan.VFX effects is the key part which has added icing on the cake. I really appreciate their work as I did not receive any fringe moment where my attention was distracted due to Audio or Video effects.,Hunter Killer
164,jwpicton,Potential - trashed,5,1 November 2020,"Ok, the plot is a little far out but has potential for a reasonably good political/military thriller. However, the amount of nonsense throughout the film is at best awkward, and mostly just dissapointing. There are just too many in this film to warrant that depth of review. There are a number of technical fails but the thing that erked me the most is the 90210 type gossip and bickering on the sub. All the situations they encountered should have pretty clear protocols; it was a ham handed attempt by the film makers to create a tense, dissenting atmosphere between the captain and his xo - and was completely off the mark.
The rescue is a completely ott but fun. (NO WAY that guy could be in and out of such cold water in full gear for so long).

Many of these ""reviews"" are just marking the film down without even mentioning anything in the movie. I suspect they are fake. This is a reasonably big budget all out big star action movie. Severe acting chops are not required and in that respect the actors did a passable job. Yes the Russians jumping between Russian and English when conversing was odd... But how do we know that wasn't something the studio and not the producers demanded? If you rate it down for just that you're an idiot. Other than that little gripe this is a pretty solid testosterone based action film. We also thought it was a bit unlikely US Seals would be able to get so close to a Russian Naval base, but they could do that surveillance from satellite/drone. That however would not move the story forward so we let it slip. All in all a pretty good bigger budget action movie, the likes of which we don't seem to get many of nowadays.",Hunter Killer
171,sagniknath,Dated but worth the ride on the submarine,7,6 November 2018,"This really isn't as bad or generic as I expected it to be. Simply put,this is the type of movie where, if you leave behind a few of those proverbial brain cells ( or maybe ALL of them) prior to viewing, you are actually rewarded with 2 hours of some good entertainment.
The most intriguing aspect is simply how much of an anachronism this movie is in terms of the release date. The script felt like it was written at the very least 20 years ago, when post Cold War fever was still around, before 9/11 came to change all of that drastically .
The ""Russian"" actors don't even make an effort to hide their American accent. However, this actually makes the movie even more amusing to watch as an artificial time capsule from the late 80s /early 90s. The suspense revolving the submarine battle scenes were indeed cliched but they still managed to make it not boring. I am happy the plot was kept very matter of fact instead of wasting time giving characters sappy back stories.
If you grew up in the '90s watching Cold War themed submarine movies like Red October then , and if you want to watch a movie to blow off some steam, this movie is definitely for you to be enjoyed as a fun nostalgia ride.",Hunter Killer

It wasn't perfect, but it was as good as it gets for this type of film. Well done! Gerard Butler played the role of the submarine captain with gusto and suave. Actually, the entire cast did a fine job in their respective roles. My only complaint is for Gary Oldman, who was under utilized in his role. While it was predictable, no surprises, no twist and turns, and had situations in which required your suspension of disbelief, it was completely entertaining, had my heart pounding and still left me with a sense of hope.

What are you looking for, sitting in your chair playing some high-end movie critique?
This movie had a great cast, with some good and renowned actors.
It had a good bit of everything. Naval warfare, ground combat with some good and correct tactics.
It had a bit of political goodies, and some nice warfare/Pentagon scenes.
So, what are you wannabe movie critiques looking for, really?
People. If you are looking for some good old nice action, you won't be disappointed.
Don't listen to all these wannabe critiques!An addition to my review.
Some movies are seen once, and never again.

191,dogmaticdogs,Has Some Real Highs and Lows,7,27 October 2018,"I thought the acting was great, and the underwater cinematography was awesome. Finally a movie that made the viewer feel they were actually at sea during a conflict rather than just watching models floating in a bathtub.I guess the only thing that irked me was the following:1. The movie preached loyalty to those that have your back over your superiors and politics. I agree completely with that message, but it was so pervasive and force-feed that it removed a sense of realism from the feel of the movie.2. Gerard Butler was portrayed as a superhero rather than a human being. They showed him as having zero flaws and never making a mistake. When faced with difficult decisions he always chose the right one which resulted in the best outcome, regardless of his chances. I think all great men and women have some darkness and mistakes in their past. Since Gerald had none, it removed some much needed depth and complexity from his character, and again diminished the realism.Both of these flaws had more to do with writing than the great work of the actors involved.",Hunter Killer

Everything is made to be competent and nothing else. How's the other actors, they're fine, the story: average at best, action: competently shot, the characters: mostly bland. Nothing is awful but nothing is good. Not a bad movie, but not good. Just stick with hunt for red October.",Hunter Killer
193,MartianTom,Good start.... but then it continued,2,1 March 2019,"I really had high hopes for this, having seen the high rating on iMDB and also noticing that Gerard Butler and Gary Oldman - two of my favourite actors - were in leading roles. My reservation? That I hadn't heard of it. I have a pretty good sonar for films, so I wondered why this one had somehow been missed.I realised why after about 40 minutes in. The premise was promising, the acting was good, the script seemed sharp and witty.But then it was as though someone else took over the writing. And they paid so much for the lead roles that all they could get for the rest were second rate amateurs (Michael Nyqvist aside - RIP).The tension went out of it after that, and it became a by-the-numbers B-movie. You always knew what the outcome would be. I found myself saying 'coup' about ten minutes before anyone else seemed to realise. And as soon as one of the Seals came out with the line 'This could turn ugly' (a line repeated with monotonous regularity), I lost it.I was hoping for something like Crimson Tide. Instead, I've seen better episodes of Thunderbirds.Not really worth it for me.",Hunter Killer

This movie is so underrated and ignored, but it's a solid movie that holds your attention throughout.

197,metztex,Surpisingly solid...worth watching,8,31 January 2020,"Bottom Line Up Front: Plot is different from other, moves along nicely, acting is good enough to compensate for some bad dialog. Worth watching if you like military suspense films. Not as good as Red October but it is the best ""silent service"" film I have seen in quite a while.Don't understand why this got so many bad review. Granted there are some bad scenes in this one but to be me it does not detract from the main theme of what military officers are trained to do. (I know, I was one). Think on your feet and complete the mission to fit the big picture. Maybe the ""haters"" all think military personnel are stupid robots that don't think. If so, they need to know that military officers are trained to think. Otherwise, the negative reviews are a mystery to me. Look past that preconception when you watch this film.Plot is not recycled like many other films out there nowadays and this was refreshing. Plot and character development moved along along nicely and did not drag on the film. Cinematography was decent and effects were above average but not top notch. There were only a few areas where it detracted from the film. There were a few scenes that were unrealistic like a Sea Wolf/Virginia class sub having trouble with depth in a fiord. Not likely. The LA class and the Aklula class could take that shallow depth (even a WWII sub could take that depth with no sweat).",Hunter Killer

Pax Americana had some creditability before they decided to switch on into ""boss mode"", which is after the collapse of the USSR. All that cr*p was glorified in so many Hollywood flicks and many folks around the globe were kind of enjoying the show and even trusted the narrative about the ""mighty warriors"".

199,vandykeu,Drek,2,15 February 2019,"Confession: I LOVE submarine movies, and I really wanted to like this, but it's just bad. It's clearly meant to be a navy recruitment ad, sort of in the vein Top Gun was decades ago, but the plot just doesn't make any sense, and is totally manufactured drama. The initial sub battle is an ex machina that does nothing but alert the Americans to the fact that a coup is taking place and give the Russian captain a convenient excuse to board the Arkansas- it doesn't actually have anything to do with the coup.Gary Oldman's character is awfully written. Manufactured drama.Then there is the SEAL team... which is basically Lone Survivor re-hashed.And then the submarine scenes themselves have no authenticity whatsoever. The lingo isn't correct. The tactics/procedures make no sense. It's just awful.To top off the list, the special effects are worse than those from Crimson Tide or Hunt for Red October- 20-30 years ago!",Hunter Killer

The drama with Gerald Butler is as you would expect, a bit hard to swallow, I am not sure as to why he still gets roles.The plot as a whole, is pretty hard to swallow as well, it is more of an action flick, rather than drama based, even though the action is pretty lacking and is a bit laughable when it happens such as when bullets are fired into the water, and they carried on as if fired into the air, bullets just do not act like that when fired into water.You could knock this movie all night really, and judging by the goofs and others section, this has a lot of incorrectness just for effect thrown in.A 6.5 more so than a 6, but not a movie that I would pay top dollar for.",Hunter Killer

Perfect good old action - so relieved to come across this kind of movie with no ridiculous romance that has nothing to do with the story and no self-absorbed characters with a drinking problem and a teenage son that hates them for it. A proper hero/war/extraction movie where you like the characters for what they do and how they act and you know nothing of their personal life/issues - thank God for that!Very entertaining and although the end is predictable I was glued to the screen the whole time and loved every minute of it. On top of everything else it was shot beautifully and it had me google all the places they mentioned in the movie to see where they are on the map. Will definitely watch again in a few days.Ignore the reviews that complain that this could never happen in real life - IT IS A MOVIE.,Hunter Killer

But you will not have the same deep level (not pun intended) as the past submarine movies.Gerald Butler is OK but not as action type like Liam Neeson. I have seen worst from him (Gods Of Egypt).

While I'm not sure about Gerald Butler as the captain of the Arkansas, he did an adequate job. The movie suffers from some Hollywood dramatizations of the interaction and perceived (in front of the crew) insubordination of the ExO. He would've done that exactly once in reality before being confined to his cabin. You never challenge the captain in front of the men unless you're staging a mutiny.
The action is good and the tension build-up is well paced too. Some original ideas and scenarios were a pleasant inclusion. Gary Oldman was wasted in his role as the Commander of the Joint Chiefs, who seems to need to yell to get his point across.",Hunter Killer

However, the film is a no go, and the mistakes in it, are quite frankly, kindergarten level. The whole picture is based on the hypothesis that a coup takes place in Russia, and the Russian president is being held ransom by the minister of Defense and his men, who are trying to force WW3.
But despite the fact that pictures from an elite US commando group show the minister keeping the president in captivity and executing in cold blood three men of his personal guard, no one thinks to transmit that footage online, or simply provide the Russians with proof that their leader is held in captivity.
On top of that, they're trying to keep the suspense alive by pointing out that there is no way to inform anyone of what is happening. After a point, I kept on watching just for laughs ...",Hunter Killer

Hunter Killer is action packed from the start and brings to in a totally practical way a scenario that generates your interest. Without any twist and turns, the movie makes it so real that nobody knew what they were doing. It was just a matter of making one choice at a time and hoping for the best. The film gave more meaning to being prepared and using your memory and skills to prove yourself with results.

I went to see it over this past weekend and oh boy. They were not kidding and absolutely right. The movie is worth your time and seeing it on big screen. Non-stop action. 2 hours and 1 minute flew by like there was no tomorrow and I never for a second was bored or looking at my watch. But above all, you get a glimpse into US submarine. The movie is definitely worth your time.",Hunter Killer

He is the old war dog who can't see past the cold war and want's to kill all commies and press the big red button without thinking, I suppose every war movie has to have one though.

Hunt For Red October, Das Boot and Crimson Tide but well worth a watch",Hunter Killer

245,maskygen,It could off been good,3,23 January 2019,"But instead, we got atrocious dialogue, wooden acting and a horrible script.
What I loved about the movie, it's the story. It could of been a real thriller, WW3 is about to start, underwater warfare, attack submarines, the works.But what we got instead, is unrealistically scenes, a plot no ones understands, about a rogue Defense Minister, who wants war because he is Rambo? Undetected sub is following russian sub and is detected and sunk. We have a coin. Special forces squad is parachuted down on one of the best defended island by a cargo plane. Special forces got really close, nobody is watching. Best way to search for someone is shooting randomly and buildings, then leave because for certain they are not there. All the movie is like this and on top of that bad acting, dialogue. And the CGI, they didn't have it in the budget to rent a copter. Everything is CGI but not the good CGI, a little bit over a B movie in quality.In the end is just a missed opportunity.",Hunter Killer

248,mshackletonchavez,Starkly Average.,5,1 December 2018,"A rather by the books standard action feature. Of course, when one strolls into a late 2010's Gerard Butler film, it is what one expects, but in this instance, the entire film feels 'standard'.All the jokes are normal, the characters are plain, the action is fun, the plot developments are just fine, the music in standard and forgettable, the cinematography is fine. And all these things, are not necessarily bad, there all just average, like as if they just did a 9 to 5 job and called it a day. It is not cold or hollow, it has its moments, but they are artificial. Its as if there was no passion from any of the actors or the crew. It is all just fine, its not bad, its just all fine.This is extremely uncommon for a film to be. It is so unimaginative, but it is executed in such a competent fashion that it is not inherently flawed, all the methods work. Nothing stands out, as good or bad. Gary Oldman tried, but it seems as if the director gave no encouragement. This film feels like such a product, like Kraft Cheese Singles, you love 'em or hate them, but they're the standard.This film therefore is so middlingly average, it is actually in intriguing how they made such a constant result. It does what it says on the tin, this film is perfectly passable, but nor is it anything more than that, and neither is it bad.Therefore I give it the highly standard score of 5/10, for it is a proven recipe, which works, but is nothing more than that. The film is so stylistically static, its just a product, just 'movie', nothing special at all, but not bad at the same time.",Hunter Killer

It could have been better but overall director and the believable cast managed to make a good movie with 60 million budget. If movie had more money to burn it could have been much much better. The special ops soldiers looked believable and Mr Butler was ok captain, thats the problem everything was just ok, there was nothing there to elevate this movie to the classic status like Hunting the red october/ air force one etc.
When they showed fleet movement they must have used some old footage from documentary or something as you could see sailors dressed in ceremonial uniforms on one of the ships and it totally ruined immersion for me. Destroyer and some subs had CGI feel to them so not sure how was it possible to make subs more believable in Hunting the Red October than movie made many years after this classic.",Hunter Killer

The Russian president was kidnapped and Gerald Butler is sent as a American submarine captain to solve the situation.I liked the oppression atmosphere in the subnautica scenes and also how you can watch a U.S. Navy Seals team doing their job simultaneously to the boat crew.I also liked the shootouts in between the thrilling parts but in my opinion the movie would be much more intense with a runtime of 90 minutes, cause often the tension is lost with unnecessary discussions.Recommendation if you want to watch a solid thriller with some action parts and a high tension finale.Cheers,

Whomever wrote this movie deserves an award for their very near true to life depiction of how the Navy operates, how procedures on a ship actually play out, how things could theoretically really happen with special operations, and how higher ups in joint operations centers could really have their heads up their asses instead of listening to and trusting their subordinates to plan and coordinate what happens in the field. If you like military movies and navy movies in particular, this is the absolute best navy movie in a very long time.",Hunter Killer
266,paveltsvetkov,"Not a Comedy, but Funny Anyway",2,15 January 2019,"Wow, so bad... The storyline and character behavior defies human logic and viewers with knowledge of submarines will experience what teenagers refer to as ""cringe"" at several points through the movie. Gerard Butler, Gary Oldman and Linda Cardellini act with conviction, but there is only so much they can do with the absurd screenplay. The film goes from one cliche to another, and as usual in Hollywood thrillers, (almost) all Russians are depicted as physically repulsive and morally corrupt, or (at the very least) bearded alcoholics and weaklings, inferior to their American counterparts in every way imaginable. Russian soldiers run around in some WWII-style green helmets and have black uniforms that must have been inspired by the Wehrmacht. I do enjoy watching Gerard Butler movies, but I must say that his ability to select quality projects leaves much to be desired. The sheer number of propaganda pieces he has helmed in recent years is surprising, to say the least.",Hunter Killer
267,hydrocilator,Very enjoyable,10,24 March 2020,"If you like movies like ""The Hunt for Red October"" and ""Olympus has Fallen,"" then this is the movie for you.

I don't agree with all the negative reviews that have come in. It's a movie. I thought was good for what it represents. Okay, maybe not 100% believable, but all of the elements are there and well done. I like G. Butler, Common, and Gary Oldman. They did a nice job with all of the effects. I will probably watch this many more times. Not too many films lately that have come out, about the military, that have caught my eye more than this one. Just watch it for what it's worth.

270,briant-6,Solid movie but weak characters,6,12 November 2018,"I can buy into the premise of the film which makes for some great action. But the boat is the most believable character in the movie. Because for anyone remotely familiar with military standards, the actions of several key characters who fail to follow basic military protocol are mind-numbing.For example, the XO repeatedly challenges the boat captain's orders in front of the crew. The captain takes
unauthorized action in some instances that might result in court-martial, but when authorised from on high (absolving him of responsibility) to defend the sub, he doesn't do anything. And the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff reads the riot act in an uncontrolled, spitting rant to an admiral in front of subordinates.

279,kwq_e_500,Boilerplate action and caricatures of soldiers,3,31 January 2019,"I know it's got to be hard to come up with an original idea in Hollywood with the amount of pure crap that's being written hoping that someone will buy the script but if you're going to rip off someone else's idea, at least do a good job of it.The idea is one that Tom Clancy wrote in one of his many, many books about the military, the Executive Office directing said military and one aspect of our armed services that is the most popular - any kind of Special Forces. Basically this movie got enough wrong about those 3 aspects of our countries military that it became harder and harder to willfully lose, or at least suspend reality and surrender to the story.I won't give details but I will give one example - the men who serve in the Submarine Service are among the most intelligent and diligent people in any job - anywhere, doing anything. The XO or executive officer is the Commanders right hand man, and would NEVER call the Commander out in front of the crew, much less screaming and almost foaming at the mouth - his career would effectively be over and he could expect to be swabbing the toilets out for the rest of the mission and out of the Submarine Service as soon as the sub next docked - that's if he was lucky -he would most likely be confined to quarters.The Seal team was pretty funny too; in real life they would never try observing a target from the most open, obvious piece of real estate within 10km of their target and especially one with only one way to exfiltrate, and that one way could be closed down by a 10 year old with a BB gun, and the entire team would never lay all next to each other - that sort of made it hard to get into the scene.Many more examples but I will just say don't waste your money seeing it in a Theater, rent it but only after they drop their price from new release level to average war movie level.",Hunter Killer

When the Seal team is up on the tower and the Russians are looking for them they can see the Russian standing down on the ground through the metal grating they are sitting on but the Russian can't see them when the spot light is shining on the tower? Also, a submarine on a hard dive with a 40 degree bubble trying to outrun torpedoes pulls level when they are 15 meters from the bottom without hitting the bottom? A little unrealistic on that one.

It's chock full of submarine war movie conventions, square-jawed-hairy-forearm manliness, and cartoon characters masquerading as actors but here's the thing: it's a freakin' GERARD BUTLER movie, not ""Woman In The Dunes"". Stuff blows up real good, it's reasonably suspenseful from beginning to end, and the jokes just keep on coming....wait, check that; there is little in the way of discernible humor at ANY point in Hunter Killer. If they snuck a joke in, I was unaware of it. But stuff does blow up pretty good.Butler is completely convincing as the ships' captain who has risen from below-decks where he presumably started his career peeling potatoes and swabbing the decks, to his new job as commander of a nuclear submarine. In typical fashion with these things, his first day on the job is a doozy: before he's had his first cup of coffee in the big chair, he has to go toe-to-toe with a Russian sub under a frozen Barents Sea (submarino-a-submarino!) and then sneak into a Russian base and rescue the President of Russia from the clutches of his own Secretary of Defense. Crazy, right?While plausability does not really factor into all of this in any significant way, it's fun and it's a very handsome looking production, full of sweeping nautical vistas above, and bathospheric detail below the surface of the sea. Very enjoyable to look at. Did I mention that stuff blows up? Goodness prevails; the bad guy gets his comeuppance, but not before he has one of those ""uh-oh"" moments just before he's about to become one with the universe, which is always deeply satisfying. The good Captain finally gets the kind of street cred that he deserves, as his colleagues had been kind of iffy about him up til that point. I liked it!",Hunter Killer

I heard it got negative reviews (I'm guessing biased) and my suspicions were confirmed because this movie was actually very good. The plot definitely pays homage to Hunt for Red October (1990) and Crimson Tide (1995) with a splash of Lone Survivor (2014) which keeps it very interesting. You don't see the unexpected plot changes coming and what you think is going to happen (based on film clichés) doesn't happen which adds to the suspense. The modern submarine tech used and CGI were also excellent in that they weren't overdone and is believable such as the detachable mini sub piggybacking off the submarine (which was an experimental prototype in Hunt for Red October back in 1990) and the drone reconnaissance torpedo to augment the submarine's eyes and ears on search & rescue attempts:The only issues I found :Common playing a Rear Admiral (dude looks like he's in 30's) when achieving that military rank after 20+ years of service would easily earn you noticeable wrinkles & gray hairsUnnamed Navy SEAL team apparently being short-staffedGerard Butler's Scottish accent that always comes out to say hiAgreeing with several IMDB commenters, if you have actual military experience or are a military history/trivia buff, just turn off your brain and enjoy the flick.

absurd and illogic from the beginning, none of the characters questions their enemy motives and words and do what they are told without even thinking about their enemy might be lying??? How could the good Gerald from Scotland pretending-to-be-american lie??? Absurd!
Don't get me started on the submarine scenes which seems to have the complete array of sensors switched to active mode while running silent and manage to see the most detailed contour of the landscape underwater. There is then the point when they are sailing silent and they hit a rock on the bottom without setting off any of the ""sound sensors"" around them.
And the special team of morons attacking an entire enemy base with no intel support or even a plan of any kind, who are so lucky to meet russian superman who survives being shot in the stomach and being thrown in the ""balmy"" waters of Murmansk and spending the night on a rock outside. Somehow they manage to sneak in undetected, climb a building (which none of them could have guessed the president is kept in including Boris Kal El since he got shot Before the president was improsoned) and are so lucky that when they climb the "" lazy"" special Russian soldiers are having a tea break???? What the.... ???? Do you want more? Where did they get the scuba gear? Why are they merrily walking the floor of the bay underwater with ALL their lights on? Why there is no sentinels around? Why people on the bridge don't take cover when the sniper ( who somehow managed to climb a tree with a bullet in his leg) starts shooting everyone on the head? I could go on for hours on these...
This is one of the most ridiculous movies of 2018, down at the bottom with Predator... surreal to the point of being funny but spoiled by the aura of seriousness about it... Gerald go back to do innocuous semi funny romantic comedies and ask Gary to stop embarrassing himself shouting his lines in such a terrible waste of digital supports.

It is a blatant copy of The Hunt For the Red October but if you're going to copy, copy from the best. Not quite ""300 In The Ocean"" but way more tense than its predecessor, with a Seal Team to boot. Hunter Killer focuses on quick thinking, grizzled veteran sailors and special operators; where Red October relies on a cerebral protagonist working for the CIA.

A US submarine Tampa Bay gets vanished when it was trailing a Russian submarine in russian waters. USS Arkansas submarine was then sent to find out about it, which is helmed by Joe Glass (Gerard Butler) and they came to know about something else going on there. Movie is tight, with some class scenes, esp the scenes of submarine manoeuvres were superbly handled with just the right amount of thrill. And some of the fight scenes were also good.

This is a submarine flick that has everything you can expect from a submarine flick and the fragile nature of foreign policy, along with great performances from Gerard Butler and Gary Oldman.

320,puppypet,what a movie is supposed to be,9,11 February 2019,Today many movies are so twisted this movie is absolutely rock solid. If you're interested in submarines kind of a military movie than this one is perfect in its genre.It's not perfect but what is... But I will tell you I gave it a 9 of 10 because it is action and the cinematography is perfect. Not only are the underwater scenes absolutely flawless but even above ground the cinematography is amazing you feel like it's all really there laid out in front of you.It's not often I even like movies because Hollywood today is Holly weird and that's a fact but this movie is where it should be in the entertainment field. Anyway if you're looking for a fun evening watching an exciting movie please watch this you will not be disappointed. Oh and for the people that do give it a poor rating they're the ones that are probably wanting those twisted movies from Holly weird that I was talking about.

Made it 10 to offset the definitely too low score of 6.6 - what keeps it from a true 10 is some clichés, too extreme sub maneuvering, and the fact that a 10 should be reserved for milestones and masterpieces.You do not have to turn off your brain to enjoy this one, ignoring a few clichés. It's just well done all around, except for some microphone/voice work which occasionally makes it hard to follow dialogue. The squad action felt entirely believable and worth the watch by itself.

Hunter Killer kept you from getting up and going to the bathroom. The 3 dimensions of story line from the Sub, to the military command to the Navy Seal angle, the movie kept you entertained and even though you know good wins in the end, you still want to be kept in suspense.

The script is flabby, the movie predictable, cliched and very slow. I am normally a fan of Gerard Butler and love him in 300 and law abiding citizen but I would have to say in this he is lacklustre and a little wooden.

No way because it was i interesting even though ot was full of technical goofs. Goofs like alarms sounding, screaming & yelling when they were running in ultra-silent mode on the boat would never happen. And urs the story has been hashed over a few times aready and the acting from Oldman was way below his potential, overall it was an entertaining movie as long as you check your critical eye for details at the door. Just kick back and enjoys a couple hours of action that is done not poorly, not great, just entertaining",Hunter Killer

Gerard Butler is one of the best action hero's of this decade. I also really appreciated Toby Stephens as bad ass team captain Beaman .The plot is interesting with unexpected twists. I think the action is exemplary, with some really tense moments in the submarine. There were no moments in the movie that seemed painfully unrealistic to me.There was no political bias in this movie, which is also refreshing nowadays. The movie brings me back to the 90s where these kind of action movies were more common. Make sure to watch it!",Hunter Killer
338,rejackson-37077,"Surprisingly good, more than a submarine movie",8,8 March 2020,"I passed on this movie for quite a while. Another submarine movie would be just the same old cliches of things that can happen to a submarine. Finally decided to give it a try on a really boring day and I was happily surprised. Yes, many of the same cliches you've seen on every, single, movie about submarines. But that was just one storyline in the movie. The story on a whole was a fantasy but it tied together into a good story. The biggest fantasy was that the producers obviously expected Hilary to be president when the movie was released. Their blond female President was was a better looking almost clone of her. She's only on the screen for about a minute but word of mouth of the scene of her being in charge and making command decisions may have killed the interest of anyone who remembered Benghazi.",Hunter Killer

The acting is great, the writing is great,the visual effect is great, the dialogue is not so cheesy like other action/bad ass movie and most of all, this movie doesn't pretend to be Oscar worthy. It serve its purpose which is to entertain.If you like action/thriller/adrenaline rush kinda movie, don't let this movie slip past your to-watch list.

Maybe because of the stupid script, but i had like 15 times during any dialouge where i wanted to cry and shout ""And now? that's it?""I'll give you some examples:Any dialog between Buttler and the russian Captain. WTF?!? They were awful to watch. The russian captain moving his hands like a prophet over the map without saying a word ...The scene when the russian president realizes it is a coup ... omg the whole dialouge ... catastrophic.Overall, acting was bad. Dialouges were very bad, no tension creeated. No answers given, no questions asked ...The whole story ... Murmansk beeing infiltrated by ...no. It's just too much to write it all down.

Captain gives an order for down bubble and a crewmen confirms the order by saying up bubble, something that should have been fixed in post production. The other issue are the sonar men. Seemed like half the time they either did not have their headsets on, you know actually listening to sonar, or had one ear cup off. Did the actors find the headsets uncomfortable or were they told to act that way? I am sure people that lived on a sub in real life would find lots of other issues that I missed. Better direction, scripts, or whatever lead them astray, and the film would be much better.",Hunter Killer

349,EngineerSahab,"A Masterpiece, brutally shot down by hypocritical reviews",8,2 March 2019,"I believe all those critics out there who panned this action flick could not fathom the thought that normal human beings can pull off a heroic act. I guess they are cool with bunch of lab experiments saving the world again and again despite all the differences but when the same feat is pulled off by normal looking characters who happen to be well trained officers then it all of a sudden becomes outlandish.
Yes, we indeed have seen a lot of rescue missions but what makes this so different is that very few were pulled off by brave men from both sides (obviously enemies of each other by worldly rules) for the right cause. Off course this doesn't happen in real life, but seriously were you here to witness a documentary on war?
No offense to anyone but I believe there is a certain group out there lobbying against this guy, I don't know for what reason, but this surely is very unprofessional to allow your personal grudges creep into the professional front.There is nothing wrong with this flick except for the hypocritical reviews that made it a box office disaster!",Hunter Killer

Despite the cringe-worthy dialogue and terrible casting (Common and Gary Oldman) the film is very watchable. Actually you get 2 films for your money - which is good value right ? The first movie is a Submarine drama, full of dramatic under-sea rescues and torpedoes off the starboard bow etc etc. The 2nd story involves a 4-man band of Special Forces who have to rescue the Russian President from a Military coup. It's all very spectacular - the cinematography was excellent and the soundtrack stirring. A ""boys own"" adventure in the spirit of the '80s movies. Hoo Rah !!",Hunter Killer

Even high tech. for the team on the ground is impressive (yeah, what's a ""Tom Clancy""ish extended movie these days without a Seal Team running around; a testimony, I guess, for a need to water down a unique plot. Ya know, so current movie goers can understand it. Or, not as the mentality may be).
Even a good name cast, but then the current ""required"" interjection of PC comes off as created. Plot goes along, then have to insert the pant suit 20 something that never would be in a War Room, but... she knows. In charge (CIA? NAVSEA?) and shuts all the veteran admirals down because she knows how to adjust an end node on a computer site. Well, yeah, they're all older white males too so thus the required put down in current story format. (and the only person in the room she can relate to is the only African-American in the room... nah, can't be contrived... we're all supposed to be equal). As well as the female president that came off as only being inserted due to a Federal workplace law...not because of brilliancy, to boss the boys around.

I didn't expect anything of that quality and it wasn't. The script was anything but perfect and Mr. Churchill didn't kill it this time.That all being said, I admit that I did liked the movie for what it is.

Sometimes even funny when it should not be. Like a reindeer in Scotland together with ""bamby"" from Disney. Reindeer's do not exist in Scotland, nor do american deers. And they are sure as h.... not related as this movie suggests. :-)
The lack of knowledge is not only present when it comes to animals but expands also to submarines and navel Warfare.

The dialogue is weak in places but the story is fantastic. Lots of tense action scenes and suspense. The best thing is that it has a beginning a middle and an end, simple...no flashbacks, no confusion, just action packed and easy to follow.

384,marcd30319,Clancy did it better,6,15 March 2019,"The plot may be set in today's world, but Hunter-Killer feels like the Cold War never thawed out. The American nuclear submarine Augusta (SSN-800) is commanded by scowling Scottish actor Gerald Butler while the Joint Chiefs of Staff is chaired by the Oscar-winning British thespian Gary Oldman who chews the scenery and his fellow actors with gusto. Since this is Hollywood, there is a female U.S. President (Caroline Goodall) and national security advisor (Linda Cardellini) while Rear Admiral Common is channeling his inner Cory Booker. Throw in a top-secret SEAL team infiltrating Mother Russia while a couple of renegade Russian military officers led by a rogue Defense Minister is bent on deposing their matinee-idol Prez and you got yourself a Tom Clancy cocktail. Did I loved it? What's not to love! I really dug that old thriller novel by Keith Wheeler which I read when I was a kid. Or that old Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea TV episode ""The Exile"" with Ed Asner channeling his inner Beria. So if you have a couple of hours to spare and want to enjoy a white-knuckle submarine thriller, Hunter-Killer is your cup of grog. On a sad note, this was the last film for Michael Nyqvist. Rest in Peace. As an ironic aside, Nyqvist's chacracter is given the U.S. sub skipper's lucky piece at the end of the movie.",Hunter Killer
385,yabuturtle,"Entertaining movie. I don't get it, why is it hated so much?",7,23 May 2019,"It's weird because the people who do hate it hardly mention WHY it's stupid. Just that it's stupid. And that it's a propaganda film? Really? Is that what people got out of this? The russians weren't evil, they were led by an evil minister and they weren't incompetent why the great americans saved everyone. The russians on the side of the president helped win the fight here and they made peace? And why are people comparing it to Red October? It doesn't make any sense. It's not even the same kind of movie, other than having russians and submarines. I do wish there was more character development with some of the crew and seals teams but what I saw, I saw a pretty good movie. Entertaining and kept you on the edge of the seat. There were a few moments that were kind of hard to believe, but, like with Independence Day, this is where you will need to turn your brain off sometimes. I feel like people's complaints aren't really valid complaints, just whiny nit picks. I thought it was a pretty good movie.",Hunter Killer
386,mike-4416,What's wrong with these people?,3,19 January 2019,"As someone who watches all submarine movies and loves most of them, I was really disappointed to see Gary Oldman lend his name to this. It's the kind of movie that should have Arnold Schwarzenegger jumping out of the water with a machine gun taking on the Russians single handed. The acting is what took me out early, or maybe the submarine that handles like a Porsche. Or the rear admiral that speaks with the intelligence of Peewee Herman. Or maybe the Americans that cruise their sub right into the Russian naval shipyard undetected and take on the Russian conspirators. Good thing this US submarine crew was able to run in and take the president. Yes I thought with this cast it was a serious movie, it's not. It's a B movie at best",Hunter Killer

389,imdb-942-240064,"Love cold war suspense movies, especially with Subs, but turns out to be an average action film",6,20 October 2019,"Start by saying I love cold war Sub films. Crimson Tide, Hunt for Red October ranks up there with my top favorite movies. So I was really looking forward to this film but although good for a movie night at home with the family, was overall a disappointment. I would give it a 3 or 4 rating but I love sub movies.Positives: great underwater sequences -- who doesn't love action with subs navigating through dangerous waters and high suspense with torpedoes and modern equivalent depth charges and international intrigue.Major negatives: Who ever was the casting head did a terrible job across so many fronts, it was so stereotypical that it was cringe worthy. To start with, I get it that it is good to push past old stereotypes and cast women and minorities in leadership roles. But the black admiral just didn't cut it, his acting is really bad...they really needed an actor with serious gravitas and delivery, this guy absolutely didn't cut it (by the way I'm one of the racial minorities and his acting was just terrible). And then it is followed up with the very stereotyped, young, female NSA rep who pushes back on the old establishment (her acting was not great either). The icing on the cake was the Hillary look alike for the President who was just terrible (I'm absolutely not a fan of Trump so don't think is from a Trump supporter). The other major negative was the superman achievements of the 4 man special forces squad. I get it that is is just a movie but what they achieve is just above the realms of any realism (did they have any real special forces advisors on this film).I wish the makers of this movie would have watched Crimson Tide and Hunt for Red October a few more times to learn the lessons on how to make a less cringe worthy and a great cold war sub movie.",Hunter Killer

397,paulmclaren,Stinker,4,13 November 2018,Review - Hunter KillerGerard Butler stars in this Hunt for Red October wannabe which feels like a straight to DVD release.Some reasonable naval action mostly via submarine present but the acting is incredibly wooden and the film lacks heart.

Our hero, played by Gerard Butler, must fend off the insolence of his 'by the rules' colleagues, the insanity of a mad Russian general, and the idiocy of American politicians. Great underwater scenes along with some excellent rescue action from some special forces dudes. The only flaw (as ever) is with Gary Oldman's overacting.

401,sones11,"OK, everyone it's an action movie, not a documentary!",9,15 December 2018,"I'm not sure about all the negativity--it seems to be coming from 2 camps: 1) the anti-American crowd who believes America to be evil and doesn't like Russians (in this case, only some) being portrayed as such 2) The group that expects an action/thriller to be realistic.To the first group, I have nothing to say. To the second, I say, of course it's not realistic--what were you expecting, a documentary? Did you raise such objections when you watched the Avengers or any other superhero movie?If a movie is made to entertain and keep disbelief suspended for 2 hours, then Hunter Killer does both in spades. There is non-stop action from the first scene and it holds the tension throughout. Well worth my investment in time and money to see it.I will agree about the comments related to Gary Oldman's performance, though. This guy is a great actor, but for some reason he chose to play his role so over-the-top that you have to wonder how he became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. I would have pegged him for an angry and immature Seaman 1st Class at best, looking for a bar fight.",Hunter Killer

Some of the lingo was a little off the mark, but that's OK. Silly to insist on 100% authenticity. That said, I tripped over one gaffe early on in the flick that I should think would have been caught by the director's Navy liaison officer, assuming he had one. The CJCS's flag lieutenant was wearing her aiguellette on the right shoulder, which is appropriate only for presidential aides. The aides to admirals and generals wear them on the left shoulder. So much for nit picking trivia. As for the admiral acting as the CJCS, his manic behavior was badly scripted. No four-star officer would behave that way. Finally, I noticed one plot hole near the end. What happened to the Russian destroyer skipper after he was countermanded by the Russian sub skipper who had come to the rescue of the ARKANSAS? He just disappeared.",Hunter Killer

Boris VorshevskyBoris Vorshevsky is the President of Russia during Hunter Killer. It is said in one of the newspapers in Vladimir Makarov's house that Vorshevsky and other members of the Ultranationalist Party ousted Makarov from the inner circle. After the Loyalists lost the Russian presidential election, Vorshevsky and other moderate figures in the Ultranationalist Party felt that Makarov's presence would jeopardize the Ultranationalist Party from gaining the trust of the Russian people. They also believed that by removing Makarov would change the Russian people's perception towards the party, as well as distance other hardliners in the party from their violent past at the same time trying to improve relations with the United States and the Loyalists which were strained because of Makarov. Angered by his removal from the party, Makarov harbored a deep grudge towards Vorshevsky and vowed to destroy his government at all cost. Another news clipping inside his safehouse confirms this new found hatred, with Makarov vowing to kill Vorshevsky to ensure his betrayal would not go unanswered. After the events of ""No Russian"", following the presence of an American operative in that massacre, Vorshevsky reluctantly authorized a full invasion of the United States to avenge the deaths of their citizens. However, this decision proved to be disastrous later, as while Russian forces managed to surprise the United States, they suffered many disastrous defeats that resulted in him authorizing a full withdrawal.",Hunter Killer

429,bradkiefer,Scene at the beginning when Gerard is hunting an Elk - lol,5,19 January 2019,"My mouth literally dropped at this scene at the beginning where it shows him bow-hunting a Bull Elk in Ireland. There were so many things wrong with this I was dumbfounded:#1. There are no Bull Elk in Ireland. (Red Deer maybe, but no Elk which are indigenous to N.A.)
#2. At that time of year the bull would have most like shed his antlers already.
#3. He is hunting him with a recurve bow that wouldn't even have made it 1/2 way across that lake.
#4. When he is ready to shoot (LOL), it show a female and doe, so he doesn't.
#4a: Supposedly it's a Cow Elk and Calf, but nooooo, they show a whitetail deer and calf.
#4b: Worse, the fawn is like a month old still having spots that haven't grown out.
#4c: EVEN Worse, Bull Elk don't hang around Cow's (except in the rut), they have their own male groups, and in weather like portrayed the entire herd would have been forced to lower altitudes for food. They don't form FAMILY UNITS - OMG.7 things wrong within a 10 second time-frame. And that's just off the top of my head. Wow. Whomever was responsible for that scene needs to go back to school.I give it a 5 since the rest was just meaningless action that wasn't horrible, though the same lack of research and believability is present.Just laziness? Who knows...",Hunter Killer
430,kdstemmer,"Well executed, submarine war movie",9,30 April 2021,I just watched this and I have to admit that I was at the edge of my seat for the last hour of the movie. I have seen a few submarine war movies and this one is without a doubt one of the best I have seen so far. It depicts the tension of being caught under water really well. It has a few surprises and simply delivers. I thoroughly enjoyed it. A solid 8.5/10 rounded up to boost the average rating it has....,Hunter Killer

434,hotrican1976,"Story, great! Casting, meh....",8,9 February 2019,"A story true to the maritime war classics like das boot, Hunt for the red October, and Crimson Tide. The issue was character believability. Let me put it to you this way Common (yes the rapper,) was more believable as an admiral than Gerard Butler ever was as the protagonist Captain of the submarine. That's not saying much because common just looked like a rapper in cos-play...that said the storyline was great and the action sequences good enough to keep you at the edge of their seats.",Hunter Killer
435,dillonjeffers,Pleased!,6,12 January 2019,This film was good. It has lots of action and it even placed me on the edge of my seat a few times. The actor's gave their best.

436,jakemccoy-289-559646,Unintentionally Funny because it's so Horrifically Cliche,2,17 January 2019,"Take every testosterone-driven action film from the past thirty years, boil down all of the cliche ""hard-ass tough guy"" one-liners...all of the computer typed overlays like ""TOP SECRET NEPTUNE GLACIER MILITARY FACILITY: KYVEK, RUSSIA"" .....mix in all the obligatory military helicopter scenes where they're zooming over the water...... Add a solid dramatic Vagner-esq snare drum & french horn soundtrack....army boots running on various surfaces such as airplane hangers and steel platforms.....cartoonish CGI....To be perfectly honest, we sat down to watch what we already knew was going to be recycled material. But we were in the mood for an action film anyway.
But- we all started goofing on it less that five minutes into it. You just can't help yourself, it's so stupidly predictable. Everything.I think we lasted 35 minutes before we finally ran out of jokes. I cannot believe this has such a high rating on IMDB.
It must be people who didn't already see 1,001 identical movies over the past few decades.
After Das Boot was released there really was no more need for these types of films.I gave it two stars because I didn't watch the whole thing. Otherwise I'd just give it one. I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt.",Hunter Killer

The story is refreshingly original and not what I expected going into this. Overall a nice film to watch for popcorn entertainment. It's not perfect but fun and different enough to be worth a watch.

440,jose-viegas,Great War/Action Movie. Way better than I expected,9,27 August 2019,"Let's evaluate the movie as it is, a great action/war movie. Of course it's about Americans saving the world, but let's not put that into account The movie is well written, has great tension and action scenes and it keeps you waiting for what's coming next. And it's not because Russians are bad or that Americans are better. NO. Let's face it, if we come to a nuclear war, Americans and Russians for certain will be in the middle. They are part of the problem, so it's better they will be part of the solution too :). Politics aside, there are good guys and bad guys on both sides. The ones that want war, and the ones who want to avoid it. It's great war movie. Most bad reviews are just because they don't stand Americans, or because they find it clichet to have US and Russians in a middle of a nuclear tension. Ok. Does that mean if it was China vs India would it be better? The movie is great, and it's fiction anyway, so why bother with that kind of logic. Grab the popcorn's and enjoy it :).",Hunter Killer

Kind of deals that's basically selling your soul for an Oscar.Somehow in 2018, they found writers and directors that have seen one Hollywood movie ever. This copy and paste action movie is the battlefield earth of submarine/war movies.The paper thin overused plot tangles the story of a sub captain and some nameless baby seals.It's a constant back and forth of who shoots first between drab hard to follow dialogue. Everything is predictable and the amount of missiles in this movie add an unnecessary half hour that becomes annoying in the end.The cherry on top is the absolutely horrendous CGI every ten seconds. I'm talking PlayStation ONE game cutscene bad.Save yourself two long hours.Skip it.",Hunter Killer

It seems to pretent to be another Hunt for Red October or Crimson Tide, but it's nowhere near that level.I didn't find the Navy Seals even remotely believable. Just some guys acting like tough guys, but looking ridiculous really.The whole story is so far fetched and ridiculous that I just wanted to finish the movie to see how they managed to get out of it. But not that I was excited or worried for the heroes. It's just a bad script with bad acting and a very bad story.I know there are tensions between Russia and the West, but it's not like in the 'good old days' of the Cold War. Back then we could relate to Hunt for Red October (which incidently features Vladimit Putin as a character in the movie) or Crimson Tide.",Hunter Killer

468,dougk-8,Why the R Rating?,8,27 October 2018,"After looking at various clips and trailers, I assumed maybe it was going to be cussing that caused the R rating, but after watching it, that can't possibly be it. Wasn't sex. Wasn't gore. Can't even be violence. I've seen more PG-13 movies that made me regret taking the 10-12 year olds that were more inappropriate.As for the movie, everyone in our group really enjoyed it. (ranging from 58, 30, 17 and 11) Fun Gerard Butler movie - I was worried it'd be pushing an agenda, but if it was, it went over my head. (I know, there's always some kind of agenda (or message) but nothing that pulled me out from the movie)Was exactly what I expected from the few trailers - a fun popcorn flick that I didn't regret paying for to see in the theater.I don't know how it'll do in the box-office this weekend since the ads and previews were scanty and the R-rating surely kept more families from seeing it, which is a shame. Thumbs-up from this viewer.",Hunter Killer

471,austin-night,Surprised at how much fun this movie was,7,7 December 2018,"Based off critic's reviews I assumed it was going to be garbage (like the last couple of Gerard Butler movies I didn't like - Geostorm and Den of Thieves.) Today was rainy and it was still in the cinema so I gave it a try. Hunter Killer is the best action movie I have seen at the theater since Mission Impossible - Fallout. No kidding. Not equally as good or well made as MI, but the best since MI.Hunter Killer is an almost-great, suspenseful, fun, exciting, on-the-brink-of-war movie which is absolutely worth your time if you've even considered watching it but haven't yet. It was a 2 hour suspense film that kept me and the other few viewers in the theater (their enjoyment was audible) on the edge of our seats.No spoilers here, but understand that the majority of the movie takes place underwater inside a submarine that is trying to evade detection and avoid torpedoes, and it is quite effective at drawing the viewer in for a fun ride. Go see it. Or wait for streaming. Either way you will probably enjoy it.",Hunter Killer

It's extreme and punch-in-the-face American. Gerald's attempt at American accent is pretty laughable if you are a fellow Scot, but moving on from that...It's extremely predictable for an action movie, the cast is brilliant, however, Toby Stephens was a nice surprise. The plot overall is drawn out and again, predictable, for an action movie.It is a good watch, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it and a great weekend movie to watch with the family",Hunter Killer

Reality is that the movie under the eyes of a experienced navy or marine soldier maybe laughable, true is that the movie is made for a general public who doesn't distinguished a military condecoration of a specific army or country from a real one. The movie entertained me and my son a lot, and we were anchored to the chair for the whole duration of it. There are not many submarines movies to watch, and for the people who love them like me, this a nice welcome.
It's certainly not a movie of the same rating of The Hunt of The Red October, but not having any other one submarine movie to watch, this one will do until they make a better one.

It was a fantastic movie, gripping, no dull point, excellent visual, and some new stuff not seen before in submarine movies, thought that Gary Oldman was the wrong choice for his character, and he didn't really do it for me in his role. Apart from that small niggle, it was a thoroughly enjoyable and exciting film, will definitely be getting in 4K when it's released, to add to the submarine collection. Another Scot as a Submarine commander :)",Hunter Killer

This movie is with current technology and it was fun to see the insides of an American sub that looks authentic, though you know the general audience cannot really see the workings inside and actual one. The little squirrelly Soviet bad guy, (the green menace), was played a bit over the top, as was the destroyer captain. Still, it was a load of fun to watch.

Without giving spoilers, the film is well structured, has a very good story line and lots of action and occasional one-line quips that make you laugh.The underwater action in the submarine is the most tense, you actually hold your breath in a number of scenes. I was sitting next to a guy from the older generation, and it did make me think whether he was an ex-submariner!

A U.S black ops team is sent to rescue the Russian president and extract him via a submarine. Let that sink in.That being said there are things commendable in this movie. The action sequences are good and well executed. The pace of the movie is great, rarely a dull moment. The cinematography is excellent and for whatever reasons, there is academy award winner Gary Oldman in it (shouting a lot).It's like the Fast and Furious movies, you know what you're getting into.

I was pleasantly surprised to find myself on the edge of my seat through the action scenes. It was a fast paste film and the action started quite soon in the film.

That in and of itself made the movie a bit disjointed- as they tried to cram the three stories into a space best suited for two at most. But, they pulled it off. They even threw in a nail-biting moment, that had the audience holding its collective breath in a manner I haven't witnessed in a theater since Crimson Tide's (USS Alabama's) last EAM.With solid performances by Gerard Butler, Gary Oldman and Common- Hunter-Killer will hold your attention, even if you don't like military movies.

The Russians not only speak in English but also it doesn't seem like any of the actors can even do so with a believable Russian accent. This movie wanted to be the spiritual successor to the hunt for red October but fell flat. I think if it was edited to be 15-20 minutes shorter and focused more on technical details that made both the film and source material/book the hunt for red October more believable. Additionally the primary characters seem very flat and interchangeable. There doesn't seem to be much of any character development or nuance.

The beginning was a little slow and took a minute for me to understand the depth of it all but once it got going and started to make sense it was very engaging. This was my first submarine movie and i quite enjoyed it and have so many questions about subs, the intricacy of it all. Very action packed and suspenseful!. Most characters were very good.

Even in times of serious conflict with his XO, he doesn't lose his cool. He is a believable Captain and really leads this movie to exciting territory.All of the principal actors do a good job in this movie. I don't have any real negative criticism for the movie at all.

For all those people who's searching for a great military thriller that's engulfing you with big ships and explosions, this is it. And you even get a decent script and some good acting as well! This points to my point of departure; I don't expect much from these kind of movies since they're always overly dramatic, unrealistic, heroic and kliché-driven. But come on, once in a while everybody who's just awed by military capabilities has to watch a movie like this.With that said, people who aren't, will not find it as amusing as I did. It is purely for my kind of crowd: 15-40 year old guys with an interest in military and politics (yes, it is highly unrealistic, but entertaining, in that sense) who's watching a movie without their (female) partner.The 9 is to weigh up for all the bad reviews, since I actually think this movie deserves above 7.0 on IMDb.Sit back and happily waste 2 hours of your life on this one, I say!",Hunter Killer

582,mohsinkhateeb-469-400955,A Full on Action Entertainer not to be missed.,10,17 January 2019,This is my second review on IMDB.So keeping the review short this movie has lots to offer to all the action as well as thriller genre fans. Being a submarine movie this movie has action and thrill moments on land as well as under sea and under sea moments are marvellous.A must watch for all action as well as thriller fans.,Hunter Killer
583,itamar-c,Awesome action movie.,9,30 November 2019,"I rented this movie almost for nothing at a black friday television promotion in my country. Based on the trailer and some reviews I wasn't expecting much from the movie but as the rental was so cheap I decided to give it a try. But to my surprise the movie turned out to be excellent. Extremely well produced, great action scenes, good acting, good screenplay, one of those movies where you barely notice time passing.",Hunter Killer
584,halldormagnusson,Truly enjoyed it,8,17 February 2019,"This movie had all the stuff I want from an thriller. None of the characters came across as indestructible heros so the suspense was real. Reading the negative reviews, most of them seem to be politically motivated instead of an honest review of the movie. It's like a person who hates comedies but feels the need to leave a negative review of every comedy he watches. This was not even a clear cut American are good and Russians are bad, plenty of good and bad guys on both sides, just like in real life.If you are into war thrillers then check this one out.",Hunter Killer
585,philderosa1,Great action flick start to finish. Very entertaining.. Not a history lesson.,10,17 January 2021,"I've watched many movies in many genre's over the years, and action/thrillers are one of my favorites. This movie is head and shoulders above many enjoyable movies I've seen, equal to some of the best.
I've been streaming a lot just like everyone else this year, binging a bunch, and this week I started binging Gerard Butler's movies that he directed, mostly 6's and 7's. You see my rating. I don't usually rate movies. I do use them as a guide, and I don't let a rating stop me from watching something. I don't understand why this isn't rated higher. I suggest watching it, I think most people would not be disappointed.",Hunter Killer
586,kjelljol-1,Lousy background check,5,3 May 2019,"Just from watching the first 10 minutes you could tell that Hollywood isn't really worried about doing lousy background check when portraying landscape or scenery from other parts of the world. The Barents Sea nearby Murmansk is not a place you can see icebergs floating about (which by the way would tip around the way they were shown in the movie with far more ice above the water than under). Then a scene from Scotland during winter, where Butler is hunting with a bow? Come on!
Well, even though the movie starts with winter it's magical summer a little bit later when the special force task group land from an airdrop. No need to say, they are also able to manouver around without beeing detected on the Kola peninsula - the Russian North Fleet stronghold.I could go on. It's just sloppy. But I guess these shortcuts and errors are accepted in moviemaking, as long as the action weighs up for it.
The action is ok. Acting is ok. The great late Michael Nyqvist is credible as the sadden russian captain who understands he must help his foes. Toby Stephens suits his role and Gerard Butler, well he is okeyish. However the villain is to weak and underexposed as a credible treath. Gary Oldman is there just for the cover photo, as his role is badly written and he seems more interested in starring in his next project.",Hunter Killer
587,rpffds,Very disappointing about this submarine movie...,3,26 January 2019,"This is a moronic action jacked movie not for the the fans of ""Hunt for the Red October"" or ""Crimson Tide"".The movie lacks a decent script, plot and pacing. On the very first moments when one sees a vent covered with the american flag, one can only cringe and perform a major face palm just imagining what will come throughout the rest of the movie.CGI is bad! Period! There are scenes that are sharp (real scenes!) and others that are so fussy, that it almost resembles that strange effect that Spielberg and Lucas made on the last episode of Indiana Jones. However, Indiana Jones's Crystal Skull had ALL CGI scenes with the same fussiness consistency throughout the entire movie! Hunter Killer has too many parts with CGI that will make you cringe!! The dear hunting scene, when commander Glass first arrives at the sub, helicopter leaving the marines at the training site, Gerard on top of the sub gazing at the open ocean (ahahaha that light consistency is so laughable!) and sooo so many others with subs and ships! What a mess!!The Hunt for the Red October has far better CGI than this and its from 1990!If it weren't for Gerard and Toby this would have sunk to the bottom of the Laurentian abyss.",Hunter Killer

590,got-myard,A worthy legacy to the classics of the genre!,7,11 May 2019,"One has to be careful when viewing a movie with Gerard Butler in it! They are often action packed and that's it. However, this movie was more than that. The suspense was very much stressing and while the story was a bit predictable (yet again some tensions between Russia and the USA), it was accompanied with a modern bit of gunfight. The Russians are not depicted as a bunch of stupid bad guys. They are actually shown as human beings: conflicted and often wanting to do the right thing. These two hours went by quickly and it is a worthy follower of the likes of The Hunt for Red October and Crimson Tide. Cheers to a genre that I thought long gone!",Hunter Killer

I don't want to be traumatised or left wondering what I had been watching. This movie had a great story with decent acting and good effects. What I did like is that this isn't the Yanks against the Ruskies typical movie. It left me feeling hopeful rather than fatigued at the Americans winning yet again. OK they did a little but were helped fir once by their enemy. One of my fave all time movies is the Hunt For Red October and it's on a similar vein. Maybe not in the same class but it's still a feel good movie. Not sure how anyone could give this such a low rating. It's not Oscar material but it's entertaining and that's all I ask.,Hunter Killer

616,jf-90133,"Heart, no brains",3,1 November 2018,"At the least, the photography was fine, as were the CGI special effects.
However, the image of the Joint Chiefs staff acting indecisively and even panicking (Gary Oldman - scared and rushing to judgement) was too much... written that way to suggest uncertainty in handling the unknowns of a Russian coup d'état.
Plenty of inaccuracies. An enormous bridge crew on the sub... most of whom do exactly nothing. An XO who panics and questions his Captain (Gerard Butler)... of course all is forgiven in the end (in reality that would be the death of his career). The only Americans who do make decisions all make purposefully BOLD decisions, upper case, different from everyone around them, suggesting that this is the only way success is found. Millennial propaganda: gotta do your own thing no matter what...? Well, not in the military. The exception here is the Special Forces team sent in to infiltrate the Russian base... they are portrayed more accurately but not absolutely realistically.
Then there are imaginary weapons with made-up capabilities. Such as a Russian PHALANX-type close-in (""CIWS"") defense that downs some missiles within a few feet of the ship (actual fact: 1,600 to 14,000 meters). That close to the ship and the momentum of the debris would still heavily damage the ship.
And the portrayal of the Russian and American fleets each sailing in a straight line, very close together, pointed straight at each other. Ridiculous in so many ways.
And then there are the Russians. Fortunately this is not an attempt to portray Putin... the Russian President is somebody else. More can be said here.
The advertising tries to suggest the film is the next ""Hunt For Red October"". NO, absolutely not.
So it's a fun movie, just exercise your military suspension of disbelief.",Hunter Killer

This movie seems to be ""pushed up the ladder"" by others, and I would like to say something against it.First. Optically very nice movie. For an actions movie (I grew up with ""Die Hard"" and the like).
Sound/Music: Was there Music? Sounds... a bit much of those dramatic ""SWOOOOSH!""-I-Zoom-In-Now-Sounds.But if you have seen other Submarine-Movies (Like ""Das Boot"" or ""Hunt for red Octobre"") you begin to see, why this movie is not as good. Because it is in some cases just totally un-logical.Some examples?
Calling LOUD for total silence and announcing that with a claxon!During battle-stations crewmen are screwing around on torpedoes... just why, and why with a 24mm wrech that has to fall in that moment? (Total silence was announced just before, so work had to stop anyhow, especially loud work)How did that marine with the shot leg get that 1km into the wood and up the tree without help?Why was the americal transport plane not shot down or threatened by the Russians? I mean, Polyarnuy is not as close to the coast as Norfolk.That port should be harder to enter by americans that for Frodo to get to Mordor. Now they just run up a sloped concrete thing, climb over a fence and there they are?That ""60 degrees down!""-Command is total nonsense. You would not be able to stand in the submarine then, our you would have to stand on the bulkheads (Which the crew does not do), not on the floor (and I think the whole interior of the boat is NOT supported on a cardanic swivel arm...)Would the amaricans really send a carrier strike group (one carrier only!) into proximity of the Russian motherland, just to get it shot by the landbased planes?Storywise: The Americans find out (of course, the super-intelligent CIA-Woman that outbrains 5 Admirals and all their staff) that the Russian President will be in danger and then send six (6!) Soldiers into on of the best-guarded ports on the Russian Navy? Then a submarine is sent in to pick them up again, has ""by suprise"", as a hunter-killer-sub, also a rescue sub with it... and of course survives the shrapnels of about a dozen anti-ship-missles where a AK47 just moments before almost shot the rescue sub to pieces (which is made from 16mm submarine-steel and therefore almost immune to 7,62mm rounds from an assault rifle).I am not biased by other reviews. I think this is quite a nice film, if you do not take it serious at all. But for me, as I compare it with Red Octobre and Das Boot I have to say.... nice action movie, but lousy submarine-movie.

it has submarine warfare, love it. Even if the submarine defies the laws of physics, I still enjoyed those moments a lot.Here are my turnoffs:i had issues understanding some of the English dialogue. Either because actors did not pronunciate clearly or special effects sounds were too high to get the message.the bad guy is too bad. They stopped just from giving him Dracula teeth.the behaviour of the CxO. Hysterically screaming instead of debating.

They installed a phone tap on what the Russian thought was a secure underwater cable and would stop by every couple of months to download all the captured intelligence.They also tracked ship movements and took underwater photos of the ships in the harbor.There are any number of inaccuracies in the movie, but penetrating the Russian defenses there is not one of them and the subs did not require a Russian naval officer to do so.",Hunter Killer

651,debbiet2,Rent it!,8,3 February 2019,I don't know why people are giving this such low ratings. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is the first movie we've watched in years that my husband didn't fall asleep during so that there tells you it's a good movie. Good action sequences. Good acting. Good plot line. Sure there was a hoakey part or two that you knew wouldn't happen in real life but it wouldn't have made for a good movie. Very entertaining and I'll rent it again sometime to have my parents watch it.,Hunter Killer

660,dak1220,"On the whole, it's fun.",7,8 November 2020,"This is really not a bad movie, but it's easy to nit-pick. That may explain why it has a 69% positive score with the Rotten Tomatoes audience, but only 38% among professional critics. Count me among the 69%. It has enough authentic touches to help you enjoy the action and suspend disbelief most of the time, but enough plot holes and outright goofs to make you shake your head in, well, disbelief, from time to time.I'm not going to give a plot summary or reveal the worst goofs in advance. Watch it and see for yourself without preconceptions, as I did. You will be rewarded with some good action scenes and some acceptably realistic navy action. But there will be an occasional ""Wait, what??"" moment if you actually know a little bit about submarines and/or insist on plausibility when watching commando action. You can either let those moments ruin the whole thing for you, or you can smile and keep on enjoying.Gerard Butler may not quite be the equal of Sean Connery as a submarine captain (Hunt for Red October), and Connery may have had a better and more original script to work with, but Butler still does a very credible job. So if you like submarine movies and your nonsense filter isn't set too high, there is a good chance that you will like this movie.",Hunter Killer

Well, it is.Remember naive, Putin targeting 6850 nuclear warheads in ours cities, and when he pulls the trigger there will be no time for hesitation.At the end, let's get to know his opinion:

Some if it is highly unbelievable and impossible in real life, but hey, this is a movie, not real life. Others allude to a very intense scene. It was intense, but the outcome is predictable. I came away from it saying it was worth the matinee ticket price but that's about it. The typical XO (Commanding Officer) by the book and the Captain plucked out of who knows where that has this amazing intuition and gets all of the best outcomes even though he doesn't follow the rules. Had he followed the rules, everyone would have died. So, he's the hero and everyone lives happily ever after.

702,mezza180,Worst film seen this year,1,31 October 2018,"Where to start with this load of dross.
The plot is as far fetched as you could hope for.
A US Submarine ends up sailing into the home of the Russian Fleet, completely undetected for the most !
Meanwhile a US Seal Team have managed parachute into Russia and set up camp watching the Russian base - again undetected !
Amidst all this the next nuclear war is about to kick off unless the US can kidnap the Russian President from the Naval base.
Add to all that rather nice cinematic shots of the US 5th fleet sailing into the North Atlantic to battle the Russian's - unfortunately the production team failed to notice the British Naval ensigns flying from some of these ships !!The outset looks promising but it rapidly fell into the ridiculous.
I wish i could say the acting was good or the action scenes were worth putting up with the rest - but neither were true.Save your money.",Hunter Killer

Gary oldman is one of my favorite actors and I think he was the weakest character. All others shined. Gerard butler at his best. I'm going to have my wife watch it tonight to see if as a buff as well she agrees. Must watch.,Hunter Killer
707,petermacleod1957,Better than expected,8,16 January 2019,"I didn't have high hopes for this. What with Gerard Butler in the lead I thought we were in for a barely credible gung-ho action fest like Olympus Has Fallen. Actually, Mr Butler was reasonably restrained and was good value. The story was the usual rogue Russian general up for a coup scenario but was quite restrained, without the usual posturing you get with this sort of action flick. At times the action was quite tense, the sub scenes being quite realistic and the ending has an up-beat note of international co-operation without being cheesy. Also notable as the last movie for Michael Nyqvist whose untimely death took place shortly after completion. He was only 56 and is probably best remembered for the Swedish Girl with the Dragon Tattoo films.
Overall an entertaining film and worth your time to watch. Not quite up there with Crimsom Tide but we don't get many sub films so make the most of this one",Hunter Killer

720,email-24054,Pathetic!,1,1 February 2019,"I typically like Gerard Butler and Gary Oldman, but they couldn't save this disaster of a movie. The story line could have been possibly pulled off, but there were too many major mistakes made to salvage this film from being crushed under the pressure.From an early scene, where Joe Glass (Gerard Butler) is out bow hunting deer. He spots a big buck, and has pulled back with the deer in his sights. At the last moment, he sees a doe and a fawn a bit behind the buck, and doesn't take the shot. DEER DON'T BEHAVE IN THIS MANNER! They don't stay together as if they were a family, as this scene implies.The US submarine technology as portrayed in the movie is not believable.US Subs don't carry a small submersible along with them ""just in case"" they may need it.I have no idea what defensive systems the Russian's have in place at Polyarny Shipyard Number 10, but I doubt it's the treacherous combination of mines, acoustic sensors, and secret passageways as depicted in this movie. If it was that difficult to get in and out of, their own fleet would suffer casualties.Based on when this film would have been in production, it would have been assumed that Hillary Clinton was going to be our next president. Having the token older blonde in the role of US President was an obnoxious play off that assumption.While our US Navy SEALs are an amazingly capable group, the way they were portrayed in this movie was extremely unbelievable.These are just the most obvious flaws in this movie. There are many more minor goofs that make the movie difficult to watch or take seriously. Do yourself and your wallet a favor. Avoid this disaster at all costs.",Hunter Killer

There is no way the writers or director did any research for this movie. My favorite line of the whole movie was when the pilot of the SEAL delivery sub called the underwater current at 700 feet a ""rip tide"" right after they complained about how it would be crushed if they dove any further.Imagine the most cliche and cheesy movie. This is a remake of that.

This is one of the best war thriller movies in decades.

It was suspenseful even though we knew what was going to happen (you just can't kill off Gerard Butler.. come on). My husband is a SubVet and was surprised to see so many spot on things about the sub itself. It was Hollywood'd up, and maybe the Russians should've spoken Russian and have subtitles to read (only complaint really). I personally don't expect ""realistic"" things to happen in a mostly fictional movie, so the likelihood of these things happening in really life doesn't bother me.

One of my recent rules of thumb has become to look at both critic and user reviews before watching a movie and then make a decision whether its worth to watch one. Critics are definitely not the only gauge to use these days because I have watched so many good ones that had poor ratings on rotten tomatos for example. And this is definitely the case with Hunter Killer as well. Going into this movie with no expectations I must say I am pleasantly surprised. This movie will definitely not win any awards, but when it comes to delivering an unpredictable, somewhat realistic, edge of your seat action thriller, it delivers on all accounts. With so much CGI filled style over substance movies out there these days, it was a nice throwback to the classic 80's well done action flicks that we all loved growing up . Highly recommend, just dont expect too much and it will be worth it.",Hunter Killer

732,trytych,Sub par in every way,1,18 January 2019,Terrible CGI on par with a 15 year old video game. Dialogue was forced and lame. I pretty much never review films but this one stunk. I have no idea how it's getting 9 or 10 star reviews. I turned it off after 40 minutes because quite frankly I didn't care at all about the story or what was going to happen.,Hunter Killer

Some mistakes to be noted, apart from the goofs already spotted:
1) some fighter jets taking off from the US carriers have black German signs
2) the Russian trucks that carry the long haul missiles have a red star painted on them. Politics patterns might have remained the same thanks to 'Uncle Vlad' but flags have evolved from Soviet back to Russian.",Hunter Killer

741,dacoates-07721,Like Tom Clancy never existed,5,27 October 2018,"In a world where Tom Clancy did exist, this movie is offensively unrealistic. I'm just an average fan of modern military fiction, I have no military experience. But all fans of modern military fiction know nonsense when they see it. Would it have been too much to ask the authors of this story to have least read other fictional work on this topic, or to at least have browsed the Internet's many non-fictional sources of information on this topic.There was some nice hardware in this movie and some nice settings, those were exciting and entertaining, so there was some value in that. But those parts where interrupted by my constant need to scoff out loud at completely nonsensical depictions of military operations, tactics and decision making.So if you want to see pictures of military hardware and personnel in action then you'll get that. But if you expect to see the actions taken by the military to make any sense whatsoever you will be offended.Warning: Some spoilers after this part in the form a partial list of laughable depictions of military actions:Navy SEALs who walk (not swim) under water.
Navy SEALs who wear goggles when underwater instead of a dive mask.
A US heavy HALO insertion in Russian airspace (like radar isn't a thing).
Navy SEALs who don't know how to HALO (unbelievably insulting to our military).
A US sub that SURFACES to extract divers under fire (because otherwise you'd miss the opportunity to get shot at). Let's see, submarines and SCUBA divers both operate under water, but if someone is shooting at us, then let's go to the surface. Yeah, that makes total sense.
A sub avoiding acoustic sensors needs the crew to make no sound louder than a whisper, so the skipper gets on the ship wild PA and announces over loudspeakers to be quiet now (whispers are louder than PAs I guess??).
Destroyers looking for subs without active sonar.
A sub running quiet with active sonar.
Subs operating submerged in the midsts of icebergs.
The entire concept of anti-submarine warfare does not seem to exist in this movie.
An anti-missile system that is able to distinguish between incoming missiles and the target they are about to strike (IDK, maybe, but seriously doubt it).
A russian sub commander who just happens to have also trained every sailor on a nearby destroyer and everyone in the local navy base.
A Russian sub commander who has no Russian personality whatsoever and is easily convinced and won over to reason by a few kind words from the hero.
A Russian president, who's really just a nice guy caught in bad circumstances, and just wants everyone to play fair (like Putin never existed).If people are going to write stories in which someone will invest money, it should be required that those writers are at least familiar with the subjects that they are writing about. Any high school student could have written this. And any high school student who was more familiar with the subject matter would have been a better choice.",Hunter Killer

749,fredtai,Olympus Has Fallen - (Underwater!) Fantastic movie,10,28 October 2018,"Was not sure what to expect from his movie as most films that sell themselves with ""From the Producers of...blah, blah, blah""- (in this case ,Olympus has Fallen and Fast and Furious) usually end up rubbish. I have enjoyed all Gerard Butler's action movies and this was no exception, it was like Olympus Has Fallen mixed with London Has Fallen, Hunt for Red October and Lone Survivor. If you liked any of those movies I'm sure you will enjoy this. It was a white knuckle ride from start to finish and never lets up the pace. Sure it has cheesy dialogue and a predictable plot but it is very well made and has great performances from Butler, Oldman and Nyqvist (in his final role before his untimely death last year) . Almost the best movie I have seen this year (inc. MI Fallout, Ant Man 2 and Venom) , just pipped at the post by Infinity War. Recommended without hesitation!",Hunter Killer

This is does not come into the same league, or even the same planet.The CGI ""Faslane"" is pretty terrible. It would be been better to not even say what port it was, as the back drop was laughable.The submarine ""evading"" the torpedos....40 degree's down! No just not, that would never happen, and the submarine suddenly able to level out before it hits the sea bed. This is a several thousand tonne submarine in water! It isn't that manoeuvrable.Just for information, a nuclear sub, that is stopped like the US Sub did when it was trying to hide in the dirt, this could of clogged in let/out lets to cooling systems for the nuclear reactor and would not happen!When it comes to accurate submarine operations, they one is WAY WAY WAY off the mark.Don't get my started on the spineless XO!!!",Hunter Killer

778,corneliusoliphant,American fantasy at it's most mediocre...,4,4 November 2018,"In 2005 we saw the film Stealth offer us a delightfully funny ass kicking of anything that isn't American. During that film an AI drone entered Russian airspace, Human american pilots entered sovereign russia to save this drone. Two Russian pilots were murdered in their own airspace but don't worry the AI done was a good guy... in 2018 this American hubris and hark back to the old days where Russians are the bad guys is being brought back again only with a fraction of the special effects skill or budget of Stealth. Acting of the american roles is cliche'd at best and the acting of Russian roles it deliberately cold and stiff. If you want a good old cold war style action movie, hunter killer offeres plenty of similarity but falls short of providing any joy. Rewatching the classics or Red october, red dawn or even the delightfully awesome under siege will be much more worth your time... This average release could have been something we scrolled by on netflix rather than have been a theatrical release. This is just another example of how TV has overtaken the movies in acting, writing and now even special effects...",Hunter Killer

Everything about this movie is just appalling, Tom Clancy (RIP) rising from the dead and h(a)unting the story writers of this movie is far more believeable than anything which happens in this movie.I like myself some nice brainless action movie and popcorn now and then as much as any fellow 85.

Who are these people? I guess if you think Springsteen on Broadway is the bomb, stop right here, don't watch this movie, ""Mary Poppins Returns"" is almost out, save your money for that. But seriously, I rate this movie as one of the best I ever saw, period. I created an IMDb account just to say that. It has excellent and believable action with tactics and technology that is pretty much accurate to the current state of things. Nothing better than an edge of your seat thriller where every step is believable and accurate. I am not in the military but I am a fan of the genre. I read lots of books and loved ""Red October"" and ""13 hours in Benghazi."" My wife has no idea what a Virginia Class Sub is or what a CIWS cannon is, but she said it was awesome too.

Performances are good,story line is ok if not predictable. There's no suspense, a touch of action but just not a film you'd asscociate with any of the actors unless we fast forward another 10yrs and they were struggling for work. Watch to pass the time, just don't expect what you'd expect from Gerard Butler action movie, or the twists and turns of a Gary Oldman. Hence why I'm left puzzled...",Hunter Killer

This movie is drivel, story is all over the place and is beyond fantasy. It's predictable in its nonsense and stereotyping is awful, Americans save the day while Russians are traitors looking to overthrow their evil overlords. The story then plays out in a poor mix of cat and mouse. Acting isn't too bad but nothing can save the plot which was written by a 13 year old, Tom Clancy this is not.",Hunter Killer

That gets top points. But the villain and Russian port was a big let down. The movie could have been much better with some more budget on hiring the right villain . Similarly a better setup for the villain and a more mature depiction of the russian port would have really completed this movie.

It simply unfolds into one gigantic mess of twisted logic, unbelievable and unrealistic quests and ""end game"" climaxes that provide little pay off because at their core they just don't make sense.Beyond all this the real thing that hurt the film the most was the writer / director clearly had no understanding of Military or Geo-Political affairs. Time and again I found myself wondering what the studio military liaison expert was doing on set while they were filming? A well thought out Tom Clancy piece this is clearly not.I actually don't mind some mindless military action, Top Gun for example has no idea how Air Combat is fought but it still entertains with it's simple action packed plot, amazing visuals of actual F14's in flight and head bopping soundtrack.
