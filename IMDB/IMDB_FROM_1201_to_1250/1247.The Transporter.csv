0,TheLittleSongbird,"Energetic, stylish and breezy action flick",8,15 February 2010,"I saw ""The Transporter"" with my brother and sister while holidaying in Scotland. I was expecting a formulaic and predictable film with bad acting and mechanic action, but what I got was the complete opposite. There may be some weak spots in the script, and Shu Qi doesn't always convince as the beautiful captive. But the film is beautifully filmed with lovely cinematography and gorgeous scenery, and has terrific action sequences that help the film go along at a fast pace. The story is a good one, and the soundtrack is energetic. With the exception of Shu Qi, the acting is not bad at all. Jason Statham has a cool charisma that does shine through, and Matt Schulze seems to be having a lot of fun as the lead bad guy. The direction is efficient enough, overall this is a fun action flick if a tad on the short side, helped enormously by a confident sense of style and the action. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Transporter
1,Leofwine_draca,Brisk and slick French action thriller,6,22 November 2016,"A sleek and efficient action thriller from the guys who brought you KISS OF THE DRAGON. Although not equalling the heights of that particular movie, this is nevertheless a fully enjoyable tale of big bad guys, slimy bad guys, a lone action hero and a pretty tag-along Chinese girl (Shu Qi, who manages to be annoying, but not too much). The setting, once again, is France, so expect lots of breakneck car chases through the streets of Nice, some stunning locations, and lots of outrageous staged action sequences which will have you shaking your head in amazement – in a good way. Jason Statham is, it has to be said, no Jet Li, but instead he brings a kind of hardman toughness to his performance as the skinheaded hero, who strips off his shirt to battle the bad guys time and time again. I like Statham, and I hope to see him in more action movies to come. Out of the cast members, only Francois Berleand really shines as the friendly French cop.The plot is nonsensical and full of holes, the script inconsequential. Even the bad guys are less bad than before, with the exception of Matt Schulze as the annoyingly 'yuppie' style smuggler and Ric Young as the stretched-face Chinese villain of the piece. However, the action comes thick and fast, from shoot-outs to hang-glider action and axe-fights to the death. Although this film does shy away from showing violent death, the martial arts battles are fast and furious, especially the oil slick tumble and the fight in the bus. Action fans should stick around for the truck-chase finale, which is exceptional stuff and includes one of the funniest deaths for a villain I've ever seen. Well-shot and slickly edited, my only problem is with the out of place music, rap and stuff like that, which I'm not a fan of, and which is pretty intrusive early on. Luckily it fades out come the thrill-ride of a finish.",The Transporter
2,SnoopyStyle,Jason Statham satisfies all your cool fighting needs,7,1 December 2013,"Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a hired transporter willing to deliver anything with simple rules. Never change the deal. No names. Never look in the package. Frank's latest job is to transport for a guy named Wall Street (Matt Schulze). However on the way, he opened the package which turns out to be a Chinese girl.Written by Luc Besson, this has all the cool people who looks cool, and does cool fighting. And Jason Statham is great at this. From this point on, he becomes the go to guy for all your cool fighting needs. François Berléand does well as Inspector Tarconi and Qi Shu makes a good looking kidnap victim. However, it's not really about any acting. It's all about the action. And director Corey Yuen is an expert at the HK action style.My biggest problem is that people keep losing or not bringing their guns. So it's a lot of kung fu fighting when gunplay would make more sense. However sense has little to do with this. You must leave reason out of it.",The Transporter
3,claudio_carvalho,"Die Hard IV  Do Not Think, and You Will Have an Enjoyable Action Movie",7,7 March 2004,"Nearby Nice, Frank Martin (Jason Statham) transports and delivers illegal cargoes. His business is supported by three basic rule: Rule no. 1  The deal is never to be changed; Rule No. 2  No names; and Rule No. 3  Never watch the cargo. The day he breaks his own rules, he realizes he is transporting a Chinese girl, Lai (Qi Shu), and he gets in many troubles due to his fault. This movie is pure action having all the usual clichés: car chasing, explosions, fights when nobody uses guns, the lead actor gets some kind of involvement with the victim etc. But the choreography is excellent and the action scenes are great.  Jason Statham recalls Bruce Willis in `Die Hard'. If the viewer do not think, he will have an enjoyable entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): `Carga Explosiva' (Explosive Cargo')",The Transporter
4,jboothmillard,The Transporter,5,17 May 2007,"I saw the advert for this on TV, and I thought it looked quite cool, so I tried it. Basically, The Transporter, or Frank Martin (Lock, Stock's Jason Statham), an ex-special forces man, is now a secretive man who sticks to strict rules (mainly his own). He is basically hired by many people to transport anything they want with no questions asked and no names given, only where to go. One of his delivery's though has a rule broken where his curiosity leads to opening the delivery to someone called Wall Street (Matt Schulze), and he finds a Chinese girl, Lai (Shu Qi). When Street finds out that he broke a rule, he decides that he should be dealt with by many assassins. With his life now in danger, he is both on the run, but also, with Lai's help, going to rescue many Chinese prisoners to be enslaved, being smuggled into France by Lai's villain father. Also starring François Berléand as Tarconi and Ric Young as Mr. Kwai. I must admit there might not have been much of a story to pay attention, but all the action, explosive and chase sequences never disappoint. Worth watching!",The Transporter
5,ccthemovieman-1,Statham & Style Elevate The Action,8,18 June 2006,"I still rate this pretty high even if the last 10 minutes got totally out of hand and went crazy, action-wise. By ""out-of-hand,"" I mainly refer to the usual excessive action and bad guys-keep-missing-good guys-even-from-short range-type mentality. Actually, a lot of the film is that but it's such a fun movie that I didn't care.Jason Statham is very cool in the lead and it's he that makes this a decent film. I also enjoyed Shu Qi, a very pretty woman; the witty dialog of Francois Berleand and some stylish, tongue-in-cheek directing by Louis Leterrier and Corey Yuen. Another director whose films are known for their hip styles also co- wrote this: Luc Besson.Some of the action scenes are outrageous. To Statham's credit, he did most of the action scenes himself. I guess he's a tough guy in real life, too. He's pretty amazing.A no-brainer-but lots of fun movie.",The Transporter
6,Tweekums,Good mindless fun!,8,18 September 2010,"Action star Jason Statham is Frank, the eponymous transporter who will deliver anything for a price. He has three simple rules; never change the plan, no names, and don't look in the package. On his latest job he breaks the third rule and discovers that he has a beautiful Chinese woman in the boot of his car. Knowing that he is delivering a person against their will doesn't cause him to abandon the job although he does let her have a drink. When he delivers her he is offered another simpler job; just delivering a case this time. Luckily for Frank he stops off to get some refreshments because as he returns to his car it explodes. Displeased about this he returns to the house he'd dropped the woman at and helps himself to one of the cars there; but not before beating up a load of goons. As he drives away he discovers that the Chinese woman, called Lai, had escaped in the commotion and hidden in the car. The man who wanted him dead wasn't in the house at the time and when he learns what has happened heads off to kill Frank... Frank is hard to kill though and he is soon helping Lai who explains that the man is involved in human trafficking. Soon she has been captured by the man and we learn that her father is also involved with the trafficking. Frank spends the remainder of the film fighting hoards of goons, parachuting onto the back of a moving lorry and dodging bullets while trying to rescue Lai and the trafficked people who are trapped in a container.If you go into this film expecting a gritty exposé on the evils of trafficking you will be disappointed however if you sit back, but your brain in neutral and suspend your disbelief you should have a great time. Jason Statham is great in the role of Frank, playing it dead straight he made the unbelievable scenes believable; even when he drove a car off a bridge and landed on a car transporter and when he fought a room full of goons while covered in oil. Qi Shu was good as Lai although she didn't have too much to do. I liked François Berléand's portrayal of Inspector Tarconi; a policeman who clearly knew that Frank was up to something but never really made an attempt to catch him and even let him go when Frank pointed out that he could get to the bad guys so much faster than the police could. The many fights are all perfectly choreographed and the car chases and spectacular.",The Transporter

8,BA_Harrison,Delivers the goods.,8,16 September 2016,"Frank (Jason Statham) earns his living as a transporter, a driver who operates on the wrong side of the law, making deliveries of any kind, no questions asked; but when Frank breaks one of his own rules by opening a package en route, his ruthless employers decide to silence him using any means necessary.Jason Statham has some pretty lousy titles in his filmography (the preposterous and tiresome Crank movies, the disappointing The Expendables), as do director Corey Yuen (the mediocre So Close, the abysmal Blade of Kings) and producer Luc Besson (the awful Arthur and the Invisibles). The Transporter, however, sees all three on top form, their film providing an hour-and-a-half of exhilarating, knowingly dumb comic-book nonsense, star Statham playing his part perfectly, with an admirable sense of seriousness despite the patent silliness of the action (unlike his irritatingly OTT performances in the Crank films).As the story progresses, the gunfights, fist fights and explosions get bigger and better, with logic never allowed to get in the way of spectacle. Statham looks every inch the action hero and handles his martial arts scenes convincingly, the best being a hugely enjoyable battle against numerous foes that makes use of a couple of barrels of grease and a pair of bicycle pedals. Bringing a bit of glamour to proceedings is the lovely Shu Qi, who plays the contents of the package that gets Frank into so much trouble.",The Transporter
9,sunwarrior13,Transporter Delivers Action Without Proper Storytelling,6,8 November 2011,"The Transporter is an action film directed by Louis Leterrier and Corey Yuen and written by Luc Besson.The film stars Jason Statham as Frank Martin, a driver for hire – a mercenary ""transporter"" who will deliver anything, anywhere – no questions asked – for the right price.In the movie, he finds his life becoming all the more dangerous when he turns against a gang of criminals.It also stars Shu Qi as Lai Kwai.The Transpoter presents Frank Martin as a former Special Forces officer who lives on the French Mediterranean that has a lucrative second career as a underworld courier for hire. He will deliver anything anywhere, but he has three iron-clad rules - once the plan is in motion it cannot be changed, neither he nor his customers are to ever use their real names, and under no circumstances will he open the package. Martin is hired to make a delivery to a wealthy but unscrupulous American known as Wall Street, but after taking possession of the package he realizes that whatever is inside happens to be alive. Breaking his own rule, Martin opens the bag to discover a beautiful Asian woman, Lai, who is bound and gagged. Lai briefly escapes, but Martin captures her, and delivers her to Wall Street as promised. However, after being given a parcel to deliver by Wall Street, Martin finds out what Wall Street is up to - in partnership with Lai's father Mr. Kwai, Wall Street is part of a scheme to smuggle Asian illegal aliens into France. Martin's conscience gets the better of him, and he sets out to rescue Lai and put Wall Street and Mr. Kwai out of business; however, as if this wasn't enough of a challenge, Martin discovers a French detective, Tarconi has gotten wind of his illegal business. The Transporter is one hell of an action film.It presents actions scenes that are merely to entertain regardless whether they are realistic or not.It spends of its time between car chases and martial-arts bouts with random scuba-diving footage.Also,it has a lot more fights, explosions, and more fights, but with a flair.Overall,the actions scenes are simply excellent and outstanding as a means to entertain in lieu of a good story and character development.",The Transporter
10,hitchcockthelegend,The best and worst of the action movie genre.,6,9 January 2011,"The Transporter is directed by Louis Leterrier and Corey Yuen and written by Luc Besson (who co-produces with Stephen Chasman) and Robert Mark Kamen. It stars Jason Statham, Shu Qi, Matt Schulze & François Berléand. Music is by Stanley Clarke and cinematography comes courtesy of Pierre Morel. Plot sees Statham as ex-soldier Frank Martin, a much respected courier in the underworld who is dynamite behind the wheel of a car and electric with his fists and feet. Living it up nice and cushy on the French Riviera, he lives by a set of rules that should not be broken, but during this particular ""transport"" job, he breaks his rules out of curiosity and gets embroiled in a fight for life.The Transporter made back double its production budget, enough of a financial swing to ensure that sequels would follow (two so far, with the first sequel easily the best of the three). With Stallone et al on the wane, and the likes of Diesel and The Rock yet to convince, The Transporter gave ex-model-turned actor-Statham the chance to flex his muscles and make a mark in the action genre. Which he did, with great physicality, deft of movement and rugged good looks. Which is just as well since all those around him are rather bad. He's helped enormously by the choreography of Yuen, who gives the fight scenes plenty of zest and originality to leave them memorable. The spirit of Hong Kong action movies reigns supreme in The Transporter, with the added bonus being that of Morel's pleasing photography. But strip away the action and there's nothing left, the plot is boorish and the dialogue just dreadful, worse still is Clarke's music score, where instead of adrenalin boosting urgency we get leaden comedy. Very poor, and indicative of the production. It seems that the makers had themselves a bunch of great action set pieces to begin with, and then built the film around them, without due care and attention.It does what is expected of it as an action piece of popcorn, but it's pretty shallow outside of that. 6.5/10",The Transporter
11,Theo Robertson,Franco American Action Thriller High On Action,6,31 July 2010,"Apparently one of the criticisms of French film nowadays by the indigenous population is that they resemble American films too much . I'm not entirely sure if this is a bad thing since American movies have been so successful through the decades . The French do have the consolation that the French New Wave heavily influenced one of the great golden periods of Hollywood in the 1970s THE TRANSPORTER is a Franco American co-production made for the international market . Set in France and featuring American action film making techniques such as quick editing . It also features the mainstay of American action pictures with car chases and explosions but the French setting does help somewhat if only because we're treated to glorious landscapes of the French Riviera . Certainly you'll be hard pressed to name a better photographed action movie than this one The screenplay co-written by Luc Besson centres around a criminal played by Jason Statham being caught up in a people smuggling ring from Eastern Asia but the film doesn't really explore people trafficking , its main function is to cram as many fistfights , car chases and shoot outs as is possible even if they're somewhat unlikely . It is after all a pop corn no brains actioner and for what it is it's fairly well done",The Transporter
12,Scarecrow-88,The Transporter,9,25 April 2016,"Incredible fight choreography and Statham athleticism (along with his usual cool and charisma), along with cars and buildings that go Kaboom!, offer plenty for action fans to embrace in this custom made star vehicle that follows a highly paid ex-military mercenary who performs tasks for customers with particular ""packages"" they want delivered to specific locations under certain conditions. He has rules to abide by so that the transport goes without a hitch. Well, he ""opens a package"" and what stares from within his trunk is a very pretty Asian woman (Qui Shu). She tells him of slaves being transported by those who hired him to bring her to them. If he doesn't help her they will die or be sold. What ultimately triggers his war with these dirtbags who initially hired him to bring them Shu is their attempt to blow him up in his car, a bomb disguised as another package for him to deliver. When they fire missiles at his château, it is game-on! With Matt Schulz as a lead heavy in cahoots with Shu's rotten pops (Ric Young), making Statham's life most difficult. The use of oil and the shirt off his back and the ability to fight himself out of cramped confines against a litany of men (inside a greyhound or sandwiched between carrier crates in a transport yard are such examples) are just some of the amazing stunts and fight scenes that make up this hotly paced actioner. The finale has Statham trying to avoid gunfire and Schulz' interference as he attempts to commandeer a truck hauling the human slaves in an exhilarating chase sequence. The fighting in the cab of the truck gets intense. Statham's use of his quick legs and how he orchestrates speedy kicks and sharp reflexes produce breathtaking results. The film opens with a humdinger of a car chase highlighting Statham's talents also behind the wheel. The whole point is to signify that Statham has arrived and no matter the firepower or manpower, he seems more than capable to avoid harm while others aren't so lucky.",The Transporter
13,LeonLouisRicci,Sleek Streamlined Sock-Suey,7,25 May 2014,"The Largest Suspension of Disbelief in this Type of Thing is that when the Action Hero, here it is Jason Statham, is about to take on 6-12 Bad Guys in a Martial Arts Choreography to Show His Stuff, the Villains all Discard, Throw Away, Leave Behind, Hide, Forget, or otherwise Appear WITHOUT GUNS. Because if they did not. GAME OVER.So with that Conceit in Mind, it is Safe to Move On to more Outrageous Action and then more Outrageous Action. That's what's here to Enjoy and it is Piled On from Scene One and Never Stops for Plot, or Characters, or Anything Else to get in the way of the Fun.You Either buy into this Stuff or You Don't. It is Entertaining to a Point and can be an Exercise in Style when some Creative Folks like Yuen and Besson are at the Controls. This One was Successful Enough to Spawn Two Sequels where by the Third Enough was Enough and the Transporter Ran Out of Gas.But this is the One that Started the Trio and it is a Fine Fiction with a Semi-Charismatic Hero with Rules and a Rhythm of Chop-Suey that is Attractive in Limited Doses. As a Start-Up this will do and Delivers Enough Mindless Bang for the Buck and a bit of Style to Boot.",The Transporter
14,poolandrews,Enjoyable action film.,6,1 May 2010,"The Transporter is set in Marseille in France where ex-military man Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is known to the criminal underworld as a 'Transporter', a man who who can act as a getaway driver or deliver an illegal cargo from one place to another. Frank accepts a job to transport a bag across France, on the way to his destination Frank gets a flat tyre & has to get the spare from the boot & notices that the bag is moving. Curious Frank takes a look inside the bag & sees a Chinese woman named Lai (Qi Shu), Frank delivers the cargo to the destination & gangster Wall Street (Matt Schulze) gives Frank a suitcase to take back with him but it turns out it's packed with explosive & blows Frank's car up while he is inside a roadside café. Wall Street wants Frank dead & sets out to kill him while Frank reluctantly rescues Lai who tells him of an operation to smuggle hundreds of Chinese through Marseille...This French American co-production was directed by Louis Leterrier & Cory Yuen & is a fun & energetic light hearted action film that could be described as a sort of cross between James Bond & Die Hard which has already been said about The Transporter franchise as a whole before, I must admit I did actually quite enjoy The Transporter for what it was. The script isn't the best with several poorly thought out moments like when one moment we see the kidnapped Lai is tied to a chair & then the next she's in the back of a car that Frank steals still tied to a chair. I mean how did she open the car door? How did she get in the car tied to a chair? How does a chair even fit inside the back of a car? How did she close the door once she was inside? How did Frank not notice a fully grown woman tied to a chair in the back of a car he just got in? Why did they kidnap Lai anyway? Why did they hire Frank to take her to that Château? Why is she free to do anything she wants at the end? What happened to the second truck full of Chinese at the end? How did Lai's father get to the truck Frank was driving so quickly? How did Lai get the gun off the Chinese gangster when we clearly hear her scream? Some sloppy writing & plotting hurts the film (alos, tellingly only four character's in the entire film are given names) but on the positive side The Transporter is quite likable, the main character played by Statham is likable & although his forced relationship with Lai seems clunky they make a nice couple & have a certain on screen spark, the bad guy's are alright if a little faceless & generic while the good natured cop has his moments. At a shade under 90 minutes at least it's short & moves along at breakneck pace, your never too far from something blowing up, a gun being fired or a fight scene which is definitely a good thing.To be honest where The Transporter excels are it's action scenes which are great, from car chases to exploding houses to shoot-outs to imaginative fight scenes that have an air of Jackie Chan about them as Statham pulls out all the moves & uses various random objects to help him like his jumper or barrels of oil. Thankfully there's none of that horrible quick editing, everything here is well photographed & it's clear to see what's going on, who everyone is & where they are in fight scenes. The car chases are cool too although I wish they had used the huge trucks at the end a bit more. The ending itself is a bit of a let down with a brief stand-off & a rushed final few minutes that would have benefited from better send-offs for the villains. A word also goes for the French locations which are really nice, shot mainly in bright daylight the locations look really nice.Filmed in France the production values are good, there's a lack of CGI computer effects & to my eye most of the stunts were real time stunts performed on set which helps the look of the film enormously. The acting is fine, Jason Statham was made for roles like this where he plays a likable action hero & he's pretty good here while Qi Shu is attractive as the love interest.The Transporter is a fun & enjoyable action comedy with energetic fight scenes & some cool explosions & car chases, Statham is likable as the hero & despite some poor writing I liked it for what it was. Not a masterpiece by any means but an enjoyable way to spend 88 minutes. Followed by Transporter 2 (2005) & Transporter 3 (2008) both of which drop the 'The' from the title.",The Transporter
15,dbborroughs,"Great Popcorn action film, is one of the great guilty pleasures of all time.",9,3 September 2005,"I love this movie.I've seen it I don't know how many times since its release and I never seem to get tired of it.The plot is simple. Frank is man who will transport anything anywhere so long as you follow his rules. For Frank the rules are what keeps him safe and out of trouble. Of course Frank breaks one of the rules and he suddenly find himself on the run with a girl in tow with police and the bad guys on his tail.This film has great characters who say very funny things, the exchanges between Frank and the police officer name Taconi is wonderfully funny and knowing. It has incredible action the likes of which you've probably never seen, the opening chase is one of the best ever put on film, and o course the battle in the oil.Its a wonderful film that completely falls apart dramatically in the second half. Once Frank and the girl come face to face with the two bad guys, the film ceases to make logical sense. Whats going on (apparently a plot to smuggle Chinese into France, though its not really clear) is less important than getting Frank to the next action scene. Whats so troubling is that even after 30 or 40 viewings it feels like the film makers never had a clear direction past a certain point in the story. Its not fatal, but it is annoying.Plot collapse or no, this is a great film that really should be seen. Its just two hours of good fun, and great times.(Besides it sets you up for the sequel, which in many ways is better than this, even though it too has plot problems)",The Transporter
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,All action,7,12 February 2006,"I remember seeing the advertisements for this film. It looked like a good popcorn-flick, plenty of action and not much else. What can I say... accurate ad campaign. That's exactly what this movie is. If that's a good thing or not is up for the viewer to decide, but know that if you go to see this movie, that is what you will get, nothing more, nothing less. The plot just barely makes sense and keeps the movie... well, moving. The pacing is pretty solid. The acting is just about average. The soundtrack consists mostly of hard rock and rap, which is fitting, I suppose. I personally didn't mind(I enjoy both music genres, though I wouldn't exactly say I loved the music in the film), but if you're one of those who would, you might want to consider another film to watch. The cinematography is fairly basic, though some of it is experimentally stylish... and as with most experiments, not all of it is good. Luckily, there's not too much of the bad. The martial arts choreography is pretty good, with some using of surroundings and nearby items in the fights. The action is cool. Very. It's very intense and the film has more than its share of it. Statham may not look like he can kick ass... but believe me, he can. I can't tell you how many fights or action scenes there are in this film; I lost count. One complaint that I simply have to make, though... the girl. She's just about the worst actor in there, she's annoying and every other time she opens her mouth, a screech comes out. I read in her mini-biography that she has a 'manic' acting style; that's OK, there are movies where that fits, where that would be considered good comic relief... but here, it just causes the viewer(maybe not all, but most definitely yours truly) to cringe. The humor in general is pretty tame. Very ""Saturday morning cartoon"". All in all, good if you're looking for a high-octane, leave-your-brains-at-the-door action film. Pointless if you're looking for anything else. I recommend this to fans of action-flicks who can accept that it's nothing but action and still enjoy them. Everyone else, avoid. 7/10",The Transporter
17,view_and_review,Please transport this to the trash,2,6 January 2005,"I'm not one to quickly abandon a movie... OK it depends upon my mood and whether or not I paid for the movie. The Transporter wasn't all that intriguing to begin with; the acting was average as were the characters and the plot, so it was going to need something for me to make it worth my time. All of Jason Statham's fighting couldn't bail this movie out in my opinion.I know that Hollywood likes to use pure mind-numbing shooting and fighting to hide its weak scripts, but nothing doing this time. It all went south when the damsel in distress (Lai) decided that this stranger (Frank) was good enough and safe enough to remain with. And did I mention that he helped in kidnapping her and he was admittedly in imminent danger? But... he did give her a bowl of soup, so he must be alright then. There are better more creative ways to tie two people together other than the utterly cliché damsel in distress recognizing the kind-hearted criminal. I didn't finish the movie so I can't rate it more than a 2 or 3.",The Transporter
18,evanston_dad,Pretty Fun,7,4 April 2006,"""The Transporter"" is a not bad action flick that, true to the genre, is heavy on the action and not much else.Don't look here for a plot you can sink your teeth into. The focus is on outrageous and at times downright dazzling set pieces designed to show off the athleticism of star Jason Statham. He's a relaxed and easy to watch action hero, and as long as he's engaged in kicking butt he easily carries the film, but he doesn't have the charm of, say, a Jackie Chan, and he doesn't do as well with the scenes where he's actually required to speak. But fortunately, he's not required to speak frequently, and when he is, he's only asked to deliver a few words at a time. Wise decision by the screenwriters.You're not going to add any points to your I.Q., but you just might have a good time.Grade: B+",The Transporter
19,anaconda-40658,Transport This Film to the Trash.,3,1 December 2015,"The Transporter (2002): Dir: Louis Leterrier, Cory Yuen / Cast: Jason Statham, Shu Qi, Matt Schulze, Francois Berleand, Ric Young: Title regards giving and receiving of information without care or thought of consequence. Jason Statham plays the title role whose job is to transport merchandise without asking questions. One such package happens to be an Asian female tied up in the trunk of his car. He is not suppose to look at the merchandise but upon discovering the victim he is targeted by terrorists. Typical plot is just a series of action and stunt scenes to solve absolutely nothing. The action is directed with exhilaration by Louis Leterrier and Cory Yuen but their writers are obviously lacking ambition in the creativity department. Statham was appealing in Snatch but here he drives fast, makes narrow escapes and beats up ten guys at once. Shu Qi is the hostage. After appearing in this dreadful mess she will likely need to go back into the trunk again to hide the shame. Other roles are your standard investigators and mindless thugs that fit like puzzle pieces in formula plotting. Generally they end up on the receiving end of Statham's foot up their ass. There is no point to this mayhem other than to employ senseless violence for sheer pleasure. It is a lame screenplay that should have been transported to a different screenwriter with no questions asked. Score: 3 / 10",The Transporter
20,FlashCallahan,So that's what bicycle pedals are for......,6,10 November 2014,"Frank Martin is a former soldier running a private business as a ""Transporter"", a hired criminal whose job is to transport cargo, packages and passengers without question. Frank is the best in the business and he has never broken the rules. When he is hired by an American criminal to deliver a package, his curiosity leads him to break the rules, and he discovers the package he is delivering, is a Chinese woman named Lai. Learning that Frank broke the rules discovered Lai, the criminal sends his mercenaries to assassinate him. Frank takes it upon himself to protect not only himself, but Lai, as he agrees to help Lai rescue enslaved people from China, who are being smuggled into France........If you've seen any film produced by Luc Besson in the last thirteen years, you will know that they are hugely over the top, very silly, and in some instances, blooming awful (Taken 2, Colombiana). But thankfully, this is one of the better ones.And the reason being is that its concept is just so foolproof. A man, a solitary man who doesn't break any rules, breaks one fundamental one and everyone wants to kill him.But he can kick butt, and lots of butt is kicked. With the added bonus of Statham not putting on a ridiculous accent, this is the film that got him noticed, and even though its nothing to write home about, he has screen presence.The main plot involving him and the girl may have been stolen from The Big Hit, but it's still dumb fun.",The Transporter
21,movieman_kev,a fairly good action film IF you turn your brain off,6,22 October 2005,"Jason Statham is Frank Martin, an ex-Special Forces operator who is now a transporter who has his own set of rules that he strictly abides by until he breaks them and opens a ""package"" he's transporting that contains Qi Shu. This film is entertaining enough, if wholly unbelievable. You'll enjoy it if you turn off your brain and just roll with the action. Personally I expect more from Writer Luc Besson, but then again since 1995 he's only made fun and entertaining but not great films (with the two obvious exceptions of the original ""Taxi"" and ""Danny the Dog"" which were almost as superb as his pre-1995 movies) My Grade: C+ DVD Extras: Both widescreen & Fullscreen editions of the film; Commentary by actor Jason Statham and producer Steve Chasma; a 12 minute Making Of featurette; 3 Extended / Uncut Fight Sequence with optional commentary; and Theatrical Trailer",The Transporter

23,Mr-Fusion,"It's trash, but hell if it ain't entertaining",7,26 November 2015,"I don't think I've ever witnessed a movie that so thrives on a strangely dumb likability as ""The Transporter"". I felt a very European ""The Fast and the Furious"" vibe from this (not just the Matt Schulze connection), only not so insulting to the brain. There's no use coming to this with knives sharpened; it's inviting in its mindlessness.To wit: Jason Statham's a conveyor of goods for various criminal enterprises, and his every action is governed by a code of rules. Obviously, he'll come to break those rules and find himself in hot water with the bad guys as a result. Cue the series of physically impossible fight scenes. It's not hard to see where this thing's headed, but somehow, it doesn't make you want to slap yourself. All of this absurdity rests on the icy coolness of Statham, a man rising to the occasion without reservation. He's why something so flimsy can actually work. Even when he's fighting thugs on an oil slick, it's still engaging.I liked it just as much today as I did in 2002. I've got no interest in the sequels, granted, but as a standalone, it's a fun movie.7/10",The Transporter
24,whpratt1,Transporter Broke the Rules,10,22 September 2005,"Glad I decided to watch this film on TV as I really wanted an action filled film with a great plot and I soon found out this film had everything from Soup to Nuts. Jason Statham,(Frank Martin),""Cellular"",'04, was a no mess around guy, who did all his work by the book, in other words, Step 1., Step 2., & Step 3. No names mentioned and a prompt delivery of the merchandise and never open up the cargo to be delivered. Frank Martin had a fancy life style and lived in a fabulous home and had great talents in driving a car where no one else would dream of driving. However, Frank made a bad mistake and happened to opened up a bag of hot enjoyment and trouble. In this film there is plenty of action, even romantic and sexy scenes and bloody fights and very fancy steps of self-defense. QI Shu (Lai),""Mei Ren Cao"",'03, gave a great supporting role to Frank Martin and managed to get him just where she wanted him, flat on his back. If you want to see a really great entertaining film, this flick will never bore you to death.",The Transporter
25,JamesHitchcock,A Hero Worthy of a Better Film,4,24 August 2006,"Frank Martin is a ""transporter"", which in this context seems to be a euphemism for ""courier to the criminal fraternity"". For the right fee he delivers ""packages"" around Europe, subject to three self-imposed rules. First, he will never change the terms of a deal once it has been agreed. Second, he will ask no questions about the identity of the persons with whom he is dealing. Third, he will ask no questions about the contents of the package- and will certainly never open it. The film deals with what happens when Frank breaks his third rule. On one journey he notices that a package, which he had assumed contained something inanimate, is moving, and obviously contains something living. Frank opens it to find that what has been consigned to his care is actually a beautiful young Chinese woman.Frank now begins to question his amoral, no-questions-asked philosophy. He learns that the girl is called Lai, and that the men who hired him to transport her are involved, together with her father, in an illegal scheme to smuggle Chinese immigrants into Europe. Frank decides to protect Lai, but in doing so he discovers that both he and she are in danger from the ruthless people-smuggling gang.Jason Statham seems to be Britain's first entrant into the world of the tough-guy action hero, previously dominated either by Americans (Stallone, Segal, Diesel) or Continental Europeans (Schwarzenegger, Van Damm, Lundgren). On the evidence of this film, he seems to be able to act a bit (something that cannot be said of all his rivals) and makes Frank a stylish hero, a mixture of East-End bovver boy and James Bond. On the one hand his expensive BMW cars, his smart tailor-made suits and his elegant home (a converted lighthouse) on the French Riviera speak of a Bond-like sophistication. On the other, his skinhead-type haircut and his tough-guy manner betray his working-class roots. (He would have been more convincing as a Cockney, but attempted to play the role with an American accent, doubtless to pacify that section of the American market that regards British English, especially when spoken with anything other than a ""posh"" accent, as an incomprehensible foreign tongue).In many ways, in fact, I felt that Frank was a hero worthy of a better film than this one. The film's numerous chase sequences show the influence of the Bond films (especially the sequence near the beginning where Frank uses his driving skills to escape from the police, at one point making a daring leap to insert his car onto the upper deck of a car transporter), but it lacks the wit and style which are the hallmark of the Bond series. The nearest it gets is a sort of grim gallows humour. (Frank refuses to drive the getaway car for a gang of bank robbers because there are four of them, rather than three as he had been led to believe, so the leader of the gang solves the problem by shooting dead one of his own men). The film also lacks a notable leading lady. Shu Qi is a well-known actress in the Far East, but this was her first English-language film, and she did not seem fluent enough in the language to be a credible heroine.As with most films of this type, spectacular action is more important than plausibility; the action sequences generally involve feats that would be improbable, or even impossible, in real life. As always, the villains fire off vast quantities of ammunition from powerful automatic weapons without ever once finding their target; action heroes and their girlfriends obviously have some miraculous immunity to bullets. Most of those reviewers who have defended this film have pointed out that action-adventure films are not supposed to be realistic. That is a fair enough point, but the main problem with the film is not a lack of realism but rather the lack of a decent plot. The first half, up until the point where Frank discovers who Lai really is, seemed clear enough, but the second half just seemed a confusing series of chase sequences, shoot-outs and martial-arts fights. It is all very well using a mixture of kung-fu skills and CGI techniques to produce a piece of pure escapist entertainment, but I always find that sort of escapism to be more entertaining when it is placed in the context of a plot which, if not strictly realistic, is at least comprehensible. 4/10",The Transporter

27,KineticSeoul,Statham begins,7,28 July 2015,"So this is the breakout movie for Jason Statham and the first movie where he plays as the lead role. I didn't much think of this actor when this film first debuted. But he really built himself up to be one of the most well known action stars out there. I remember watching this movie as a kid and thought it was alright, maybe because I was a big Jet Li fan back then. Sure this film can be slightly corny in today's standards and the chase and action sequences are ridiculous. But a movie like this shouldn't be taken seriously. And it seems to get even more ridiculous and even more over the top with each installment. So the plot is about this guy named Frank Martin who is a Ex-Special Forces Operator and topnotch driver that transports people or objects from one destination to another for a fee. Even if the task is dangerous, so in a way he is a getaway driver. He has three rules. Rule One: Never change the deal. Rule Two: No names--Frank doesn't want to know whom he's working for, or what he's transporting. Rule Three: never look in the package. The last two rules puts him at a disadvantage in my opinion, especially since he works for dangerous guys. From the dialogue to the anti-hero to bad guys interactions is very cliché, but it's one of those action movies that because of the simple and yet fun action sequences. Even if the characters directions and decisions doesn't make much sense either. Mainly because it doesn't try to be more than what it is, while it having effort and well choreographed sequences in it mixed in with humor. This is a cool (although a bit corny now) and stylish action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. So overall, this movie despite the mediocre character development and story it connects well enough with the cool action sequences to make it worth a rental and made it worth a watch in the theaters when it came out.7.1/10",The Transporter
28,thesar-2,Transport this Beauty Home Tonight!,9,16 April 2010,"Ah. The movie that introduced me to Jason Statham. Unfortunately, it took me a long time to get to this film.I was very hesitant to see The Transporter, much as I was to watch my first Jackie Chan film (Supercop.) So it was years after release, and instantly I took to Statham's charm, acting, charisma and fighting ability. By the time I watched this, part 2 was already headed to theaters (which I did see on the big screen) and part 3 was planned.But, I digress. This one involves an ex-super soldier who, well, ""transports"" items/people from one locale to another using basic and fundamental rules to make a living. And he's good at it, despite a noisy French officer. The transporter, Frank (Statham) gets inadvertently caught up in a human-smuggling ring and though he likes anonymity (obviously) he regains somewhat a heart and helps a victim and tries to stop the bad guys.Really. If you cherish the Jackie Chan movies, you'll like this one. You know what I'm talking about. Barely a plot. Barely good acting. Less plot, more kick-butt. You'll then like this action vehicle.I don't really like comparing Statham to Chan, as they are 100% different, but they do produce similar movies. While Chan has a certain charm for his fan base, Statham also has his own way of producing charisma for the audience. And he got me hooked.Best scenes involve NO CGI or any special effects (something part two of this series should've taken note of but failed) and just having Statham driving or hand-to-hand combat. Just his character's depth and fighting technique is worth the time, money and effort into watching what would've actually been a run-of-the-mill average foreign action flick. Recommended!",The Transporter
29,Robert_duder,The rise of an action star,9,12 January 2012,"Not many knew Jason Statham prior to becoming The Transporter but no one in the action genre has forgotten him since and for good reason. The Transporter is a rip roaring, red blooded, action packed flick that will leave you cheering and enjoying every minute of it. It has absolutely everything you could possibly need from an action movie. The gruff, tough hero, a European background, organized crime, martial arts, stunts, explosions, car chases...and everything else. Best of all it does actually have good story even if its completely predictable and simplistic but there is nothing wrong with that as long as it works and it does!! Statham is as bad-ass as any legendary action star you can think of. His character of Frank has more depth than you think at first and his good guy side wins out every time. This is one of my all time favourite action characters. Qi Shu plays Lai, Frank's package to be delivered, that turns out to be more than expected. She does alright although her wild nature makes her sort of annoying and she is often hard to understand. The chemistry between her and Statham is decent but not perfect. Really also enjoy the performance by François Berléand as Inspector Tarconi, the adversary/friend to Frank. I enjoy their banter and their storyline and they could have used it more both in this one and future sequels.Creator and writer Luc Besson is synonymous with action. The Professional, The Fifth Element, Unleashed, Taken...just to name a few of my personal favourites. Simply put he knows what people love in an action film. First timer Louis Leterrier helms the film and clearly does a great job. He went on to do some very big projects like the sequel to this and Clash of The Titans. I think he's probably a big action film fan himself and so he handles the story, content and character perfectly. If you love action even a little you should be watching this right now. It is the perfect flick to enjoy yourself beginning to end and look forward to the sequels. Jason Statham will win you over every time. 9/10",The Transporter
30,bowmanblue,90s style action in the 00s,8,25 March 2019,"'The Transporter' may not be Jason Statham's introduction into the world of on-screen action heroes, but it was certainly the film that cemented his potential as more of an 'old school' tough guy. Since the early 2000s, action films developed a severe case of over-seriousness. Gone were the days of witty quips and wry smiles of the Arnie and Stallone era, replaced with grim protagonists and gritty surroundings.That's why 'The Transporter' is so great. It totally knows what it is, i.e. big, dumb fun that's only trying to entertain, rather than deliver any sort of 'message.' Jason Statham plays 'Frank' an ex American marine with possibly the most 'questionable' American accent ever (seriously, it flits between London and New York approximately ever other word!). He specialises in driving for a living, or rather driving anything illegal from point A to point B in a severe hurry.However, his professional attitude to his work is severely tested when he begrudgingly opens the boot of his car during a job, only to find a young Chinese girl tied up in there. Naturally, his conscious is tested and it's up to him whether to deliver this girl to her - obvious - fate, or help her out. Luckily for her, she's quite pretty and therefore makes up the perfect love interest to our bald, rugged anti-hero.I would probably say that there's zero original content in this film. If you've watched enough action films then you've pretty much seen everything here and possibly done better. However, that isn't really too much of a criticism as 'The Transporter' is just such damn good fun. It has good looking heroes, evil dastardly villains, beautiful locations, great action and punch-ups. But, most of all, it never takes itself seriously in the same way as the 'pre-Craig' Bond movies did.And, if all that isn't enough to get you sit down and watch it - for the ladies - you get one hell of a look at a totally oiled-up Jason Statham, beating one goon after the other while he slips, slides and slaps his way through the bad guys - all gooey and topless.

There are many similarities, but The Tranporter suffers by comparison. The story of Leon has more humanity than Frank's, which has less human interaction and more martial arts scenes.

No, not really, but the first time it was entertaining, and the second time it was entertaining, but the third time it was basically just more of the same (same of what? I wonder, because it is the same movie, so if I have watched it three times, then of course it is going to be more of the same).Basically this is an action movie about a guy who transports stuff, no names, no questions asked, and no looking. Unfortunately, against better judgement, he decides of look, and ends up getting himself into trouble, and trouble seems to involve a criminal organisation that are not only heavily armed, but also have an unlimited amount of men to throw at this one guy who, by the way, manages to beat them all up.It this movie has one scene that stands out, then that is the scene where he covers himself in oil (engine oil, so there is nothing erotic about that scene), spills the rest of the oil on the ground, grabs a pair of bicycle pedals, and then starts beating up on the impossibly huge number of thugs that seem to be there simply to get beaten up by Jason Stratham.

At least here, one can't accuse him of being type cast (because in all his films to follow he would portray similar characters, making me question his acting ability).

Indeed, The Transporter lives up to the promise inherent in these names - it's a fast paced, professionally-shot, and totally enjoyable action outing that's easy to love. The French locations are beautiful and make a nice change of pace for the setting for an action movie, and the car chase and driving scenes are all the better for occurring in these locales. This was the first feature film for co-director Leterrier, and he and Yuen show they know how to deliver the action goods. Between the car action, the gun-shooting, missile-shooting, and Hong Kong-style Martial Arts, the movie breezes by in a blur of entertaining goodness. 
It's easy to see why this garnered two more sequels and a TV spin-off - it's a simple, enjoyable premise and the end result lives up to, and exceeds, audience expectations. While we wouldn't necessarily recommend the sequels, especially the second installment, what we would recommend is the Japanese DVD, if you can find it. It's an uncut version that contains more violence than other DVD issues to date. However, it's certainly not mandatory you find that in order to fully enjoy The Transporter - from action newbies to die-hard fans, it delivers the goods and surely a great time will be had by all who see it.

43,Anonymous_Maxine,Fast action and paper thin characters...,6,14 March 2009,"There are certain action movie premises that never go away despite the fact that they always produce movies that are clones of countless unimpressive action movies that came before. The kidnapped child, the raped and murdered wife, the otherwise wronged family, or in this case, the crusade against corrupt businessmen, smugglers, drug dealers, etc. Take your pick, they generally all turn out about the same, don't they?Jason Statham is inarguably today's fastest rising action star. He blasted onto the scene with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (a smashing action movie despite what I can't get over thinking is just the goofiest title) and soon followed it up with other action movies like Crank and Snatch which are absolutely overflowing with awesomeness. The Transporter movies are great vehicles for Statham, although this one was hardly an impressive first outing. It starts out great, with four guys scrambling madly out of a bank they've just robbed and jumping into his car, where he calmly sits motionless and informs them that there are four of them but the deal was three and then proceeds to list off all the reasons why four guys just won't do, including that it throws off the weight calibration of his suspension and will exceed the amount of gas that he has allotted for this particular delivery. The situation is, ah, resolved, and he puts the pedal down and leads the French police on an exaggerated high speed chase through the streets and alleyways of Marseilles that is so overblown that it promises to become one of those movies like Wanted or Shoot 'Em Up that are soaked in every excess imaginable but are nevertheless tons of fun.And for a lot of the movie that's what we get, but unfortunately its also populated with paper thin characters and cartoonish villains involved in a preposterous human smuggling plot. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Statham is, as the title informs us, a Transporter by trade. He makes his living by delivering things without asking questions and commands a conspicuously massive salary. The shadiness of his clients is to be expected, hence his insistence on never giving his or learning their names. He has three rules about his services  I forget the order, but they involve never changing the deal in any way once an agreement has been made (hence the tense confusion at the beginning of the movie), never giving names, and never looking in the package being delivered. When you're dealing with the kind of people that he deals with, it's generally best not to really know much about what's really going on. Especially when you have a friendly but attentive police detective making occasional house calls to your beautiful beach house and wondering about things like getaways being made in cars exactly like yours and when that last car later gets found blown to pieces with two police officers in the trunk. If nothing else, the French seem pretty generous with the benefit of the doubt!But despite this string of good luck, he breaks one of his own rules on his latest delivery, accidentally buying an Orangina for the contents of his package and then letting her go off into the woods to pee. We never learn much about why he was asked to deliver this stunningly sexy Chinese girl in the first place, but it soon becomes clear that her family is involved in a massive smuggling operation involving smuggling bedraggled Chinese people out of China. Incidentally, I watched the movie last night in China with a bunch of my Chinese friends. They were not amused.The rest of the movie, unfortunately, is an exercise in Action Movie-making 101. It's flooded with action clichés and predictability, which is disappointing even though there wasn't really a time in the first half of the movie where it promised to be anything different. But the bigger problem than the clichés and the predictability are the sheer lack of thought put into the script and the senselessness of the entire premise itself. You see, the Chinese girl's father is currently smuggling ""400 people in a container"" through Marseilles. Is this for real? 400 people in a container the size of a semi trailer? Shipping through Marseilles? I had been under the impression that a container traveling from Hong Kong to, say, America takes something like 4-6 weeks. But to travel ""through"" Marseilles on its way to somewhere else? Such a trip would take months and I'm just going to go ahead and guess that roughly 0% of the cargo would make it through alive. I don't know much about the logistics of human smuggling, but I'm guessing that such a percentage would do some damage to your profit margins.But no matter. The evil criminal scheme behind the action is beside the point, it's little more than a catalyst to differentiate between the good guys and the bad guys and give them something to fight over. Jason Statham is cool as hell in the movie, but his costar may be a good Chinese actress (she's much more famous here than she is in America, so's you know), but she just can't act in English. She reminded me of the horrendous performance by the heroine in First Blood Part II. At the time of this writing I've seen half of The Transporter II, which immediately comes off as a much better movie than the original, which places it in the diminutive category of sequels that surpass their original movies. Statham fans and hardcore action fans may get a kick out of The Transporter, but behind the high class action gloss and Statham's star power it's a b-movie at heart.",The Transporter
44,gwnightscream,"""Pretty Good Action Flick!""",6,14 July 2016,"This 2002 action film stars Jason Statham, Qi Shu, Francois Berleand and Matt Schulze. Statham (The Expendables) plays Frank, an ex-special forces soldier/mercenary who delivers and transports. Soon, he's hired for a job, but ends up breaking the rules of opening the package and finds Asian girl, Lai (Shu). Frank finds himself in a heavy situation and tries to protect her. Schulze (The Fast and the Furious) plays Wall Street, a corrupt businessman who tries to kill Frank and Lai and Berleand plays Inspector Tarconi, Frank's friend. This is pretty good, Statham is great in it, he & Shu have good chemistry and the fight sequences are impressive. I recommend this.",The Transporter
45,GOWBTW,Man! This movie is even better than I hoped for!,10,3 May 2003,"Man! I had a feeling this movie would be a big hit. AND IT IS!! The Transporter combines action with martial arts, romance, and intrigue all into one. I kept rewinding all the great action scenes shown. Especially the well timed catch will the gun, and the dropkick to the door ""The Transporter"" did. This merc was a one man army who doesn't like to be tricked! Or Ticked! Don't mess with The Transporter! Jason Statham will definitely be the next martial arts star of the 21st century! He rocks! He really intensify the audience with his moves and he's so hardcore, anyone with lemon for a brain should know better than to mess with ""The Transporter"". Being a mercenary is hard work, retaining the skills shouldn't be difficult. The music was good in the movie it suited it well. The lovely kidnap victim (Qi Shu) had a lot of mouth, but a lot of guts when her own father put her through hell all her life. She wouldn't turn on Frank after she helped her. Lots of action and adventure is what the movie provided, and it's a big keeper as well. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.",The Transporter
46,Captain_Couth,Jason Statham action star.,8,27 August 2005,"The Transporter (2002) was a fun action film that was directed by Jet Li's fight director Corey Yuen and it starred Jason Statham. Jason stars as Frank Martin. He's a hired gin who does driving jobs for a hefty fee. For his services he'll use his superb driving skills to get his paying customers out of a jam. He asks no questions and needs precise instruction in order to perfectly time his getaways. His number one rule is to never ask questions. One day he takes a gig from a sleazy and shady man named Betancourt (Matt Schulze). Instead of delivering the goods, he breaks his number one rule and peeks inside the package...A fun action film filled with bone breaking action and wild stunts. People have unfairly slammed this movie for being unrealistic. What do you expect? The action scenes are performed to flamboyant ans stylized you have to suspend belief. It's one of those movies that doesn't throw in realism all of a sudden to make the movie more interesting. Jason Statham is pretty cool as well as the Transporter and he seems legit, not another tough guy phony. HE looks like he can knock the tar out of you in a real fight. Co-stars Shu Qi (she learned to speak English phonetically for her role in this movie).Highly recommended.",The Transporter
47,elshikh4,Despite Many Hindrances.. This Movie Transports !,7,30 January 2009,"How did the girl manage to go into the second car while her hands, so her feet, were being tied up to a chair? Why the gang didn't send a simple guy with one gun to kill the Transporter and the girl at the first's house? (Great waste of ammo if you asked me!). How this Transporter gets illegal jobs to transport bank robbers, while his face is exposed for all??Naaaaa.. Don't bother yourself. It deals with shutting up, and shutting down, the brain. So at one point, when a bunch of bad guys attack the lead frantically, you'll notice how all of them is without guns, and after long-4-parts fight with them you'll see FINALLY the bad guys WITH the guns coming pretty late I suppose, or is it the right time, regarding the nature of it as straightforward pure direct-to-action flick. It's a typical moment to define what really this movie is all about.It looks like some of the action movies that were made in Europe in the 1960s & the movies of Hong Kong in the 1980s, being clever when it comes to deliver popcorn, so it's a good transporter itself. The action is wonderful, the backgrounds are gorgeous, Qi Shu was charismatic and childish, François Berléand was mildly funny, the music score is enjoyable putting a human feel to it, and the rest of the soundtrack drives the movie as a disco night.On the other hand, (Jason Statham) is really silly, looking more like his car. Yes, he did his share of fighting fairly, doing most of his stunts. But away from that he's metallic, and electronic, except for the few moments where he gives us his bad impression of Clint Eastwood!The motive of the lead, about smuggling Chinese people, can be replaced with anything else: money, gold, drugs, expensive art piece, nuclear bomb, kidnapped kid, et cetera. Of course the ""people"" will put a sensitive side to the character and make a human out of the (Statham). Though, the movie deals with them as if they're just like any of the previous choices. Anyhow, this is unmixed action time, so don't be BORING!I must say that (Matt Schulze) as the evil EVIL guy (Wall Street) was ugly, particularly with his idiot eyes. He almost said to the lead: ""Hey, there is a bomb in the bag I'm giving you, I'm evil man Ha Ha Haa!"". But, to tell you the truth, I think that (Ric Young)'s hairpiece was uglier!And what about the 2 police patrols that the transporter met while the girl's attempt to escape? He was a reason of their horrible death! Originally, to where he was taking them during their being in the car's trunk? But why the scriptwriters would bother themselves with points like that, you'll forget it anyway during the loud next sequences, and with the lead saving all the souls at the end, he's wholly forgiven!Watch out for the scene where the transporter survives a shower of bullets by hiding behind a door. You'll find that again at the next Transporter movie; I began to believe that doors can be bulletproof indeed!Nevertheless, it's saner than its sequel. For instance, you read that at (Statham)'s request, the producers took out a moment when his character deflecting a missile with a tea tray, at the assault on (Frank)'s house, as ""he didn't think audiences would believe it"". In the next movie, they'll listen to Statham less (it's something related to getting rid of a bomb in a car's bottom!).In this formula, I've been bothered the most by one part; when Jason Statham is forced to take off his shirt, being in one long fight with so many unarmed men, getting into a mud fight-like with dozen of them, then concluding this sequence by kissing another man (Ugh!) just to suck air out of him in the water!! It's not a haphazard; it's the way some movies want to be commercial even if cheaply and disgustingly.Anyway, you can watch it while traveling in a bus, or if you want to beat some people you hate, or at lonely night when you're not able to sleep. In fact, I read that the real money that this movie made was through the DVD sales.And yes, I think that the monkey in the photo with the child was (Statham) as a kid not the other way around.. Just kidding :)",The Transporter
48,thinker1691,""" I make it a practice to keep my promises. It's one of my rules! """,8,16 April 2012,"This action packed story is written by Luc Besson and directed by Louis Leterrier and is exactly as Besson envisioned it. Jason Statham plays an ex-Special Forces soldier named Frank Martin. Living quietly in a secluded, and isolated house on the Mediterran. Frank was hoping he could retire without conflict. Unfortunately, his unusual private practice of hiring out as a special delivery man, puts that dream in jeopardy. The Movie is called "" The Transporter "" and relates Frank's story of being able to deliver anything from point one to point two, providing his simple rules concerning his employment and his safety are not violated. Such is the tale until a man code name "" Wall Street "" (Matt Schulze) requires Frank to deliver a certain 'special' package (Qi Shu) without question. His personal rules violated, Frank becomes involved in more that just a delivery. When the heavies decide to reciprocate with violence, Frank is introduced to Inspector Tarconi (François Berléand) who believes that Frank is certainly a 'Person of Interest.' The rest of the movie becomes a fun filled adventure of high flying street chases, explosions and physical action involving Martial arts of the best kind. The result becomes the basis or foundation for future films in like manner or a series as I certainly would be interested in seeing more. Jason Statham is certainly the right actor for this movie, one that you certainly want to see more of. Excellent film and readily recommended. ****",The Transporter
49,freemantle_uk,A B-Movie for the MTV generation,6,15 July 2013,"Back in the 1990s Luc Besson was a top action director in the US and France, best known for films like Leon and Nikita. In the early part of the 21st Century, he turned to producing and one of his major hits was The Transporter, the film that made Jason Statham into an action star.Frank Martin (Statham) is an ex-military man who turned into a driver for hire in the South of France. He lives by three rules: No.1 never change the deal, No.2 no names, No.3 never open the package. But on a job he opens the package to find a Chinese woman (Shu Qi) tied up and gag, resulting with him crossing an American gangster, Bettencourt (Matt Schulze) who wants Frank dead. Frank has to work with the woman, Lai, and a police detective, Inspector Tarconi (François Berléand), to bring down Bettencourt and his operator.The Transporter takes a basic B-Movie plot and story and gives it an MTV flash. The highlight of the film is action sequences which director Corey Yuen injected a load of fun elements with martial arts, gun battles, an axe fight and the famous oil fight scene. There are flashy moments like when a gun is in the air and the downwards camera on a gun when a machine gun magazine clip drops to the ground. There is some weak CGI but it is rare and the best parts of the action is the practical effects and stunt work. The real problem with the action is at times there was too much quick cutting which made some of the action sequence and it made them hard to follow: this was the particularly the case with the fight in the bus which was too tight, too close and overly edited. The best sequence for me was the highway chase because it was easier to tell what was happening and for the most part the fighting and gun fights were well done.The Transporter was Statham's first leading role outside of Guy Ritchie's films. He had the action chops with his physique and his martial arts ability and he was already showing his shy wit. But he gave his character a weak American accent which kept slipping. Likely Statham had enough charisma and was able to give Frank enough menace in his look. Statham also had very good chemistry with Qi who did have charm as Lai. The pair worked well and were surprisingly believable in the context of their world.The Transporter lacked a threaten villain: Schulze played his role more as a man who is partier then a ruthless crime lord who will kill anyone who crosses him. Schulze's performance also did not help giving the character smug, frat boy characteristics. The film also introduces a character called Leon who was able to beat up and knock out Frank, leading you to think that there is going to be a showdown between the characters: but it never comes about, which is very disappointing.Stanley Clarke gave The Transporter a more modern, techno score which was fitting for the most part, especially when it becomes pumping for the action sequences near the end. The score combined by the French setting reminded me a little bit of The Bourne Identity. But The Bourne Identity is a much more intelligentially stimulating film.The Transporter is a very paced actioner that does not rest. There are fine action sequences throughout the film and a decent start to The Stath's action persona: but this is a film for Statham fans.",The Transporter
50,ianlouisiana,Absolutely bloody hilarious - a hoot from start to finish..............,6,6 September 2007,"Presumably M.Besson produced ""The Transporter"" between two more pressing engagements.Indeed one might be forgiven for thinking that ""produced"" might be too strong a word.For this is a film that has run amok.I lost count of the number of ""hommages""up on the screen to such an extent that it seemed one long ""hommage"" to dozens of infinitely better movies. To get to the particular rather than the general,the hero is a narcissistic criminal of indeterminate origin whose desire for anonymity is so strong that he leaves a box of snapshots and souvenirs on top of a cupboard.He is a man so unthinkably stupid that he uses his own car when hired as a getaway driver in a bank robbery.His sole attempt at concealing its identity consists of fitting revolving number plates,a device James Bond was using forty years ago.Duh......I think the Old Bill have rumbled that one son.For some reason not made clear he has a laissez - faire relationship with the local flic that is almost oedipal.He drives a black and shiny BMW penis - symbol with fine disregard for other road users and clearly needs a refreshment course on the Highway Code.He has - and you could have knocked me down with a rolled - up copy of ""Soldier of Fortune"" - a background in the military.And just in case you thought he was a clerk in the NAAFI there's a medal thrown carelessly in his ditty box.He is played by Mr J.Statham in a particularly tight - fighting suit.He is a man so vain as to be unable to resist gazing lovingly at his own image in every reflective surface he comes across.Presumably Mr Statham wishes to assume the mantle of Mr S.Seagal in the comedy action hero stakes,but I must say he has a lot of ground to make up.He is not as funny,neither does he display Mr Seagal's sang froid in dispensing mayhem.Mr Statham wrinkles his brow a lot to signify thought,something Mr Seagal never has to do.I am not entirely sure what accent Mr Statham attempts to assume,he appears to be a little confused himself at times,veering between Bob Hoskins and Joe Pesci in random fashion.To be fair to him he has very little to work with,he might as well be playing the tooth fairy for all the basis his character has in reality. There is a nice line in product placement,if I was considering doing a blag,for instance,I'd give serious consideration to big Beamer after watching this.And if I had shares in ""Orangina"" I would be well pleased. Mr Statham was prominent in ""Lock,stock and two smoking barrels"".I suspect ""The Transporter"" will appeal to the same audience of mainly lager - swilling wannabe geezers who will sit in front of their tvs burping happily trying not to knock their cans of Carling over as they reach for their Naan bread and Lamb Tikka.",The Transporter
51,dee.reid,"A few bumps mar an otherwise decent outing in ""The Transporter""",7,31 August 2005,"There's no question that Luc Besson is one of Europe's biggest action producers. I mean with the cult classics ""La Femme Nikita"" (1991) and ""The Professional"" (1994) behind him, he's basically been given the green-light for every big action picture he comes across. One of his latest and most ambitious projects was ""The Transporter,"" released in 2002.I have to admit this is one flick I approached with a very open mind - very open. I mean, I like Jason Statham. I think he's a pretty cool guy and at first, even I questioned his casting as Frank Martin in ""The Transporter."" But the problem is, and I'm assuming this is the result of the quickly edited action scenes (which were toned down to make the film ""PG-13""), he's not being given the room to really be the best he can be.As the lead character, he's a transporter. He can get you, your associates or your property anywhere, anytime, on time, no questions asked. But you know what? Common sense tells us that it was curiosity that killed the cat, and the cat in this picture thankfully doesn't die some horrible death but instead, curiosity yields him a break - a beautiful woman named Lai (Shu Qi) - bound and gagged, and in the trunk of his BMW.It's not spoiling much that she and Frank get together and as a result, are forced to do battle with shady and vicious American businessman Wall Street (Matt Schulze) and his army of high-kicking, disposable assassins. There's a little more to the plot and Lai, and the circumstances surrounding her appearance in the trunk of Frank's car, and it involves some smuggling of poor Chinese immigrants from China to Europe, where much of the action takes place.Speaking of action and there's plenty of it, Statham does display some pretty impressive moves but the frantic editing just doesn't do him justice. He obviously worked out for this part and there are frequent moments when his ripped torso is on display. He also (barely) manages to shy away any possible accusations that he's just a British novelty to American audiences. Director Corey Yuen (whose work on Jet Li's 2001 action film ""Kiss of the Dragon"" I admired), is behind it and Besson's got a producer credit.The problem may not be Statham because I think he's a really cool actor with a raspy British accent, but the script is worth some deeper examination by more thoughtful minds. There are plenty of holes and unanswered questions (i.e., the extent of Frank's military training and experiences, Lai and how she wound up with Frank and her quarrelsome relationship with her father who is played by Ric Young, and the plot with the Chinese smuggling).But why am I making such complaints? ""The Transporter"" is an action movie; no plot required. Despite some bumps in the road, ""The Transporter"" is pure action fun from beginning to end, and I got my free ticket to see ""The Transporter 2"" on Friday.7/10",The Transporter

However, when Frank transports his latest package he breaks one of his own rules on delivery resulting in his life being put in danger...The opening chase scene in this film is brilliant and set the bar for what this film should have been like for the rest of its running time. However, The Transporter is another example of a film where the opener is so explosive and exciting that it was always going to be a big ask for the rest of the film to play out in the same manner and sadly it doesn't....The story is fairly uninspiring and is barely given any focus; this isn't a problem in this particular genre if the film provides consistent thrills and spills and whilst there are thrills and spills at sporadic intervals there are also quite a few dull spots which sour the experience slightly. Statham is not the best of actors and like Arnie he is at his best when he is given lots of action scenes and cheeky dialogue that winks at the audience. To me, there is not enough action here and Statham was a little too dry and wasn't the commanding screen presence that he can be. Statham isn't helped by being saddled with Qi Shu who is a very poor sidekick and love interest.When the focus is on the action the film is quite good (as well as the very good opening scence) there are the action scenes with the trucks which were pretty good (reminiscene at times of the truck scenes in Raiders Of The Lost Ark), but like I say they come too few and far between for my liking leaving me feeling a little underwhelmed.The Transporter is watchable and is by no means a bad film (it does have some exciting and entertaining moments), but where plot and characters are weak it needs to compensate by thrilling its audience at every moment, but this film does not do that.

Frank Martin is a cool character but only the first film is good the others are TERRIBLE & try to be like a fast & furious film & i HATE that franchise!!! But yeah wanna see Statham do action old school style & be very cool then see this first entry.

60,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,The regular but still fun Statham material,6,20 March 2014,"Jason Statham is popular for obvious reasons. Most audiences enjoy Statham just for his sharp British accent and his athletic action chops. Of course, there is more to that when telling a story in film because that can't be the only thing the plot centers on. It just has to placed in the correct moments for the storyboard to move with flow. For this film, it definitely can be said for sure, that the flow of this movie is even. Yes, there are other things to address but those things will come. This is perhaps one of the few films people can enjoy that deals with consistent movement (like the The Fast and the Furious (2001) franchise in a way). The story is about an ex-military man, Frank Martin (Statham), who is covertly working as a transporter for hire - a man who basically moves things from one place to another. No questions are asked about what he's transporting; that's not apart of his deal. If the deal is broken, so are the rules and that's basically how things unfold. Upon taking what seems to be a routine job of ""transporting"", Martin discovers there may be more at stake and breaks his code of the deal. Thus ensuing him in a load of trouble. Of course, nothing he couldn't handle though and that's actually the surprising part of this movie.The screenwriters behind this movie are Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. Before this time, Besson was best known for writing Léon: The Professional (1994) and Kamen had written for The Karate Kid (1984). To many, those are extremely well written works. In six years they would write for Liam Neeson's Taken (2008). I guess they're writing slipped a little in quality around this time. That's not to say their writing is bad, it's just predictably clichéd. There are only a few areas that stand out. The areas that are clichéd are the one's dealing with character development in the protagonists and the knowledge of the antagonists.Statham playing an ex-militant is pretty much the same as how most ex- militant characters are written. They like working alone, but yet end up finding a love interest. They also have retained their martial arts and survival skills since their retirement, which allows them to fight their opponents with ease. It was actually more interesting in the beginning of the movie because it wasn't all about taking on 5 times as many opponents as it was getting the job of ""transporting"" done. Before the action finale to the film, Statham played a much slicker character - almost like a cheaper version of a James Bond. It was cool to watch him be clever and evade authorities by his driving skills or name changing license plates.Accompanying Mr. Martin in his travels is the thing that makes him break his rules; a girl named Lai (Qi Shu). Here, she explains to Martin in her best English about a crate shipment of people that are being given to some wealthy guy. It's actually not clearly stated what is purpose of this. Illegal immigration? Slave labor? What? Matt Schulze plays the wealthy bad guy and he doesn't play badly at it either. In fact, viewers may find his performance a little more energetic than Statham's. Not sure if it was meant to be that way, but Statham pretty much plays it straight faced. I would like to know how Schulze's character was able to track Martin wherever he went though. It's a little preposterous since there was no clear indication on how Martin's place of living was discovered.When it comes to action sequences however, that's a different matter. Since Statham is well equipped for this type of genre, there is no doubt Statham knows what he's doing, and those scenes filmed will be entertaining. Which leads to a very specific moment that must be pointed out - the oil slick fight. This particular scene isn't something action fans may see every day. It's a very unique action sequence and it's quite baffling to know how it could've been executed. The music provided by Stanley Clarke was an interesting take too. The sound mix contained some orchestra but mostly jazz work tones that actually meshed well with the scenes that were filmed. It surprised me. Overall, it's your standard Statham film. Nothing far from what's already been made.The Transporter had a good premise and started out with class (thanks to the music). By the end though, it's a standard Jason Statham action movie that has consistent flow and doesn't have bad pacing.",The Transporter
61,lewiskendell,"Nothing special, but still entertaining.",6,29 January 2016,"The Transporter movies all share the same basic elements. Fantastic action scenes, barely-there stories, and Jason Statham. In the original Transporter, we're introduced to Frank, Statham's character, and the absolute bare minimum of his background. The rest of the movie is car chases, explosions, and fights.I won't go into the plot, because it's pretty much only here to give Statham a pretext to hand out his butt-kickings. My favorite thing about these movies is that Statham is never really in danger of dying or being beaten. If he's fighting someone, they MAY get in a hit or two before puts them down. Even if it's like, 20 guys with machine guns, and all he has for a weapon is his shirt. The fight scenes are pretty cool, you can always rely on this series to add a few new wrinkles to the standard old sequences.There's some kind of smuggling going on that Qi Shu's dad is involved in, and Matt Shulze is somehow involved in it too. And François Berléand plays some kind of cop who is also Jason's friend, or something. Qi is the eye candy/damsel in distress/love interest, Francois helps move the plot along, and the rest of the cast are bad guys. That's pretty much it. Seriously.Don't watch The Transporter if you're looking for a well-written script or some compelling character development. Pop it in when you want to see some bad guys get the crap kicked out of them, pretty explosions, and a pretty girl.",The Transporter

And second, the ending, which, remarkably, is an almost scene by scene copy of the ending in the James Bond flick, LICENCE TO KILL. I mean, there are homages and then there are ripoffs, and the ending in THE TRANSPORTER is a total ripoff of the ending in the 007 movie. It's unreal. I'm surprised Brocoli corp & MGM/UA didn't sue. During the climax, in both films, there are two trucks transporting illegal goods, with the villains in two cars driving behind the trucks. In both films, the hero flies over the moving vehicles in a crop-duster and lands on one of the trucks. In both films, the hero battles with the driver of one of the trucks and gains control of it. In both films, the cars try to shoot the hero by driving next to the trucks. In both films, the hero ends up underneath the truck and his shot at by the villain in the cars with machine guns, etc. There's no need to go on. The whole thing is ridiculously similar. The scenery even looks similar in both films.Except for a couple of ok fighting scenes, THE TRANSPORTER was an almost complete waste of time.",The Transporter

66,Prashast_Singh,Pure popcorn entertainer!,10,17 February 2019,"I had a great time watching The Transporter.It's a pure popcorn entertainer with terrific action, and a great story too.It's not a dramatic or very serious film, it's meant to be enjoyed and I'm telling you that if you like action movies, this movie is not to be missed.It's another highly entertaining French action film written by Luc Besson, one of the best action movie screenwriters.Jason Statham is obviously a delight to watch! He plays a very sharply written character bound by rules and discipline. He really kills it in the uniquely crafted action sequences. You get to see a very balanced and ideal kind of action hero in the form of Frank Martin, the character played by him. The cast is full of great characters and almost everyone gets a good share in the film.And yes, it's an out-and-out action film, so action lovers are definitely in for a treat. All the nonstop action is captured and executed very well. Several moves are so great that you might want to rewind and see them again. Explosions and car chases are done brilliantly, while it's the fight sequences which have been done with extreme sincerity and perfection.Given that it's a 2002 film, The Transporter (or Le Transporteur) stands tall as per action movie standards. It's still quite fresh and fun to watch although you'll find some elements to be similar in movies that came after it (even today). Still, it's the freshness in the execution, uniqueness in the script and excellence in the action that makes The Transporter an all-time entertaining French action classic. Must watch.",The Transporter
67,PatrynXX,Not bad. Amount of action in the movie is kewl.,6,24 April 2003,"(spoilers??)I thought this movie was pretty good.  Jason here makes a good case to be in a Bond film as well.  He doesn't look that bad in a suit.  Course I know some Bond fans might have a fit, but I'm one of them and I'm not having a fit.The plot is a bit silly, but the amount of action and explosions and kicking the bad guys and going thru doors simply makes you forget that.  This up and coming star is really impressing me.  One thing I don't get, does he have a shirt fetish?  He seems to love taking his shirt off.  This happens 4-5 times throughout the movie.  Especially interesting was the grease scene.  This movie has some humor infused into the movie, and this is a fine example.If you love ""leave your brain at the door"" type movies, you'll love this one.  Too bad many people haven't heard of this movie.  I loved it the moment I saw the trailer last year.6/10Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 10/10",The Transporter
68,brchthethird,"Not much going on plot-wise, but still a whole lot of fun",7,9 November 2014,"While it certainly won't win any awards for originality (nor did it), THE TRANSPORTER is probably the best solo vehicle for Jason Statham that I've seen up to this point (to include stuff that has come out more recently). It's an all-thrills, no frills action movie with minimal character development and a logically incoherent plot, but the action sequences and Jason Statham's charisma as a leading man more than make up for the flaws in the narrative. Certain elements date it a little bit (a few soundtrack cuts in particular), and it almost feels like a relic of the 90's except for the fact that this came out in 2002. Still, I have great nostalgia for these types of movies and I had a great time watching it. Not only that, but there was some humor peppered into the mix which makes it contrast favorably to other movies that take themselves a little too seriously. Overall, this is a must-see if you're a fan of Jason Statham or action movies in general.",The Transporter
69,MadamWarden,TRANSPORT ME TO ACTION,8,18 September 2021,This is not subtle drama. This is action at its best. Statham was his best in this early display of his powers and torso. The oil fight scene is slick!Sadly the follow-ups not so good but this is really worth a watch. Great fun!!,The Transporter
70,CitizenCaine,Statham Good In First Starring Effort,6,28 November 2008,"Frank Martin is the transporter, a bad ass guy who transports criminals or their requests for a price. As long as the criminals play by his rules, Martin doesn't have a problem. This is readily apparent in the opening scene when Martin argues with four criminals who pile into his BMW, claiming they only said there would be three passengers. Martin doesn't budge until they acquiesce, which means offing one of themselves. Jason Statham inhabits the role of the transporter perfectly, but a promising film for the first fifteen minutes gets bogged down with a script that disappoints the audience. On his second job, Martin almost immediately breaks one of his own rules, and the film loses some steam as the character commits some blunders the audience doesn't expect of a bad ass guy. The film becomes more formulaic during the scenes when the female lead (Qi Shu) has screen time. Martin gets mixed up in human trafficking and of course the girl too. Technically, the film has multiple continuity errors which are more noticeable than in most films. Statham and the terrific action sequences make the film watchable, however over the top they are. The fight scenes are good, but the opening car chase is the highlight of the film. Luc Besson produced the film and co-wrote the screenplay which is inconsistent in tone, and action specialist Corey Yuen directed the film. **1/2 of 4 stars.",The Transporter
71,phubbs,The Transporter,6,11 May 2019,"Written and produced by iconic French action director Luc Besson, this was his second attempt to bring Asian action to the mainstream in Europe (and kinda crack into the US on a personal level). Yes Asian action was no secret back then (although it wasn't huge outside of Asia) but this was Asian action with French flair.The story is pretty simple. Ex-military man Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a transporter, a transporter of anything no questions asked. He has three rules; no names, no alterations to the deal, and don't look inside the package. Whilst delivering a package he notices it moving. Eventually, after much deep thought, he opens the package and discovers a bound and gagged female. He is somewhat shocked but carries on with his delivery.Upon delivering the package to the client he is offered another job. Midway through this job the package explodes and almost kills him. The client, a Mr. Bettencourt (Matt Schulze) tricked him and tried to whack him because Martin broke the rules, he opened the package (kinda understandable actually). This obviously forces Martin to return to Bettencourt's estate and take vengeance by killing some of his men and stealing a car. Alas the car has the bound and gagged female inside. Martin must now protect himself and the woman who has also revealed that Bettencourt is trafficking people, so there's that too.Now, this movie was never very original, not by a long shot. The fact that Besson was involved helped as he was seen as more of a cult director at the time. The Asian action blend and influence from director Corey Yuen was seen as fresh at the time. And Statham drew intrigue because here was an action man who wasn't your standard handsome A-list movie star with big muscles; he was British and looked and sounded more like a villain...with muscles.With that being said there is enough to like here for sure. The first half of this movie is easily the better half as we are given a very likeable action thriller that is clearly very Besson-esque. We meet Martin who is a disciplined, calm and collected, suit-wearing professional who only speaks when necessary. He drives a souped-up, high spec, black BMW which he drives like a badass, but again only when required. The plot is basic but engaging and the action is swift and brutal but believable. It is only once Martin inadvertently saves the girl that things start to go downhill with silliness.For a start it takes an age before we actually find out why this female (Lai played by Shu Qi) has been kidnapped, which is stupid. When she is picked up by Martin she has no real idea who he is and if he's trustworthy, yet she never really tries to escape. Hell, even when Martin takes her back to his place she STILL doesn't try to escape! I mean, this guy could be planning to rape and kill her, but she ends up totally trusting him, covering for him when the police show up, and even making him food! She basically gets all cozy with Martin without even knowing him or what his plans are and considering her situation, it's weird.Things get even more out of hand when the bad guys show up in the middle of the day armed to the teeth with guns and rocket launchers and destroy Martin's residence. All this in clear view of anyone, but nothing happens and no police are called. Luckily Martin has yet another luxurious residence not too far away (of course) so it's all good. And the female he rescued (who is kinda his captive now) offers sex to make up for all the trouble she's caused, because of course she does. The really odd thing though is Lai trusts and helps Martin so much throughout the movie, but when it comes to a point when Martin really does need her verbal assistance with a confrontation between the police and the bad guys, she doesn't say a word!I must also point out the quite terrible musical score throughout this picture. An odd blend of your typical action themes with soft orchestral moments which feel completely out of place for the most part. It really is quite weird because at times it makes the movie feel like a low budget production, like it's been tacked on because they had nothing else to use.Anyone who knows Luc Besson will know this movie and just what to expect. We all know Besson has a hitman/hitwoman fetish and since his 1990 offering 'Nikita' has essentially done the same thing time and time again switching between male and female leads. Although 'The Transporter' is nowhere near as solid in overall quality as his earlier hitman flicks (the other being 'Leon' in 1994), this first offering does still have plenty to enjoy. It's just a shame that the movie slowly degenerates into a stupid mess which was eventually doubled down on with the even stupider sequels.6.5/10",The Transporter

There's a better story here than the one told, but star Jason Statham delivers the goods and has a real future as an action star. Statham is the most virile action hero since Sam Elliot and is built like a hairy Greek god. He also sounds like Billy Idol. I saw this movie primarily to see Qi Shu, who impressed me so much in Jackie Chan's ""Gorgeous"". Qi Shu has the kind of face that looks as if it were made of the parts of two different beautiful women. Her mouth certainly doesn't go with her eyes and nose and keeps her from being stunningly beautiful. However, she uses her mouth the way many actors use their eyes, and her contribution to ""The Transporter"" and cinema is largely due to that expressive mouth. She's perfect in ""The Transporter,"" giving her character much more than is written.What keeps ""The Transporter"" from being first rate is the directing and editing. Much of the dialogue is unintelligible and some of the action scenes suffer from unwise editing. Watch the ""deleted scenes,"" which are actually extended fights and you'll see what I mean. Had the fight scenes been left intact,the movie be worth a ""7"". As presented, however, I give ""The Transporter"" a ""6"".",The Transporter
74,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,An international action thriller!,8,18 September 2005,"This is a very entertaining piece of action cinema. Jason Statham plays the transporter of the title who (appropriately) transports packages for the highest bidder. Naturally his clients are shady crime world members, after all he is not just a Sunday ride or a trip to the grocery store. The Transporter is a rule abiding, martial arts fighting, pedal to the medal driving professional who knows how to get the job done and get it done right. The story has Frank Martin (Statham) delivering a package to a client cross-country and he unwillingly (well almost) looks into the package, thus breaking one of his strict rules of trade. Then, in short, all hell break loose. Granted that this movie is not much in the plot department, but for action it has few peers. For all of you Hong Kong action film lovers, here is a film produced outside of Hong Kong that follows that same relentless formula you love.Also, one cannot help but look at the credits: a french director and producer/writer, a British star, a fight choreographer from Hong Kong, a plot involving Chinese criminals, and the hero's car is German. Basically an international action thriller! Also with this movie Jason Statham has cemented himself as leading man and will undoubted do many more action movies in the future, including the sequel to this. 8/10Rated PG-13: violence and action",The Transporter
75,johnstonjames,A Fun Diversion. Not Much More.,7,26 June 2010,"i liked it. it took me a long time to finally watch one of these films (how many are there again?), but it was better than i expected.i can't say i just love Luc Besson. i find him interesting but that's about it. i can't say i relate to a movie based on what? some BMW promo series on the internet? you gotta be kidding. how (no pun) commercial.actually this film seemed loosely based on Walter Hill's film 'The Driver' which was much deeper and a better film. this film was just more cranked up and testosterone charged. that doesn't always make a better film. Walter Hill's film has a better script, is more reflective and is a good example of contemporary (contemporary enough, that was the 80's) film noir.in defense of 'Transporter' i will say this. it wasn't Michael Bay, and at least in this first film (haven't seen the others), it used real stunts and not a lot of CGI stunts. i miss the old days when a stunt or an explosion was done for real and not just done with CGI (even when it's state of the art you can always tell it's CGI). it was to the 'Transporter's' credit that they actually staged pretty much all the stunts unlike 'Transformers' which had a lot of the action inter-spliced with CGI effects.i didn't think the plot was so bad or nonexistent, it was just kind of simple. but it had a good message about not treating human beings like slaves or commodities. it was solidly directed if not a little too ""busy"", and the actors were likable and sexy and, let's face it, Jason Statham is outrageous to watch in action. a sort of European Bruce Lee.not gonna make any attempt to say this was great cinema or anything, but it was entertaining, pretty much did what it professed to do, and it probably should be treated with a little bit more respect than it seems to have gotten from critics and audiences.",The Transporter
76,Pedro_H,Silly Hong Kong action thriller transported - for box office reasons - to the South of France.,5,14 December 2004,"Given that politics and old age have side-tracked the last generation of action stars a search for new generation must proceed a-pace. Jason Statham was OK in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and a little better in Snatch (both directed by fellow Brit Guy Richie) so he is given the reluctant nod in this action no-brainer. The fact that he can do stunts helps too (although not all of them, unless he grew more hair while parachuting!) making him more than suitable for this nervous try out. Sadly he can't do the needed American accent to save his life!JS plays a strange ""no questions asked"" transporter. The guy charges more than Federal Express, but Federal Express don't allow the transportation of girls in sacks with tape across their mouths. When our hero breaks his own rules and interferes with ""the package"" all kinds of problems unfold.What we have here is - in all reality - a Hong Kong pot boiler with a bigger special effects budget. Sadly the script seems to have cost the same as it would down Sweat Shop Avenue and some of the dialogue is truly gut turning and terrible. Clearly the work of people that don't have English as their first language. However when it moves, it moves well, in a James Bond kind of way. The modern audience might not know it, but the quality of the stunts on display would have probably knocked the 1960's audience on to the cinema floor. How times have moved on!This product has nothing further to report on other than the fact that Taiwanese female lead - Oi Shu - is sexy beyond belief.

80,movieguy1021,The Transporter: 6/10,6,26 October 2002,"Car chases are about the coolest stunt in an action movie. To my latest count, The Transporter had three.Frank (Jason Statham) is a transporter: he delievers packages from one bad guy to the next, no questions asked. Or he may even carry passangers, as seen from the first scene. But when he opens a package that seems to be moving and screaming, things start to turn to the worse. Soon everybody is trailing Frank and trying to kill him. Just an ordiniary day in the life of a transporter.The opening car chase scene is the coolest one I've ever seen in movies. Sure it's unlikely (nay...impossible), but this movie isn't about what can happen in real life. The subsequent chases pale in comparision, but are still pretty cool.The plot, however, is anything but cool. In the first half, the plot was the consequence of opening the package. In the second half, it's about 400 Asian immigrants and the girl (Qi Shu) from the package's father working for the bad guy. Or something like that. Action movies like this are supposed to have you not really think about anything except for basic plot and explosions (like the one at the rest stop...awesome!), but you had to follow the plot or else you wouldn't understand what was happening.The best non-car-chase fight sequence was in the bus station. Buses...$35,000. Fighting ten guys on an oiled floor...priceless. At some times, Statham's moves seemed like he was break-dancing. Speaking of Statham, he could be the next action hero. With his Bond-like stunts and his Diesel-like build, move over Brosnan! There's a new hero in town.Shu was good as a girl with tape over her mouth, but she soon became an obnoxious person who wasn't fun to be with. Shu, and almost everyone else in the movie, had accents that were hard to understand a lot of times. If they learned anything from The Osbournes, it is that they can put subtitles in English-it'll help!The music was right on-key, helping tense the situation and then relax us, and then tense us up again. In the beginning, the sound FX really helped to bring out the quality of the sound. Music can be obnoxious if used in the wrong places, but in some places, like The Transporter, it helps bring out the mood.The bad guys, on the con side of the film, were so one-dimensional that they must have aced Stupid Bad Guys 101. On the test: Question 1: True or False: When the person you're supposed to kill disappears, just assume that he died. They must of tried to kill him and ""succeeded"" three times. What a load of idiots. And some of the film was so utterly unbelieveable. Statham just knows how to scuba-dive, parachute, has a giant house with an underwater passage to another house connected to it and has a million Mercedeses. Right...Well, enough of my mumbo-jumbo. If you just skipped down here to have me cut to the chase, here it is: Fun, mucho action, and some awesome chases counter against one-dimensional bad guys and horrible plot.

And there were some very impressive scenes. But ultimately the action wasn't quite high-level enough to sustain my interest in the face of many plot holes.The motivations of the characters didn't make much sense. The policeman and the bad guy are friends for no reason I can see. I didn't feel any chemistry in the romance. There is a father-child relationship that doesn't make any sense. The protagonist is one of those criminals with a heart of gold, except in the first 20 minutes of the film, he does some incredibly ugly stuff I won't spoil for you. I can't empathize with a protagonist who'd do that. Some of the comedy with the lead actress fell flat. (You can't miss her, she the only woman in the entire movie with a speaking role.) A lot of stuff blows up, which is good, I just couldn't get the plot points out of my mind.Who should see this film:-- Action movie lovers only, and then only on a rainy day.

No questions asked. Frank adheres to a strict set of rules, which he never breaks. Rule One: Never change the deal. Rule Two: No names--Frank doesn't want to know who he's working for, or what he's transporting. Rule Three: never look in the package. However Frank's newest delivery makes him break some of his rules.He's been hired by an American known only as ""Wall Street"" to make a delivery; but when Frank stops along the route, he notices his package is moving. Violating Rule Three, Frank looks inside the bag, finding its contents to be a beautiful, gagged woman played by Qi Shu. Frank realises what evil man Wall Street is and he sets about destroying a human trafficking organisation. he gets some help from his friend and Police Inspector Tarconi played brilliantly by François Berléand who adds some humour to the film (and subsequent Transporter films).But what makes this such a great film is the introduction to film of the great character of Frank Martin, brilliantly played by Jason Statham.

88,Flagrant-Baronessa,All Quiet on the B-action Front,6,2 September 2006,"A hard-boiled ex-soldier (Jason Statham) runs a private 'transporting' business in which he moves goods for clients from point A to point B, no questions asked, no packages opened and no names exchanged. One day, he breaks his own rule by opening the large bag he is transporting and finds a beautiful gagged woman (Qi Shu) in it.Jason Statham of Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels fame slips into the buff testosterone-fuelled action-hero role with almost effortless conviction and the perfection with which he delivers his cheesy lines deserves credit (""All right, that's enough juice for now.""). From the campy winks, the fast-paced drop-kicks and packing punches and just generally badass attitude, Statham clearly masters the B-action genre. He knows what he needs to do to entertain the audience, and he does it like he means business. Hardcore, in other words.However his ""American"" accent clearly deserves less credit. If you were BLOWN AWAY by Kevin Costner in Prince of Thieves or Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta, you will like his efforts. Ditto Qi Shu whose performance keeps us guessing (mostly about what the hell she is saying). In all fairness, I thought she was really cute as Lai  the woman who complicates things by popping up from the bag, but also viciously annoying with her little high-pitched girly screams and submissive approach. Thankfully, Statham and Shu's on-screen chemistry makes up for this and facilitates the whole plot on an important, fundamental level. Because they are so different (macho-man vs. girly girl), they somehow look great juxtaposed.This plot never strays from its template story. Ever. It's simple. It's straightforward. It's action-packed and amazingly fast-paced. Twenty minutes fly past like five. But enough praise, because ""The Transporter"" really isn't a good movie. Even if you're looking for cheap adrenaline kicks this would not be the first film I'd recommend (it's probably be Poseidon [2006], ha) -- this simply lacks 'oomph' and the good guys are too GOOD and the bad guys are too BAD. Nothing new -- next, please!6/10",The Transporter
89,rajatdahiyax,Jason Statham!!!!!!!,8,9 February 2015,"An outlaw finds his life becoming all the more dangerous when he turns against a gang of criminals in this action drama. Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a former Special Forces officer who lives on the French Mediterranean and has a lucrative second career as a underworld courier for hire. Martin will deliver anything anywhere, but he has three iron-clad rules - once the plan is in motion it cannot be changed, neither he nor his customers are to ever use their real names, and under no circumstances will he open the package. Martin is hired to make a delivery to a wealthy but unscrupulous American known as Wall Street (Matt Schulze), but after taking possession of the package he realizes that whatever is inside happens to be alive. Breaking his own rule, Martin opens the bag to discover a beautiful Asian woman, Lai (Shu Qi), who is bound and gagged. Lai briefly escapes, but Martin captures her, and delivers her to Wall Street as promised. However, after being given a parcel to deliver by Wall Street, Martin finds out what Wall Street is up to - in partnership with Lai's father Mr. Kwai (Ric Young), Wall Street is part of a scheme to smuggle Asian illegal aliens into France. Martin's conscience gets the better of him, and he sets out to rescue Lai and put Wall Street and Mr. Kwai out of business; however, as if this wasn't enough of a challenge, Martin discovers a French detective, Tarconi (Francois Berleand) has gotten wind of his illegal business.",The Transporter

This 007-like role can only be played by a Brit, and Statham does an excellent job. An action film that doesn't have much meaningful dialog, but just enough to make the characters interesting. I love the dry humor, and pun filled lines. After breaking his own rules, you see very well choreographed and exciting fight scenes  albeit not very believable  that's not what this film is about. Good, relatively clean, fun with some nice twists as the transporter tries to return to his simple lifestyle.",The Transporter
91,diac228,The mindless action film that actually entertains,8,5 August 2005,"Accept The Transporter for what it is and then the rest is just uphill from there. The Transporter is this European film that is exactly the kind of film that I had been looking for: it is no question a truly mindless action flick with a lot of action and also a ton of stunts, and very little plot to weave it in together. Who needs a plot anyway? Despite being a bomb at the United States box office, it gained enough popularity over a small cult following to garnish a sequel. And if there is a movie that deserves a sequel, it should be this one. Not enough people gave Jason Statham a chance years ago, and maybe this time the American public gets to see how good he really is.This fast-paced film is about a man who gets paid to move stuff around, and he never questions what it is and who it is going to, he is simply used as a transport. Retied mercenary, suddenly Frank Martin grows a heart when his next transfer is actually an Asian female woman. After breaking one of the rules (opening the package) disaster erupts, and now it is up to him to end all the chaos. Yes, the plot sounds a bit on the uncreative end, but guess what, there is only one reason to see this movie, and it is for the action.The Transporter has more action than most American films out today, and this movie happens to be only 92 minutes long. The movie opens with a massive chase sequence, and the movie ends with a massive chase/action sequence that despite it resembling Raiders of the Lost Ark, it still keeps you on the edge of your seat until the sequence is finished. In between the two big scenes are several more fights here and there that were well choreographed and almost perfectly executed. And unlike most other action movies like The Bourne Supremacy, the action isn't so in-your-face that you have no idea what is going on, the camera is far away enough from the subjects that it allows you to see everything that is happening, and also at times, slows down so you can catch your breath and be able to realize what had just happened. The acting is certainly not Oscar-caliber, but it gets the job done. Jason Statham has plenty of potential in becoming the next big action star, as long as the United States gives him a chance. Remember it took Jackie Chan over a decade before finally coming out with a movie that American audiences went to see, which was Rumble in the Bronx. Oh, before I forget, the soundtrack to the movie was awesome.Bottom Line: I use Jackie Chan as an example for one reason alone, because Jackie Chan and Jason Statham are both stars of two of among the most underrated and underapprieciated action films in a very long time. Just like Rumble in the Bronx, The Transporter has a weak plot, but is totally made up for with the insane amount of action and kung-fu that makes this film a perfect summer popcorn flick. I personally find this film very entertaining, and get over the fact that it received very little attention and give it a chance, I am sure you will like it. The Transporter: Finally, the mindless action flick that does not try too hard to have a decent plot.Score: 9/10",The Transporter
92,Magow-Intermean,The Transporter Review,8,30 March 2019,"Ex-soldier Frank Martin now makes a living on the French Riviera as an underworld courier who has strict rules of operation: never change the deal, never use real names, never look inside the package. But when he breaks his own code, he quickly becomes the target of a vicious human smuggling ring.
Three things to do with a PhD:
a) use it for self-improvement;
b) use it for the betterment of mankind; or
c) say ""bollocks"" to it all and write a bunch of action movies.Tough choice, but if you're Robert Mark Kamen, co-screenwriter of The Transporter and proud owner of a PhD in Anthropology, it's gotta be c).Kamen's got a nice line in churning out cheap, cheerful, chop-socky movies (first Kiss Of The Dragon, now this) along with writer-producer Luc Besson. And don't get us wrong - we're grateful. Even if it's pretty evident after ten minutes that PhD stands for ""pretty hokey dialogue"". Or is that ""plot hardly discernible""?No matter. The Transporter exists purely to turn our very own Jason Statham into an action star capable of putting the willies up Vin Diesel. It succeeds admirably.Post-Ghosts Of Mars, if anyone had suggested that big, bald, brusque Jase could hold his own as an action hero, they'd have been laughed out of town. And while he doesn't exactly deliver an acting masterclass (his 'American' accent doesn't quite stand up to the rigours of actually opening his mouth and talking), this is all about kicking ass and taking names.And the model-turned-actor is impressive enough - athletic, powerful and displaying hitherto unseen martial arts prowess - to deserve a crack at bigger things.Here, though, his character starts out with an intriguing amorality, but quickly becomes Mr. Bog Standard Action Guy, taking on hordes of villains armed at times merely with a sweater and, in one hilarious scene, an oil slick and bike pedals.If all that improvisational guff sounds very Jackie Chan, that's deliberate. The spirit of Hong Kong action movies hangs heavily over The Transporter, most notably in the CG-free fight scenes which, thanks to former fight choreographer Yuen, have enough zing and originality to satisfy even Hong Kong aficionados. Helpfully, they also take your mind off the nonsense in between, complete with dreadful dialogue from Robert Mark Kamen.He has a PhD, you know.Statham impresses in a movie that is simultaneously the best (the fight scenes) and worst (everything else) action movie of the year.

Soon I'll be hiring Never Ending Story 3.I picked this one because (a) I saw they've made a sequel, which means either the first one was good, or lots of people went to see it (b) it has Jason Statham in it, who hasn't let me down before.The movie follows the Transporter (Statham), which is a much better name than ""The Courier"" or ""The Parcel Guy"". The Transporter's mission statement basically reads do the job, do it smart, don't break your rules (think DeNiro's character in ""The Score"". When one inadvertently gets involved in one of his jobs, his simple business is turned upside down. He's not going to get uninvolved without lots of flying kicks, explosions, oil and a cool cop.Kept me entertained, but a pretty shallow script, weak supporting cast and some ridiculous action sequences that would make Jackie Chan wince.

Frank has 4 rules when it comes to transporting and they are ""Never Change The Deal"", ""No Names"", Never Open The Package"" and ""Never Make A Promise You Can't Keep"". He eventually breaks one of the rules by opening the package which turns out to be a kidnapped woman named Lai (Shu Qi). He eventually delivers the package to Wall Street but gets double crossed and now Frank must help Lai by rescuing enslaved people from China.

97,smakawhat,"Like the French setting, true ripe camembert",4,14 October 2002,"Enter Jason Stratham, a guy who has certainly kicked in some steroids and new muscle entering the new found territory of 'the action hero'.  Certainly along stretch from his roles in Snatch, and Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels.  Jason is the ""Transporter"" and ex military guy living in France who delivers stuff for 'dubious clientele' so long as they follow his rules. However, the transporter screws up by breaking the rules by opening a package and getting involved when he ends up transporting a Chinese woman to someone.At this point you want to know where the story is suppose to go, but what really happens is it goes nowhere.  Sure it's an action film, with a great car chase and some great unique fight sequences.  But at some point the people making this tried to make the story solve itself within 5 minutes in an office room as they start introducing more bad guys, and try to write up a hasty conclusion.From this point on you can't even like the film for its stupidness.  It doesn't even get to maintain some degree of B movie camp.  Worse is that the acting when needed particualry between Straham and You Qi is so chessy and SOOOOOOOO bad it is cringe inducing to listen to.  Like the great French setting this movie reaked of over ripe camembert.It's too bad cause Stratham is definitly passible as an action hero, and the oil slick fight scene is quite ingenious.  But the HORRIBLY bad acting, horrible dramatic moments, and lack of any comedic fun make this film DEATHLY DULL.  There are also some unbelievable continuity errors the most obvious being that one of the rules for the transporter is that nobody knows his name, but 1/2 way through the film at one point, You Qi is calling him Frank for no reason or explanation.

This would be well and good if the character had set this up, but because it's never mentioned again, we are left to believe that this is simply an AMAZING coincidence.The movie is loaded with AMAZING coincidences, but the action sequences are exciting, and there's never an awkward attempt to bring a brain into the proceedings (like they did in, say, the first Spider-Man movie).

99,basrutten,Very feeble attempt at cool action movie,2,17 September 2005,"""The Transporter"" was recommended to be my a colleague as one of the worst movies he had seen in recent years. While I usually take claims like this with a grain of salt, in this I think there was a lot of truth in it. ""The Transporter"" is an extremely lackluster, uninspired attempt at making a cool action movie, which manages to screw up in almost every aspect.First, there's the story. It makes very little sense, and is so predictable and full of clichés that you can guess where it's going to go almost immediately. None of the characters, including the hero, are even remotely interesting, and everything is so rushed that there is no room for character development at all. You might as well watch some cardboard cut-outs.Billed as an action comedy, ""The Transporter"" does indeed offer a lot of action, but only very little comedy. There are some things that are supposed to be funny, but, with two or three exceptions, they really aren't. Unless completely inept and cartoony bad guys are still supposed to be funny...That leaves only the action. And while there certainly is a lot of it, and in spite of some impressive pyrotechnics, it's for the most part really dull. Apparently, the makers of this cinematic dud have gone to great length to make sure that the main characters comes across as really cool. The problem is that the things he does aren't even remotely possible in the real world, and are for the most part so exaggerated that they become unintentionally funny rather than cool. On top of that, the hero is so completely invulnerable that any tension there might have been is completely ruined.And finally, there's the music, which is in one world awful. For some reason, just about every action sequence in the movie is accompanied by either some annoying hip hop song or some totally nondescript and monotonous rock number.I wish I could find something positive to say, but there really isn't anything I can think of. ""The Transporter"" is an utterly hollow movie, with virtually no story and no characters to care about, full of action that is so exaggerated that it becomes simultaneously dull and unintentionally funny.* out of ******",The Transporter

101,Shiva-11,The Transporter delivers!,7,19 October 2002,"Frank Martin, provides the platinum standard among couriers: he will deliver any package, any where to any one, on time, no questions asked. Understandably,  his rates are a bit steeper than FedEx and his rules a bit more stringent. When he agrees to deliver a duffel bag Frank breaks Martin rule # 3  never look in  the package  only to discover that the contents are alive, kicking and beautiful.  What's a guy to do ?  Throw her back in the bag and complete the contract of course! Unfortunately Frank's employer is unhappy the indiscretion and his idea of a customer service complaint is to eliminate the server. The opening frantic car chase through the streets and along the boardwalks of Nice, sets the tone for the for the rest of the movie  infused with equal parts action and humor you quickly realize  that this is not a film that  takes itself seriously.  Co-written and produced by  Luc Besson (The Professional and The Fifth Element) it follows in the vein of his earlier films:  reluctant protagonist who bends the rules to do his job, shows a little humanity inadvertently becoming a champion for the oppressed, and having to dodge bullets, bombs and badmen along the way. .   The lead captures this spirit.Jason Statham's Frank is a no nonsense ex-special services minutia obsessed professional who refuses to be rattled even as the world is coming down around him (literally in one scene). Statham, best known as the fast talking Turkish in Snatch, possesses both the bulk and matter of fact glib finesse necessary to be an action hero.  The intricately choreographed and numerous marital arts sequences  - the best I've seen in a non Asian film  bear the trademarks of its Hong Kong predecessors and confirm that he also possesses the requisite physicality to carry a film in this genre. Statham may well turn out to be the next Bruce Willis (or at least his British counterpart.)There are several glaring problems with this film: the people smuggling subplot seems to have been an afterthought,  the dialogue is often unintentionally laughable, and then there are those pesky laws of physics  But none of that matters - I wanted high octane fun and pyrotechnics, and I wasn't disappointed..

The opening car chase is awesome, the house fight scene is excellently done, and it's accentuates by some interesting music. The house attack is explosive and cool, and the rocks figh and bus/warehouse fight are legit. The warehouse fight is just insane.

Of course he decides to help her...Entrance car chase as we watch what Frank is doing for living has resemblance with Pirès/Besson 'Taxi' scenes and the whole story is set in France also. There are also clear reference with movies like 'Léon' or 'Ronin'. But never mind that, 'The Transporter' has obvious problems with reality, like lots of todays action movies. There are too many great explosions, our heroes special skills (drives with his feet, holds under truck at high speeds, bullets are not even wounding him...) and unbelievable acting from some actors (Matt Schulze is trying so hard to be bad that that is funny).

His film Leon proved that but that was very enjoyable and was believable whereas The Transporter, well oh dear. This was watchable don't get me wrong, but as Hollywood trashy fun, minus the word fun mostly and it's just Hollywood trash.Well the basic story is that Jason Statham plays ex-army soldier Frank Martin who ""transports"" packages for anyone to earn money, but Frank has three rules, which are no new deals or renegotiation of old ones, no names and never open the package, but he breaks the rules and gets involved with a Chinese girl Lai (Qui Shu) whose caught up in people's smuggling.And that's it, the film suffers from lack of story or depths to the characters, which makes them uninteresting and you not care about them. Lai sleeps with Frank for no reason even though he treats her badly, though he is just doing his job. There are plot holes the size of a black hole like the villain goes after Frank because he opened the package, but he was nowhere near him when he did it, so how would he know? That's never explained. The script and dialogue is very cheesy and cliché. Also the acting is atrocious, no one can act in this though Statham isn't too bad, but he just wasn't convincing much at all nor was Qui Shu and even though Francois Berleand as Inspector Tarconi was good, the script didn't help him even though Frank and him have a history, that is never delved into.

Yes, I actually check out fighting styles in action/martial arts films. I like to see that the actor is making up an individual fighting style that suits their character. His fighting was as clean, smooth, and edgy as his driving. I wanted to be in the car with him. A movie's good when you wanna be in it. I was a little put off by the ending being about the Asian slave trade. It was resolved rather blandly and haphazardly. All of a sudden, there's a mass of Asian slaves coming out at the end. You didn't find out anything til the end, and you were still kinda confused. They should have explained things a little earlier and a lot more clearly. As an action film, however, it pumps you up. The music they used was really hot and had you bumping and feeling like he'd be a cool dude to chill with. As a storyline issue, you weren't sure if he was French or from somewhere else and living in France. You just wanted to know more about him so you'd have a stronger basis for rooting for him. All you know is that he can fight, drive, and catch the ladies. He's a French Bond? He's clearly more than that, so they should've fleshed Frank out a little more. I know it's an action film, but Jason's worth the effort :). Truly a good film to get into. Statham better keep up the good work.",The Transporter
112,extravaluejotter,"Big, Daft, Entertaining Euro-Action!",6,21 January 2007,"I really wasn't expecting all that much from ""The Transporter"". Although Luc Besson co-wrote the screenplay, it didn't have a lot to recommend it. An action flick directed by a couple of guys I'd never heard of before, starring Ross Kemp Lookalike Jason Statham? Why am I even bothering?Well, uh, I was hooked after the first big car chase. Completely improbable stunts, but executed so slickly that I was unable to look away. There are a few slow sections of the movie (normally when someone bothers to explain what's going on) but it's worth watching for the action sequences. Jason Statham performs his martial arts moves pretty well and the fight scenes are surprisingly inventive. I particularly liked the use of bicycle pedals in one scene! The use of CGI in the big action set pieces is kept to a discreet minimum, so there's plenty to wince at as cars (and characters) get thrown about like toys.There was some sort of plot but it's best ignored. Watch ""The Transporter"" for the stunts and fight scenes and you won't be disappointed.",The Transporter
113,jmillerdp,Should have been MUCH better!,5,12 September 2014,"Jason Statham is perfectly fine, and there is good stunt choreography by also-director Corey Yuen. But, Yuen, in the director's chair, doesn't know how to shoot those fight scenes, or the car chase scenes.The cinematography, such as it is, is shaky-cam. And, it is too close up. We know that Statham can fight, so by doing the close-up stuff, and doing too much cutting, it undercuts the stuntwork, and it makes you think that they had to cut because the actor couldn't do full, uncut fight scenes.The story has okay ideas, but even in 92 minutes, the movie is narratively uneven, so it basically starts and stops at irregular intervals.The Stanley Clarke film score seems divorced from the film, like it was something he wrote separately, and the editors just kind of cut and pasted it into the movie. A disappointing effort. The franchise is being restarted in 2015, so I am hoping for better then.***** (5 Out of 10 Stars)",The Transporter
114,chvylvr80,An action packed thrill ride,8,5 September 2003,"The Transporter renews my faith in action movies. You don't need incredible effects to up the action quotient like The Matrix, you just need to have lots of chase scenes, shooting and fights. That is what The Transporter provides. Jason Statham should become a box office darling based on his square jawed good looks alone but he also can carry a film. The Transporter doesn't have great acting or plot or anything, it's just solid action. The soundtrack is great and provides a great backdrop for the action. The fight scenes alone are works of art. There are a few ""yeah right"" moments, but overall it's a very competent action movie. Bottom Line: If you like action, you'll love The Transporter.",The Transporter
115,yashrajs536,Statham's Action skills makes this film Worth Watchable!,8,18 January 2015,I had to admit that Jason statham proved himself as a action star by way of this flick I liked him from this flick he had used his full martial arts techs to make this film watchable I am surprised by its action sequences.I Also agree that the film is boring at some points and it also includes very less action scenes but the duration of the film has overshadowed it so it is good.Plus there are some unbelievable action stunts but still I.am liking it I had not watched its sequels but I will sure watch them as I would like to see whether they are good from this.I am not disappointed by this movie I hope that the next sequels would be better than this.This flick had forced to me to become the fan of Jason statham really he is the action star I full admit it!!!,The Transporter
116,brandon_lee420,Nice action scenes!,8,12 January 2010,"Corey Yuen has directed some low-budget action films but in 2002 he directed a great action flick called The Transporter, which stars Jason Statham. Jason Statham's first film was brilliant and he became better and better in acting from then on. It was in 2002 that he starred in an action flick and finally showed off his Kickboxing and other skills and it was really great. From the first scene I had a feeling that this was going to get better after twenty minutes and I was right 100%. The story gets more interesting and more characters are introduced, good and bad. Jason Statham's character is all calm and careful and that is cool but when it comes to someone messing with him and his car, he really unleashes his dark side and believe me that all hell is going to break loose. The stunts and choreography are fantastic, so well done stunt men and choreographers. The character, played by Qi Shu, is pretty exceptional and her humor is funny. Her lack of vocabulary is a weak side to her character and you need subtitles sometimes to understand what she is saying. The villain Wall Street, played my Matt Schulze, is totally ridiculous in acting and he doesn't look like a villain but a wanna be villain. The boring scenes were revolting and they all contain the French cop. They contain blah-blah-blah and that stops the story a little bit.Ex-Special Forces operator Frank Martin lives what seems to be a quiet life along the French Mediterranean, hiring himself out as a mercenary ""transporter"" who moves goods--human or otherwise--from one place to another. No questions asked. Carrying out mysterious and sometimes dangerous tasks in his tricked-out BMW, Frank adheres to a strict set of rules, which he never breaks. Rule One: Never change the deal. Rule Two: No names--Frank doesn't want to know whom he's working for, or what he's transporting. Rule Three: never look in the package. Frank's newest transport seems no different from the countless ones he's done in the past. He's been hired by an American known only as ""Wall Street"" to make a delivery; but when Frank stops along the route, he notices his package is moving. Violating Rule Three, Frank looks inside the bag, finding its contents to be a beautiful, gagged woman. Frank's steadfast adherence to his other two rules--which make up his basic code of survival--also quickly fails, hurtling him and his new companion on a road leading to shocking secrets, deadly complications, and the last thing that Frank ever expected to come to believe: that rules are made to be broken. (Copied from IMDb) The action scenes are very lethal and smart with a little bit of coolness. When he took off his shirt while he was fighting enemies, it showed that he was a show-off who liked his body. The action scenes never disappoint or get boring as Frank Martin terminates enemies, tough scrawny. Sometimes it would look fake,(Spoiler!!!) like when he survived the bombing on his house (Spoiler End!!!), but it can be real as well. Mmmmmm? The end scene was very awesome and very James Bond like. As far as the story goes, it doesn't disappoint but it feels like it is clichéd, somehow.Corey Yuen did a good job at directing this film while Luc Besson did fantastic writing the story. The car chase scenes look realistic and that's why you should watch this movie. I would recommend this to any film lover that likes a solid action flick. It is not a masterpiece but definitely worth a peek. The sequel is even better but the the third one sucked balls.",The Transporter
117,SeminolePhenom,The movie thats greatness relies entirely on the fight sequences and chase scenes!,6,8 September 2005,"Frank Martin(Jason Statham)is the greatest driver there is. He makes his own rules and it works out splendid for him until he takes a job transporting a package for a few high class goons. He breaks one his own rules by opening the package only to find a young Asian girl. After bringing the package to its destination he is asked to take another package to a different destination and finds it to be bomb intended to kill him. Frank Martin gets his revenge and starts a battle with very powerful men.I have found that I enjoy these types of action movies better if they are much shorter as this one is. It is only 92 minutes long which helps keep people entertained throughout. The actual movie consisted of a plot that was OK but was not really carried out well. I happen to be a sucker for the stories of revenge, so I found it quite entertaining. There are many sequences that they try to set a romantic mood to but fail miserably. There is barely any dialog which is the way these types of movies should be. If you are going to make a cheesy action movie then make it rely on the action and only the action!! Don't try to make a dramatic story to the movie! So, The Transporter moved in the right direction by mainly doing this.As I have already hinted, the action just makes the movie what it is. The fight scenes were some of the best I have ever seen and reminded me of some of the older Jackie Chan movies. The chase scenes were definitely one of the best. I would say the best chase scene since Ronin. Whenever Frank is fighting, you just get a good vibe and it makes the movie. Honestly, if the movie left out the romance and the drama, it would be a great movie. Instead, the movie drags on and on about subjects that don't matter at all making it only mediocre. In conclusion, The Transporter is a entertaining thriller which, like many other action movies, has very many flaws.I recommend this movie.",The Transporter
118,SinjinSB,just a long chase scene with lots of explosions,6,29 September 2002,"Written by a Frenchman, Luc Besson...Directed by a Hong Kong director, Corey Yuen...Set and filmed in France...Dialogue is English. Maybe it could of drawn the best from it's different sources, but instead it's just a big mess. Really it's just a long chase scene with lots of explosions. For some that may be enough entertainment, but I like a little more of a plot, depth of characters...I guess just a little something more to hold my attention. *1/2 (Out of 4)",The Transporter
119,TheGreatMarkukini,A revving start for an a Nascar-like action career,7,24 February 2020,"Probably the first movie with Jason Statham that I saw deliberately. Of course he had pretty iconic roles before this, although they didn't bring out the legendary masculinity that is praised all over the world.Luc Besson has created the image of a somewhat ideal man: a confident guy capable of doing almost everything, wearing neat stylish suits and driving fast gorgeous cars. Almost James Bond on a secret mission to deliver whatever you desire. The set of rules professed by the Transporter gives a certain charm as operating within boundaries requires a quick wit and ingenuity, plus it always looks badass when you break the rules with righteous intentions.The movie is a perfect example of a well balanced action flick that incorporates an interesting story with incredible choreography of fights and smart scene planning. In my opinion this film is an official breakthrough for Jason Statham and a solid beginning of a franchise that makes all men produce buckets of testosterone and forces women to open windows to reduce a sudden temperature spike in the room.",The Transporter

121,jaybizman,The Transporter: Birth Of A Franchise.,9,11 November 2020,"This is a fairly unique concept movie, by French director Luc Besson.
As of Nov 2020, almost 20 years old, spawning two sequels.There are really four 'Stars' - Jason Statham, a former British Olympic diver
(note that Jason normally has an underwater scene in his movies); Shu Qi,
from Taiwan then on to Hong Kong (she didn't speak English and spoke her
lines by rote); Francois Berleand, a well known French actor AND... a car.In many respects The Transporter series is all about... the car ... and driver.
In this first movie, the auto was a BMW 735 (normally a V8 automatic), now
refigured as a custom manual V12! So it has speed and massive torque.Jason transports whatever with a set of ""rules"", and breaks them with a ""package"" - which causes all sorts of mayhem. As a former 'Special Forces' operator he's pretty handy with his fighting skills (NOT a Martial Artist), but has since learned quite a bit. Throw in human trafficking, gangsters, and you have a movie.The Transporter is made with the usual French Flare and it's well worth a look.",The Transporter
122,Sfpsycho415,Way Better than Triple X----7/10,7,12 October 2002,"I hear people saying how Triple X is the best action movie of the year and what not, which isn't saying much seeing how their were not too many action flicks to begin with. But The Transporter blew away the competition. It has a much cooler story to begin with. It follows a professional courier of illegal goods who breaks the first rule of transportation: never open the package. Fortunatley, the package he opens contains a beautiful kidnappee. Unfortuantley for him, he now has the police, his clients, and others on his tail. Jason Statham is amazing-despite the obvious exaggerations that come with all action films- and Qi Shu is incredibly tasty. The action sequences are the best i have seen in a long time, especially the hand to hand combat and the opening and closing chases. This is a great action film. 7/10",The Transporter
123,tvdefrancesco,This Movie Was Hilarious,8,6 May 2021,"I just watched this movie for the first time in May of 2021. I was laughing so hard during this movie. It was way over the top but it totally knew that it was. You could tell from the music.Jason Stetham is the Transporter and the possibly underaged girl in his trunk is ""the package."" Stetham treats her like slave. Tying her up, keeping her mouth duck taped, making her drink threw a straw, and using her as a projectile weapon literally throwing her at cops 😂. I almost died when he threw her at the cops. However even as she's tied up in the trunk there's music playing as if he's seducing her.He then gets wronged goes and beats everyone to hell only to find the package in the car he stole. He throws the package out of the car and begins to drive away when he stops to maybe consider this package is a human being. And a hot Asian girl to boot. He brings the package home where he keeps her mouth duct taped and asks only her name. He doesn't want to know anything else. Especially her age haha. That night the package looks through his stuff and finds pictures of his military service so you begin to think Stetham is actually a good man. Not the kind of man who keeps tied up possibly underaged Asian girls in his trunk for money and delivers them to crime lords to be tortured or killed. That was Stetham from 6 hours earlier, shes moved on and trusts him now because of photos lmao.The next day the package begins to act all house-wifey and Stetham thinks, you know I can really see myself settling down with this package. The package soon says let me repay you for your twoubles and bangs him. Trading sex for favors. Stetham knows only her name. Not the age of the possibly underaged package. A scene comes later when he yells at the package saying it's all been lies since the start and I burst out laughing. All he asked was her name! How could she have been lying when she was a prisoner with her mouth duct taped in his trunk?! This was before any of the container stuff with her father.Stetham's house is then blown up by missiles that button hook sharper than a Julio Jones route and he and the package are forced to scuba dive to the neighbors house. Luckily Stetham, a loner, had an extra scuba set lying around beneath his house. His basement water escape route seemed to be built by the Knights Templar Jaque De'Molaie himself!We then meet the Packages father who has an all time worst haircut. He's working with Wall Street guy to smuggle Asians in containers. Apparently they hire muscle who don't use guns but all excel in hand to hand combat. Lmao. One scene they even call to a master ninja with a birth mark on his eye to come into the office. They had a Sensai on retainer in the office next store haha. Also for a Boss Wall Street really did his own dirty work. Fighting hand to hand combat and leaping onto moving trucks.Stetham gets arrested but the cop wants him to go on a killing spree. Rather than letting him go and not charging him yet they cook up a plan to have him taken hostage by Stetham. Cuz you know, not charging him based on hearsay would have been too rational.Stetham is then willing to die for the package at the hands of her fathers haircut, when the package shoots and kills her father. Cuz you know nothing spells romance than murdering one of your parents.Stetham then frees the 385 people who somehow are in a corner of an 8x12 foot container. The 15 people who died in transit have disintegrated or been eaten by the rest of the people in the container and the cops showed up just in time to congratulate Stetham, not arrest him for kidnapping an Officer.We see that Stetham has really been a good man all along. He has evolved over the past 21 hours from a psychopath who keeps possibly underaged Asian women tied up and led to their deaths to the savior of the container. Saint Stetham. Now he and the Package can settle down together and make a family with small boxes who will grow up to Packages of their own. Maybe even enough to start their own UPS.And they lived happily ever after with him still never wondering how old she was and the Package forgetting all about the trauma and inhumane treatment he inflicted upon her not even 24 hours prior.Wow! I love this movie lmao.",The Transporter
124,georgecoffeynewyorker,"Great action flick, no question. hahaah",9,18 August 2015,"The film is very basic plot. Thats what I love about movies. Some I do like when you are left guessing, but not all the time.A Transporter is required to deliver ""Packages"" around. All Packages are ""required"" to follow ""guidelines"" in case of car chases. His first trip to deliver robbers Packages to a guy. ""Weight"", ""Destination"", He continues to get jobs or ""Transports"". However on one particular job, he receives a package to be delivered to Grenoble, France. He stops buy for refreshments and his car is blown up. As expected he gets very P****d off. This Chinese woman - Lai(Shu) was one of the deliver packages. HE delivers her. IN return he receives the package that blew up his car. So on a revenge warpath, he encounters Lai again. He is so annoyed. It is then revealed Lai involved in his personal life is actually because she tells Frank(Statham) that her Father and family are to become slaves in a shipment container.I enjoyed the movie. Seen it a few times. Great action flick. No doubt. However I was lost as to the bit why Frank was late and yet Frank himself is punished by his car being blown up. So according to the film, If I'm late for something and that was MY rule, I should be punished?????",The Transporter
125,LouE15,"Utterly enjoyable nonsense, a very guilty pleasure",7,23 May 2007,"I don't think I quite fit the movie's target audience, but this big, dumb film cheers me up every time. Somehow all involved have achieved the amazing feat of making a second-rate Euro-doo-doo-chop-socky flick watchable, enjoyable, and even involving.Jason Statham plays Frank, whose job title gives the film its name. But he's not just your average lorry driverhe drives a mean car and will transport anything, anywhere around the Med, for a price. He's careful, taciturn, precise and likes routine. Within that framework, anything goes.Life breaks in on his steely solitude in the form of a woman (surprise!), and sets off a chain of events  but honestly, the rest of the 'story' is just thoroughly entertaining nonsense hardly worth summing up. Suffice to say that a bulked-up Jason Statham is surprisingly good in the central role  the only serious defect there being the daft transatlantic accent. Statham couldn't be more London if he tried.The movie's colour, humour and pathos come from able sidekicks Qui Shu and Francois Bearléand, and from Frank's (human) inability to live out his life by the cold logic of the lonely code he has set himself. In its harshness, his code reminded me of the terse commands of the Way of the Samurai, but in its application it is funny or brutal by turns. It's a credit to Statham's acting (yes!) and fighting skills that he lifts this above cartoon fare, and to the cinematographer that it looks much better than it deserves to.For yet more very enjoyable tosh, check out Statham's ""Crank"". I can't remember when I laughed so hard. That boy's got something",The Transporter
126,crowrobot,Pure warpspeed action,10,28 June 2005,"'The Transporter' is a big, loud, dumb action movie that manages to be wonderously entertaining largely due to it's leading man, Jason Statham. Statham is very charismatic, and watching him kick major amounts of a$$ is so much fun.From the opening car chase to the explosive finale, 'The Transporter' is filled with cleverly staged action. It also includes one of the funniest battle scenes I've ever seen: Frank (Statham) is fighting off a bunch of bad guys in a pool of oil in a parking garage. As you can probably guess, he uses the slickness of the oil to his advantage. This scene has the distinction of something I've never seen before in a movie.If you like big popcorn movies like 'Tomb Raider' or 'XxX', 'The Transporter' is the movie for you.",The Transporter

128,Blackace,90 Mins Of Pure HIGH-Octane Action!!,8,2 November 2002,"I think many critics went to this film expecting something totally different then what this film was trying to be. Critics were actually looking for a quality detailed plot and Oscar winning performances. I can tell you right now that the Director: Luc Besson wasn't even aiming in that direction at all. The actual plot of this movie was definitely an afterthought. I'm not going to bother going into full detail of the plot either, cause everyone who has seen this movie knows what it's about. I want to comment more so on the performance of Jason Statham. Can this former unknown carry an action movie and could he be the next Arnold, Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Bruce Willis or even Vin Diesel? Well..I don't think he's any of them, as he has his own style, but I think he has the potential to be a great action star. While all the other actors are great action stars, most of them can barely act. Vin & Bruce had their moments (Pitch Black & The Sixth Sense), but the others are pure action actors with one line dialogues. I think Jason Statham has charisma, style, personality, wit and the look. He has a unique way of delivering his lines. He does it with coolness and confidence. In the Transporter he does this adamantly and his fighting abilities are pretty awesome as well. People forget that he was in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch and even The One w/Jet Li. He'll be in The Italian Job next.
As for the movie itself, I loved it. I went into the theater expecting continuous action with a small plot to move the story along and that's what I got. I was happy that the producers didn't show ALL of the action scenes in the trailer like many of them like to do. There was still a lot of special effects and stunts that weren't in the trailer. If your bored and need a little excitement in your life get to the theater and see The Transporter. If you want to see an even better action film get Jet Li's FIST OF LEGEND. You won't be disappointed. B-ACE",The Transporter

130,ogdendc,Back to the action,8,25 January 2013,"'The Transporter' is an action thriller with a credible action hero. Jason (Lock, Stock) Statham comes out with a lot of credit for his performance here. I just wish he had decided sooner (at the start of the film, preferably) not to try to put on an American accent. By the end, he is just using standard Estuary English, which works fine with his character.His trade as a high-end courier (would The Courier have been a better title?) working for any criminal gang that wants his services leads to interest from the local police inspector, played by Francois Berleand, who also turns in a wonderful performance. Scenes between the two of them work well. But, as acting credits go, that is about it.The movie is well directed, well edited and beautifully photographed. The fight scenes are tightly choreographed, often in narrow corridors, and Statham earns his money in those scenes. If you like car chases, you will love the first few minutes too.Although the plot does not really make sense, it exists as a framework to hang all the shooting, fighting, diving, driving and explosions – and they are good.There is the inevitable 'love scene' between Statham and Qi Shu (bet you saw that coming) but it's all over very quickly, as if the director realised that it's not what we're here for.

131,TimBoHannon,"Starts at 80 degrees, ends at 20 below zero",4,4 March 2007,"Meet Frank Martin. Martin (Jason Statham) is a retired British Special Forces officer currently enjoying retirement in France. Well, sort of retirement. Frank actually makes his living by transporting goods or people from one location to another. His services have made him a millionaire many times over, evidenced by his oceanview palace. The two-tower structure comes complete with fancy gates, a brick driveway, a garden, two kitchens and even an elevator. In his pristine garage resides the only love of his life, a perfect BMW. His services come with three rules: the deal never changes, no names, and never look in the package.The movie begins when Martin arrives with perfect punctuality outside of the world's richest bank. He is to whisk three robbers to safety, but four emerge. Citing rule number one, Martin refuses to leave and calmly explains why he cannot carry four men. The lead robber puts a gun to his head, but without the ignition code, he cannot drive. Checkmate. The panicking leader executes the fourth man.Martin starts the car and is pursued by police in a wild chase through busy streets and narrow alleyways. Dodging and swerving his way to safety, Martin outsmarts the police in the film's high point. This car pursuit has drawn comparisons to a similar scene in The Bourne Identity.The movie only rests for little while, and then it is on to his next job. His contact explains the job, then says, ""It is for a man named..."" ""No names,"" Martin interrupts, reiterating his strict adherence to the rules. The client's name is Wall Street, I suppose, since he is only addressed with pronouns. The cargo is large bag to be fit in his trunk.While tending to a flat tire on the way, he notices his ""cargo"" squirming. Curiosity gets the best of him, and he discovers a hopelessly bound girl (Qi Shu) with her mouth sealed shut as well. He has no sympathy and completes the deal, but when his customers double cross him, he enacts revenge and the hostage ends up in his home.The girl, Lai, is grateful for the help and stays with him though she is free to leave. However, her former captors are not too happy with her current quarters. 5,000 bullets later, she informs Martin that she was smuggled in from China as part of a human slavery operation and many more will follow.Up until this point, the film is performing admirably, but once it's second half commences, the wheels begin to fall off one by one. The chemistry existing between Statham and Shu in the first act quickly evaporates. Not even the discovery of Martin's conscience works.We are led to believe that Lai's father (Ric Young) is one of the slaves, but we later find out that he is the mastermind behind the operation. This new discovery throws into question why Lai was in the bag in the first place, and raises many other questions as well. The film never gives its audience the courtesy of answering those questions, and it feels as if Luc Besson is making it up as he goes.The action also goes down the toilet. It mostly consists of Frank being confronted by a group of ruffians and knocking them to the floor. Each man rises up to fight again, and every time he has them beaten more henchmen appear and join the fray. His reluctance to use lethal force is astounding. The invulnerability of every character completely undermines the effectiveness of everything the film wants to do, and reduces it to the level of Beverly Hills Ninja. The climax involves Frank parachuting onto to a semi-truck in an attempt to commandeer it. It is boring, and reminded me of how much more I enjoyed the semi-truck chase in License to Kill.Statham flourishes as the amoral Martin and Qi Shu fares well as the confused and vulnerable young girl in strange surroundings. Francois Berleand is satisfactory as a friendly but suspicious detective, but has no interesting material. Matt Schulze falls flat in embarrassing fashion with his lifeless treatment of Wall Street. Ric Young is equally bad. Even Shu, who probably set the record for time being bound on camera, becomes a drone in the second half.Cory Yuen is better than this. Luc Besson is better than this. Moviegoers deserve more than an action film that slowly destroys itself. The first half warrants a good score, but what follows is so putrid that The Transporter rates only a four out of ten.",The Transporter

The story, though not real original, is also good and the fight scenes are pretty much eye candy; albeit not too realistic. They're just COOL.  All in all I liked this movie and would recommend it if you light fight films.I also like how the director and writer had the transporter without too many lines and no cheesy one liners when he's come face to face with or demolish a goon and/or thug.  It was most enjoyable with what wasn't said, rather than any geeky taunt or quip.  It helped Jason Stathen to exude the badass persona without having to rely on catchy phrases to put up a false bravado. Well done on that account to actor, director, and writer.  I BELIEVED i didn't want to get on this guy's bad side -- if the fight scenes were unreal with the sheer number of goons he had to fight; I at least KNEW I wouldn't want to face him myself or with two maybe even three of my strongest friends.

The naff storyline, the kick-boxing moves, the lack of dialogue for the leading man, the army of nameless heavies, the almost compulsory Japanese bad guy / girl / even director. The plot - which i will NOT go into here - is rudimentary to say the least. The amount of times people just happen to turn up in scenes without any realistic semblance of how they got there is incredible - it must be a record for a movie. Couple this with the total number of unrealistic stunt moves carried out and you have yourself a bona-fide turkey. For instance, trucks propel themselves forward on their own without a need for a driver, a small plane goes from a hundred feet up in the sky to thousands of feet in a blink, the hero can somehow dodge a thousand bullets and still manage to incapacitate 3 bad guys with nothing more than a jumper !!! i watched this knowing what it was beforehand - a cheesy action flick - but it still took some swallowing to believe the plot. The best award must go to the guy who somehow managed to squeeze a further 2 sequels from this franchise. After the first film - the whole cast and crew should have been sent straight to DVD dungeon never to appear again. How they convinced anyone to make another 2 movies is beyond me. The Transporter is a poor man's Bourne - and that is a derisive remark to Bourne. If Van Damme had done this - then it would have stayed where it belonged - the bargain bin.3/10 - just for sheer cheek of conning us with this movie.",The Transporter
135,Nobody-27,Lowest IQ movie I have ever seen,1,25 June 2018,"There are fun movies, guilty pleasure movies, even silly or ridiculous films... and they can all be enjoyed, to some extent. But this one is way below any of those standards. It feels like it was written during a drunk weekend, and with no re-writing. Someone had money to burn.
I won't go into details, because they are worthless. I wanted to see action and camera work, as well as chase sequences, and even those failed. Fighting was badly coordinated, chase scenes lack sense of space and orientation and therefore believability, story is barely there, twists and plot points absolutely ridiculous, timing is off throughout... In conclusion: this film sucks in every way imaginable.",The Transporter
136,Rooster99,An excellent action movie!,9,12 May 2003,"All action movies should strive to be this imaginative!  OK, the plot was not particularly intriguing, but what action movie's actually is?  But the plot was secondary to the action, it only served to make the bad guys bad and the good guys good.  The rest was up to Jason Statham's considerable fighting talents.There were some unbelievable yet jaw-dropping stunts, a terrific fight scene in oil, and some great car chase scenes.  There were no smarmy one-liners making light of good action sequences as is too often the case in American-directed action flicks.  The hero was cold, yet compassionate.  He didn't kill unnecessarily, but when he had to, he was ruthless.  There are many great action sequences, some so unbelievable you have to just shake your head and remember that action movies are not supposed to be based on reality.  There is even a great shot of the hero jumping off a speeding semi while it races over a bridge onto the back of a bus going perpendicular to the truck under the bridge!!  I mean, come on!  It would never happen, but I have to give credit to the stunt coordinator who imagined the possibilities.There is another hilarious scene where the hero chases down an airplane on foot, hijacks it, jumps out of the plane at great altitude in order to land on the back of a speeding transport with a conveniently located borrowed parachute!  I am glad all crop dusters carry such indispensable equipment and that it is so easy to land on the back of a truck speeding down the highway at 130 KM/hour.All in all, 90 minutes of sheer enjoyment.  Even with the predictable ending, I have to highly recommend this movie.  If you can suspend belief for a little while, you will be rewarded.",The Transporter

But what I got was a GEM!!!!! After the end of 90's and the decline of ARNOLD-STALLONE presence, Hollywood was really going for ACTOR oriented movies than ACTION oriented HEAVY WEIGHTS (which is Good by the Way). In an arena now starving for ACTION STARS, this movie really redefines the Golden-age Action Films and makes the answer for the NEXT LEVEL ACTION HEROES.Directed by Louis Leterrier and Corey Yuen, tells the story of a man who makes a living with the delivery of illegal things.The Transporter (Spoilers******) After ending the military carrier Frank Martine (Jason Statham) is now in the field of smuggling. A disciplined, solo professional who transports criminal materials in his BMW for the outlaw customers. He has strict rules for his service which makes the Transporter a noted name in the crime world.But things went wrong when he got a new assignment, to transport a package which happened to be a lovely Asian girl(Qui Shu).Scripted by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen tells the Hard Hitting Fast Paced story of The Transporter - Frank Martine. A great structured screenplay for an action movie, which also blended with another dimension of Underworld and Romance. Tremendous camera works, enriched with in the fast cutting editing which really demanded in the movie. Credit goes to camera team of Pierre Morel and the visionary editor Nicolas Trembasiewicz.Both the vehicle and the physical stunts were done brilliantly. Fight was well choreographed by Film Director Corey Yuen and the Stunt performers rocked in each frame. The man who steal the show Jason Statham, his portrayal of Strong and Silent - Good Bad Man was the best thing in the movie. I wish he would appear as 'Agent 47' if Edidos game company brings their Hit-man titles as movies, he will LIVE in that character. Plus lovely lady Qui Shu was really treat for eyes in every frames.All and all it's a great movie which stands in the Top of high rated Action titles.

139,Nigel St. Buggering,Great action; where's the story?,6,13 October 2002,"Everyone involved with this film has gone above and beyond their minimal duties in crafting an action film, save one; sadly, he is the lynch-pin of the entire production.First, the good: Jason Statham is in serious competition with Vin Diesel as THE cool action hero of the post-Arnold age.  He has incredible screen presence, he can handle the action, and he can actually act.  He also has a great regular-guy feel to him that reminds one of Bruce Willis when ""Die Hard"" hit the screens.  Director Corey Yuen does a terrific job of creating a western approach to the Hong Kong action film; the action sequences are uniformly exciting and interesting, even when they're being thoroughly ridiculous, a hallmark of Hong Kong cinema.  The supporting cast all do their jobs admirably, namely making the hero look good.So the problem?  Luc Besson.  Is it just me, or has this man been coasting on the goodwill created by ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""Leon"" for too long now? He seems to have no clue how to construct a story, or convincingly develop characters.  There is so much left unexplained, unexplored and undeveloped at the end of this film that the plot is reduced to a meaningless excuse for action sequences.  When the action is this good, that may be somewhat forgivable, but I still fail to understand why a few rewrites were not in order.  It's one of those scripts in which the hard-bitten hero has a change of heart just in time to save everyone, not because he's learned a valuable lesson, but because it's time to do so.  The girl he finds in the trunk of his car is the hinge on which the entire story swings, but it's never fully explained why she was in there.I give an 8 to the director and cast contributions, and a lowly 4 to Besson for his lazy screenplay, leveling the film out at a 6.  See it if you like great action, but don't expect to be told a story of any worth.",The Transporter

The quote that really stands out in my mind is: ""He was a bastard, but he was my father.""Statham was very good, but I had hoped there would be more to it than just him.  That being said Statham can carry a movie like Vinny Diesel so far has not.  Eye candy.  Lite beer.  Krispy Cream Donuts.

143,stargunner,Patchy at best.,4,6 September 2005,"The Transporter start out very slow. You get an idea of what Statham does in the movie, and that goes on for about a half an hour. Then things start to get interesting, but they only start to. Once you find out what the movies all about it kind of ruins the cool tone it had to it originally. The plot itself is not only bad, but is thrown together, making for a really patchy film. The action is great - but that's all. Even at some points its absolutely ridiculous what is pulled off. I found myself laughing at a few parts. And those weren't the parts I was supposed to be laughing at.Transporter tries to be funny at parts, and it really isn't. It tries to be serious throughout, when really it's just weird. I wouldn't recommend this movie even as an action flick, since most of the action is repetitive and unrealistic. For example, two cars collide and burst into flames before they barely even hit each other. But what bothered me most about this film is the extremely poor music selection. What was left of the Transporter that made it any bit redeeming was ruined by the awful soundtrack. Half of it was hip-hop, when there really shouldn't have even been music. And the score for the rest of the film simply isn't that good and doesn't fit the tone of the movie. All in all it was another disappointing movie rental. I could keep the flick for another week but I returned it the day after. I didn't really want to look at it.

146,the-evil-cult,I Didn't Like the Robotic Fight Scenes,6,17 July 2007,"The Transporter is about a man named Frank whose job it is to transport things. He lives his life by following rules designed to get him out of trouble. It is clear early on that many of his clients are criminals. However, he is professional and does not pass moral judgment.One day however he breaks one of his rules. He looks inside a package in the trunk of his car to find a woman named Lai. By breaking his rules, he spirals into trouble.It's interesting to see people torn between professional conduct and moral conduct, as it is a decision we all have to make, and different people will make different decisions.As a criticism, the movie's fight sequences seem too choreographed. Frank's fighting style is not smooth and flowing but rigid and sequential.The damsel in distress Lai is very attractive, and sometimes I wonder whether this sends the message that only beautiful women deserve to be saved.The movie concerns smuggling of people from Japan to Europe, presumably France. At the end we learn that the refugees seem to respond to Japanese. Since refugees tend to flee from poor and unfree countries to rich and free country, what just doesn't seem right is why Japanese people would be smuggled to Europe.

147,unbend_5440,All The Transporter offers are big car chases and fast fight scenes,9,14 December 2002,"And as luck would have it, those big car chases and fast fight scenes make up almost the entire movie. Seeing as the chases and fights are extraordinarily stunning, The Transporter succeeds! This movie really is the same as most action movies out there. Great action, lots of excitement, explosions, guns, hand to hand combat, lame love story that nobody cares about, and no originality at all. I for one don't care about the lack of originality. I thought the action topped almost everything XXX tried to do. It's not THE best action film of the year (that would be Bourne Identity or Die Another Day) but it buries the rest of this years action letdowns like Ballistic or Rollerball in a fraction of a second!There's one thing I wanted to point out. The huge climax with the Trucks on the highway at the end seemed strangely familiar to me. I think somebody was watching Raiders Of The Lost Ark a little too much when they wrote the script.As for the star, Jason Statham, he has the fighting style of Jet Li, and the coolness of Vince Vaughn and Vin Diesel combined. This guy is too cool to go unnoticed. If he's not making 10 million a movie in a few years...... then...... maybe it will take a little longer......So, in the end The Transporter is exactly what it tries to be. An amazing 90+ minutes of watchable stunts and fights, with a lame love story that nobody cares about, and a plot that's so unimportant that I barely remember what it's about.

So finally came the day I finally decided to watch it and I must say even after all these years it's quite enjoyable.I want to talk about a few aspects of the movie.The story. ( Easy to watch, engaging.
It's set in the beautiful French riviera where we are once again reunited with Jason Statham in another action/crime packed movie. Personally, this is one of my favourite examples of how to make a good action movie. All you need is likeable characters, excellent bad guys, the right amount of action, fighting, stunts, cars exploding way too much for no reason, romance and one man against the world story and you have made an iconic movie. It doesn't work every time but it worked this time.Sound design - (Excellent. When I watched all the fight, action scenes the special effects gave satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out. Everything music-wise felt just right like you would expect.)Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that Transporter vibe to everything.)Stunts. ( I was expecting many satisfying stunts from this movie but it still managed to surprise me with quite a lot of amazing stunt work starting the mansion till the bus depot. I'm still amazed.)Overall I think quite a lot of people will enjoy it and very few won't. Personally, after watching it this feels like not the greatest movie and not the worst one so it's somewhere in the middle around 8 out of 10.
Would recommend to anyone and it would be one of my first choices.",The Transporter
150,timelord-3,Tongue in cheek and proud of it,8,5 November 2002,"Took advantage of tightarse Tuesday and went and saw The Transporter this evening.Interesting film - reminded me a lot of 'The Big Hit' - stylised action and fight scenes mixed in with a lot of tongue in cheek humour.  The Transporter didn't go the extremes that 'The Big Hit' did but it was heading there.  It even shared a similar theme of the tough guy falling for the Asian school-age girl.The audience I saw the film with were sniggering at some of the more implausable things (the leap of the car onto the car trailer for one).The fight scene in the bus depot with the slippery oil was inventive.Can't help feeling that Jason Statham was a bit miscast for the role of the super efficient Transporter, the guy you hire when you have to get a package from point a to point b.  Writer Luc Besson has a long history of projects concerning loners (La Femme Nikita, Leon, heck, even Joan of Arc) and Statham doesn't fully succeed in pulling off the role.  He's great in the action sequences but anything else he seems to fall into familiar territory that his old mate Guy Ritchie trained him in for Lock Stock, and Snatch.The final chase between the Transporter and container lorries did seem to steal a lot from the Bond flick 'Licence to Kill' (taking over lorries, jumping from planes onto backs of lorries etc), but it did add enough wrinkles to stamp its own signature on the scenes.Good film though - great action sequences and inventive locations.  8 out of 10.",The Transporter
151,pantagruella,Stylish European mayhem from beginning to end.,9,23 January 2003,"I had heard nothing good about this film, but as I started to like Jason Statham in Jet Li's 'The One', I thought I would see his headlining performance in 'The Transporter' when it came to the UK.I had already heard that the director was only interested in stunts and that Statham's accent drifted from faux-American back to archetypical Mockney. I had already read that there was no plot to speak off and that the whole enterprise was unrealistic.Having seen the film and been flabbergasted by its stylishness, I don't think these valid criticisms touch the film.Jason Statham is the Man. Tough, composed, laconic and absolutely ready and willing to take on any number of hostiles. How can he be so good at this kind of martial mayhem? How can he be so flexible? I have seen generations of genuine martial artists take to the cinema - Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Olivier Gruner, Cynthia Rothrock, Don 'The Dragon' Wilson - but on the basis of 'The Transporter' these have nothing on Jason.There are enough stylish and imaginative stunts to make me think this film is at least on a par with the best James Bond films.Other attractive features are the beautiful vistas from Southern France, the well-placed musical tracks, the villains who are 'well 'ard' and 'serious'.I don't know how an obscure British actor gets to star in a film that opened at cinemas in the USA and didn't go straight to video in the UK.

152,ashecatlin,Solid movie with a sloppy third act,6,29 July 2020,"At the end of the day this is a Jason Statham flick, so you know exactly what your getting yourself into. You get his standard tropes, where all his movies have the same feeling, though he is the best action hero of past the 2000's worth watching.The started off really good with Jason or Frank in this film, talking down a guy who had a gun pointed at his face and then a pretty sweet car chase. The first act was really good, as was the second but where this film fell apart for me was the third act.So the story is he's paid to transport something, finds out it's a women. Unwillingly saves her then the mob come after him. After failing to kill him, they infiltrate them which felt like the climax. Then out of nowhere the girls dad shows up, so why was she transported in a bad with her mouth taped shut? The big bad is then reduced to a measly henchmen and the plot makes little sense. It the becomes a story about human trafficking, which could have worked but now with the dad involved it doesn't. Then the last 30 minutes of the movie is just action sequence after action sequence, it just doesn't do anything for me. Crank did it amazingly, this felt more like man of steel where you had a good one but then they keep on trying to outdo themselves and I felt a bit bored by it.The very end was still pretty good, with resolution of the girl. But then it just fades to black, without any resolution to Frank's feeling toward her. If they are going to be a couple or have romantic feelings, given they had sex and the second arc did hint towards that angle. That ass shot though, hot damn, that's a spicy meatball. Overall this was a good flick, I'd happily watch it again. Just disappointed by third act as it went against everything it had established and didn't even have a good pay off. Though I did really like the interactions between Frank and the cop, that was awesome.

He has a sharp wit and a big heart under the rough exterior. This is a lot of fun and basically launched Statham's action career and a series of these movies.

Sprinting over hills and across valleys, our determined protagonist is lucky enough to find that the plane has landed and that its pilot is hanging around doing nothing much in particular.

155,kmberger,Action for action's sake,7,14 October 2002,"Let's be honest here.  The appeal of The Transporter is not in a gripping, tightly-plotted script that speaks to the intricacies of human nature.  The appeal of The Transporter is in the action.  The appeal is the highly-choreographed, Hong Kong-inspired, thrill-a-minute martial arts and stunts that make movies like this great fun.Directed by Hong Kong veteran Corey Yuen (Jet Li's Fong Sai Yuk movies) and coscripted by French action master Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita, Leon, The Fifth Element), The Transporter is the story of Frank (Jason Statham), an ex-military man who now earns a lucrative living in France as a transporter; a man who drives criminals and delivers packages, no questions asked.  Frank has three rules:  Number one, never change the deal.  Number two, no names. And number three, never open the package.Well it wouldn't be much of a movie if Frank didn't break the rules - and it's rule number three that proves his downfall, as he opens the package in his trunk only to find the lovely Lai (Shu Qi).  This starts a chain of action sequences that lead to a very cloudy and obscure plot which serves mostly to offer up more bad guys for Statham to beat the living snot out of.And beat them up he does. The action sequences are the saving grace here, with boundless energy (and an endless supply of goons) and inventive setpieces.  The movie starts with a high-energy chase scene down alleyways, up stairs, and every which way but the right way on one-way avenues. Another top-notch scene involves an outnumbered Statham fighting off a barrage of mooks while all of them have to deal with overturned barrels of oil - there's more slipping and sliding than there is punching and kicking there.  It all adds up to a lot of fun.There's no depth and mystery involved in a picture like The Transporter.  It is what it is, and it aims to please.  For pure entertainment (and a few double-take moments), it's well worth the time spent.",The Transporter

Having seen the first one, it was ludicrous. I was laughing at its ridiculousness and at some points, I was cringing. Frankly the only cringe-worthy aspect of this movie is the actress who played Lai. I'll give her credit, for someone who doesn't usually speak the English language she spoke it well, but it doesn't make up for her bad acting. She's not the worst actress ever, but she wasn't that great.The plot is unrealistically silly and just an excuse for Jason to kick some butt, and that's totally fine by me. This is a movie where people talk instead of shoot, and only use guns when there's a convenient opening for the hero to escape. Jason plays Frank Martin, a driver-for-hire who will drive children to school or act as the getaway for a group of thieves, or deliver anything--no questions asked. He's got three rules: no changing the deal, no names, and never open the package.Soon enough, he's given a job to transport a package that just happens to be a woman named Lai, and from there, things get complicated. He simply gives her a drink, but that still breaks one of his rules, and before he knows it, his car explodes shortly after making the delivery. This gets Frank tangled up in a human trafficking operation that he feels obliged to stop, partly because Lai is one of the key figures in it.We've got catching up to speeding trucks on parachutes, grease fights, bike pedal kicks to the face, and legions of henchmen battling a shirtless one man army.

Jason Statham and Lucy Liu did a good job with their characters, but I think it was the storyline that brought this movie down.It had good and innovative action scenes, but that was basically all. Towards the end of this film, I found myself wanting it to end and not really caring what happened. To be completely honest, the opening car chase was the best part of this movie.So to make a long story short, there's a lot of action movies that are worse than this, but there are way more that are better.",The Transporter

If I'd bothered, I would have lost count of the number of times Jason Statham looked at his watch. However, like Ryan O'Neal in the similar film, The Driver, that seemed to be almost the limit to his acting. I half-remember a review of The Driver that said that Ryan O'Neal had a range of emotions from a to b. Jason Statham is the same; he has ""grumpy"" and ""looking at his watch"". The film also reminded me why I stopped buying Stanley Clarke's albums twenty five years ago. The soundtrack was clichéd at its best, and normally far worse.

This movie is definitely of of those. What I especially disliked about The Transporter is that everything and everyone in it is unnatural, cartoonish and dumbified even for an average ""superhero"" flick. And as far as the action-movie qualities go, The Transporter offers and cookie-cutter set of typical ""action"" effects - a car chase (a way unrealistic one!), a missile-launcher shooting and explosions (waaay pointless), lots of unrealistic small-arms shooting (do you want to see rifle bullets flying straight through think brick and mortar walls? why?) a ""kung-fu"" fight (Jackie Chan probably puked if or when he watched it), a car-bomb bada-boom (a HUGE blast, but no one gets hurt), and a difficult and inner-conflicted supporting character.

The effects weren't exactly top notch but decent.  The plot and overall story were very good.

My first reaction when I heard 'Frank's speech was one of incredulity. They gave the lead actor this ghey american accent, its AWFUL. Its a real shame, as originally the role called for a ex-SAS freelancer, why they just couldn't leave it like that who knows? Maybe its to do with the fact it's a French production and they couldn't stand the idea of a strong British actor in a lead role in a French film...? Anyway, apart from that it's very very good. Funny as fewk, its so true to life, how extremely violent situations can lead to bizarre yet hilarious conclusions (i have some personal experience of that.) The action sequences are some of the best I've seen, esp the oil and axe scenes,leading me to suspect that Stratham may be in the line-up as the next Bond. However, both the lead protagonist and the female leads father are cardboard cut-out stereotypes, a little more time should have gone into casting them methinks....

It looks like there is a little wire work but it's not obvious (like the six kicks in the air stuff). The chase scenes are good but tiring (why does EVERY action flick have to have a chase in it?), and Statham's character is interesting and fun to watch. They added tracers to all the bullets, which added to the visuals of the shooting scenes.The amicable relationship he has with the French inspector is a nice touch. It added comic relief without getting silly.*** SPOILER *** I really appreciated the fact that the movie avoided a cliche' twist ending, like the love interest betrayal or buddy betrayal. I was expecting it, but it didn't happen. Also, the love scene seemed a little contrived at first, but then I realized she seduced him to get him to follow her later. So that made sense. *** SPOILER OFF ***My only real quibble is one of the fight scenes went on a little too long and after a while it didn't make sense. It reminded me of Hong Kong kung fu movies where they have to slip a fight scene into the movie at every opportunity.

This is a great actioner ! I'll say it again if I must. It benefits from his Chinese, French and American origins alike : local atmosphere and intimacy combined with one-liners & great action, with martial flavour.THE GOOD Jason Statham has both the charisma & martial arts skills to make his performance as a self-controlled, slightly weary ex-soldier off. Sold in the making of as the occidental answer to Jackie Chan he is indeed devoted enough to train for his own stunt work up to perfection & very likable. The French police inspector and the Japanese girl are also well portrayed, respectively professional and determined when they're not kind. On the other hand, the villains are cardboard, even tough the henchmen must be given credit for their fighting scenes with Satham. Supervised by an Asian co-director with years of fighting choreography experience, these are just fine, whether Statham battles with 10 guys in a pool of motor oil (actually syrup but still a slippery mess), outdrives the Marseille police with his Transporter skills or shows near bullet-time speed in an axe fight. Only the fights in the truck cabin kept me wondering why they hadn't crashed already. Vehicles in action movies often seem to have a secretive automatic pilot for these circumstances. THE BAD Those bank robbers. How can a professional put up with such nerve wrecks ? (I had to say something)THE UGLY The story (especially the inspector's illegal cooperation in spite of the criminal evidence against the Transporter) isn't everything but less of an excuse than in most B-movies within the genre.

174,deltajuliet,One of my all-time favorites of the Action genre,8,21 February 2006,"Where to start......The Transporter starts out with a spectacular car chase through Monaco. Statham (this is the first film I saw him in; he's now one of my favorite actors) dazzles the screen as the amazing driver of the BMW right from this opening.I could talk about character development (and there is some on Frank's, Statham's character's, part), acting (and it was decent), et cetera, but in all honesty, that's not what this film is about. This is about having fun, watching some amazing martial arts, and viewing some great driving. Not to say that it totally relies on action (I absolutely loathe xXx for everything it represents), just that the action scenes are simply the highlights of the film.And that's why this is one of my favorite action films. The martial arts were some of the best I've seen. Though they may not have been all entirely believable (well, this is an action film), they were always at least possible (versus something like The Matrix). And they were great eye-candy. The martial arts also utilized many things that haven't been in past martial arts flicks (ex: fighting in oil, thus much slipping around, etc). Basically, action = good.The action direction that Corey Yuen contributes gives John Woo a run for his money. The cinematography seemed to always provide a clean, crisp French Riviera sunshine that gave a vibe of energy and excitement (and aesthetic appeal). Fight scenes were never hard to follow, and always fun to watch. Car chases were beautiful. I don't know if I've said it yet, but this is a great action film! It's never too over-the-top, and it's not totally non-stop action, so the action that is provided is boosted that much more. A must-see for action-buffs, Statham fans, or Shi Qu fans, this is one of the most recent cult films I know of.",The Transporter
175,bkam,"Plot holes? Of course, but who cares?",7,26 June 2003,"If you were expecting an involving, strongly emotional film during which you form a relationship with the characters, then how did you end up with this film?  Sure, the characters are flat, and even the plot has some big problems.  Just get your cartoon-sensibilities out and try to enjoy it!That said, the score is somewhat enjoyable in my opinion, the camerawork is outstanding (if it doesn't bug the hell out of you which it seems to do to some people).  There's not much to be said for any of the actors apart from Jason Statham, who is perfect for the part.  Someone mentioned that he has the Bruce Willis look going on, which is true, while he also has that cool accent.  And those are two guys who can pull off having receding hairlines without going totally skinhead and looking like a slab of meat (like Vin Diesel).  If you liked that look and accent in Snatch or the Italian Job you will probably like it here too.  In my opinion he is a perfect action hero: cool, calm, in control, powerful, fast, and anything but annoying.  Most heroes fail in one of these respects at some point during a film.So now the important part: the action sequences.  These really make up for the lack of coherence and character development.  Maybe you think that nothing could make up for a lack of coherence; well obviously you're not the action type and should stay away from this film!  If you can get over it, then some of the scenes are quite beautifully done, so rhythmic and well-choreographed as to look like dancing.  Some of the scenes are reminiscent of Kiss of the Dragon (and even one of the villains is the same guy).  That reminds my brothers and I watched it, we were many times reminded of other action movies: Ronin, Speed, Terminator 2, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Lethal Weapon 4, The Professional, the Fast and the Furious (some of these are not surprising due to their mutual associations with Luc Besson).  But while you might just think it copies these other films, it basically does many of the cooler things in these films in a borderline montage of action that leaves you with a sense of tribute to the genre rather than a copycat.  Plus, it has many scenes which are extremely original.  Overall, if you're into the action, this movie has some intense and spectacular scenes.  If you aren't, don't see this movie so we don't have to hear you complain about it. [7/10]",The Transporter

For his services he'll use his superb driving skills to get his paying customers out of a jam. He asks no questions and needs precise instruction in order to perfectly time his getaways.As the lead character, Statham's a transporter. He can get you, your associates or your property anywhere, anytime, on time, no questions asked. But you know what? Common sense tells us that it was curiosity that killed the cat, and the cat in this picture thankfully doesn't die some horrible death but instead, curiosity yields him a break - a beautiful woman named Lai (Shu Qi) - bound and gagged, and in the trunk of his BMW. The day he breaks his own rules, he realizes he is transporting a Chinese girl, Lai (Qi Shu), and he gets in many troubles due to his fault.It starts with a wild car chase in France, & introduces some memorable phrases. There are no smarmy one-liners making light of good action sequences as is too often the case in American-directed action flicks. There are some unbelievable yet jaw-dropping stunts, a terrific fight scene in oil, and some great car chase scenes. The Statham is cold, yet compassionate. There is even a great shot of the him jumping off a speeding semi while it races over a bridge onto the back of a bus going perpendicular to the truck under the bridge!! I mean, come on! There is another hilarious scene where the hero chases down an airplane on foot, hijacks it, jumps out of the plane at great altitude in order to land on the back of a speeding transport with a conveniently located borrowed parachute!There is plenty of action, Statham does display some pretty impressive moves but the frantic editing just doesn't do him justice. He obviously worked out for this part and there are frequent moments when his ripped torso is on display. He also (barely) manages to shy away any possible accusations that he's just a British novelty to American audiences.A basic action film filled with bone breaking action and wild stunts. People have unfairly slammed this movie for being unrealistic. What do you expect? The action scenes are performed to panache & stylized you have to suspend belief.

Add a little touch of originality and shake well and voila: you got a totally ridiculous, preposterous and yet funny movie. The car chases were good and predictable. The rocket propelled grenades or missiles changing course in mid flight; if they were heat seeking, I keep wondering where the heat was coming from. A toaster perhaps or a coffee machine?

Unfortunately after he finds the girl the movie breaks down into a series of cliches and explosions that are less interesting. The girl in particular, Qi Shu, is not a terribly good actress and is better as eye candy than whenever she speaks. In fairness it's probably her first English language movie.

To be sure, this is a movie where you must surrender disbelief before you walk into the cinema, in the genre of films like the Die Hard series and many modern Asian martial arts movies. Facts don't get in the way of a good story, and in a good story such lapses can be easily forgiven. This is sadly not one of those films, though.  I can only presume that the budget ran out, and deadlines did their damage, because after what seemed promising through almost the entire movie quickly turned into a shambles with one of the weakest endings I have ever seen.  I won't spoil what happens, although the ending could hardly be any more spoiled if I tried - suffice to say that you will leave the cinema thoroughly disappointed, and perhaps even tempted to try for a refund.As the film progressed, I'd been expecting to want to buy it on DVD if only for some funny scenes, alongside its impressive special effects and fight scenes (which borrow heavily from the movies of Jackie Chan in places).

Big mistake !!! After an admittedly cool introductory chase this is a straight and steep downhill deploying movie (Hint - leave right after it and do something else. It will save the evening !). Most treestumps have more distinguishable and varied facial expression than Mr.Statham flashes at the audience in this movie, the villains are utterly faceless styrofoam cutouts, the ""plot"" has holes in it the size of parking lots and some of the surprises are so hare-brained ( I mean, what villain has a packaged and primed timed-explosive-device ready for deployment, while frolicking in his gardens, just in case he needs to blow some unlucky courier to pieces if the whim takes him ?

Jason Statham does well in a role made for him. Frank Martin is his best action role to date in my opinion. Cool but lethal, he's basically everything we want in an action hero. 'The Transporter's' fight scenes are definitely the movie's highlight. Corey Yuen's choreography is brilliantly inventive placing our hero in life-threatening danger that he somehow always manages to slip. Don't take it seriously and you'll enjoy it. I personally love Luc Besson's action flicks and haven't been disappointed with any he's wrote or produced. This is among his best. Top marks to Vincent Tulli for his sound design too. ***/*****",The Transporter
191,Freddy_Boy,High-speed action from start to stop,6,14 June 2007,"Jason Statham plays Frank Martin a man works as a professional transporter. That means delivering or driving anyone without asking questions.Statham is an unlikely action hero. From chased in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to boxing promoter in Snatch and now energetic action star challenging ""actors"" as Van Damme for the role as hard-kicking bad boy.And he does a fine job too. Statham has a lot of presence and a lot more acting talent than other action stars. He might not be a Kevin Spacey but he can definitely get into character. Even if it happens to be the generic ""ex-special forces"" unwilling hero that just happens to be good at just about everything, except giving up that is.French action movies are plenty in numbers now a days. This movie isn't bringing life into a stagnating movie industry. If anything this movie is contributing to it. This is, pretty much, a standard generic template. Some cool action stunts, fight scenes, car chase and some, but not much, snappy dialog.In the end The Transporter is nothing more and nothing less than a good action flick. With Jason Statham as the main contributor that is.This is also another one, albeit rather early, movie that carries the ""Luc Besson Label"". He was indeed involved as a writer and producer his name even puts director Louis Leterrier on the side. A director who, as a note, got to direct The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton. That these movies, with Bessons involvement, act as a springboard for directors and upcoming action stars is likely but also sets the standard for movies to come.Still, Transporter was one of the earlier action movies, not groundbreaking or anything but very well worth viewing and by all likelihood even enjoying.",The Transporter
192,khan_rado,Cool is the right word for it,7,8 December 2015,"Meet Frank Martin. A former military he is now in the transportation business. A man of principles he likes it quiet in the morning. But after breaking his own rules his world becomes quite loud.More than a decade after its release this film hasn't lost any of its charm. It's entertaining and enjoyable but most importantly it's very, very cool. The connection between Frank and his car making it almost a supporting actor, the way he dresses, talks and acts and the whole atmosphere of the film are catchy and memorable. Jason Statham played his role so well that it's no wonder this film established his as a major action star. Qi Shu is acting very natural and Francois Berleand is very much into his character, also.Of course, some scenes are a little bit over the top but that doesn't take away its charm. The dialogue is clever and original and the fight scenes are choreographed with perfection. Combinig this with the fine settings and the fast pace it's an action film that deserves a watch.",The Transporter
193,du_man,Surprisingly Good,8,4 June 2003,"Rating: * * *Recently, most action flicks have completely wooden scripts and big but completely unbelievable action scenes.  See, for example, the latest James Bond film, Die Another Day.  Several of the action scenes couldn't happen at all in real life under any circumstances and the characters are badly written.The Transporter is an exception.  It's not entirely credible, but it could happen, and that's saying more than you'd think.Jason Stathom, whose first films were Guy Richie's ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"", shows that he is a good action star and actually probably better than Vin Diesel.  The script for this flick isn't the greatest and has some wooden dialogue, but the characters are well written and that helps a lot.  The action scenes are thrilling and a lot of fun to watch.  The plot is good for the first half, then worthless for the second half, but then again, the second half is almost pure action.  The character relationships are well done, especially between Stathom's character and the French policeman.Overall, this isn't the best, but it is very entertaining and fun.",The Transporter
194,ImmortalCorruptor,could have been awesome,6,14 December 2002,"This had many things going for it, great cast, great camera work and great stuntwork.  There were a lot of scenes that made me say, ""Ooh, that was cool!""  Sadly, there were just as many there made me say, well, I can't say that here. The first impression I got as the movie played out was that this was a big screen adaptation of the popular video game ""Driver"".  But as the story played out, it became painfully obvious that it was just another effort to follow the Hollywood pattern. Good things:  The actors fit pretty well, and many stunts have a Jackie Chan quality.  Jason Stathom makes a great leading man.  There are tons of current, hip camera shots and editing tricks to make this look cool. Bad things:  The bad guy looks like a character from the Kids in the Hall (I thought immediately of the bad guy from Brain Candy when I saw him).  The story seems to have been pieced together from a 14 year old who's already seen too many Bond films and played way too many video games.  Also, during the fights, there are tons of ""lame fighters"".  (These are the many guys trying to beat up the good guy, but while the good guy is whooping up on someone, the lame fighter stands completely still, even though he isn't hurt and has a clear shot at the good guy.) Blah, 6 of 10.",The Transporter
195,JackDevoe,The cooks made a fantastic broth!,10,14 October 2002,"I thought that THE TRANSPORTERwas flowing with coolness. Jason Stathammade a great leading man. He had a very smooth performance. He was veryhonorable, he never lost his cool,and another unique thing about him was that he never killed anybody unless he seriously had no other choice. It was achange from other movies where the good guy just kills all his enemies. Plus, he was VERY impressive with his martial arts. He was so good at it, he couldprobably beat Keanu Reeves in a fight. (Or even have a better chance againstJet Li than he did before in THE ONE.)People say Shu Qi was annoying in the film, but I thought she was cute. Herperformance was very fitting to her character in the film, so it6 made sense that she wasn't a confidant, Julia Roberts type of character.Corey Yuen's best modern work can be seen here. He actually did a better jobwith the action scenes here than in KISS OF THE DRAGON. He didn't evenhave to make blatant references to his other works in this film. His ideas were much more frsh this time. It made me think of the days of RIGHTING WRONGsand FONG SAI YUK.Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen have also written their best screenplaysince THE FIFTH ELEMENT. The movie had a very European feel to it, and noHollywood fluff got in the way. One way to sum this movie up is to say that it's a French/American Kung Fu film. It's the best action film I've seen this year.",The Transporter
196,BlockChuckster,Good Action Picture,7,7 July 2003,"This is the type of movie that Vin Diesel is probably beating up his agent for him NOT getting an audition for.  Stratham is making a serious statement for his contention of being the next up and coming leading man action star, especially after such good action yarns as Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.  He has arrived!",The Transporter
197,schtdygirl,We liked it!,10,12 November 2003,"My husband and I started watching it on HBO recently and we liked it.

If the story had been better, I could see them doing a series of these.",The Transporter
198,shiner310,transporter,7,6 September 2005,"This is a more than decent action flick. But the one thing that really struck me was the heavy homo-erotic content in this movie. besides the goodlooking hero, the villains are also goodlooking -- so when they fight, it's almost like you expect them to start making out pretty soon. towards the end -- SPOILER ALERT -- the homo-erotic content gets pretty blatant. first the hero covers himself with oil, so he can slide around the floor -- reminds me of hot oil wrestling. then when he's using a dead guy's body for cover and both get blown out a window and into the water, when the bad guys set an gas slick on fire, our hero ""sucks the air"" out of the dead guys' mouth... but it looks like a pretty passionate kiss. kudos to the filmmakers",The Transporter

Sure, the butt-kicking scenes are fun, but I'd rather get beaten to a pulp than watch a movie this dumb.  I agree that the leads, especially Mr. Statham, should become big stars, but they're going to need much better material than this to do the job.",The Transporter

201,lapratho,Impossible and Lame Superstunt Re-Write of a Classic,1,5 November 2007,"I had a hard time sitting through this masterpiece of modern impossible action untertainment and wasn't the least entertained. Others have made enough comments on the impossible stunts, so I'll spare details. When a movie goes overboard it becomes unbelievable - this one breaks that line big time. Even some Schwarzenegger flicks and the impossibly surreal ""Chronicles of Riddick"" worked better than this one!Conceptually the whole thing is similar to a 1977 (TV movie?) ""The 3,000 Mile Chase"", which is also listed here at IMDb. Except that I found that original courier chase story far more enjoyable. In today's video game culture something is missing - a good reality check!Hollywood has always managed to do the impossible, but things have gone too far out of reach for a real human being with even half a brain and a little basic physics education to imagine being part of the story. Never mind ""character development"" - bland or psychotic, I see people every day that make movie characters seem real by comparison, ""developed"" or not :)But for the entire action thing going here: Thumbs down!I think modern directors and writers need to watch some of the classic flicks like Burt Lancaster's ""The Crimson Pirate"" to understand what really good stunt and action work is all about - make it real with and for real people and forget computer animation!",The Transporter
202,BenjCarr,"Dude, this was so damn funny. Take a friend. (SPOILERS)",5,4 November 2002,"Oh my God, THE TRANSPORTER was incredibly funny. CROSSROADS funny. ORIGINAL SIN funny.It works like a parody of one of those '80s action movies, where the villain has henchmen who shoot machine guns at the hero but don't hit him. Meanwhile, the hero finds ways to effectively use a random object, like a sweatshirt, to subdue large groups of people.Seeing Jason Statham in SNATCH and LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, I was not prepared to see him completely ripped, cool and awesome. And the whole movie plays like one of those Clive Owen BMW ads, except without the deep emotional resonance or without the obligation of having to make any sense.After the first two action scenes, including the kickass opening chase scene, I looked over at Jessika and said, ""My God, I want that man ... now.""Unfortunately, in the movie, his love interest is Miss Horrible Asian Stereotype (whom he gives noodles and, strangely, chopsticks when he first entertains her at his home). She apparently can read and follow an English cookbook recipe despite not being able to read it aloud. Her broken English line-readings are, I think unintentionally, the funniest damn thing in the film.""That ... is ... point of romantic swim, no? No ... witnesses...""There are also the typical moments. The cheezoid rap music that segues into the romantic violin music when a fight scene ends with the hero encountering Miss Asia. A villain walks into every scene with the same facial expression. A cop walks away from the hero's seaside home castle but isn't able to hear or return to the scene when it's attacked by a barrage of cruise missiles and machine-gun fire two minutes later. (When the first missile flies toward the house, I laughed out loud.)Then comes the scuba-diving escape scene. Jessika told me that the hero probably keeps two full diving suits and equipment under his house for just such an occasion. I told Jessika it was lucky that Miss Asia was a certified diver. We were 40 minutes into the movie, and Jessika turns to me and says, ""You know, we still haven't figured out what the hell this is about.""Soon, another guy shows up in the film, wearing so much pancake makeup that I told Jessika he looked like Little Richard.When you do realize the plot, though, it's so wildly implausible that I was asking Jessika. ""OK, so the hero's trying to stop people from smuggling illegal Asian slaves in the back of MACK trucks through the French Riviera? Where are they going? Who keeps Asian slaves in Europe? I thought Asia was the only place where they could employ Asians under deplorable conditions at a slave wage.""(Later, I mentioned to Jessika that the scene where Miss Asia frees the slaves reminded me of the time when Catherine Zeta-Jones saved Mexico single-handedly in THE MASK OF ZORRO.)At one point, during one of the hero's slow-motion, shirtless running scenes, I pretended to be running with him. And Jessika howled.""No, it gets more gay!"" Jessika said to me. ""Soon, he's going to be covered in oil!""It did. At one point, the hero, shirtless and doused in barrels of oil, deeply kisses a dead man underwater - to stay alive. (Yeah right.) I almost fell on the floor I was laughing so hard.This reminds me, where can I hire myself an evil henchman? You know, someone who only exists to run at my more heroic enemies only to get killed?
And the ending, when Miss Asia frees the slaves (while I was wondering why they weren't all sick from being stuck in the back of a truck during an elaborate, multi-accident chase scene), also has her deliver what must be the worst line in the history of film. Jessika and I laughed so hard that we both cried. We're going to gather a group of people to see it again later this week. I suggest you do the same.",The Transporter
203,kennyevans,The Transporter-Didn't move me.,3,18 January 2007,"I loved Statham in Snatch, I thought he was inspirational, and pulled off the part with real conviction. The voice over throughout only adds to your involvement with his character and sympathy to his plight.Here however I felt that Statham was totally misdirected. He seemed straight jacketed in the part and the lines he was given further tied him down. His screen presence is fantastic and the film on paper should have been great. The opening car chase (although ridden with more continuity errors than many entire films) was reminiscent of Frankenheimer, even more so with the French location. The story however as it unfolded I felt was staggered and unconvincing both in content and acting. The Asian girl I thought was about as wooden as an 18th century Galleon and although there should not have been any chemistry due to the circumstances, any attempt just didn't work, including the scene where she drops her clothes in the doorway. Totally embarrassing, dialogue, acting, direction...todo! There were many simply unbelievable parts and I can't help nut think that this should have been an 18 so that the makers could have exploited the violence and gun play to it's max which seemed to be it's mainstay anyway. Insteadwith a kiddie rating which I feel could have been executed so much better. Once I saw the rocket leave the launcher when Stathams house was attacked, and travel almost pedestrian like through his kitchen, giving them both time to take evasive action, my suspension of belief snapped and I had to enter the comedy zone for the rest of the film. All the time fighting my better intentions because the film had great production values, even if it did contain a tad too many jump cuts for my liking. It dipped in and out of great and mediocre for a couple of hours.Statham earned a nice pay packet no doubt, but I'm sure he'll look back on this as a huge turkey that probably didn't warrant a sequel, of which I have not seen. Hopefully he'll not try and any more accents, god knows why this either wasn't dubbed or scrubbed from day 1 of the shoot. It would have worked better with his native accent, possibly tidied up for the US market who seem to have a problem with the 'mockney' south London drawl. There were so many dialects and accents it was a bit of a mess on that front.This surely has to win the prize for most bullets dodged by leading man in any film to date.Watch Ronin and see where it could have gone.",The Transporter

Lots of the action seems familiar from many Hong Kong action flicks but it doesn't disturb the viewing. The beginning act with the driving sequence is better than most Hollywood movies.

Better than the Matrix sequels anyway.",The Transporter

Although the Chinese girl pisses a lot of people off (at least that's what the negative comments on the forums here seem to indicate) I actually found her to be endearing, and the main highlight of the movie.Other characters, however, were just cheesy. The Villain looked more like a failed pop musician than some evil rich guy, so the match-up between him and the main character was completely unexciting from the get-go.The action is not as fast paced and riveting as the sequel.

Wrong again!! That illusion lasted the same length as it did for me to come to my first conclusion.Qi Shu was actually quite able in her role as Lai, the hard done to female who get's associated with our hero, but the other characters were just the usual types that you would expect to inhabit this kind of movie.The Transporter had such promise if the character had been fully utilized instead of being turned into a Michael Dudikoff wannabe and the storyline actually been given some substance, but instead I would consign it to the shelf along with the likes of Missing in Action, Bloodsport and Under Siege. 3/10",The Transporter

When i saw the name Luc Besson i thought by myself that this could be a nice movie, you remember films like taxi, yamakasi, wasabi or kiss of the dragon.
The story of the transporter is pretty simple; jason statham play's a guy who delivers packages for criminals. He has simple rules that shouldn't be broken, not by the criminals who give him the assignment or himself.Then he brakes the rule himself, he opens a package. and in that package he finds a chinese girl. from that moment there after the criminals who are smuggling people in containers from asia to france.this film has disappointed me a bit. When you know the luc besson movies, you expect something fast. this movie is fast but only in the first half after that it's turning into a soft story about trust and real love. So my conclusion is that if you like films from Luc Besson you shouldn't watch this, because it's a little disappointing. if you are a fan of Luc Besson you probably gone watch it any way.I give this film a 6. greetings to all of you movie lover's",The Transporter

Might I remind you that this is an action movie that's supposed to be in the style of violence and not sophistication?  I think people need to learn to understand that.  Do you go to see Titanic wanting to see martial arts?  How about White Oleander wanting to see animals in their natural habitats?No.  So take this for what it is.  It's an action movie.Having seen Statham in Snatch, it was quite a great surprise seeing him as a martial artist, but also sad since he could've used that in The One with Jet Li.  The only other guy that I think could've done this better was Gary Daniels.  British guy, martial artist, muscular.  That's all there really was too it.So, don't go to this movie expecting a grand moral lesson at the end for your children.  Don't go to this movie if you want to see the triumph over racial hatred.  Don't go see this movie if you want to see a relaxing, long, non-entertaining movie.See it if you want to see awesome action sequences.  Because this movie sure has those.(8/10)",The Transporter

221,Wogle,A brilliant Action Movie,8,3 July 2005,"OK... I don't care what other people say, I think this movie is one of the best action movies around.Why?Well for starters, the film has plenty of action sequences. ""So what?"" I hear say. Well the difference is between the ones in this movie, and others, is the fact that they are far more ""stylized"". By that, I mean the fighting action is like a mixture of Hong Kong Kung Fu action, and the kind of action that you would normally find in an action movie. It's John Woo for the West!The second is probably far more important: Realism. OK, I can agree that the movie's plot is a bit far-fetched, and this does make the movie seem unrealistic, but it's the small things that make this movie stand out. Take the shooting scenes for example - We see the bullets (Albeit in tracer form). How many movies can you see the bullets in? This adds to the realism of the movie and the tension. Also, when Frank Martin is chasing after the lorry, he's not in a cool looking car or one that can go at over 150 MPH... No! He's in a rubbishy, small MANUAL car. Yes, MANUAL. Unlike most movies where every single car seems to be automatic transmission, we can actually see gear changes! OK, the last point may seem trivial, but it's that along with the fact Frank Martin uses another guy's breath to breathe underwater, and uses the pedals on a bike to stand up in slippery oil, that make the film stand out, showing that the main character is not just muscles and testosterone...

223,ColdZro,Short on plot -- BIG on action. What did you expect?,8,13 October 2002,"Most of the movies I bother to comment on are the ones which people say they didn't like because the plot was weak...but if they're honest, most people should tell you that the thing about an Action movie trailer that gets their attention is the ACTION!  But most people aren't honest.  They wanna pretend that they went to the movie expecting a brilliantly-written story.  Well, I got news for ya:  Every action movie you see is going to have a weak plot! A Drama had darn well better have a strong plot, sure.  But an Action movie -- 9 times out of 10 -- is going to have a weak plot!  Why?  Because when you see an Action movie trailer, you don't say, ""wow, that sounds like a thought-provoking story.""  No, you say, ""WHOA!!  THAT MOVIE'S GONNA ROCK!!"" So, as I've said many times before, let a movie be what it is.  So okay, with that said, yes, the plot of The Transporter was like something from an episode of ""The Rockford Files"" stretched out to movie length.  BUT, The Transporter is clearly (to anybody who's seen the trailer) an Action movie. If you had seen the movie's trailer, but didn't know it was an Action movie when you bought your ticket, then you're an idiot.  Now, fast-paced, kick-butt action is the real reason you wanna go see an ""ACTION"" movie, correct?!  I mean, that's why I went to see it!  And I was not disappointed in the least!  The action in this comes at you hard and heavy through the whole movie, barely stopping for a minute to catch its breath.  Yeah, they did a few things that are highly implausible, but who freakin' cares!  I see reality all day long!  A little imagination never hurt anybody.  Which is not to say that the whole movie is full of impossible stunts, but it does have its share.  But my point is this: When I saw the trailer for The Transporter, I said, ""Whoa!!  That movie's gonna rock!""  And what did I say as I walked out of the theater after seeing it?  I said, ""WHOA!!  THAT MOVIE ROCKED!!""  So did I get what I expected? Absolutely!  Well, no...actually, the more I think about it, I didn't really get what I expected.  I got more! I loved it!  9 out of 10.",The Transporter

I did enjoy watching this and had no regrets whatsoever unlike Van Damme flicks.Frank (Stratham) is one guy who works as a transporter and transports anything. The comic sense is added into the movie due to his 'rules' of transportation. Just three rules and if anyone of it is broken he always lands in trouble. Lai (Shu Qi) is one such 'cargo' which he is supposed to deliver but he breaks his third rule and all the trouble starts. To add to the trouble got a local inspector suspecting him of some foulplay.It has got a simple story, well directed action scenes and some light humour in between. No complications, no overacting just a simple thrilling action flick. I would recommend it and you won't regret it !",The Transporter

I guess I am becoming an old fogey because when the cool techno music switched to ""rap"" noise, I became quite irritated and distracted from the actual movie.   I thought Qi Shu was outstanding; I am looking forward to seeing her in future films.

226,danim33,"Almost, but not quite",6,8 June 2003,"This movie reminded me of a Van Damme movie (before he completely went downhill) with a little Jackie Chan. Jason Statham was really fun to watch and I see him doing well in the future if he avoids doing more movies with completely useless plots that exist only to feature the far-fetched action scenes, like in this movie. (You might say that the same is true of J. Chan films, which I love, but they are at least humorous and extremely entertaining.) The supporting actors for the most part were bad and the storyline was weak. I liked how the movie started by showing us the transporter's job, but then the crap he gets in later is just an excuse for some ridiculous, although often entertaining action scenes. Do not see this movie unless your only expectations are to see ONE watchable actor doing some interesting action scenes. If the story or overall acting matters to you at all, then do not waste your time. This movie had potential with a great star (Jason) and idea for a movie (about a transporter), but did not live up to its potential. 6/10(mostly for Jason)",The Transporter

The action is fast it has good soundtracks (!) so if you get the chance to buy/rent this movie Do It.I absolutely love the role of the Transporter he does it superbly. If you have the chance look the other ones too... they're equally good.For me this movie deserves at least an 8/10. Hence I'm giving it a 10 :)",The Transporter

At the end of the movie the female lead shoots her dad and utters the line ""He was a b#$%^&d but he was my father"".

229,MrGravano,Skeleton of Quality,6,29 April 2003,"This movie had a lot of the right elements, especially the action.  For some reason though, it never really clicked.  The background music is bland, and most of the acting is lacking emotion - leaving the viewer very detached.  The chemistry between the actors also seemed forced, with the possible exception of the cop and the transporter. You can't really blame all of them; the Chinese father/daughter spoke broken English like you would expect from a Jet Li movie.  The strong points were the action, but many of these scenes were overdrawn and too controlled (you'll know what I mean from the final battle in the container yard).  The plot was very thin, but it took so long to materialize that you might not realize it.  Overall, the film left me depressed and expecting more.  Decent attempt.  6/10",The Transporter

Even the main character looks like the character of GTA IV.Action is great and the story is fairly good. Also reminds me a little to Die Hard, but I find it sometimes too unrealistic. For example, main character fight many times without fire weapons. Works great, but sometimes he is against dozens of bad guys and none of the bad guys seem to have a gun. Especially at the end, gets too ridiculous in this. All those bad guys should have at least a gun. I mean, they look like they get pay for defend the main bad guys. Maybe that is the least I like about the movie. But is not too bad. You might forgive that.I didn't like the girl actress work. Was not convincing many times, for some reason. Is like sometimes acts very different from what you would expect.

So how does The Transporter pull this off? Three simple things: great style, a cast of main characters with incredible talent, and of course the awesome chase scenes and fight sequences...plus a good tongue-in-cheek attitude about it all.Simply put, if you've been looking for a great action film for awhile, this is definitely the medicine you need.",The Transporter

236,franlorin,question of believability,8,19 March 2006,"I hope you already watched this movie, since my comments contain definite spoilers the movie was wonderful to watch because of the possibilities of a carefully regulated life (played by Stratham), i.e., here is a man who determines all eventualities in advance - that was clearly portrayed at the beginning when the news broadcast stated that three robbers had been picked up because of their bad driving (they ran into a taxi going wrong on a one-way street in Avignon) - if they only would prepared a better agreement in advance to cover the extra distance?!but then, what's this? - he gets a flat tire for god's sake! - how did he miss an eventuality as mundane as a flat tire (supposedly, it can happen to anyone, right, but this is our perfect hero?) - but why doesn't he only use run-flats on that BMW? - run-flats are not even high tech anymore, but our supposed hero didn't even consider using them on his otherwise very well equipped vehicle well, I gave an 8, but I was tempted to drag my rating down all because of the flat tire goof - anyway, the rest of the movie (before and after that FIRST incredibly annoying ""break in the rules"" by our hero - NOT opening the package as our hero said) was really very good",The Transporter
237,MovieLad26,My very first Statham movie,6,9 June 2013,"""The Transporter"" is a 2002 action film starring Jason Statham as Frank Martin, a professional driver with a very strict set of rules...that get broken almost a third into the movie. So much for efficiency, but that's the point. To throw a strict character into dangerous territory is nothing new for Hollywood, and with a film such as this,you'd hope it would be at the very least, decent. And surprisingly, it is.I'm not going to lie, I enjoyed this film when it first came out, and even more so today because of the monotonous sequels that follow a similar formula, and never take risks with the character.The plot involves Frank doing a transporting job for a criminal, and just when the mission seems like a success, suspicions begin to unravel and Frank is thrown into a firefight with the criminal in question, while attempting to protect a woman he was never meant to see due to his strict rules. The film follows a simple execution with enough turns to keep you entertained, but only to a certain degree. The fight scenes are slick, as are the driving scenes. The only kind of scene it's missing is a good old shootout, as we learn quickly that Frank fights mainly with his fists, which is fine, but it doesn't leave a lot of imagination to the viewer for what would happen next. The acting is sub-par. I like to consider Jason Statham a good actor when he wants to be, and he's good in this movie, but every one else seems to follow a generic formula, and it just falls short.I give the Transporter a 6/10 because even though it may be hooky in some parts, the action is good and it serves nicely as a movie to watch when feeling like nothing more than an action flick. It's a popcorn flick with little to no intellect, but sometimes you don't need it, and this film luckily doesn't.",The Transporter
238,sweper74,No No No No....,2,12 May 2006,"What a waste of time *gasp*. The ""Actionstar"" of this movie was of course an expert in everything, he not only had the martial arts skills to kick large butt, but also was good looking, had the best car taste, best talking-skills - could talk sense of a woman in no-time or lecture up the bad guys. If you wanna see a good action-movie/thriller with Jason Statham go watch ""Cellular"" instead and cut this crap, there's just too many exaggerated or dull things about this movie. This ""1 man with a bare breast kicks 20 guys butt at the same time""-movie did not impress me. Not at all (sorry).I grade it 2/10",The Transporter

The movie is just the right length... not too long. The hero is a relative unknown, but performs excellently as Frank, the clinical, calculated ""Frank""... an ex-special forces ""retired"" transporter of illicit goods... no questions asked until he meets Li, one cargo he wasn't bargaining on.The plot is relatively simple, the characters are very obvious, yet it works... very well... If you're looking for a well crafted action flick, this movie will be a very pleasant way to spend an evening, if you're looking for the next Matrix, and don't appreciate simplicity, you should probably avoid.All in all, the Transporter is a fast paced, solid action movie with great fight scenes and a noble plot.

The opening car chase scene could have been really awesome if filmed differently but the rest of the action and fight sequences were very good.It isn't an Oscar contender so don't expect a story, much less an elaborate one that goes into extensive details about every thing that happens.

This isn't any different.It definitely wasn't near as good as The Professional nor was it really that type of movie.

By minute eleven, you're left wondering if you're even watching the same movie.I've never, in all my days viewing movies, going out on dates and getting prostate exams, experienced something turning so sour, so quickly. The sudden and alarmingly abrupt change of style and pace of the film almost makes me question if there were original filmmakers (obviously harden vets of the action movie genre, who's craft has been molded and fine tune through years and years) who were fired halfway through production and replaced with some random crew members pot head teenage son and his bong hitting cronies. The movie is a plunge into stupidity in every way fathomable,  with some of the worst written dialogue ever to be penned. Such is the case when the evil villain of the story is killed, only to have his hostage daughter pipe up in big, teary, dough eyes `He was a bastard.but he was still my father.'The film picks up for a brief, shining moment about two thirds into it with a extremely well filmed and choreographed fight scene that has the hired-driver-hero fighting off thugs as he's drenched in oil or some other brown liquid. I should have left the theater on a high note at this point but instead remained for the rest, only to have it fall back into the poorly written, style over substance waste of two hours that it was.",The Transporter

It is very well done, with good camera, music, action, but unbelievably stupid story. By watching this movie, I had to laugh for many times.
So my advice is: If you wanna see tech managed action movie and the goal is only to entertain yourselves - see this movie. And dont think about the plot and things like this.5/10",The Transporter
244,peffs,Downhill Fast,3,13 September 2002,"Luc Besson has traditionally given US audiences something more than your standard Hollywood action film, often with thrilling (La Femme Nikita, The Professional) or visually dynamic (Fifth Element, The Messenger) results. So what went terribly wrong with The Transporter? Perhaps it was the director's (Corey Yuen) heavy reliance on the stylized John Woo and Jackie Chan inspired action sequences. But that can be fun sometimes. Perhaps it was the improbable scenarios and James Bond like clichés. But that, too, can be fun, even when the diabolical evil mastermind waits to kill the hero providing him enough time to be saved. What really went wrong with this film was that the story and main character got lost after the first car chase sequence.
Frank Martin is The Transported, played perfectly cold faced by Jason Statham. He is wonderfully introduced as a well organized, manicured, and precise driver hired for transporting ""packages"" for high fees, no questions asked. This is an austere man, following his own protocol and rules to keep his life ticking as perfectly as his watch. I wanted to get to know this interesting and reserved person from the moment he tersely negotiates with bank robbers on the first job we're privy to. He drives up to a bank at the strike of 10 am just in time to pick up his load - four bank robbers with masks, guns, and bank sacks. As he calmly explains that the contract was for three men, no more, and that he is not proceeding until the contract terms are met, the robbers threaten with guns and the cops start closing in around them. Through some good negotiation skills and some fancy and fantastic car handling skills, The Transporter soon has the men out of the situation and returns to his seaside home to clean up the minor mess to his car. BMW had several notable directors (Ang Lee, Guy Ritchie) shoot short films for the web, some with dramatically good results. The car chase sequence follows this theme with great results.But then something terrible happens with this wonderful start to the film. His next assignment, to carry a bag to a hillside mansion, turns bad when he opens the wriggling package to find a fresh and soft faced Asian girl with model good looks. Breaking his rule never to open the package results in some bad consequences. After he kicks two motor cops into submission, we loose the interesting guy and are left with only an action hero flexing his muscle and beating up on multiple guys at a time. The story about the thinking, motivated professional trying to walk the line as a precise driver in an imprecise and dangerous world turns into a mess of fight sequences and large explosions. Gone is the Martin with the clean suits and sharp dialog. We're left with a buff martial arts guy and no plot. This could be expected from the Hollywood studios and some of the lesser interesting Hong Kong action films but I expected more, both from the early hints of a real character at the start of the film and from Besson's earlier works. Sadly we're left with action fluff about as satisfying as cotton candy. Have fun with the car chase and oil spill antics, just don't be surprised if the sugary mass turns to air after the lights come up.",The Transporter
245,theo692,A real let-down,1,18 October 2002,"The movie opens with at least an interesting take on the car-chase concept, but from there it's all downhill. There's so little continuity between scenes that at times it seemed randomly generated. Unfortunately, in this shuffle, we never learn the ""little things"" like why the main character would suddenly break his all- important rules (one after another) or why the directors deemed it necessary to introduce (as the love interest, no less) a female character whose only inspiration seems to be one-upping Kate Capshaw from Temple of Doom.

Some of my friends went to see the movie and came back disappointed. They thought it was ridiculous and annoying for some reason. Of course that made my hopes of a new good action movie vanished quickly. Though I just couldn't let it all go, so finally I grabbed my butt and went to see it. A little bit doubtful, but still with an open mind.Guess what? I wasn't the least disappointed when I came back home. This was actually one of the best pure action movies I've seen in months. xXx was good, but perhaps a bit too much. The Transporter was all that xXx wasn't, though the stories are not to be compared, but some of the scenes was a bit alike. Anyway, The Transporter can be proud of the good acting, fabulous fighting scenes and a great and innovative story. Another thing that surprised me was the fact the whole love deal in the movie wasn't bad at all. Often the romance and love parts in action movies sucks.. really bad too.So to sum it all up. If you're looking for a nice fighting-speed-action flick, then this is really it. I still have to warn you. If you get disturbed on things that aren't ""realistic"" then you better leave this movie alone. Actually, then you should leave all action movies alone, because they are all about being ""a bit too much"". Now that I have warned you.. go see it.

Finding a kidnapped woman (Qi Shu), complications arise for Frank. It starts out good, but everything falls apart when the cheesiness takes over. The dialogue and acting do nothing to help the story. The movie's main attractions, its action sequences, are weak. Not only do they seem very slow, but the camera work makes it very hard to follow everything.

Statham is an up-and-comer with great screen presence and I also hope to see more of Qi Shu in American films. Although the story line could have been more polished, the illegal smuggling of Chinese was an interesting twist and I would enjoy a movie that delves deeper into this all-too horrific reality.

256,Arctic_fox,Irrational action,4,17 August 2003,"Well, I wouldn't have expected this kind of screenplay from the man who directed Fifth Element, Leon, Nikita and the Big Blue. If one would summarize the film in one sentence it would be: irrational action from the start. The plot was really illogical. For instance, why on earth would someone want to pay 40 000 dollars to someone to transport a daughter of a boss (who runs a criminal organization) to another place in the same country? Why didn't they do the `transport' themselves? It never came out why they wanted to transport the daughter to another place in France in the first place.I don't like about films that contain impossible stunts either. What do you think about the following stunt: the key figure in the film jumps ten meters from a moving truck to another and performs a somersault from top of the truck keeping hold of the roof (?!) and smashes the windscreen kicking the bad guy inside the truck. What's the fun of watching a film like that? The film let's you think that the good guy must be a god, because he can perform actions what humans are not possibly able to do. Therefore, you (the viewer) think that there is absolutely nothing that can happen to the hero and there is no point watching the film, since you already know what's going to happen. Such stunts are logical when a robot from the future or someone in the matrix does them but humans aren't supposed to be able to do such actions. I think though that the actor, Jason Statham has talents and I hope he will be seen in more classy films in the future.For your information directors and screenwriters: viewers are intelligent creatures and don't appreciate that you underestimate them.

The plot is really terrible and is not helped by the useless acting skills of Jason Statham, why will he not just use his natural London accent? He plays ex-British military, but still feels the need to add an awful American twang to his dialogue. The plot is so stupid, even for a mindless action flick. Whereas films such as Jackie Chan's use tongue-in-cheek action, this film tries to be cool, but is laughable. The music in the film really adds an element of pure cheese. The hip-hop beats played to car chases is really inappropriate. It works well with ""The Fast and the Furious"" because they have some cool vehicles, but not with a BMW being chased (really slowly) by a few Citroen police cars!

This Action/Crime/Thriller is about an Ex-Special Force operator Frank Martin (Jason Statham) with a mysterious past now works as a ""transporter"" who moves goods--human or otherwise from one place to another. No questions asked,with his own set of rules . Rule One: Never change the deal. Rule Two: No names--Frank doesn't want to know whom he's working for, or what he's transporting. Rule Three: never look in the package. but he broke his own rule & gets into trouble, which one & what type of trouble see the movie please ;).The most strong element is Jason Statham been an Olympic Diver on the British National Diving & background in martial arts gives us some amazingly thrilling car chases & fighting sequence, as a man one of the reason watching some movies is gorgeous ladies which this flick fulfill through beautiful Asian actress Qi Shu (lai).Now lets come to the weak part the reasons why i gave 6/10 , this flick has a very weak script for mature audiences & predictable too,no character development except Frank martin unreal heroism & a weak villain with not much to offer & avg performances by supporting casts sends this flick right back to being an avg , when i compare this action flick to first movie of Die hard series or MI which been released much earlier then "" The transporter"" they have much better story line to offer. yet if u like watching Jason Statham in action & want to feel the innocence of Qi Shu call your friends rent the movie don't buy ;) & have fun on couch :)",The Transporter
265,beeble_bee,an OK movie,4,26 September 2005,"i didn't really like it. Storyline wasn't very clear. It moved too quickly. I liked the stunts though, they were cool, sophisticated martial art style moves. The climax and ending was blunt and ended quickly. The whole movie...well.... not very clear. Not much action either, the relationship between Frank and Lai wasn't emphasised and shown clearly, which then lost the intended reaction at the end. Maybe the sequel would be better... Camera angles were good, the speed of the camera shots helped build the tension. The Transporter wasn't as good as I expected. So, in my opinion, this movie sort of disappointed me.

268,dreadfulape,A truly repulsive and ridiculous movie,2,14 May 2007,"This is one of the stupidest movies ever made. Not just in terms of the logic of its plot. That would be OK. But it is also outrageous in its grotesque representation of the female lead and jarring in its mismatch of derivative elements - fight scenes, car chases and petty sadism.The car chases are a fair attempt to match the standard of ""Ronin"". The fight scenes are uniquely detailed attempts to copy the style and energy of Jackie Chan. But the former film is a proper hard-bitten thriller where sinister people on both sides are fighting for high stakes. When cars are driven down public streets, innocent members of the public get hurt. 'Transporter' crosses over into Blues Brothers territory (such as the car leaping into the air from a standing start and landing on the lorry). And yet other elements of the film are deeply nasty (such as the bank robbers assassinating their own members).Likewise the 'comedy' fighting: Jackie Chan movies work because they know that they are simple fun. This attempts the same thing in a ill-fitting version of a 'hard-bitten' thriller, and ends with sheer nonsense. After the endless fight on the bus and in the station (one man in unarmed combat versus dozens), there is then the ridiculous fight in the oil-covered room, with its absurd bicycle pedal denouement. The hero then returns to the bus station and takes a gun from an injured man. If the injured man had a gun, why didn't he use it? Throughout the movie, the baddies have guns, and use them: except when the scriptwriter decides to fit in some Jackie Chan action.The 'hero' in this movie is in fact an extremely unpleasant individual. He is quite prepared to deliver The Girl into slavery or whatever fate awaits her. He rejects a number of chances to help her (even after he has discovered the only important thing about the character, that she is (ho-hum) exceptionally attractive). OK - that's the stereotypical anti-hero. But why does she then turn to him for help, help him, cook for him, and fall for him sexually and emotionally? There is no reason whatsoever for her to do this. He should be her enemy quite as much as the 'baddies'. And yet she does. It is an utterly unashamedly misogynist and racist depiction of the ""submissive Asian girl"", and of the ""hot chick"" role of females in a action movies generally.",The Transporter

In essence...another typical, over-the-top acion movie starring Statham, who I admired in ""Lock, Stock..."", who fails to pull through any of the same qualities as in the aforementioned movie.It's far too outstretched in terms of believability and, as in my previously mentioned reviews, resembles another Beyond Enemy Lines a.k.a dodging bullets (and in this case pure fire to the skin from the after effects of a rocket to the building he's in) scenarios, where the ""hero"" can come unscathed no matter what is thrown at them.It simply annoys me. More so being how, as I mentioned, Statham's abilities in ""Lock, Stock..."" far surpassed any of this action tat he's been involved in.Fine, it's simple..full of gun power..a nice bird to look at.... For me, I need something with substance and fewer actors who sell out to chase something i'll never understand they are after.As the subject states...so painful I was hitting the sides of my head in disgust...now I have a headache making this movie even worse.Good luck if you enjoy this Rated 2 for that hot Twainese piece...it would've been 10 but the rest of the movie is something I wouldn't wipe my ar*e with so had to scale down accordingly.",The Transporter

273,Borut_Z,Action scenes are not enough,6,13 July 2004,"I haven't seen action movie in, literally, years. Sure, I saw adventure/war/thriller/sci-fi movies with action (combat) scenes, but no pure action movie, because I totally lost interest in this genre long time ago. I got this movie from a friend, he just told me, it's the guy from Snatch and if nothing else, it's worth seeing it because of a car chase. So I watched it without expectations, and like with Pirates Of The Caribbean, it worked out very well for me. I'm starting to believe no-expectation policy is the way to go.Le Transporteur is pure action and that's it. The movie has weak plot, average acting, no character development, but it has energy. The car chase at the beginning is the best I have ever seen. It really rushed adrenaline through my veins. Fighting scenes were also impressive for me, but I really can't compare them to anything as I've usually avoided kick-ass movies since the time of Van Damme. Yes, the movie is totally unrealistic and unbelievable, in real-life main character would die at least ten times (or maybe a hundred times), but that's how it's got to be in this genre nowadays. Actually, that's how it has always been. Jason Statham, with his black suit, leather gloves and (almost) bald head, reminded me (like another user already wrote) of Hit-man - assassin from a PC game. As a matter of fact, the movie kinda looks like a game. They too lack in story (usually there is none or it's ridiculous), but they look good and are fun, just like this movie. There are complaints about young Shu Qi, but I think she did okay, wouldn't say it was major casting error. I guess they needed oh so cute, fragile, in-need-of-protection type. So what if her English sucks? But, the movie could be much better. It started really well, with a cool, interesting guy who is real professional. But, when a girl showed up, the movie-makers couldn't resist a little romance, which was unnecessary and really didn't fit in. Bad boys' leader, who is in many movies so charismatic, is here totally empty, shallow, uninteresting. The music wasn't that bad like some say, it was somewhat good, but it really could be better. It's great way to improve the movie with the music, and I really don't understand why they didn't put more effort in it.I kinda feel bad for the movie, because I did like it. I believe it could be one of the best action movies ever made. Unfortunately, a movie is a whole. Everything counts: acting, directing, script, editing, sound&music. Even action movie needs more than just good action scenes to become really great action movie. Maybe it will improve in sequel, but we all know what's usually the story with sequels, so...",The Transporter
274,lerner-3,Unbelievable... literally,5,18 August 2010,"Just watched Transporter 1 and 2 so this review will be about both. And I won't be able to explain my point without some spoilers. Both movies are equally as good, or bad, depending on your opinion, and I suspect the same about the third, which is unusual for sequels.Transporter is a good action flick if you can suspend your disbelief, and I mean really suspend. Here are the spoilers to prove my point. The transporter is fighting off a couple dozen baddies in a fist fight. After he knocks them all out he reaches in one of their pockets and takes out a gun. Why didn't they use their guns? Who knows. The filmmakers didn't even bother to make up some far fetched explanation like having the boss tell them not to use their guns because it will attract attention. Don't worry about it, just shut off your brain and enjoy the action.The transporter paraglides out of a plane and catches up to a truck going down the highway and lands on the roof. Another time he catches up to a helicopter in a car.Here's a zinger that had me laughing out loud. The Transporter is driving with a bomb under his car which is about to go off. What would you do? Well I would get out as fast as I can and run. What does he do? He finds some perfectly placed ramp that lifts one side of the car up and rolls it around so that a crane hook can just catch the bomb sticking to the bottom and pull it off just as it explodes while the car continues to roll 360° and lands on its wheels and he keeps driving.Here's another great laugh. The transport and the head bad guy are fighting it out in an airplane. The pilot is killed and the plane goes out of control into a nose dive. You're thinking well here come some unbelievable stunt where now he knows how to fly a plane and manages to pull it out of a spin that even expert pilots can't do. But you'd be wrong, because it's even more over the top than that. The plane actually hits the water head on. Neither of them are in a seat or have a seat belt on. Yet the plane simply hits the water, stops completely intact, then sinks, with both passengers alive and swimming in the water that starts filling the cabin. Think of a bus falling into the water off a pier and that's was a jet nosediving into the water at 600mph looks like. Oh god, I can't stop laughing even now.So if you're an action junkie these films will really appeal to you. Lots of car chases, fist fights, and gun play. If the silly factor turns you off at all then run the other way, or maybe get in your car and fly through the air in a couple barrel rolls away from it.",The Transporter
275,AkshaySonthalia,Good watch,6,13 January 2014,"Just saw this one today. It was interesting, the script was intelligent and the idea is unique. For a 12yr old movie, i guess it met its standards well. Except since i watched it in 2014, i found many loose ends to it. The most obvious were the fighting sequences, the acts were poorly choreographed and designed. I could see the non-reality element in them. Even otherwise, keep aside the lack of reality the stunts were also weak n laid back. Otherwise, the movie is quite enjoyable. The story flows smoothly. I loved the work of Jason Stathom and the actress Qi , both made a good duo. I hope the sequels r better, i plan to see them sometime very soon.",The Transporter

This movie reminds me of the French movies from the 80s, lots of action and lots of fun. Okay, it's been brought up to date, and now has martial arts, but it is still a wild ride.Jason Statham plays Frank Martin, ex Army, who works as a ""Transporter"" who works moving goods, no questions asked. When he's asked to move a package of no more than 50 kilos, he accepts the job. On the way to make the delivery, he gets a flat, opens the trunk and sees the package, in a bag, squirming. He decides to be a nice guy and give the package a drink... a mistake he is soon living to regret.There is the old police detective, snooping around, trying to find out what Mr. Martin is really doing in the Cote d'Azur. The girl, who seems to bring out the worst in him. The villain, who's trying to kill the Transporter.

In this, he was the lead and tougher and way more cool and the fact that he did 99% of the stunts himself was impressive.Personally, I would have liked to have seen much more actual ""transporting"" though, so we could enjoy more of the driving scenes. The ones we do see were cool, unbelievable, but enjoyable ! The soundtrack was good and Qi was an attractive choice - not sure why they needed to pass her off as Japanese though ?!

The story is one dimensional and oh so predictable.  A 12 year old who plays an excessive amount of first person shooter could have come up with a better plot.  Now I can appreciate a good ol' fashion action movie, but this was way over the top.  I was all over that opening car chase scene until he jumped his BMW off a bridge and onto a transport truck,...come on let's keep it within the realm of reality.  See Frankenheimer's Ronin for a proper car chase scene.  And what about parachuting down onto the trucks, once again why couldn't he have just driven up to the trucks and hopped on...that I could go for.  And the rockets into the house....anyways, I love action flicks, but I also like a sense of reality, even if the movie just skirts it.  The Bond flicks are a good example of extreme action within the confines (for the most part) of the physical laws of the universe.  As for the acting, over the top, but that's to be expected.  Character development...non existent.  Love interest...laughable.  However, the most disappointing aspect of this film was the blatent plagerism of Guy Ritchie's BMW ""Ambush"" short and Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".  If you see the movie it's obvious.

At first, I thought it was computer-generated, but a computer would have done a much better job. It would also have been useful to have had sub-titles when Chinese (?Mandarin ?

I came away with a great opinion of Jason, but I didn't like the lack of plot, the action sequences, the audio track. All in all, an unimpressive first viewing.Then, I found myself thinking ""I'd like to see that first car chase scene again."", Or, ""why didn't i like that fight scene in the bus garage?""... and I ended up buying the movie!!!The good: This is a straight ahead action flick with good (if not great) fight scenes, a contemporary (if poor) plot, good (if annoying) car-chase scenes.  And Jason.  This man rocks, and I sincerely hope he continues on to super-stardom so we get HIM with some higher-class movies.  Oh, and the settings and scenery are excellent.The bad:  The girl is an annoying, bad actress who speaks so thickly I found myself wondering what she was trying to project. BUT, she's practically a thespian compared to the indistinguishable rumblings of the french police.

The other actors were basically either annoying (the ""girl"", her father and the main ""bad guy"") or bland (the ""cop"")The fighting was innovative at times (the docks/bus station) and laughable at others (in the truck) but overall it served it's purpose well and probably saved this movie from getting a 2!",The Transporter

The action of this film is truly exciting, Jason Statham truly is bad ass as Frank Martin a.k.a. The mysterious Transporter, Jason shows some potential as he not only can act but his body movement is incredible, I'll even say he can rival Jet Li in terms of fighting. The action scenes have to seen to believe, not only are they ridiculously funny, they are well choreographed(which was done by the film director Corey Yuen)They're arguably the best fight scenes since ""The Matrix"" and they don't rely on wires in every scene.What Didn't Work: Let's face it, there is no plot in this film, NONE, and the character played by Shu Qi gets rather annoying every now and then.

Whatever that isn't given by the movie, is given by him. He gives a 100% pure performance in this movie. The underlying music of this film is also very good.

The only sequence that stands out is the Raiders of the Lost Ark rip-off. Statham is not a martial artist, and even an untrained eye can see that in the ho-hum choreography. From the martial arts angle, this movie would do well to come up short. Hell, the only way it could be seen as impressive or exciting is if you had never seen another martial arts sequence. That, or you've only seen American martial arts films from the 80's...The plot....is nonexistent. There are so many plot holes that is should be considered disgusting, but so many people make excuses for crap like this. *sigh* And stunt performers wonder why they don't get the respect they deserve...Bare in mind, by applauding mediocre crap like this (just as an example), YOU DON'T HELP!!!!! For crying out loud, the central twist in the plot (if you can call it that) has no justification. Why was Lai in the duffel bag? It's never clear to the viewer, and no explanation makes sense. There's nothing she could do to effect the situation besides bitch about it, and frankly any other rationalization would be drawing at straws. If you've got one, I'd like to hear it. However, every explanation I've heard so far has been a complete load of crap. So wow me. While you're at it, tell me why Frank went against his own rules to help a person that he couldn't have known was in the bag in the first place. All he saw was the bag moving, no sounds of any kind. For all he knew, that was a bag of rabid squirrels. I know the movie needed an excuse to get the ball rolling, but don't insult us...Aside from other ridiculous points in the films (like the convenient open space on the truck at the beginning of the movie), look out for the first squabble Frank and ""Wall Street"" have. After Frank is knocked to the ground, the stock villain ""Wall Street"" says to his henchmen; ""Keep him alive..."" The only sensible question to ask at this point is ""For WHAT?!!?!?!?"" Skip this unless you hate yourself...",The Transporter
296,agentvangough,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.,8,6 May 2005,"The Transporter is perfect for its time. There is car scene, several fighting scenes, which makes it worth seeing. The first thing that makes the film step away from everything you have seen before, it the bullet time. In every movie you see, bullets flying and they all hit the ground right in front of the person. In this movie they use this laser type trail thing and you can see them landing all over where the gun was pointed. The lead character plays the perfect anti hero. He is just doing what he is good at, for his own personal benefit, and that is that. When you cross him, it isn't just a job it gets personal. This makes the film even more interesting. The girl is hot and she isn't in the whole movie. Welcome to the combination driving and fighting.",The Transporter

Want to watch a good action flick??Then go ahead and watch The TransporterJason Statham is really the man for the job as the Transporter ,who is this ex-military now retired guy who ships object or transports people from here to there without asking questions.A solemn man who does his job by the rules and does it really good,Statham fits very well into the role of the transporter.Then comes the day when he breaks his rules while transporting which leads to a series of events which brings out the professional hunter in him.I had watched it after much hesitation and after watching it i felt that i was more than wrong about the movie.The action sequences are really good and Statham has this very cool style of fighting throughout the movie(which though is sometimes unbelievable but strategical)If u r done with movies like The Matrix and KillBill and haven't watched this one then go ahead and watch it immediately .Neglect the lack of a proper script and the sometimes-dragging melodramatic scenes in the movie and u'll have a good time.The performances put up by the supporting cast ,Francois and Qi Shu are also up to the mark.A very well made movie ,transporter doesn't miss out on the stuff required to keep its audiences glued to their seats yearning for more of it.",The Transporter
298,Liquid-5,This movie is total garbage,2,19 October 2002,"Few films bring to mind gold standard by which all bad movies are measured. The gold standard? Dante's Peak, of course. That film demonstrated a total lack or respect for the viewer, not only offending through a total swiss cheese plot, but also by blowing all sense of reality through the window. The Transporter is in this category of poor films. The first 15 minutes actually lulled me into a false sense of happy expectation. Yes, it was ripped off of Ronin, but a good car chase is still a good car chase.Once the car chase stopped, though, the crap began. I think that there was a plot somewhere in the movie, but I can't be entirely sure since they dropped what felt like plot elements in every 20 minutes or so and never really explained them. I doubt it was a very good plot anyway, you don't hide plots that are sound between useless action sequences. That's ok, though, it's hard to care about a plot when you can't find anyone in the film to sympathize with. The Transoporter was a hollow and emotionless character, first not really caring about the woman in the trunk and suddenly lusting for her, after several times declaring she is nothing but problematic. Oh, yeah, I can see why he's ex-military since he puts a loose rope around her neck and lets her go out of sight to pee. Hey, guess what, not exactly razor sharp military intelligence there, pal.Then there's Chinese girl. She's a whore, and not exactly sure where her allegiances lie. At one point, she could saver the Transporter from a problematuic situation, but chooses instead to just look dumb. She jumps into bed with the Transporter ten minutes after meeting him, and doesn't exactly have a very clear picture of how she sees her father. Anyhow, it might actually be worth seeing this at some point. I have no doubt it will make every movie you've ever thought was bad seem that much better, as this is truly a Batman & Robin level piece of trash.",The Transporter

300,Fifteenthwarrior,Excellent and funny action flick,10,24 November 2002,"My wife and I went to see this movie, because we could not get into the sold out James bond movie which I was not too interested in seeing in the first place as that series just keep rehashing the same old corny plot over and over again.As we got to our seats, I could not help noticing that the theater was filling up quite nicely, something which I did not expect, thinking that this was going to be just some B movie that no one would bother to go see. Now when I see a movie theater filling up, that usually tells me that the word of mouth has gotten out regardless of what the movie reviewers have been saying about the movie. People just tell their friend to go see this movie.I had already seen a movie with Statham , Ghost Of Mars which I liked a lot. You know the type of cool midnight movie action flick which most guys love with their popcorn and soda. So although I was not expecting an academy awards performance I know that I generally liked Statham 's persona.Well the movie finally started and right away I was pleasantly surprised , I even commented to my wife as we were watching , "" I'm really liking this movie"". Statham plays an interesting character as an ex Special Forces type that retired on the coast of France, taking work on the side as a transporter of extremely hot illegal packages that even the criminals would not want to transport themselves. He is a no questions asked one man Federal Express type  transporter of  illegal goods. He is just the right person for the job too, highly experienced ex military ,  quick thinking , organized and effective and can't be pushed around by even his hardest core customers. Now Statham is a meticulous professional that takes pride in his work, who lives by a set of simple rules. 1) Once you agree to the contract, it does not change, 2)  No names / no questions  asked   3) never look in the package.Well the story is basically what happens when he breaks rule # 3. I will leave at that for those who may not have seen the movie yet.The action sequences are very well done , the pace of the plot is fast and the dialog is quite funny.This gets a 9 out 10. Not because it academy awards material , but because that is how I felt when we came out of the theater .",The Transporter

I hate when I have no fair no choice in what I me and my friends watch at the cinema because they gang up on my choice anyway...... This was straight out bad.  BAD actors and performances all round. Jason Statham is great in Snatch but in this movie he sucks big time. No redeeming aspects at all. Except the fight where he ""THE TRANSPORTER"" tips the oil and everyone slips all over the place trying to grab him. I didn't even like the action scenes they were so generic. Corey Yuen what were you thinking. I love his old stuff my personal fave is My Father Is a Hero. But he screwed up big time here. Also Luc Besson who I am fan of his work, this a dodgy movie with typical structure and plot more thin than a super-model with a eating disorder. And the chase scenes weren't even exciting. I most more thrilled by riding a coin operated pony ride. The whole movie was predictable and was so boring when the actors spoke pointless dialogue which got in the way of the barrage of fight scenes. And the romantic interest couldn't even speak English properly, when she tries to say ""Or your brain goes on the f**king desk!"" she could barley pronounce it. At least they just slip in the pointless sex quickly without reason. Just have the girl slip off her gear and jump the b*****d, Also the French cop sucked. His worst line in the movie was in response to the Frank saying ""Well I'm ex-navy..."" and he says"" Well I'm ex-little boy..."", Great dialogue time went into that one. And the worst part of the movie is when Frank is in jail and the cop unlocks the cell and then hints to Frank that he should escape and save the day. After ""hinting"" it they exchange pointless looks for about 3 mins, the French cop trying to get the message across. In final I hated this movie is was short and was an anti climax.

304,dovregubben,The best action movie of 2002!,9,2 December 2002,"Once again Luc Besson asserts his mastery of the action genre.The great thing about The Transporter is that the action never stops.  It only takes a breather for a few minutes at a time to develop the plot. The fact that it HAS a coherent plot sets it apart from most action movies I've seen recently.  The one liners aren't too cheesy, the action is just enough over the top to entertain you without insulting your intelligence, and the trailer didn't give away even a fraction of the great scenes in the movie. The good guys are likable, the bad guys are detestable.  The character interaction is enjoyable at all times.  Jason Statham is certainly establishing himself as an action movie leading man.  I hope more roles like this will follow for him.If you like action, this movie is a MUST SEE!",The Transporter

We don't go to action movies to see character developemnet and The Transporter doesn't break new ground there. How could it; the movie is only 45 minutes long, or so it seems. So predictable you'll think you've seen this movie before. Scenes run together so incongruently I wonder if the editor was even looking at the celluloid. The romanctic interlude is likely put in only for a nudity rating. Even the stunts are archaic. Jumping out of a plane with a parachute, ooooh! Leaping from an overpass to a moving semi, whoa.

The dialogue is awful and there are so many cheesy lines you could melt them down and use them in a fondu! However, in a way this only makes the film more watchable. There were countless times when myself and other people in the cinema cracked up (check out the moment when the flowing music kicks in when Statham opens the bag for the first time!) at moments which were quite frankly halarious! But the film really doesnt take itself seriously, and almost seems to recognize that some of the lines are so bad, they are good!Jason Statham has always impressed me, especially in Guy Richie's Snatch, and in this film he doesnt let you down. Okay, so his accent may be dodgy as hell (we personally thought he should have kept the british accent to add to his hard ass image) but he is hard as nails and surprisingly efficient in the fight scenes!Overall, yes the plot is naff, yes the script is tripe, yes some of the acting (Statham aside) is wooden, BUT yes the action is fantastic, yes Statham is cool and yes it is so funny I nearly wet myself!Watch out Vin, Jason is the new action star!",The Transporter

I think I could pick up some volunteers at the Community Theatre and make a better movie than that. Jason Statham (with a little work) could be a huge action figure in the future, but the other people in the film (and the writing itself) were below poor.

Why does he have an extra mask there for her. 2. when they're underwater suddenly they both have full scuba-diving gear with masks, oxygen-tanks and swim feet. For me, moments like this weakens my impression of the film. However if you love epic fighting and explosions I really recommend this title. There were tons of fighting and explosion. At some point of the movie two cars just collided and exploded.The part I liked best about the movie was the start. That was really well made.

When I went to see this movie, I was expecting a nice Ronin-esque like action flick. Especially considering I'm a huge fan of Jason Statham, and all the previous movies he has done. Instead I've got a poorly thrown together clichés and scenes with absolutely no point. The lead female character barely speaks English (they TRY to explain this fact in the movie), and needs to spend much more time in acting school. That probably goes for at least half of the actors in the film. The soundtrack is horrific. The music in and of itself is great, however it seems as in the sounds somehow were mixed up and the wrong music was played at the wrong scene. There are times where techno is playing during a slow scene, and a nice slow song plays during an action sequence. The dialogue is forced, the story is cliché, and nothing whatsoever stands out from this movie to write about. The only decent scene was the car chase at the beginning of the movie and the fight scene between Jason and the many villains in the warehouse. It did manage to show off Jason's potential as an action hero, as well as had some creative fighting moves. However, this movie has nothing to offer. The same action can be seen in different, and much better films. Avoid this as you would the Black Plague.1 out of 10",The Transporter

The acting of Statham, Schulze and Berleand is passable, but the comical over-acting on the part of the rest cast would get irritating if this movie were any longer. Qi Shu makes for nice eye candy, but her grating voice, accent and over-acting shatters her sensual image every time she opens her mouth. The extended fight sequences (way too long in my opinion) are spectacular, but they can't carry the movie. The non-fight scene stunts, in my opinion, were the best parts of the movie.

Don't worry, her dialogue wasn't worth subtitles so we didn't miss out on any translation.Throughout the movie it seemed like Luc Besson was deliberately attempting to minimize the kill ratio in this movie, JUST to maintain a PG-13 rating (i.e. throwing a knife in between a persons legs vs. in his chest).

Lots of rapid-fire editing (think Robert Rodriguez on PCP) cannot cover up how lame and ridiculous the car chases---he is THE Transporter after all---are.  The actual fight scenes, as mentioned by other reviewers, are also hilariously bad as well.Even worse, though, is the story, or lack of one.  As likeable as Statham is in Guy Ritchie films, he is given nothing but horrible dialogue and no plot to work with here.  This should not be surprising, considering Luc Besson wrote and produced this.  Watch The Fifth Element sometime and try to figure out just what the story was there.All in all, an utter waste of time.",The Transporter
331,Olson50,Entertaining in a not-too-demanding kind of way,9,28 August 2003,"This can more or less be summed up as ""Leon The Professional"" meets ""Enter The Dragon"".  90 minutes of non-stop action with just enough plot to keep it together.  The fight sequences are reminiscent of the golden age of kung fu, while the style is classic Luc Besson.  Hong Kong action meets French chic uptown!  C'est magnifique!",The Transporter
332,nelson_family01,Action packed,10,20 October 2002,This movie is awesome from the get go. Never heard of the actors but they did a great job. So much action going on the movie never loses interest. Similiar to a James Bond film but a different twist. A must see. Hard to comment on this movie due to not giving it away.,The Transporter
333,vagrant829,Caveat Emptor,5,13 October 2002,"There are two types of bad action movies: the first is the action movie that doesn't even bother to put in a storyline, and simply tries to get by with some cool gimmicks and action sequences; the second is the action movie that tries to put in a story line to make it seem like a movie with substance...and fail miserably. This movie didn't just fail miserably. It failed with such spectacular flare that practically two-thirds of the people in the theatre, including myself, burst out into laughter and just about every scene. If you're looking for some mindless action, I suppose this movie may do, although even the action sequences (supposed highlights) are way too unrealistic (pretty much an attempt to create the White Bruce Lee, if you ask me). But I'd recommend a DVD rental, not a waste of your saturday night (a mistake that I don't regret; I hadn't laughed as much in quite some time. The Unintentional Comedy Value in this movie is phenomenal; it rivals the likes of Mortal Kombat).",The Transporter

Now I can say that after watching the trasnporter I am a happy camper.Very good action, well thought out action senes.

It opens with possibly the best car chase sequence I've ever seen.  The movie maintains intensity and it seemed about 5 minutes long.  The movie is fun!The down side of the movie is a plot that progressively becomes more absurd and a stupid, yet exciting, final chase scene.It doesn't have the depth of character or the development of La Femme Nikita or Leon the Professional.

There is no story and thats it, but on the other han I can't name vey many action films with one either so what it lacks in story it makes up in action. Jason Statham is quiet good, not great but good enough and the asian girl is also okay. As I said the ction scenes are great and Satham acctually shows some really good close quarter fighting, not Jet li class but very good, using power instead of speed. the only scene I didnt was te one in the bus.....main character is surrounded by bad guys and they only atacks one at a time...not neat.

If you want to see a film with a good story watch other films. Most of the people give such movies a bad rating because there is no story. But they always forget that it is an action film. The story isn´t important in that kind of movies. I watch this movies because of the shoot outs and the fighting scenes. And the more spectacular and faster they are, the better the film. If you see a lot of action you will certainly forget about the story. And THIS movie is one of them. The characters talk a little bit but most of the time they shoot, fight or drive very fast through a town. That was it. And it´s fun to watch it. Everybody who loves action films and everybody who doesn´t compare those films with American Beauty, Road to Perdition or such films, should see this film. It´s worth to see it.",The Transporter

But give it a try...,The Transporter
341,wluck2p,A very bland action movie....,5,30 June 2003,"So I just saw the Transporter and I must say that it was very trite and also very bland. First of all, When you have an action scene, generally there is fast paced music in the background. Not so for this flick, the score does not match the movie. Secondly, the dialog leaves way more to be desired, I kinda felt like this movie was overseas and then shipped here. If you want a true fight type action movie then Kiss of the Dragon or Fight Club are far superior.",The Transporter
342,sometimey,Good action...even better soundtrack,10,10 July 2005,"As movies action movies go this was okay. Lots of action. A little romance. The whole bad guy/good guy thing. Sometimes the dialogue was difficult to understand with all the various accents. Most of what the policeman said was incomprehensible for me. Without a doubt the absolute best thing about the movie was the music. Right off the thing that kept me watching was the soundtrack. It was absolutely EXCELLENT!!! I'll watch this movie again...just to hear the music. It actually became a character in the action. Overall, the soundtrack took this movie from a 5 to a 7 for me. Stanley Clarke is OUTSTANDING!

344,padason,This is a great film,10,10 September 2004,"This picture is pure action and is a perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood today. It keeps forcing ridiculous female heroes and boyish men in the role of hero. Jason Statham is tremendous ,the bad guy( who I recently saw in Steven Seagals atrocious Out of Reach) is also great. Shu Qi is gorgeous and the film is beautifully shot ,the fight scenes are sharp and unpretentious.The dialogue at times is dodgy as is the soundtrack but I would actually buy this on DVD and be proud of that fact.

Well I was not wrong. But i NEVER expected that my previous sentence could be filmed with so much action, entertainment, class, good music and fun.Now this Statham guy is no James Bond, but he is so much better than him. This movie makes sense (no fighting with tuxedo on). Very good photography, direction and visual effects.

346,bhelmore,9/10 star reviews! You've got to be kidding me!,4,6 April 2021,"Like many action films, the script of The Transporter was largely ""throw-away"", but I would expect that the same script in a capable director's hands could have resulted in a much more enjoyable film. Unfortunately, ""capable"" is not a word that I would use to describe the director(s) of The Transporter. The casting, the acting, the cinematography, the fight scene choreography -- everything about this movie is lacking. About the movie's only saving grace is some of its car chase scenes, but these are bought down by the most distracting music score that I've ever heard in a film! I know it sounds crazy criticizing a film's score, but The Transporter's score is so bad, it made me constantly aware of its presence. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. This is not a John Statham movie worth watching.",The Transporter
347,eeo756,Can't Miss but I'm gonna pick nits...,9,25 February 2006,"First let me say that this is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed the first time I saw it and every time I've seen it since. I would have paid to go see this movie which in the age of cable and DVD is a high compliment indeed. However, as I am the idiot who sits in movies and says things like ""That's a Model 1911 Colt and this movie is set in 1908!!!"", I do have a few nits to pick with the movie and they are all things that could have easily been rectified.Frank Martin drives, according to the Inspector, a 1999 BMW 735i. Now while I am by no means an expert on Euro-spec cars, one would think that a 3.5 liter six-cylinder would be a bit weak for the kind of work Frank does. I would pick an M5, 4.4 liter V8 or take a less conspicuous 540i six-speed and buy modifications from Alpina to bring it up to M5 specs. Maybe he needs the extra trunk space of a 7-series...in that case, the 745i V8 or the 750i V12 would be a much better choice. While I'm not sure of Euro-specs, in the US the 745i and 750i were only available with automatic transmissions and that would take some of the drama as well as the skill away from Frank's driving. At least here in the States someone shoehorned a 5-liter V12 into a 5-series BMW and mated it with a six-speed manual. Why couldn't Frank drive a 7-series with a V12 and six-speed? All the producers would have to do is stick on a 750 badge!!! (That 5-series with the six-speed and V12 is for sale and if I had 25 large burning a hole in my pocket it would be in my driveway...) Now, about Martin's military background...while he was sleeping the girl found pictures which would indicate that he had been an American helicopter pilot, Gulf War era. Now, although Jason Statham does a pretty good job of downplaying his British accent, he would have been much more believable as an ex-SAS operative, especially with the level of fighting skills he displayed. I'm sure in light of the crop duster plane sequence it was important to show that Frank had flying skills, however I wish our pilots were as well trained in hand-to-hand combat as Jason is!!! (9-11 would be a footnote of a couple of failed hijackings in that case...) Admittedly, in my service I was a Pathfinder attached to an aviation unit and several of our warrant officer pilots had been Airborne Ranger qualified enlisted men before going to flight school. I too am a Ranger School graduate and my hand-to-hand combat training nowhere approaches Frank Martin's level. Only the SAS, Dick Marcinko's Seal Team Six and maybe Delta Force could possibly fight at that level.Statham looks convincing though, and not since Steve McQueen have I seen someone who actually looks like he maybe can drive as well as he does in this movie (possible exception of Robert DeNiro in Ronin, whose research for any role is legendary and other-worldly). I did like this movie and will watch it again.",The Transporter
348,stephen-mooney,A Guilty Pleasure,7,29 March 2006,"I first saw this a few years ago, on a rainy day and I nipped into the cinema in the late afternoon to get dry and warm. How glad am i? A film that basically came out of nowhere and helped secure Jason Statham's reputation as being the hardest Englishman in the business (Vinnie Jones? Please!) and one of the most popular actors in America. Its pure adrenaline from the first car case, right through to the homo-erotic but brilliantly choreographed oil fight. Statham's no Tom Hanks in the acting stakes - but then he is not required to be. He's required to look hard as nails and run, jump and punch a lot. Which he does - a lot. The biggest let down of the film was the weak ending. You know that the girl will save his life and kill her father, you know it - but you really don't want it to happen and when it does, well - lets just say that every time i watch the ending I want to throw the TV out the window. Anyway - pure blokes film, great fights, great stunts, cars, guns, sexy woman and it may never win any awards for best screenplay, but that doesn't mean its not worth checking out. And if your girlfriend/boyfriend complains - just mention buffed up men with no shirts on, covered in oil.",The Transporter

352,andreipielescu,"Interesting plot, minor continuity issues",9,25 March 2019,"""The Transporter"" is an action film that focuses on Frank Martin (Jason Statham), who is a private driver for illegal cargo, such as people and money. The plot follows him in the south of France, where he activates. His work is led by three simple rules, which he almost always obeys. However, this changes, with Frank breaking the three rules constantly, which gets him in trouble with the police and with a very influential man.This being a movie directed by Luc Besson, it features a lot of intense car chases, beautifully combined with occasional fights. Similar to ""Taxi"", this film is based in Provence, featuring heavily-modified and fast vehicles. In the beginning, Frank is driving a black BMW 735i which is then replaced by a stolen Mercedes S-Class. In my opinion, the performances of all actors are very strong, mainly Jason Statham's and François Berléand's, who plays Inspector Tarconi.However, there are some minor letdowns, chief among which is the continuity of details. First of all, certain features of the cars vary from one scene to another, such as the BMW jumping off the bridge in the opening scene having tinted windows while the one in the rest of the movie doesn't, or the fact that the Mercedes has its grille in place immediately after crashing through a gate, but in the next scene it is hanging off. Moreover, after the oil fight, Frank is seen swimming away from the attackers, and in the next scene his trousers are clean and dry. Another disappointment is that there are many similarities to ""Taxi"", like the way the French Police is regarded useless.All in all, ""The Transporter"" is a memorable and gripping film that is worthwhile, even if it is slightly disjointed and a bit far-fetched as the plot unfolds.",The Transporter

All the things that have been improved in martial arts films' fighting scenes such as the old fist misses the face-it couldn't happen that way type stuff have been left uncorrected in this film. As for the story, its not that great, but I won't criticise it because its an action film, and lots of action, there is.

He also starred as Vince in The fast And The Furious. I really believed that he was. Jason Statham also does an outstanding job being a Transporter of dangerous goods and people. He drives his BMW 735i all around France running away from the police with bad guys in the backseat who are just as amazed at what he is doing as anyone watching the movie. He's got it made, making $70,000 every day, that's awesome! And while he's doing it he's having fun. How lucky can you be.

There is virtually no plot, no acting worth noting, and the visual effects are poor at best. It is full of clichéd writing, and has a soundtrack that is more random and out of place than your grandma riding a Harley in a bikini. It's pretty hard to believe that they made a sequel out of this misguided action thriller wannabe, but they did, and that is now on my list of bad movies to see.

Awesome stunts, great camera shots & although totally unbelievable, it was a really good watch. Looking forward to the follow up. Subtle use of humour with another unknown actor playing the French policeman. Again, he was excellent in the role. The female lead was quite a stunner; enough in fact, to make me have a look at IMDb. THe stunts were terrific although implausible - just the way an out and out action movie should be.

The car chases are very much like the ones in the Bourne identity, but much faster, and with better driving and more class.Overall, I found this film exceedingly enjoyable, and after watching the film, immediately ordered ""Transporter 2"" online.

361,sjhawkuk,A complete joke from start to finish!,1,9 July 2003,"The Transporter takes everything that's bad about action movies and combines them into possibly the worst 90 minutes of film I have ever seen.  This film is a complete joke and insults the intelligence of anyone who watches it.
I saw the misleading trailer and thought that it might actually be worth watching, but how wrong I was.  There are so many things wrong with this film that it's difficult to know where to start.  Just how dumb can a film actually be?  The following situations in the film just defy belief: **Contains Spoilers!**1) The breathing apparatus conveniently stored in the water under Franks house!2) Frank chasing a light aircraft - on foot - and catching up with it!3) The truck steering and accelerating all on it's own while Frank is fighting the bad guy inside it!4) The bad guy conveniently having a time bomb in a suitcase handy to give to Frank when he drops of the package!5) The bad guys getting to the bus station so quick!
Don't get me wrong; I love a nice, well-made, brainless action flick as much as the next guy, but The Transporter is so pathetic, so ridiculous and just so plain DUMB that I actually felt insulted after I watched it. Also:6) Jason Statham's accent! - What the hell is going on there??7) The music! - Could they have actually chosen worse music for this film?? It annoys the hell out of you and does not fit the on-screen action at all. The song played over the end credits is absolutely hilarious (unintentionally, of course) - just have a listen to the lyrics and you'll see what I mean.
As a comedy, this is about as good as it gets!  The ludicrous scenes described above, coupled with terrible accents and an even worse plot, means you'll be laughing out loud most of the way through - I know I was.

And the simple fact of the matter is that The Transporter cannot even manage this. Sure, most of the action sequences are reasonably well choreographed, and Jason Statham is quite engaging as the titular character, but neither of these is enough to save a film that chokes on one of the worst scripts of the year. Luc Besson's fall from grace is complete. Even last year's Kiss of the Dragon was smarter than this - and that really is saying something. By the film's end, every single person I attended the screening with had two major complaints: First and foremost - how completely non-sensical the script was (to the point where Lai Kwai's actions have no motivating basis at virtually any point in the film). Secondly - one of the worst musical scores in film history. Mr Stanley Clarke, stand up and take a bow. Any score that so completely overplays the action scenes to the point where sound effects are actually lost in the mix, is one that is worthy of sincere disdain. There were plenty of other criticisms levelled, but these were the main two that really grated on all of us.Do yourself the biggest of favours and avoid this tripe at all costs. Maybe, just maybe, The Transporter is worth a late night rental from the video store when you have absolutely nothing better to do and are in the mood to ""Spot the flaws"". But otherwise, just don't do it.",The Transporter
367,jdthor2,75% Fantastic 25% Wreck,5,4 October 2002,"Hello Everyone,I had the privilege to see the sneak preview of the Transporter last month, and, well.....lets just say that the first 3/4 of the movie is fantastic! The last quarter of the film is an abysmal wreck. Here where the movie critic (I suck at being a critic, so keep that in mind) in me comes out: -warning SPOILERS ahead- The film is based upon a great premise as you all know (who wouldn't want to get paid large sums of cash for 'Transporting' stuff around in a kick-ass stat-of-the-art BMW), but there are a few places where your suspension of disbelief needs to be tightened up a few notches. The first car chase scene is fantastic with Jason Satham playing the cool, ultra-professional transporter Frank Martin, making his BMW jink around corners and fly around twisties the way anybody worth their salt does in GTA3.The trouble comes when he is trapped on an overpass and surrounded by police cars. How does he get out of this? Make the car jump into the air from a stand still of course! I've done this in my car on many occasions, rev the engine, lock the independent front brakes, burn the rear tires, and let er' rip! OK, I know its a movie, I'll let that pass, maybe he had a running start of a few feet and a conveniently placed ramp, I'll give that one to them.I won't go into the heat seeking, shoulder launched, chase-people-around missile scene, but I must bring up the scene where the hero is in a Cessna 182 at about 100 feet off the ground with a conveniently cooperative pilot. This scene has our hero chasing two cargo trucks that are carrying loads of illegal immigrants who will be sold into slavery (the reason he gets involved), now note that I said TWO trucks! Flying over the highway at about a hundred feet, he spots the trucks, tells the pilot to climb and straps on a parachute. Three seconds later, at about 8,000 feet.....woah!!! Hold on there, did I just say 8,000 feet? How can a small aircraft outperform a military fighter at full afterburner? Perhaps they implied that it was a few minutes later, maybe I just missed it...maybe.Ok, he jumps from the airplane, streamlines himself and dives down to the highway. After opening his chute well behind the convoy (which is doing highway speeds), he actually catches up with the trucks! One minute he's behind them, the next you see him catching up with the trucks and landing lightly upon the rearward one. Alright, if anyone out there knows how a parachute nearing the ground can do 90km/hr (this was no HALO jump either) let me know, I just don't know anything about skydiving.The last, most disturbing thing about this movie was that second truck. If anyone out there has seen this movie, please correct me if I'm wrong! The whole emphasis of the movie was the rescue of these two trucks full of people, but in the end scene, only one truck is stopped. Nobody seems to give a hoot about the second truck?!?! Did I miss some dialogue? Perhaps they said ""cargo container"" not ""cargo container(s)"" when they mentioned the people, I'm just not sure, but every time I heard them I swore they were talking about both containers (on trucks at the end). Will someone who is going to see this movie PLEASE listen for that, I would love to be proven wrong.Overall, if you like action flicks I would go see this one at a matinee and leave after the oil-fight scene (you'll know). The characters are great, especially Frank, Inspector Tarconi, and the villain 'Wall Street', the fight scenes are really done well, and lest we not forget...the driving.I rate it about 5 out of 10 and pray they rework the ending before it releases.",The Transporter

I saw it opening weekend, and I admit that I was skeptical after seeing the trailer, and reading the critic reviews.  But I went anyway on October 12th, and to my surprise, the theater was full! The movie was great.  Lots of action, great acting for a action movie, and Jason Statham is quite sexy.  It's way better then xXx, and it might possibly be the Best action movie of the 21st century!

369,frouge,Don't hurt yourself by seeing this!!!,1,15 October 2002,"What was Statham thinking??  I was excited to see this film, as I liked him in ""Snatch"", and ""Two Smoking Barrels"".  However, this was full of such implausibility's the action was overshadowed by the idiotic scenarios. Take a cookie cutter plot (rescue girl, fall in love, help her save lives) was very poorly implemented.There were good things in the movie.  The fight scenes were very good and original.  If you can ignore the fact that one car follows him and he gets attacked by at least 10 people, you will love this movie.  If you can also ignore the fact that the police chief hints at Martin's (Statham) illegal activities, but does not develop it, but will put his life and job on the line to assist him for no substantial reason.  If you can ignore the fact that in the opening minutes, Martin is stopped right next to some police officers who see him in his car and then he goes through a very elaborate car chase scene, but still no one can identify him.  If you can ignore the fact that he breaks his rules of opening the package for no good reason, but rescues the girl, and she is a subservient non-entity, who uses sex (""What we did last night was real"") for her own reasons.    If you can ignore all those things, then go see this movie fast, or wait until it goes to video (where it should have started).",The Transporter

After all Luc Besson whose credits include Leon and The Fifth Element was credited for this film.The films opening left me slack jawed with amazement. Not at the audacity of the driving and action but at the crass stupidity of all the players. Stathams bald hard man in a suit came across as one of the most incompetent idiots of all time. After all, who stands still after a robber questioning the number of people and yet allowing the police to come along? An idiot, that's who.The plot lopes along carefully ignoring the massive holes that you could drive a herd of mastadon through and still leave room for the entire Mardi Gras procession in Rio! You have a heroine that shoots her father and then smiles happily at releasing a bunch of refugees whose likely fate is to be put on a plane back where they came from. You have Statham jumping from a Cessna plane that goes from skimming the roof of the lorry he is going to jump on to 20,000 feet in a second and whose parachute descent takes about the same time.This is a godawful film and only amusing in places. The characters are wooden save for one, the laconic police inspector who saves the film entirely.Please Luc ... get your act together. Do NOT ever put you name to such crass tripe again!",The Transporter
371,turZii,Just what i expected,8,2 November 2008,"I was looking forward for some entertaining action flick, and The Transporter truly filled my expectations and even more. The plot is nothing superior, but it's easy to follow and does it's job very well leading from action scene to another. Acting is mostly good and Jason Statham pulls it off great, like he always does. As an action film, this one had it all; big-ass explosions, shoot-outs, crazy fighting scenes, car chases.. Most of the scenes are a bit over the top (well, i think that's the idea..), but if you liked the action in Stathams another 'kick-ass-movie' Crank, i'm sure you'll love this one too. All in all, very good entertainment which has some awesome stunts and doesn't require much brain-work. But that's the thing what makes this film so enjoyable. :) Action at it's best!",The Transporter

373,sonic999,Nicely done Jason Statham,7,5 February 2003,"This isn't a very good movie, but I still enjoyed Jason Statham's performance in it. He just stood there, and keeps it cool through out the whole movie. He plays the tough guy well, and I really hope to see this British hunk in more leading roles.His martial arts are actually VERY good. He performs nice fast snap kicks, and seems to be a pretty high jumper. The problem? Well the biggest problem with the martial arts in this movie is that you can pretty much see each opponent waiting for the kick or punch from Statham - which makes the martial arts in this look weak.The best fight scenes in this are:-The whole Bus sequence-The whole oil wrestling scene-Statham knocking down the door, and taking on the guys with axes.
I really dont want to comment on the rest of the movie, cause this movie is seriously all about Jason Statham, and I say ""Nicely Done!""",The Transporter

But hey, I need more depth for some explanation of a story line too! It just seems like people who weren't doing anything for a couple of months said, ""We got some time off, let's make a movie quickie! YEAH!"" This movie had great potential, but didn't get to use it. A shame, really.",The Transporter
375,Mr_Bronze,What a great surprise!,8,22 January 2003,"I only saw this film because my local Warner Village had both 8 Mile and Gangs of New York sold out. I wasn't looking forward to it at all after seeing the trailer - the footage of Statham deflecting a missile with a tray looked especially awful.Thankfully to my surprise, the film was amazing!  It had both me and those that also reluctantly saw it with me in a complete state of shock. Statham was excellent (unlike his performance in The One) and the chemistry between him and Shu Qi's character (I always knew her as Hsu Chi) was both amusing and heart warming when appropriate.The action scenes were fantastic, Statham carried them very well and the editing was not too noticeable.  I would even go as far as saying that the scenes were better than previous films that Corey Yuen has worked on with Jet Li.  Although it goes without saying, that when Li is used correctly he is phenomenal...I highly recommend this film - great fun!",The Transporter
376,johndwright,Perfect base with nothing built on it,4,29 April 2003,"The car chase scenes were great. The story shaped up so well and then after the transporter got to the container yard it went shallow with some of the ridiculous fight scenes. It would have worked if there had been more character exploration. You never really knew anyone's story, the deepest we got was that the transporter was X-military. If it had just been terrible all the way through that would have been one thing, but it built you up and took you nowhere.",The Transporter

378,newyuenfan,Stylistically French with an Asian twist,10,23 April 2003,"Just rented it and I am blown away. For some idiotic reason I didn't see it at the theater. But man, is the preview ever a bit different than what I expected. No fooling, this is a good flick with alot of deep substance underlying the characters. I can tell the guys making this were REALLY into it cause you can just tell they had a ""Blast"" making it. The characters are likeable and genuine and the frenetic pacing and rhythm of the whole thing give me a real thrill. It's so quick and so slick that I can see how there are rapid Asian elements blending with French super cool style now. The director Corey Yuen and filmmaker rebel Luc Besson are a lethal combination, oh yea. I mean these guys mean business, this movie is no joke. It just wouldn't let up. Everything is constantly moving forward, the story lean and mean, very very strong story telling technique. Also, the score was dazzling the way it complimented the energy of the film. And yes, Jason Stratham is on a whole nother level of cool. I seen his cool in Guy Richie's gangster movie ""Snatch"",when he played Turkish and have been on the look out for this cat ever since. That too was a genre breaking film. It incorporated black humor in the style of Pulp Fiction but in a way all its own. Oh yea one last thing. I seen The Transporter again at my friends house on DVD because I told him to rent it and he too was blown away. I don't know how to explain it really. I guess the closest way would be to say The Transporter transported the action genre into a whole new arena of filmmaking in that they make no apologies for cutting right to the chase. Puns intended. O it's in your face story telling alright. John Woo, Robert Rodiguez, Quentin Tarantino and Guy Richie probably spilling popcorn all over the darn place in laughter as they watched ""this thing"" go nuts on their big screen T.V.
P.S. If you blink, um...you may want to rewind the movie, you probably just missed about oh say, fifty-thousand cuts. That's round numbers of course.
P.S. II Something that may help prevent you from missing anything could be to use a clamping device such as that used in ""A Clock Work Orange."" That would keep your eyes wide open for the duration of the movie.P.S. III  ~A New Beginning~      Why is it that when Luc Besson has a vision, T.V. sets are on the verge of exploding? Just a thought.P.S. IV  Cautionary Note   Be careful when you remove The Transporter DVD from your DVD player after the movie has played. It was spinning so fast and caused so much friction that I actually burned the palm of my hand when I went to pick it up. I now have a second degree disc burn on my hand that reads The Transporter with a guy balancing two Berretta hand guns in mid air performing a drop kick.",The Transporter

381,Spectre80,Lots of Fun - Well worth a look!,8,30 May 2003,"Some small SPOILERSThe Transporter is a great action film, with great fight scenes and an okay story. While not a particullary fast film in pace, The Transporter presents a slightly more realistic view of martial arts and unarmed combat. That is where realism stops, but in no way does the movie loose any of its fun or coolness. And cool is what Jason Statham is, plain and simple. He easily fills the role of Frank Martin - The Transporter, who can at one moment be talking to a bunch of lower-level criminals, then dealing with upper crust clients, then kicking the butt of some unfortunate henchman. Statham manages to seamlessly slid between these drastically different facets of his characters being, while remaining extremely calm, collected, and..... well....cool!While the story is not the greatest out there, and the characters besides Martin rather dull, it is a good story, rather solid and not overly cheesy or overblown. You get the sense the Martin is one man taking on a group with its own little agendas, working for small but important goals. He's not saving NYC from a nuke or taking down a terrorist organization, he's just dealing with a group of thugs, who are small in their goals but in no way disappointing. It is a far more believable film than most action movies, which I appreciate. This story could conceivably take place. Besides a couple plot holes, the story is a good one, not Oscar caliber, but still good.The action is fast, not from a physical standpoint, but an editing one. While a fight scene is taking place the camera cuts in and out almost too quickly to see all the action, but it does it in just the right way to provide a scene that is charged and gritty. Statham's martial arts skills are great, showing off his training in kickboxing and other martial arts. As an avid karate practitioner, I can say that 99% of his stuff is practical and very little of it is unrealistic. The most impressive fight is the one in which Martin covers himself in oil, preventing the bad guys from grabbing him (which they always do for some strange reason, with painful results). The fight scenes are incredible and highly entertaining.The one bad thing about this movie is the sound. The slow, light music takes away from the adrenaline and rush of the chases and fights. And the dialouge is often over shadowed by the music. While annoying, they are small grievances.The Transporter is a solid movie, not great but good. It has a great star, a strong right-and-wrong story, and action that will appeal to any action fan. Not a great piece of cinema, but a strong B-movie that will not disappoint. I highly recommend it!8/10",The Transporter
382,chrisnewman-3,Pile of pants,1,24 June 2003,"I rented this movie on DVD mainly because it was high in the charts (Not a good rule of thumb I know) and because Jason Statham was in it as the lead. I thought he was great in Snatch and thought it would be good to see him in a ""Different"" lead role.After the first 10 minutes I rapidly came to the conclusion this movie was going nowhere and it immediately sprang to mind how totally unbelievable it was. What with his house being riddled with bullets and him finding 2 breathing apparatus under his house etc.I know films are fictional and love most kinds of action films which are hardly true to life but this one really stretched it!I hope Jason does another ""good"" film soon to quickly erase everyones mind of him being in this one.",The Transporter

The hero Frank is a super fighter who makes other action figures from movies like ""Die Hard"", ""James Bond"", ""Mission Impossible"", and ""Terminator"" look like schoolboys, and he would probably win a fight against all of them with his hands tied to his back.

According to previous experience this movie could not be any good.O contrare as I found out at home. It is a full grown action movie with great effects and a lot of overdone action. The story is some how weak because of the predictability, but that is very well compensated by the main character and his accent.A great movie to watch for everybody who can accept matrix like moves and like to listen to an English accent of Jason Statham.",The Transporter

Okay, let's see...I chose this one, hoping for some nice speeding and fighting action, maybe spiced up with a cool hero and a cute heroine in a thrilling story. I really did not expect more, I just wanted to relax and feed the stupid male in me. To be fair - I got some good car chase action in the first ten or so minutes of the movie and one good fighting scene in 70,000. The rest: a ""protagonist"" that adds nothing to the ""story"" except that someone is needed to have his car and house blown uptherefore there is nothing like a storyline - if you don't want to call a series of unmotivated, incomprehensible and more or less coincidental actions storyline so, these are true for some (though not too much) action-movies. But usually, there is still the action part to enjoy. Bad news: Here even this is totally boring. Ever the same three elements stretched over minutes and minutes that seem to become hours and days.and even if you are willing to give a movie credits for nothing but fine fighting (as I am) - nope. See above. High Kicks, high kicks, high kicks, grabblegrabble, high kicks, high kicks and - last but not least - some high kicks.I don't want to hold the absolutely pathetic dialogues against the... well... let's call it ""screenplay"" as I saw the thing in the German synchronized version.

Transporter delivers on all fronts and actually exceeds expectations on the last one with a bit more story than you might expect though there are certainly gaps and it certainly is not the main focus, the main focus is watching Statham kick people. Most of the film is him beating up a bunch of disposable assassins as he travels with Lai (Shu Qi) a former 'package' who he broke his cardinal rule for and ended up helping and in that sense it does not disappoint. Nothing deep but that's not why you go to see this kind of film, you go to see the action and eat popcorn and for that it is definitely recommended.

Seriously, I am sure she is a nice girl but that screaming coupled with her body (or there lack of) honestly grated on my nerves. I would have given it a ten for yummy Jason, but gawd that screaming. I do have to admit that while her acting is a little rough around the edges, she can do a lot of things on cue ie: When she shot her father, she cried and her voice shook and it was believable.

393,sakij,"Leon on hot, smoking wheels",10,28 October 2005,"Somebody's comment included ""action-by-numbers"" well that must mean it has been accurately made to the correct formula. This movie takes all the clichés and standard elements of modern action movies and adds a twist of just possible reality. With the expected plot turns and the main character's charming bit-of-rough standard action hero script, it could easily be merely one of hundreds but the skill with which the recipe is followed produces an outstanding piece which succeeds without too many flashing lights and impossible supernatural feats.Yes it is unlikely that such a man exists but it is well within the realms of possibility and he is never meant to be perfect, just plausible. It has Luc Besson stamped all over it but is different enough from his more renowned work to enjoy and the user ratings show that female voters in all but one age group rated it, on average, more highly than did their male counterparts; so it seemingly caters to an audience different than most would assume and that is probably due to Jason Statham's style.On an entirely personal level: I think Statham's acting is superior to that of many over-hyped, over-paid Hollywood stars, he has the journeyman's trait of doing a good job without overstating his own importance and is often under-rated. It is good to see him in a leading role. Of course I have no idea if he really is a nice bloke, let's just hope so.",The Transporter

Its not the sad subservient eye candy female ""characters"" (not even cartoons, line drawings would be more accurate), I can do that, I'm a man for Pete's sake. Its not the lack of any real plot, a series of nice action scenes strung together with a wisp of motivation will do me, I like Tarantino.The unforgivable sin for me is to have an action movie with no action. Nice cars? Check. Driving them fact? Check. Guns? Check. Daft fighting? Check. But these aren't action. They are fast cars, guns and fighting.The Transporter is like an animated version of a mid-range men's fashion magazine. Glossy but not quite cool shots. Almost clever but not quite bylines.

The action scenes were very well done and the filming was exceptional. Having watched many old Jackie Chan movies I enjoyed this smart and entertaining feature.
