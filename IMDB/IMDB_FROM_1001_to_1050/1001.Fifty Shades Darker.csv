0,TheLittleSongbird,More like 'Fifty Shades Greyer',2,17 July 2017,"Hopefully, as a heterosexual female student in her twenties with a love of film that spreads across all genres and decades, this will come over as a fair assessment of a film that genuinely did nothing for me.Like as was said in my review for 'Fifty Shades of Grey', have not read the books, though have heard conflicting opinions that has mostly been intense dislike. The reason for watching 'Fifty Shades Darker' was not due to wanting to hate on it, being a negative person, curiosity but for the reason of being at a film night with friends (who liked the books) recently and 'Fifty Shades Darker', like with 'Fifty Shades of Grey', happened to be the film choice. Just for the record, the general consensus ranged from indifference to hating it with a passion.'Fifty Shades Darker' is a small improvement over its predecessor but not by much. The flaws are still the same but it's not as quite as near-irredeemably bad, and it at least tries to give some raunchy edge while not exactly succeeding.Once again, the beguiling soundtrack, that has a soothing nostalgia and appropriately amorous quality, is the best thing about it. It also looks good, nice use of scenery and very nicely shot. There is one acting bright spot, which is Marcia Gay Harden who does very well with her role.However, the same flaws are all here. Like 'Fifty Shades of Grey', Danny Elfman's score is one-note and repetitive, as well as too derivative of his recent work. He has composed some wonderful stuff ('Edward Scissorhands' is magical) but this is really not his best work. Despite the change of director, the directing style feels too mannered and there is a real sense that the director was ill-suited to material that is beneath him, after all he's done stuff like 'House of Cards' and 'Glengarry Glenn Ross'.The rest of the supporting cast fail to stand out, with Kim Basinger having little to do, next to nothing actually. More problematic once more are the two leads, and the chemistry is next to zero once more. Understated can be a lovely quality to acting, as long as it also becomes nuanced and with believability given to the dialogue. Dakota Johnson, especially in the first third, is too understated that it feels more like there is a lack of personality or emotion. Jamie Dornan looks uncomfortable throughout, delivers his cringe-worthy lines awkwardly and is just bland as dishwater with no charisma whatsoever. Chemistry is non-existent.Again, the dialogue does no favours, dialogue so bad that absolutely nobody (even the best actors and actresses) can do anything with it. It causes unintentional laughter throughout, is embarrassingly clunky and is pure smut. Then there is the story that is so thin structurally, heavy in repetition, so badly plodding and without style or atmosphere that the film feels twice as long. Even with attempts to give more raunchiness and kinkiness, as well as edge, none of it comes over naturally, feeling horribly contrived. The rest of it is done far too tamely and the BDSM portrayal is still deceitful. The characters are little more than ciphers.Overall, a small improvement but still pretty dreadful even when giving it a fair chance. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Fifty Shades Darker
1,SnoopyStyle,bland,4,21 August 2017,"Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) has left tycoon Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) who is still obsessed with her. They decide to reignite their affair. She works for a small publisher under demanding boss Jack Hyde. Christian is looking to buy the company. They are being stalked by Christian's former sub Leila. Anastasia is slowly allowed into his family.I had low expectations before watching this and I'm not eager for it. It's either a low bar to clear or a preconceived notion. There is a bit of both. Johnson is a perfectly appealing actress but she's not allowed to do much. Dornan continues to be a stiff actor. Despite the promise of the edgy sexual matter, their romance is as boring as heck. Leila could have been a compelling thriller villain but she ends up as a secondary plot. The family drama is hinted at but delivers very little. There's a ridiculously undramatic helicopter crash for very little result. I don't hate this but I just find it boring.",Fifty Shades Darker
2,Horst_In_Translation,So little (or too much?) in so much,4,20 October 2017,"""Fifty Shades Darker"" is a new American film from this year that runs for a massive 2 hours and 10 minutes in the uncensored version. It is the sequel of course to ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" and experienced filmmaker James Foley took over here as director and he will also return in making the final(?) third film. The writer is Niall Leonard and it is surprising to see him in charge of such a prestigious movie script, but then again maybe they did not get anybody better to adapt the work by E.L. James as many thought this project was doomed from the very beginning and the bad literary work cannot be turned into a quality film. But I haven't read the book, so who knows. Anyway, Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan return of course playing the central characters and so do some of the others like Oscar winner Marcia Gay Harden. But there are also new characters like Kim Basinger's. Yep, another Oscar winner! However, the story is a mess. Let me explain my title now. For huge parts of the film, nothing was happening at all and then they rush in gunpoint scenes, plane crashes, marriage proposals etc. as if there was no tomorrow. Focus and balanced story-telling are completely nonexistent.Overall, the film is not a failure, but equally forgettable as the first. As a heterosexual male, I cannot deny that Johnson is still pretty gorgeous, even if I had some doubts about it in the first half. But sadly, the film is never on par with her looks. It's the same like the first film with the two protagonists trying to establish a relationship that satisfies them both with his desire for domination and her desire for normalcy. And then there are moments when she wants to be dominated and moments when he is normal, so trouble and conflict are simply inevitable. But these scenes are not enough of a foundation to construct a good film on. And the character writing is also disappointing as the ways in which they depict former lovers as evil, potential lovers (the boss) as evil and friends and family as good. Even Mr. Grey has zero shades and the title is a lie. His actions are so predictable for example that he only accepts the men in Ana's life who don't pose a danger from the romantic perspective. Then again, of course she wants nobody other than Grey anyway. The film is a kitschy movie with the only difference to romantic garbage films that it depicts some extremes. But none of it is handled competently and the result is a very bland 130 minutes you don't want to check out. Clearly a thumbs-down from me. Not recommended.",Fifty Shades Darker
3,claudio_carvalho,Spicy Soap Opera Entwined with Erotic Scenes,4,13 April 2017,"Anastasia ""Ana"" Steele (Dakota Johnson) is working as assistant editor in a publishing house. When she goes to a photography exposition of a friend of her, she stumbles upon Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) that misses her. They dinner together and Christin proposes a new arrangement to Ana and they rekindle their love. But the old woman that seduced Christian a long time ago and a former submissive affair jeopardize their relationship.""Fifty Shades Darker"" is a spicy soap opera entwined with erotic scenes. There is a silly and shallow situation and then a soft sex scene along 1h 58 min running time.

4,nogodnomasters,No rules. No Punishment. No Secrets.,7,29 July 2017,"I was not a fan of the first film and admit this was an improvement in character development. Christian (Jamie Dornan) comes crawling back to Anna (Dakota Johnson), this time, ""no rules, no punishment, no secrets."" But don't fret, if the only reason you watched the first film is to see Dakota get handcuffed, slapped around and taken from behind, it still happens. We discover more about Christian in this film as Anna attempts to end his possessiveness and need to control her. Appearing in the film is Bella Heathcote who looks like Anna giving me flashbacks to SWF. Their physical appearance is part of Christian's psyche.The film still suffers as did the first one as neither Dakota Johnson nor Jamie Dornan can act. They were cardboard in their roles. Kim Basinger of ""9 1/2 Weeks"" is suitable for her role as Elena, yet in the film I was bored by her too. I don't know if the characters were this wooden in the book, but they needed to do something for the film.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity",Fifty Shades Darker
5,jboothmillard,Fifty Shades Darker,5,22 February 2017,"The first film, based on the awful racy novel by E.L. James, was released on Valentine's Day and became a massive success, despite it being rather naff, including Razzie wins, the adaptation of the trilogy of books continued with this sequel, from Razzie nominated director James Foley (Glengarry Glen Ross, House of Cards). Basically it has been some time since young corporate executive Christian Grey (The Fall's Razzie nominated Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia ""Ana"" Steele (Razzie nominated Dakota Johnson) broke up, Ana is now working as an assistant to Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson), an editor at Seattle Independent Publishing, who has more than a casual interest in Ana. Ana attends the evening of the art gallery show for her photographer friend Jose Rodriguez (Victor Rasuk), she is shocked Christian is there, she reluctantly agrees to have dinner with him. Christian tells Ana he wants her back, but she is reluctant because his sexual pleasure in inflicting pain and sticking to his contract, he insists he is changing, and will agree to Ana's terms of no rules and no punishments, if they will resume their relationship, she agrees. A few days later, Ana is interrupted by a woman who bears a striking resemblance to her, she later goes to dinner with Jack, Christian sees him flirting with Ana, he warns her of Jack's obvious intentions, and tells her that he plans to take over SIP where Ana works. While out with Christian for breakfast, Ana sees the same woman watching from a distance, Christian does not answer Ana immediately when she asks who she is, at home he reveals it is Leila Williams (Bella Heathcote), one of his former submissives. Christian explains that after Leila's contract ended, she wanted more to their relationship, but he did not, she found herself a husband, but he died, this caused her to have a mental breakdown and become suicidal, she has been stalking Christian and Ana for a while. Christian invites Ana to a masquerade ball with an auction, to prepare for the ball Christian takes Ana to beauty salon Esclava, there Ana sees Elena Lincoln (Razzie winning Kim Basinger), Christian's former dominant who introduced him to the BDSM lifestyle, Ana is furious Christian would take her there, and that he co-owns the salon with Elena. At the ball, Ana learns more about Christian, including being expelled from schools for fighting, and his biological mother being a prostitute and crack addict, Christian reveals his mother committed suicide, Grace Trevelyan Grey (Marcia Gay Harden) cared for him in hospital, and later adopted him. Elena confronts Ana, telling her to break up with Christian and warning her, Ana ignores her and tells her to stop meddling in their relationship, returning home Christian and Ana find her car vandalised. A few days later, when the SIP offices close, Jack tries to seduce Ana, she refuses and escapes, Christian finds out and arranges for Jack to be dismissed, he also asks Ana to move in with him, she agrees, the next day Ana takes the vacant position of temporary acting editor for SIP. Ana and Christian go to her apartment to collect her belongings, there Leila appears and threatens Ana with a gun, she fires a shot into the wall, but Leila is subdued by Christian and his bodyguard Jason Taylor (Max Martini). Ana sees that Christian can still only be satisfied with his controlling and domination, she walks out and does not return until the night, Christian is furious with her, Ana explains she needs time. Christian does not want to lose Ana, he drops to his knees and turns submissive, finally allowing her to touch him in his restricted areas, they kiss and have sex. during the night, after being awoken by Ana from a nightmare, Christian asks Ana to marry him, she says she needs time to think about it. Christian leaves for a few days on a business trip, while piloting his helicopter there is engine failure, causing it to crash somewhere in the forest, the news breaks out that Christian is missing, Ana and Christian's family wait for news, until he unexpectedly arrives, Ana is overwhelmed he is safe, realising the extent of her feelings for Christian, she accepts his marriage proposal. At Christian's birthday party, the engagement is announced to the guests, Elena is there and furious, calling Ana a gold digger, Ana angrily throws a drink in her face and tells her to stop interfering, Christian and ? Grace overhear, Christian tells Elena she only taught him sex, never love, Grace slaps Elena and tells her to get out, Christian cuts all ties with Elena. In the end, as the birthday festivities begin, Christian proposes to Ana at the boathouse, with a ring, she accepts, as fireworks erupt in the sky, Jack is the watching Ana and Christian from afar. Also starring Luke Grimes as Elliot Grey, Eloise Mumford as Kate Kavanagh and singer Rita Ora as Mia Grey. Johnson is only slightly less naive as the besotted and feisty young woman, and Dornan is still a pervy billionaire, only slightly less controlling, they are more believable as a couple this time, and Basinger and Eric Johnson are only relatively alright being the nasty ones. I am relieved to say that I found this film much more bearable than the previous, the change of director helps, the writing is slightly improved, there are more softcore sex scenes that are a little more comfortable than before, and the kinky and edgy bits are a little less embarrassing, it remains glossy and somewhat gigglesome in its approach, but overall it is a slightly better erotic romantic drama. It won the Razzie for Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel, and it was nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Screen Combo for Any Combination of Two Characters, Two Sex Toys or Two Sexual Positions and Worst Screenplay. Worth watching!",Fifty Shades Darker
6,sunwarrior13,The Reunion Between Anastasia And Christian Still Lacks Kinkiness,3,21 February 2017,"As moviegoers say,""Sex sells!!!"" Despite the poor screenplay and lack of chemistry between the leads,Fifty Shades Of Grey earned more than half a billion dollars world-wide.The producers knowing that this is a great money earner have placed their faith on the two sequels they plan to make such as Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed.Now it is 2017 and Fifty Shades Darker starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan as Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey respectively has been released in the theater together with Eric Johnson, Eloise Mumford, Bella Heathcote, Rita Ora, Luke Grimes, Victor Rasuk, Kim Basinger and Marcia Gay Harden.Director James Foley and screenwriter Niall Leonard provides another movie featuring the reunion of Anastasia,who just finished college degree and started working at Seattle Publishing House, and Christian Grey,who was taught by Anastasia with new values during their reunion. This led to both having sex as often as possible despite the fact that they don't go through BDSM to translate kinkiness on the big screen.Too bad that the sex scenes that they go through does not really produce anything interesting to the viewers.Just like the first film,the viewer would still notice that Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan still exhibit lack of chemistry with one another and they remain uncomfortable with their sex scenes they go through despite the fact that there is no BDSM involved.Added to that,the relationship between them would not look anything except like a one-night stand as both Dakota and Jamie lack good performance in their portrayal most especially when both are together having sex in bed. But in spite of the reasons mentioned in the previous paragraph,the movie have currently earned almost $300 million. Expect the film to earn more for as they say,""Sex sells"" all the time.Wanting to watch the lead characters in a lot of kinkiness would definitely lead many viewers into the theaters and buying the movie's DVD upon its release.That is in spite of the lack of realism and not-so-good story in involved in it.",Fifty Shades Darker

8,Theo Robertson,Masochism Offered To Us By Sadists,3,14 February 2017,"""Hey Theo , what's a young good looking boy like you doing sitting alone watching films on Valentines day ? You should be taking a beautiful woman out on a romantic date "" Well thanks for the concern but I really do think Christopher Hitchens summed up the long term sexual relationship perfectly by the soundbite ""Now this is masochism - but it's being offered to you by sadists"" . The Hitch was of course referring to religion but both religion and the long term sexual relationship have an identical definition . I'm also reminded of how Albert Einstein described idiocy:""Doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result"" . In the case of the 50 SHADES narrative we're subjected to idiotic masochism If you've seen the first film you'll be entirely puzzled as to the casting because I don't think I've seen an actor and actress so badly cast in a film where the whole concept of the story revolves around sexual attraction . Both Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson are two actors best suited for lead roles in a bland daytime soap opera . Let's remind ourselves Christian Grey is a multi billionaire oozing in Byronic sexuality while Ana Steele is , or rather was a naïve young woman embarking on an intensely mind blowing sexual relationship with Grey and the casting really does not work . In fact several sexually charged scenes are unintentionally funny and will cause howls of laughter as the two leads spout their lines before engaging in sex . Add to this as a possible love rival in the form of Jack Hyde as played by Eric Johnson and you've got a hat trick of actors with the sexual charisma of drowned haddock . Casting Kim Basinger in a small role makes things worse because you're reminded of her on screen chemistry with Mickey Rourke in 91/2 WEEKS which while not being a great film did have an erotic quality to it and despite some fairly explicit sex scenes for a mainstream Hollywood movie in 50 SHADES DARKER it's fairly devoid of erotica",Fifty Shades Darker
9,preppy-3,As good as the first one.,7,20 February 2017,"This is a sequel to ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". You have to see the first film which introduces the characters and situations to get the second film. The first film ended with Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) leaving Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan)because he had control issues and was heavily into S&M. This movie picks up months later. She's trying to move on but he still loves her and wants her. She decides to give him a second chance but has to deal with two of his exes--one wants her dead and the other (Kim Basinger) says she can never have him.I liked the first movie and I liked this too. The acting is better than the first. I always though Dornan was lousy in the first but he's better her. Johnson was great. Marcia Gay Harden is great in a supporting role. Even Basinger was good! As for sex and nudity--there are sex scenes and they're tasteful but explicit. And (naturally) Johnson shows more skin than Dornan. Also every single romantic cliché in existence is worked into the movie. I'm not complaining about that but it doesn't always work. My audience laughed at scenes that were supposed to be dramatic. It's also too long (2 hours). Still I enjoyed it. Recommended.",Fifty Shades Darker
10,neil-476,Unerotic soap opera,6,15 May 2018,"Hunky squillionaire Christian Grey likes to strap up girlfriends and spank them until their bums go red. Having relieved incredibly nice improbable virgin Anastasia of her virginity in a dead romantic and non-pervy fashion, she subsequently reacts badly to having her bum whacked, and terminates their relationship. And that's where this film begins.And, while it has the odd bit of fetish activity in it, it mostly amounts to a conventional romantic drama peppered with the problems which rich and mildly sexually perverted people tend to encounter, like exes turning up with guns, malicious Mrs Robinson-types seeking to stick a spoke into your current relationship, crashing your helicopter on Mount St Helens, and the like.Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson are likeable and have some chemistry together. That chemistry isn't particularly sexual: for a film drawn from a source which is notorious for the appeal of its sexual fetish content, this film is sparse and coy in that regard. It is also singularly unerotic notwithstanding the fact that both Dornan and Johnson look attractive without clothes. No, I'm not being entirely truthful - there is a short sequence in a lift which is more erotic than all the naughty bits in this film and its predecessor put together.I confess that, while I normally quite enjoy watching attractive young people engaging in sexual activity, the specifics of Christian Grey's proclivities are pretty much the antithesis of what turns me on. Having said that, I repeat that there is relatively little of that stuff here, and it's not valid grounds for criticising a film anyway.Better grounds for criticism are that, despite the best efforts of the actors, the characters are fundamentally unconvincing, as are the glitches in their relationship and, indeed, the other problems they face. The sole interesting issue from the first film - should two incompatible people seek to change each other fundamentally? - is here avoided because that is simply what happens, with no agonising, soulsearching, or explanation. What is left is glossy soap opera with mild perversion.The film is basically a shambles, and I offer no speculation as to whether this is the fault of the source novel, or the screenplay (written by the novelist's husband).I am sure that the white middle-class women who bought the books by the lorryload, and went to see episode one in droves, will be along to see this one, too. They may well be disappointed, because I couldn't detect much by way of forbidden frisson.And for anyone not in the target demographic, I can't honestly recommend this. In fact, I rather feel that I went to see this so that you don't have to. How very public-spirited of me. You can thank me by not going to see it unless you are dragged along by the missus.",Fifty Shades Darker
11,gradyharp,"'...generally, a key part of good communication is that both parties be conscious.'",5,9 March 2018,"As is often the case with sequels (or parts 2, 3 and on) the initial impact of Part One (a fairly substantial examination of the dominant/submissive relationship complete with toys and lots of nudity and intercourse) overshadows the subsequent stories. So it happens with FIFTY SHADES DARKER (or DULLER). New screenwriter this time round (Niall Leonard) adapting EL James infamous Chick Lit and a male director this time - James Foley. Not as strong a team as Round One. But then there are may little things that dim the lights on this outing - less sincere chemistry between the lead couple, too much meandering in wealthy parties, an unshaven Christian Grey (just to keep up with the styles) and the addition of some unsavory characters who attempt to add tension but without enough back story to make it work.The plot - Christian (Jamie Dornan) and Ana (Dakota Johnson) decide to rekindle their relationship, except this time there are no more rules or punishments. As they begin to get used to their newfound relationship, Christian's past (fifteen prior women, childhood abuse, a nasty sordid affair (Bella Heathcote) and the threat of a strange woman (Kim Basinger) begins to haunt Ana as Christian struggles with his innermost thoughts. There is competition for Ana from her new boss (Eric Johnson) that provides a cliffhanger at the end of this far too long film.
Gone is the novelty of the Red Room and sadism and life seems to be settling into ho-hum. Maybe things will pick up in the third installment...Grady Harp, March 18",Fifty Shades Darker
12,blanbrn,"A lot more skin, sex, nudity and very blunt and brash provocative love making!",6,16 February 2017,"Once again went to check out the Fifty Shades movie series and even though I didn't read the books I enjoyed the first one, and with this entry called ""Fifty Shades Darker"" it was even more of an erotic thrill! This picture had plenty of nude scenes of skin and very erotic love making it was brash and provocative of pushing the envelope. Still much of the same plot it involves Anastasia(Dakota Johnson)as a young office lady who reconnects with Christian(Jamie Dornan)and the passion and hot nights of bondage encounters return! Only this time each are having problems of the past with envy and Christian remembers his ex flame(played by Kim Basinger). Thru it all the hot passion leads to love and it's seems the two are at a commitment.

13,MLDinTN,the acting still....,5,20 October 2017,"needs improving. I don't get why they can't get better scripts and better acting for movies about such famous books. But still I think this sequel was a little better than the first film, which rarely happens. I just thought the story was a little better and not so silly. One part that I didn't like was how the helicopter crash was never explained, how did the copter not burst into flames. Can't stand plot holes like that. And the petty Elena character was written so silly, why would she care about Ana?FINAL VERDICT: OK, but still probably only for fans of the books.",Fifty Shades Darker
14,ericstevenson,Please make the score lower,2,4 May 2017,"I hadn't seen the original movie, but I didn't care at all because I knew this would be bad either way. So this movie features the main character Anastasia trying to get back with her boyfriend, Christian Grey. There's a bunch of other stuff that happens like how he becomes her boss and their family and exes get in their way. This movie was so boring I just found myself trying to think of anything else. I realize I'm extremely critical of movies that are flat out boring. I said that ""Caligula"" would be the only porn movie I ever saw in my life and I think I broke that rule.This film has four sex scenes in it. I don't know if there's some kind of rule that a film has to have a certain amount of nudity to be considered a porn film. This probably does qualify and it's as trashy as any other porn film. The movie shows no graphic depiction of genitalia. Could they even get away with that in an R-rated film? They know that rating a movie NC-17 is the absolute guarantee your film will fail. Should they have gone all the way? It's all rather pointless.I guess I'll make an exception for not reviewing porn if it happens to be very well distributed or is something you would see in a movie guide. The only time I actually noticed something going on was when a gunshot occurred. The original was based on a Twilight fanfic and I don't know if there was a sequel made that was film was based on. Okay, when the fic was adapted into a book, they probably make a book sequel. Can't we get stuff based on good fanfics? Look up ""Harry Potter And The Methods Of Rationality"" for something good.

16,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,30 April 2017,"Fifty Shades DarkerIt's a safe bet that being tied up in bed is the sexual fetish of every escape artist.However, the subservient in this erotic drama isn't exactly dislocating her shoulder.While she is working as an assistant book editor, Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) attends an art event where she runs into her wealthy ex-boyfriend/dominate Christian (Jamie Dornan), who wants her back.She quickly agrees to rekindle their kinky relationship but under one condition: no more punishment. Meanwhile, Christian's former submissive (Bella Heathcote) and his mature mentor (Kim Basinger) both reappear in his life to wreak havoc on his current affair.While it is twice as titillating as the initial soft-core film adaptation of E.

17,851222,Shallow but good looking and watchable guilty pleasure,7,4 June 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.The most funny thing about ""Fifty Shades Darker"" (2017) is that it is a very watchable, good looking movie while in at the same time it is very shallow, woodenly acted and kinda poorly written movie. The only good acting in this highly manipulative story was by Dakota Johnson - she carried the movie. And while this is kinda of a romantic movie, there was zero chemistry between the two lead, although like i said i liked acting by Dakota Johnson - the lead guy was no match for her. And the whole sex scenes were just boring - the most boring this in the movie.That said, strangely enough i did enjoy ""Fifty Shades Darker"" while i was watching it. You kinda have to turn your brain off while watching this movie and it does work as a guilty pleasure on a boring evening. All in all this is definitely not bad movie to see it once but after you will forget it pretty soon.",Fifty Shades Darker
18,Reno-Rangan,The next fifty shades between an ordinary woman and a billionaire.,6,14 July 2017,"The film was not received well as the book was. Just like the first film, it has been another below average. Might be because of its theme. Usually this kind of films do great business, but ratings and reviews does not praise or encourage the film. So I doubt anybody will be bored of it, which means watchable film and instead it won't be their favourite.The story continued and this time it was not based on experiment or any kind of agreement, but mutual understanding. So the billionaire Grey and Ana's erotic adventure sustains. With the small-small developments the film goes all the way to the ending. That means, those who are watching it for the selected scenes, will surely would have a nice time. But nothing was strong as any European film on the similar theme.Apart from the weak storyline, there's nothing wrong with it. As to what this film is about, it served better. That's what I say to you not to expect full storied romance-drama. As usual the actors were good and another two films to come in the 'Fifty Shades' franchise. I hope they can be better than the first two. Overall, it is only for the selected audience, but curiosity makes everybody watch it and they all pour they perspective which is flooded with average to negative. Otherwise, it is an acceptable film.6/10",Fifty Shades Darker
19,cruise01,"Terrible dialogue, acting, direction, and a barely noticeable plot.",4,8 June 2017,"Fifty Shades Darker is the second film in its exotic romantic drama series that is worse than the last movie. Even with the change in writer/director with Niall Leonard and James Foley handling the second installment. The film has a terrible script; direction, and Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan stale performances tend to continue. The plot was eh, if there was one. I will say the soundtrack with the varieties of artists is probably the only positive thing about the movie. The plot continues with Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) trying to get Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) to go back with him. (After things did not end well in the previous movie). Ana now working at a new job with a boss Jack (Eric Johnson) that is trying to flirt with her. Ana decides to give Grey another chance. Soon, Grey's past comes back to haunt after him with Leila (Bella Heathcote) stalking Ana and Christian. If you are into the cliché romantic drama movies, than sure this may be for you. Or if you are looking for some steamy erotic sex scenes with Grey's BDSM lifestyle, then this may also be for you. It is difficult to find this film to be any good with its poor plot. Ana is trying to become an independent woman. Trying to have that backbone. When Grey is trying to get her to go back with him, she tells him they need to take it slow. A follow up scene, than shows her caving in for his needs. Which makes this whole movie with Ana trying to have control but a scene later, she and Grey are in bed together. There was no real conflict with this complicated relationship they are having. It tries to have this build up of Grey willing to try to work on himself and his habits for her. But there was no progression on him working it out. Grey is a man that is psychologically damaged after a past with an incident with his mother. The BDSM is his way of escaping his pain, which Elena (Kim Basinger) has showed him in his earlier years. But the plot has no real conflict when it focuses with Ana and Grey going back and forth with trying to take it slow and than rushing into some kinky sex. The script was horrible with some laughable cheesy dialogue. Like ""Kinky F***ery."" Some made up one-liners that is so bad but laughable. The direction was dull, those steamy sex scenes were made to get a rise out of a certain audience but it was nothing really special about it. The acting was bad with Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan. Literally feels like they are bored with their characters. Johnson is a beautiful decent actress but her performance that is so monotone and yet very passive in the movie is irritating and unattractive. The positive aspect of the film, which did not help the movie. It did have a great soundtrack that worked on certain scenes like the ""I don't wanna live forever"" by Zayn and Taylor Swift. And ""Not afraid anymore"" by Halsey. Overall, Fifty Shades Darker is a bad exotic film that is meant to be locked up in a dark room and forgotten. But for the fans of the novels, they may get a kink out of the movie and possibly excited for a third hopefully final movie. I do not recommend the film if your not a fan of the novels.",Fifty Shades Darker
20,filipemanuelneto,Worse is difficult...,1,20 February 2020,"This film is the more-than-announced continuation of the Fifty Shades trilogy, and I think it's the worst of the three. Despite the great success of the box office, in my view largely based on the previous success of the books by E. L. James, the film was precisely booed by both the critics and the public who paid to see it. As I did in the review of the first film, I emphasize here that I neither read nor intend to read the original books, so I will only speak about the film, although I know that many problems related to the story told already come from the original material.After breaking up with Gray, Anastasia decides to resume with him, but under conditions. Her personality changed a lot from one film to the next. She is no longer that shy girl who is unable to break a plate that we saw in the first film. She discovered her own femininity, is more confident and dominates the situation with confidence, almost to the point of reversing sexual roles with Gray. This, in turn, seems lost and not quite sure where to step, in search of firm ground. This was what surprised me most in the story told by the film. The rest (the intrigues and jealousy involving Anastasia's boss and Gray's ex-lover, or even Leila's enigmatic appearance) does not have half the interest that this change in their personality had for me. And the film also has terrible dialogues and one of the most lurid lapses of continuity I have ever seen in cinema: the complicated lingerie that Anastasia takes to the Gray's charity party and that, already on the spot, in yet another sex scene, has mysteriously disappeared of her body, leaving only a simple lacy underwear. I almost burst out laughing. Is there anything good here? Yes, but little. The performance of the two central actors in the plot is noticeably less boring than in the first film, but, as seen earlier, the impersonality and the lack of passion and chemistry between them dominates; Marcia Gay Harden did a good performance as Christian's mother and Kim Basinger was also good at the little he had to doIt goes without saying that this film is totally inappropriate for children and teenagers, given the heavy erotic material and the language used. The film had a good budget and, therefore, good production values, starting with good photography, good scene props, satisfactory editing work and a good soundtrack, composed by Danny Elfman.",Fifty Shades Darker
21,TheMovieDiorama,Fifty Shades Darker is the equivalent of having sex with someone you don't want to be with.,3,25 February 2018,"By that, I mean you want the lights off so you can't see their face. So turn your lights off, and while you're up just turn the TV off as well because there is no point watching this. Granted, this is ever so slightly better than it's predecessor. But that's like saying cat litter tastes nicer than dog poo, they're both excrements. I mean where to begin with the story? Christian Grey yearns for Anastasia and becomes a creepy stalker. Will they? Won't they? Again, I don't care. Oh, and random people from his past keep popping up like an unwanted STD. Speaking of, we were graced with Mr Grey ripping off a condom in the first film, just to encourage safe sex. In this? None of that. Spreading disease at a rate of Oprah Winfrey audience members getting presents. ""You get a disease! You get a disease! Everybody gets a disease!!"". We have our usual accompaniment of pop songs to the raunchy sex scenes. Bending over a pool table, bed or even the floor...that's about as raunchy as it gets. I actually miss the whips...what have I become!? The sex now just seems forced as it's no longer a plot device, but isn't that the point of this franchise? The acting and chemistry between our two leads is much better and far more watchable, with less cringeworthy lines of dialogue. It's still damn atrocious, just more tolerable. The pace is horrendously sluggish! Two hours! Felt like four. So many unexplored sub-plots that amount to nothing. Rita Ora though...perfection. She genuinely seems excited to be there. No one else does, just give them their wages and be done with this series. Will I be watching this again? Nope. This is just the kind of thing I put myself through for friendship.

That might not be saying much as it does take a while for the movie to pump up and having to watch it until that while came was surprisingly dull for a movie about sex.Like the first movie, most of the film is about the sick sexual relationship between Christian and the stupidly name Anesthesia Steele, but as the movie progress new elements start to pop up in the film that give it this night time soap opera feel which I'm a little embarrassed to say was pleasurable to watch.I mean it's just as dumb as the first movie that acts like a stupid music video for all the sex scenes in the movie that did not really turn me own as much as made me laugh, but did like a lot of the melodrama going on.http://cinemagardens.com",Fifty Shades Darker
25,jtindahouse,Gets an unfair deal,7,27 February 2017,"I think the 'Fifity Shades' movies were always going to have a tough task in front of them to please people. The reason? Because it is so hard for them to balance everything. Audiences want intense sex scenes - but not pornography, they want a genuine love story to be created - but they want it done quickly so there is plenty of time left over for the kinky stuff, they want boundaries to be pushed - but again not porn and nothing that is going to make them uncomfortable. That's all fine, but then consider that almost every audience is going to want different degrees of each of these aspects, and you're pretty much doomed before you even put pen to pad.With books, generally only the people that are interested in them end up reading them. However this is not the same for movies. Because very few people are comfortable going to movies on their own, they end up dragging along people with them who are less enthused about the film, and thus a lot of the negativity is created. I don't think it's deserved. People need to go into these movies with what they are trying to be in mind. Do that and you're not going to have a bad time. Sadly though, very few people do that - especially around Oscar time when these films tend to be released.'Fifty Shades Darker' is a harmless film. It's a love story with a difference. It's a film that is supposed to make you think a different way about relationships and how we all act towards each other. I can assure you there are far less convincing love stories being made into movies out there. Don't be influenced by the bad publicity out there surrounding these films.

It's the plot of the movie...and it takes about 5 minutes total. The problem is solved really quickly, in the middle of the film, and never comes up again.It's like an after thought....but it's the plot.I've seen movies based on T and A in the past that have actually more plot focus than this.But let's be honest, you are only watching it for the BDSM (which it is also light on) so I can't even give it 10 stars for that, and I am an easy grader when it comes to most movie reviews.",Fifty Shades Darker
27,stevendbeard,Better Than The First,6,10 February 2017,"I saw ""Fifty Shades Darker"", starring Dakota Johnson-Need For Speed, Crazy in Alabama; Jamie Dornan-The Fall_tv, Once Upon a Time_tv; Kim Basinger-The Nice Guys, Cellular; Marcia Gay Harden-Code Black_tv, Bad News Bears_2005 and Eric Johnson-Rookie Blue_tv, Smallville_tv.This is a sequel to the 2015 erotic hit about love. This one starts pretty much after the last one ended. Dakota is now working at a job publishing books, instead of selling them. Jamie shows up professing his love for her and telling her that he will do anything to get her back, even if it is on her terms. You know, maybe a little less S&M in the red room. She tells him they will try and take things slow & easy. Yeah, right. It's not long before they are going at each other as if they were in a soft porn movie. Eric plays Dakota's boss at her new job and I have never read the books but I have a feeling that Eric will play a bigger part in Chapter 3, due out in theaters around Valentines' Day 2018. There are some females that show up from Jamie's past; one is an ex submissive that has gone a little psycho and the other is the 'Mrs Robinson' that taught Jamie a thing or two in the bedroom-Mrs Robinson is played by Kim. Marcia plays Jamie's stepmother. Oh yeah, there is a helicopter crash which causes matters to escalate. If you liked the first one then you should like this one, too.

31,jadepietro,Hard to Say I Love You,2,21 February 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆ out of 5) GRADE: C- THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED IN BRIEF: A trashy and laughable sex yawn.JIM'S REVIEW: Oh, that privileged 1% ! Those filthy rich beautiful people in their penthouse apartments and spacious mansions, sipping Moët & Chandon and wearing the finest silks and designer leathers. GRRR! But are they happy? Really happy? Let's strip away their false facades...did you say STRIP? Yes, it's time once again for another chapter of the rich and famously good-looking Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and his love slave, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), in part two of their pseudo sadomasochistic romance saga...this one entitled Fifty Shades Darker.￼This film steps into the dark side of love once again, or at least that's its soft porn message. Lots of groping, some nudity, very little real passion or sexual tension. In this chapter, He wants back with She, after their previous break-up. He woos and plies her with lavish presents. She accepts his advances with a minimum of resistance as He works his way back into her loins. Sure they have lots of baggage, but their supposedly hot sex is insatiable. The Red Room calls. Bring out the whips, straps, and sexual paraphernalia that can still shock middle America's Puritan values. It's showtime!￼Director James Foley and Niall Leonard (a.k.a. E. L. James' husband) are the responsible parties for this misdemeanor. Let's call Mr. Foley's involvement bad judgment on his part. His direction here is adequate at best. As for our screenwriter, it's nice that the James's try to keep it in the family, but unleashing this trash to the general public should be a criminal act. Fifty Shades Darker wants to be soft core sex fantasy, melodramatic soap opera, and, in this second chapter, a mystery thriller. The wafer-thin plot (although there is one this time) involves spurned former lovers, unhinged stalkers, and lecherous bosses with questionable intentions. But all the movie becomes is a hilarious comedy of errors (mostly due to the cast and filmmakers). It's a real mess, destined for most critic's worst film list of 2017...including mine. ￼The dialog is unintentionally funny, the characters cardboard silly, and the plot absurd.For example, here are some of the verbal exchanges:""I don't know whether to worship at your feet or spank you."" ""Okay, fine. I will have dinner with you because I am hungry."" ""You're not sticking those up my butt.""Shakespeare needn't worry.The most well defined part of this drool is Mr. Dornan's abs which get quite a workout. His character lacks any dimension unless erect (and that is never shown and only intimated, of course). As for Ms. Johnson, her ample cleavage and perky breasts share equal screen time and should have star billing status as well. The actress establishes her character as a series of girlish pouts, wide-eyed ogling, and sensual lip-biting. Both performers are more silly than sexy. These physical fit actors have done better work in other films, but they did choose fame and an almighty fat check for their involvement in this series, so the blame is partially theirs as well as the filmmakers. However, I will credit them with some some acting restraint in delivering the banal dialog with the straightest of poker faces. That must have been the only thing hard on the set. ￼ Bad acting is also prevalent in the supporting cast of characters. Two Oscar winning actresses, Marcia Gay Harden and Kim Basinger should have known better. Up and coming actors like Eric Johnson, Bella Heathcote, Rita Ora, and Luke Grimes bring some class to their classless roles. All go the soap opera route, lots of hysteria and excess.In fact, there are so many ripe displays of excesses, definitely the fault of a woeful script: many stagy sex romps that register 1 on the hot meter, especially that classic steamy shower scene, an elevator tryst that is more laughable than sensual, and a rather silly set piece involving a Venetian styled masquerade ball that is reminiscent of Kubrick's only dud, Eyes Wide Shut, (which is the best advice one can give to viewing this movie, although it is the filmmakers who should really hide.) ￼ Fifty Shades Darker is dim indeed. Still planning to take your significant other to this awful movie? Perhaps then I might suggest a ""safe word"" for all film lovers: AVOID!",Fifty Shades Darker
32,rgkarim,Hello Again Mr. Grey!,6,9 February 2017,"Robbie K here, and I'm back to bring you yet another movie review on the latest movie theater ""hits."" No doubt that many are ready for the mass advertised Fifty Shades Darker, the sequel to the literary work that ""graced"" the world so long ago. Despite how badly the first installment did, Hollywood is taking another shot at the series. Is this thing up to the test? Or is it just a plain, dirty dream filling, mess. As always, I'm going to do my best to put bias aside (unlike some reviews) and give you some insight into this flick. Let's go LIKES  Still Tastefulmostly  Story a little better  Surprisingly funny at time  Soundtrack Still KickingSummary: While I'm not the biggest fan of the Fifty Shades series, this reviewer has to recognize the pressure placed on the directors for this series. For me, I think they did a nice job keeping the movie tasteful while indulging in some of thesexier qualities of the film. Although supposedly darker, the movie keeps most of the steamy scenes in decent detail without crossing into porn threshold, except the last scenenothing tasteful about that. But when the actors aren't trying to sell the sex, the story that tries to give it purpose starts to emerge. While certainly not the strongest story, Fifty Shades Darker is a little more dynamic, bringing some mystery, some drama, and some love to the table. Those who wanted a little more details to the cast will get their wish, somewhat, and wetting your appetite for the next film. Amidst all the dramatic moments though are some well-timed comedic moments, often pointing out the ridiculous concepts housed in this series. Yet the best thing, for me at least, was the soundtrack. Once more the music editors have selected/crafted tracks that fit well into the scenes, including a number of songs that will capture the heat of the scene. Was it as good as the first installment? I don't think so, but it still does its job. DISLIKES:  Story is still lacking  No butts about it  Extra Characters Lacking  Character Development Simplistic  Acting still needs improvementSummary: Okay, I'm not ignorant enough to not recognize that a lot of people are going for the ""passionate"" moments. But a reviewer looks at the other qualities, including the story. Despite being better and having more components to it, Darker's story is still lacking. Many of the plots promised in the trailer are simplistic at best, often dropping them for another sex scene or sequence of the couple arguing. The mysterious girl, the blonde dominatrix, and many other tales involving other characters are diluted attempts to add suspense, adding a little suspense and foreshadowing for the next installment before the potential is dropped. In fact, the only thing really developed to me was the origins of the strange obsession with domination and sadism. As mentioned earlier, the character development is stronger in this film, but it too didn't live up to the potential it could have. While their sex life was reaching a climax, their backstories barely moved from baseline, other than a few flashes of sad origins and some insight explaining their approach to love. For many this won't be an issue, because it gives some more time for spicy antics, overdramatic quarrels, and plenty of butt and breast shots for audiences to absorb. Yes, you get plenty of the eye candy in this film, which helps cover up the work in progress acting. If I'm not mistaken, both leading roles are awkward, reserved, and have some traumatic history. However, this does not provide an excuse for sloppy line delivering, creepy staring, and using grunts and sighs as space fillers. I wasn't the most thrilled with either leads' performance in the movie, outside of being able to do it on the screen (they seem to have that down pat). The VERDICT:Overall Fifty Shades Darker delivers what was promised, steamy scenes interlaced with the romantic drama that is enjoyed by so many. I think it still held some taste, mixing the sex with a story that provides the entertainment most will be looking for. Can it match to the picture your imagination patient when reading? No, because Hollywood doesn't have an unlimited budget and has rules to abide. But it does its best to provide what many craved. Yet not even sex can make up for the limitations in acting, detailed story, and character development that goes beneath the skin. I'm sure my review will not stop fans from trekking to the theater, but this reviewer can't recommend this one for the theater, unless you just want to see the sex on a massive screen. Yet, it also doesn't deserve the worst score, because it delivers what I think it promises, though not all the way. Oh, and make sure to stay for the credits for a teaser that really is a tease. My scores are: Drama/Romance: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.0",Fifty Shades Darker
33,bkrauser-81-311064,50 Shades of Emotional Abuse,4,9 February 2017,"If you can say anything nice about 50 Shades Darker it's that, unlike its odious predecessor, it at least doesn't tack on some faux ""liberated woman"" bulls**t in the feeble hopes of shutting down naysayers. Adding something to that effect at the end of this stinker would have been the equivalent of saying ""don't tinkle in public,"" right after electrocuting yourself on an electric fence, fly first. Also, while we're on the subject of niceties, another good thing about this movie is it endseventually.Anastasia Steele (D. Johnson), our milquetoast protagonist from the last film is at it again with her manipulative, controlling, borderline psychotic, billionaire boyfriend, Christian Grey (Dornan). Only this time, the only safety word we're given is ""change"". As in, ""I'm a changed man,"" and/or ""you need to change,"" or (if you ignore the theatrical release and find this garbage on Cinemax) ""change the channel."" Anastasia is convinced the Christian does desire to be a little less sadistic and does have it in him to change; and if we follow the cues of director David Foley, it seems the movie wants to convince us he can.There's a side plot involving a former ""submissive"" (Heathcote) who was gaslighted by Grey long ago, but for the most part we're stuck in the bloated doldrums of Christian and Anna's airless relationship. Their relationship includes such emotional highlights as: angry text messages, excessive brooding, frustrating secrecy and Christian pulling out all the stops to literally buy his paramour. The film then takes great pains to elevate every tiny independent choice Anastasia makes into some epic act of defiance comparable to Kunta Kinte on the whipping pole. Reality is, it's just a concentrated dose of rich white people problems pureed and injected into the faces of willing audiences like Botox.But of course, this movie is not for me. I'm about as far from the prime demographic as you can get (the prime demo of course being aliens piecing together what exactly happened before the Earth was destroyed). Those interested in seeing the sequel to a film based on a book, based on Twilight fan-fiction, are only interested in one thing. I'll give you a guess as to what that is.Well far be it from me to disagree with the middle-aged women sitting behind me smelling of cheap perfume and Peppermint Schnapps but I really doubt everyone got their money's worth this time around. This movie is not only an insult to fiction publishers, the Seattle skyline, helicopters, the S&M subculture and whatever the f**k Christian Grey actually does for a living, 50 Shades Darker is an insult to good smut. At least good smut gives you the goods. This movie and the filmic atrocity before it gives you the thirty second sample version of what you actually want and fills the rest of the time with blank stares, lacy corsets and complete misunderstanding of human anatomy.The 50 Shades series (2012-Present), despite being horrid in every conceivable way has still managed so far to scrounge enough fans for further movies. To them I ask, would Christian Grey still appeal to you if he had a bank account to match his IQ? Would you still want this character tracing his abs with lipstick then? They say that the difference between erotica and porn is the lighting. I think I would have rather been left in the dark on this series.",Fifty Shades Darker

37,rockman182,Fifty Shades Darker (2017),7,12 February 2017,"I might get a lot of hate for this but I actually liked it. Hear me out though. It's still stupid and has incredibly dumb moments. However, the entertainment factor has been upped since the first film. The actors are more comfortable in their roles and it shows. There is also more of a charm to this film and the love scenes and cinematography are much more sleek. Its all around stronger than the first. I think your reaction to the first and the genre in general will effect your reaction to Fifty Shades Darker though.This film picks up where the last one left off. Christian Grey tries to rekindle his romance with Anastasia Steele. Their bond becomes stronger but there are new variables and explorations of Christian's past. But through all this the two endure and actually hit relationship milestones. This film is definitely more sweet among the darkness. The leads are in a happier place and they reach a place of certainty emotionally and sexually. The love scenes are more exquisite and are supplemented with great music. I love that song by Zayn and Taylor and loved hearing it during the boat ride. Some of the locality is amazing and it shows in the cinematography.That said, the film still has narrative problems. The dialogue (while better) is still clichéd and predictable. Motivations are still questionable, some side characters are still thrown into the mix and so underdeveloped. Where the hell did Rita Ora come from? Shes is probably in the first but I can't recall right now. None of the supporting cast is there for a long time and are not given enough say. Some plot progression just happens so suddenly that you are there just scratching your head like ""wtf""? Two key events (if they can even be called that) are so incredibly stupid. The film isn't that smart at times but lets face the truth. Its based on probably very awful books so something must be going right if the film is somehow enjoyable.I know I'm in the complete minority with liking this film. I think the first is a guilty pleasure and kind of in the bad its good territory. Its more of the same with this film but its definitely a more unified and sleeker production. There's not a lot of urgency in the film but I don't know if that's how the adapted material is supposed to be. The film somehow does set itself up for a third one though. Overall, the film is exactly what its marketed as: a popcorn date movie that ladies and some guys will enjoy as a mindless but nice looking film. Also big P.S.

It's essentially just a well made, but derivative melodrama with some of the old BDSM thrown in to spice things up.I have to admit I didn't notice much different with the change of directors. It does seem to follow on fairly logically from the first film, but if you're stepping in for the first time, you shouldn't have too many problems picking up the gist of things. I'd never try to argue the storyline is all that deep.Dakota Johnson makes the film for me. She is a very appealing Ana and carries off the the vulnerable/strong character thing really well. Unlike some of the other reviewers around these parts, I think she succeeds in displaying plenty of chemistry with Christian. And speaking of that well-known male dominant, let me just add that I think Jamie Dornan plays that part quite well. Yes, he does appear kind of wooden and emotion-lite, but that's the way Christian is written in the books. And as many are aware, author EL James had a very big influence in the adaption of her books to the screen. For a start, her hubby Niall Leonard, is the sole script writer! All those expecting a vastly different screen persona of Christian are just whistling into a gale of a wind.It was fun seeing Kim Bassinger turn up playing Elena, considering she starred in Nine and a Half Weeks, back 30 years or so ago and that film kicked up the same sort of reaction from critics as 50 Shades etc. ( It was also a commercial hit.)

39,dave-mcclain,"""Fifty Shades Darker"" has a better story and may even be sexier than its predecessor.",8,10 February 2017,"In 2011, the erotic romance novel ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", by then-unknown writer E.L. James, took the publishing world by storm. And what a storm it was! James only started writing in 2009 – fan fiction based on the ""Twilight"" movies and books, but by the end of 2012 (after the publication of ""Fifty Shades Darker"" and ""Fifty Shades Freed""), ""Publishers Weekly"" named James ""Publishing Person of the Year"" and she made ""Time"" magazine's list of ""The 100 Most Influential People in the World"" and that storm I referenced had turned nasty. Authors as prominent as Salmon Rushdie derided the novels as poorly written, while others debated whether the BDSM theme around which the plot revolved depicted an abusive relationship. Nevertheless, James' mostly female readership enjoyed the romance between the main characters and James made $100 million in 2013, $5 million of which was for the rights to film the first book in her trilogy. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" hit theaters in 2015 and, despite mostly negative reviews from critics, the movie banked over 14 times what it cost to make and the second and third films in the trilogy were filmed concurrently in early 2016. The critics can say what they will about E.L. James, her stories and the movies that her books inspired, but millions of people all over the world have been entertained by the ""Fifty Shades"" saga, including the second film, 2017's ""Fifty Shades Darker"" (R, 1:58).The movie picks up a few months after the naïve, but strong recent college graduate Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and the controlling and sexually adventurous billionaire businessman Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) said an emotional ""goodbye"" by simply uttering each other's names at Christian's elevator. Ana has started a new job as an administrative assistant to Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson), the handsome head of the Fiction Department at Seattle Independent Publishing. Christian finds Ana at a gallery showing for a photographer friend and Christian talks Ana into joining him to get something to eat. Soon after, Jack, who has shown an interest in Ana that went beyond the professional, convinces Ana to join him for a drink at a local bar and Christian soon shows up. The two men take out their penises and measure them. Christian wins, taking Ana with him as he leaves the bar, but Jack isn't quite ready to admit defeat. (That last part was metaphorical, but very much in the spirit of this story, so) As Ana and Christian resume their relationship in fits and starts, the terms have changed, new challenges arise and old jealousies are aroused. Christian agrees that this time there will be no rules and no punishments and his relationship with Ana will be a ""vanilla"" one. Ana worries that Christian will be unable to give up the kinkier aspects of their physical relationship, but he assures her that she is more important to him than his need to dominate his lovers. This time, Ana is on top (again, metaphorically speaking) as she calls the shots and even shows a continuing interest in some of Christian's sexual toys and tricks – as long as she isn't again compelled to surrender control. Meanwhile, one of Christian's previous submissives, a clearly disturbed young brunette named Leila (Bella Heathcote), keeps popping up, as does Elena Lincoln (Kim Basinger), aka ""Mrs. Robinson"", the woman who first introduced Christian to the BDSM lifestyle. We also learn more about Christian's early life and why he is the way he is.""Fifty Shades Darker"" has a better story and may even be sexier than its predecessor. The plot is well, darker, with elements of a thriller mixed in with the romance and the sex, and with a new director (James Foley) and a new screenwriter (Niall Leonard – adapting his wife's novel), it's more broadly entertaining. Like the first film, there's plenty of sex in this one, but it's less (a little less) ""kinky"" and more romantic than previously. The insights into Christian's background, including meeting more women from his past, also gives the plot more depth as both Ana and Christian each have more at stake, emotionally-speaking. This movie won't win any Oscars, but it's pretty f---ing enjoyable. ""A-""",Fifty Shades Darker
40,swilliky,A boring sequel of a dumb romance,2,14 February 2017,"The sequel to the successful sex romance tells a little more of the mind-numbingly boring story of Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson). The first film left off with them breaking up but Grey continues to his relentless pursuit of Anastasia that is not borderline creepy but way past it. He buys up enlarge pictures of her that are being sold at a friend's photography gallery display and continues to send her gifts. Anastasia has started working at a small publishing company under her jealous boss Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson). Anastasia agrees to have dinner with Christian and they reignite their passionate romance though she still has reservations despite his insistence to give her money. Christian is still in touch with his old lover and the one who taught him about BDSM, Elena Lincoln (Kim Basinger). Anastasia is also being stalked by one of Grey's old submissives Kate Kavanaugh (Eloise Mumford). These strange occurrences never amount to much and the drama is alway overshadowed by the need to show another sex scene.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Fifty Shades Darker
41,brankovranjkovic,Fifty Shades Darker – Anastasia Bites her Lip Again,1,12 February 2017,"Stars Minnesota Johnson as the submissive girlfriend and Jamie Doorknob, as the dominant, controlling boyfriend. This is soft-core porn for girls and I noticed that the screening I attended was almost entirely a female audience. Though be aware that the erotic scenes are not the kind of sex girls want to see or probably enjoy. I didn't care about the lead actors, who had very little chemistry in between the sex scenes and even those were pretty dull, the elevator scene is a good example of what I mean. The plot is poor, the drama is rubbish, the acting is wooden, and the dialogue is laughable rubbish. The film is unintentionally funny when supposed to be serious, and boring when supposed to be sexy. Although sexier than the original film (my wife tells me) not as graphically sexy as the book. I sat through the pain of this and at the end felt glad I wasn't Christian Grey, though being a billionaire is always very appealing. So in summary, this is a rubbish sequel to the original garbage but will do very well because it's been released over the limited window coinciding with the Valentine's period.",Fifty Shades Darker

43,SoumikBanerjee25,"Turned into Soft Porn, Unintentionally? I doubt!",3,31 May 2020,"An unworthy continuation, that blatantly relies on Nudity and Skin Show! Unfortunately whereas the first one succeeded in terms of delivering a wholesome package; this one's void in writing is conspicuous. Amateur hands behind the production is the sole reason to blame. Writing & Screenplay both are distraught, the detailings are vague.
Incapable Editing made it even worse, The direction is weaker on the front as there are so many repetitive moments that hold so much similarity in pattern; resulting exasperation. The saving grace was the characters themselves. Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan as Christian Gray both took off exactly where they left. Gradual progression of their relationship is an intriguing watch, as they are relatable and likable to a certain extent.
They graced the sensuality with sincere audacity but at the same time too much of the same ruined the essence out of it. After a certain period of time, one can easily predict their love making skills. If you are directing a Luscious craft, atleast make it tempting enough. Make it unique, so the pleasurable moments would be justified in the eyes of the viewer. Passionate love is the purest thing one can imagine in an art form but when the drawn boundary gets blurry; things can soon turn into bothersome imagery which ultimately results in disastrous outcomes.",Fifty Shades Darker

Not that the other two Fifty Shades movies are great cinema.I enjoyed this movie. Ana is all over the place in her moods. Christian is as goofy as ever. Most of the story exists just to give them a reason to have sex in a particular location. These two should be exhausted most of the time.I liked the music. I liked the sets and wardrobe. This one felt more like a fairy tale than the other two in the series.",Fifty Shades Darker
45,euroGary,Enjoyable for what it is,6,15 February 2017,"When we left Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) at the end of 'Fifty Shades of Grey', they had parted because she was repelled by the pleasure he got from dominating her in the bedroom. This second film in the trilogy opens an undisclosed amount of time later, with Anastasia living her own life. But Christian can not let go - he sends her flowers on her first day in a new job; and when her friend Jose (who spent the first film pathetically making cow eyes at her) has an exhibition of his photography including six out-sized pictures of Anastasia, Christian buys the lot (Jose, incidentally, did not ask Anastasia's permission before displaying the pictures - she seems to attract domineering men, as also demonstrated by the attitude of her new boss). Could it be that Christian has fallen in love? It's not all romantic froth, though; the appearance of one of Christian's former submissives reminds the viewer that this is not all nudge-nudge, wink-wink, slap-and-tickle and the scene where she kneels before Christian and he strokes her hair as if she were a cowed labrador is quite chilling.Acting-wise, Johnson does well enough with her shallow, Mills and Boon role; and as Christian becomes more relaxed it is good to see Dornan given the chance to make him more than just the mysterious billionaire he was in the first film. But it is the supporting roles that are the most noticeable: singer Rita Ora, as Christian's 'full-on' sister, acquits herself very well - someone give her a larger role! - and Kim Basinger channels every 80s US soap queen you can think of in her role as the woman who was the teenaged Christian's dominatrix. Bella Heathcote, gifted the part of Christian's damaged former submissive, makes the most of the film's only real dramatic role.Like its predecessor, 'Fifty Shades Darker' is ultimately a lifestyle film: everything looks really attractive, from Johnson and Dornan's impressively-toned bodies, to the elegant clothes and the lavish houses and apartments. And the sex? Well, in contrast to Sam Taylor hyphen Johnson's efforts on the first film, *this* film's director, James Foley, inputs a little more adventurism into the sex scenes, although viewers will be pleased to note that safe sex appears to be practiced: Dornan doesn't even remove his trousers for most of the bedroom antics!",Fifty Shades Darker

50,themadmovieman,Somehow worse than the first one,2,13 February 2017,"I hated Fifty Shades Of Grey. Non-sensical, poorly written and painfully dull, there was very little to like about that movie. That's why I'm absolutely baffled that its sequel is even worse. Continuing on from where the original left off with an utterly tedious and ridiculous story, nothing about Fifty Shades Darker grabbed me, whilst it loses any sense of the sleek, or even risky, nature of the first film.The main reason that this film is so bad is the story. Featuring consistently incomprehensible twists and turns from start to finish that make an already dull story even less compelling, there was nothing here that got me intrigued in the lives of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey.And whilst the first film was tedious for its almost inactive story, following a weak Anastasia being suppressed by Christian, the fact that the sequel, which does have a modicum of character development, fails to provide any more intrigue or drama is unbelievable. We see Anastasia stronger against Christian, which adds a different dynamic to the relationship, but in turn makes the central focus of the entire series feel irrelevant.As a result, we get all these random extra characters flying in and out of the lead duo's lives that are supposed to have some sort of dramatic impact. Almost as inconsequential as some of the scenes from The Room, the new players in this sequel, namely Kim Basinger and Bella Heathcote's characters, appear completely out of the blue, and don't play anywhere near enough of a role to have the intended dramatic effect.In short, whilst there's a lot more going on in Fifty Shades Darker than its predecessor, it somehow manages to make everything even more boring. The main relationship is completely stale, the character development is under-utilised, and the new characters turn the film into some sort of weird, nightmarish soap opera that doesn't make one bit of sense.Then we move onto the performances. Now, I like Dakota Johnson. She's a perfectly good actress who's put in some great performances over the past few years, but this really isn't one of them. In an almost identical situation to Kristen Stewart in Twilight, Johnson gives a laughably underwhelming performance lumbered by horrific dialogue and a tedious character. She can do a lot better, but she's not able to bring her talents to the table in this film, and that makes her just as poor as everything else in Fifty Shades Darker.Alongside Johnson, we have Jamie Dornan. As a character, Christian Grey feels (somehow) even less developed than last time out, and that means that Dornan, whose performance was pretty dull in the first film, doesn't add much to the film at all, coming off as wooden and disinterested as he did before. Meanwhile, the likes of Kim Basinger, Bella Heathcote, Marcia Gay Harden and Eric Johnson, all of whom play in supporting roles, add almost nothing to the story. Again, their characters are as thin as paper, and the dialogue they're given is horrific, but the performances don't do much to rectify those issues.Everything I've said so far is the sort of stuff you'd expect from Fifty Shades Darker, especially after the first film. However, what's genuinely disappointing for me about this sequel is how it almost completely loses the best part of the dire original.Director Sam Taylor-Johnson left the project after an alleged spate with author of the books, E.L. James. In her place is James Foley, whose directing style just isn't as strong. I genuinely thought that Fifty Shades Of Grey was a well-directed movie. Slick, modern and with a slight air of tension and mystery (even if it was far less risky than you'd expect), there was something about Taylor-Johnson's style that grabbed me.Unfortunately, Foley doesn't manage to do the same. Fifty Shades Darker has a little bit of style from time to time, and the directing is still the best part of the movie, but it's a far cry from what we know can be done with this awful story, and with a much duller and less slick visual style, I was even more disappointed with this movie than I ever thought possible.Overall, it's pretty clear that Fifty Shades Darker is a horrific film. Somehow worse and more boring than its terrible predecessor, it does nothing to build on the story we saw last time out, instead opting for a soap opera-esque structure full of random characters with completely incomprehensible motives. The performances are bad, the writing is atrocious, and even the directing is poor.",Fifty Shades Darker
51,darkreignn,Won me over with its sweetness and charm,6,23 February 2017,"""Fifty Shades of Grey"" was the film everyone loved to hate. Chris Stuckmann, my absolute favorite critic, destroyed it, awarding it an ""F"" grade. Me, being the ever-diligent movie aficionado, decided to go see the movie anyway. And in all honestly, I was looking forward to watching it. When the first trailer surfaced, I was surprised by how good it looked. Incredibly shot with a fantastic music choice, the preview made the movie look more like a thriller than a romance. So on Valentine's Day of 2015 I walked in the theatre, plastic wrap all over the floor like Dexter's kill room, and found myself to be the only single male there. Everyone else in the 300 seat theatre, and I do mean everyone, was either with a date or with a group. Now I'm not sure if you've ever seen a widely released erotic BDSM soft core pornography film in a packed theatre by yourself, but let me tell you that it's not the most comfortable experience, especially when everyone else around you is breathing heavily and leaving every 15 minutes to use the restroom (seriously, those people had the weakest bladders). When the credits rolled not only did I find my shoes somehow soaking wet, but I realized that the movie was actually, well, not bad!I was surprised. This was ""Fifty Shades of Grey?"" This was the movie that users on IMDb rated so low that it had a 3.2 even before it came out? This was the movie Chris Stuckmann gave an ""F"" to and Jeremy Jahns gave his lowest rating of ""dogsh*t"" to? Complex characters filled the screen, an interesting story unfolded before your eyes, and a blossoming romance was born. I'm not ashamed to say I liked ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" so of course I was ready for ""Fifty Shades Darker.""And of course the critics of the world stomped the movie under their boot. But that wasn't going to stop me from taking my grandma to watch this movie with me. I take film criticism very seriously, and damn it, I'm a sucker for romance (and I know how much grandma loves her bondage). So with all that said, how was ""Fifty Shades Darker?"" The first words that pop into my head are ""sweet,"" ""charming,"" and ""romantic."" This movie won me over with how sweet its romance was between Anastasia and Christian. Christian, played by Jamie Dornan, is desperately in love with Anastasia, and that comes across very clear. Mr. Dornan's acting is believable and I wouldn't be surprised if the two actors had something going on during filming as well.Dakota Johnson as Anastasia was excellent. I don't want to bash Jamie Dornan's acting ability at all, because he is a fine actor, but Dakota Johnson acts waves across Jamie. Her portrayal of Anastasia Steele is incredible, filled with a shy anxiety and nervous love; she is truly a joy to watch on screen. And man, she is beautiful. I'm telling you, if news broke out that Jamie and Dakota fell in love during the making of this film I wouldn't doubt it.But there isn't just romance in this movie. There are some mild thriller elements here and there and it adds a lot of variety to the film. There are creepy stalkers, misogynistic bosses, and old flames trying to sow discord, and it was all so entertaining to watch. There's a fantastic scene with Christian and one of his old girlfriends that is amazing in its intensity. It will leave you breathless. And speaking of being breathless, let's get to what you really want to read about: the sex scenes. There were a lot more than there were in the first movie, and they were way more graphic, but let's not get carried away. The sexual scenes were filmed with artistry and integrity, and are nothing anyone should be offended by. There were some mild BDSM elements, but it was nothing too crazy, and that brings me to another point. I'm sure you've heard people talk about how the film, and especially the book, doesn't promote a safe BDSM relationship. I've never read the book, so I can't comment on that, but having seen the movie, I can tell you that that's the point. It's not supposed to show you what a safe BDSM relationship looks like, quite the opposite. Christian even says that he's not a dominator, but a sadist. In this film Christian changes. He wants to set his sadistic tendencies aside for Anastasia, because he loves her, because he realizes true love is better than just satisfying his base sexual impulses. It's called character development, and it worked. I can't help but think that people who complained about this didn't watch the second movie or read the second book. Now granted, maybe the book is different, but the film shows a changed, a more complex, and a more complicated Christian Grey.What can I say? I liked the movie. It's not perfect, it has it's fair share of flaws (that I can't write about because of the 1,000 word limit!), but ""Fifty Shades Darker"" is a well filmed and well acted little romance. It has sweetness and charm, and real chemistry between its lead actors. It has scrumptious set and costume design (I mean, Anastasia in that silver dress? Swoon). The ending? Adorable. The cliffhanger? Handled perfectly. The after credits scene? Now I can't wait for the final entry in this trilogy. You've heard the hate, you've heard the controversy, and you've heard the criticism. It's time to make up your own mind. ""Fifty Shades Darker"" may not be the best movie of 2017, but if you like romance, drama, complex characters, and suspense, then it's definitely one you should pay to see. Don't let the hate bandwagon stop you from seeing an enjoyable movie.",Fifty Shades Darker

53,FelipeCarrillo,"Where Are ""Hearts & Flowers""?",5,22 February 2017,"Two years ago, Universal Pictures agreed to display the preceding unreasoning erotic-romance adaptation thought up by British E. L. James, such recklessness led to a storm of dissimilar opinions between movie critics and audience, however, and deplorably the most transcendental for the film production company, was a rotund monetary attainment, not only in its homeland but in the whole world, in part by its relentless readers and partly by its strategic launch date.Valentine's day is the picked day for releasing Jamie Dornan' and Dakota Johnson's sadomasochistic fair tale. Numerous are irrational alterations within this sequel, nonetheless, the germination of all these changes lies in its hard directional shift, as Taylor-Wood hand her director chair (within allowable boundaries) over to the filmmaker of some episodes of well-liked TV series such as ""House of Cards"" or ""Billions"", James Foley.Even though ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" wasn't well-received by most film critics, one of the most relevant swaps with the original novel was the very light but pertinent conversion in Anna's identity, the main female role. On the pages, she's fragile, more naive and more permissive; on the other hand, her effigy on screen is romantic but self-reliant, a suffragist but submissive woman, and although her mission about women's empowerment did not work, it gives something moderately axiomatic away from denigrated trilogy of James. That is probably the main conflict of the latest installment, the austere and fussy accuracy to the reference book. This time, the intrepid woman who opposed the selfsame creator has gone, foolishly, Niall Leonard, Mitchell's husband, writes and sketches empty, futile and even squalid contingencies and characters.-""Ana""; -""Christian"", the metal and heavy elevator door closes tenaciously. This was the unbreathable and astute ending of the initial film, leaving the protagonist in floods of tears, thinking every day about him and trying to start over. The motion picture in question takes place ridiculously three weeks after what has happened, and I say ""ridiculous"" by unconnected and soporific distortions between the leading roles; in just three weeks, Mr. Grey suddenly forgets his firm sexual priorities to become into the authentic submissive of the story-line, in which Anastasia Steele looks more experienced, more libidinous and superficially more greedy. Fallible resolutions go on in the hands of three idle and anodyne antagonists, who covet to fracture the happy new relationship, at the same time that Grey struggles with his intrinsic shades of yesterday and today.""Darker"", this is evidently the wrong term. Even the film opens with an involuntary self-parody about its suggestive title, are some alba roses too dark? Such name is only one tactic more in order to insinuate improving previous flaws, however, the only thing that they get is to underline them with darker ink.Leonard and Foley are a dangerous duo for the romance genre, and this should not be taken as a compliment. On this occasion, they coat it a dismal, unsatisfactory and unfounded thriller aroma; a series of circumstances poorly posed, developed and resolved. How is it possible that after being on the brink of death, he just wants to have more sex?. Besides, new characters inclusion is simply execrable, providing irregular performances, with traces of university film and a limited run-time on screen for revealing their talents, wasted time in close- ups of the main leads looking each other in the eyes.Despite the unfathomable dissatisfaction I felt, there is another portion which we can praise. The first one, openly, is its protagonist. Although Johnson can't save all the footage, she does not allow her character from drowning in that sea of insipidness and boredom, on the other hand, gives it a particular empathy. Another satisfactory feature is the partial revelation of Christian's dismal past, even accompanied by flashbacks, hence he achieved a longer participation, showing his fascinating acting talent for those minds that still watching ""The Fall"" by BBC Two.In technical aspects, we can see major improvements within staging with regard to the previous film, with soft but amended erotic overtures, that even if they do not reach the expected level of arousal, it delivers elaborated challenges. Likewise, fireworks, masks, sex toys, parties, restaurants, Grey's remodeled penthouse and the usual Seattle aerial shots are perceived differently due to their nocturnal and attractive tones. Like its predecessor, sound support is vital both harmonizing the sensual shots and decorating fickle moments. Although the dreamlike rhythms of Legend, Sia, Swift or composer Danny Elfman do not convince for another Academy Awards nomination, they fit with complacency within artistically precious scenes, for example, Anastasia walking under the rain.""Darker"" destabilizes first movie spectacular expectations due to reduced chemistry of its lead actors, its poorly constructed ambitions and a series of failed elections which lose out the limited potential of James' erotic books. Grey needs to marry, forget his past and be an ordinary boyfriend, reveal his shades; Anastasia wants to be the boss of the publishing house, covets more sex, yearns for redeeming men with psychological problems, now he's who wants flowers and hearts and she wants to f**k hard. An ex- submissive lurking, a stalker boss and a grown up lady try to end the relationship; with its dull ending, ""Darker"" insinuates becoming into a thriller of killers instead of romantic frippery that it should aspire to be.",Fifty Shades Darker
54,n-kefala,Predictable plotting,4,9 February 2017,"The predictable plotting and the boring dialogues makes this sequel automatically uninteresting. ""Fifty Shades Darker"" is worst than the first movie because the characters have learned nothing and repeat the exact same unhealthy relationship. The two beautiful protagonists do their bests to treating sex like a pleasurable activity but is not enough and the result is not good. The thriller narrative, involving persons from Grey's strange past, exposes the shallowness of the story. What made the first unit of this trilogy so much better than the current version is that everything was then new. But now that we are familiar with the equipment in Christian's lavish penthouse, the novelty is gone and the boredom is here.",Fifty Shades Darker
55,destinylives52,An Inferior Sequel,6,20 February 2017,"Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan reprise their roles as Ms. Steele and Christian Grey, respectively, in ""Fifty Shades Darker."" After being freaked out by Dornan's sadist ways in ""Fifty Shades Of Grey,"" Johnson quickly gets back together with Dornan after setting up a ""no rules, no punishment"" alteration to their original relationship. Things seem to go well until a weird, disheveled chick starts appearing intermittently to freak out Johnson; sexual harasser/creepy boss named Jack Hyde (dude, seriously, this is a name that I would come up with back when I was 14-years-old writing short stories, so it kind of gives you a hint as to the writing talents of the screenwriter and/or author of the books) comes on strong to Johnson, which freaks her out; and ""Mrs. Robinson"" is revealed, giving Johnson advice about she's not good enough for Dornan and she needs to leave him, which freaks out Johnson.So with all this stuff going on — and handled badly by the screenwriter/director/editor — what is the spine, or theme of this movie? If I had to guess, it's Johnson and Dornan trying to change for each other, trying to find a compromise so that they can continue their relationship. That's all good and well; but ""Fifty Shades Darker"" is less focused and more comedic (not deliberately, I bet) than the first movie, and the first movie was no masterpiece. I know that most sequels tend to be of a less quality than their predecessors, but in the case of ""Fifty Shades Darker,"" the difference in quality is really jarring. It felt as if there were 10 drafts of the movie, and instead of the 10th, polished draft being produced, the 3rd draft got produced. Moving on My most memorable, movie moment of ""FSD"" is the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Dornan tells a creepy, former submissive who is flipping out to ""kneel,"" and she does so instantaneously. This is probably the best written scene of the movie, as it shows Dornan's immense power over his former subs; Dornan's possible, continued need for that kind of pure obedience; and Johnson's full realization that she can never give that to Dornan.Bottom line, for those who didn't understand nor liked the first movie, you'll definitely hate this one. But for those who were entertained by the first movie, as I was, you'll probably want to see ""FSD"" because you want to see how things turn out, despite the cheesy, corny, ridiculous events and dialogue. Look, it's like a two hour soap opera, and if treated as such, and you are the type to get entertained by soap operas and soft core porn, then ""Fifty Shades Darker"" may be a decent piece of entertainment for a couple of hours. Of course, if watched with a significant other, the entertainment value of this movie goes up significantly (insert winky face here).Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",Fifty Shades Darker

How, I really don't know. I actually read the books and I get it why they may appeal to the masochists because they are torture to get through. At least they are fun to read in company and just laugh out loud. But alright, I'm not talking about the books here, I'm talking about the movie.I didn't you know just straight out hate the first one. I didn't find it awful, just kinda lame. It had a nice soundtrack (just like this one), nice cinematography and there was some effort put into it to make it better than the books. And same here. They actually improved a little over the book. And they actually put some effort into it and I appreciate they at least tried. But they didn't really manage to make something good. But is that really possible? I think they probably did this the best way they could while also servicing fans. And yeah, it's not very good. This one is more plot driven than the first one, which was all about sex. And those sex scenes were pretty tame. They are tame here too, don't expect to get very turned on while watching this movie, because you won't. They are not poorly shot or anything, and songs add quite a lot to the atmosphere. But still, don't expect very explicit sex scenes. It's all pretty much soft- core. They even feel like today's music videos. The one near the end got the closest to actually feeling erotic.The actors are doing the best they can with what they are given, but there isn't much chemistry between them.

Compared to the books, they tried to fix the plot as much as they could and I appreciate that. The plot in the book was all over the place. So many plot points introduced and abandoned or ended too quickly. And some parts just plain unnecessary. Here they mixed up the order of the events, so it feels a bit more like an actual plot. Some things were wiped out and for a good reason. And they made the characters more likable. In the book, they are awful. Anastasia is whiny and Christian is a sociopath. Words can't describe how much I couldn't stand the characters in the book. Movie Christian is a damaged, troubled man, but book Christian is just a mean, controlling jerk who is obviously mentally ill. That's one more thing they improved from the books. The pacing could be a bit better, but it wasn't a disaster. At some times things seemed to happen too slow and sometimes too fast, but it was bearable.All in all, it's a slight improvement over the first one which is still something considering the second book was even worse than the first one. I appreciate that they tried to make this as good as possible, but it's still not enough to make this a memorable experience.",Fifty Shades Darker
58,annuskavdpol,Even De Vinci in the 1400's used the naked body as an art form,6,16 February 2017,"Fifty Shades Darker 2017 is about a 27 year old man who had a drug addict as a mother who died when he was 4 years old and then when he was taken to the hospital after the mother's body was found by the Medical staff, he was adopted into a family. Somehow along the way he became a billionaire. He owns many businesses and companies in America and throughout the world. He meets his ex-girlfriend at a photography exhibition where her pictures are on display. He buys all the photographs on display of her in the exhibition. He convinces her to go to dinner with him and after a bit of give and take, she accepts.Christian, the lead character, has had relationships with 2 other women in the past. Kim Basinger and another younger woman. Both women appear to still love Christian a lot and are having a hard time letting Christian go. Anastasia and Christian have a relationship, which leads to moving in together which leads to a marriage proposal which Anastasia accepts. This is the case in point story. On a Meta level, this movie is about abuse and Christian. Christian was abused as a child by his mother and there is a flashback in the movie about his father abusing him too. Christian has cigarette burns on his body and he does not like his torso to be touched, in most cases. He uses his sexual organs as a form of defense mechanism to release his swelling up tensions and stress-levels. According to the 2 ex-girlfriends that pop up in the movie, Christian needs to have a submissive sexual relationship; submissive means in the sexual context but also in the everyday life context. Anastasia appears to desperately want to give this to Christian. This movie has clear female roles and males roles. Christian, the male, takes charge in every way whereas Anastasia is submissive to his needs, for example by not going with her boss on a publications trip to New York. Christian both controls and terrorizes Anastasia's life and Anastasia allows and welcomes this kind of control from him, this is often the Hollywood female role in Hollywood movies. Christian wants to be saved by Anastasia and Anastasia wants to both be the savior and the submissive with a master in her actions with Christian. The relationship that Christian and Anastasia share is a co-dependent relationship; as each person does not seem to be whole and content within their selves. Instead, they need each other to fill the other ones' inner void. In the movie, this concept seems to be both romantic and totally acceptable however in real-life this could possibly lead to disastrous domestic sexual violence. This movie has been rated 18A for adult, and often movies I think should come with an announcement in the beginning of the movie, stating that movie is fiction. It is not-reality, but in fact an art-piece. Sometimes movies can taint reality and paint an unfair picture of what love looks like, so it is advisable to watch this movie through the eyes of an art-critical or film critical versus through the eyes of an audience member who believes this movie reflects our current day society, the roles of men and women in relationship and how love should look like today. As this really is not the case at all. This is a fantasy adult movie. An art flick only.",Fifty Shades Darker
59,Bofsensai,PREPOSTEROUS 'THE TAMING OF THE SADIST' clunker!,2,16 September 2018,"N.B. BEWARE: LOADSA PLOT SPOILERS HERE!!!Having been 'tempted' to 'suffer' all three in the trilogy, first, gotta start out by acknowledging Dakota Johnson playing her role of innocent ingenue so convincingly well must be commended - especailly through all her 'introduced to' sexual encounters ..
but otherwise, really, that's about it for a film I normally would not feel worth to add in any review on such an out and out clunker, but this one has to be commented on, and come with warnings!Not of what you might be shocked / offended by presented in its based on oeuvre of writer E.L.James' lengthy online novel, but from the sheer crassness and ideed insult not only to its target audience, presumably of women expecting another sorta 'Pretty Woman' like version love story, but those who might somehow be curious to the now entwined around some oh la la of hanky panky kinky sex play: 
that much is (over well) known from the first (reasonably intriguing, enlightening) screen adaptation directed by (female team to boot) Sam Taylor - Johnson (i.e original 'Shades of Grey'):
but in this - and it must be added (as filmed, ah, back to back) its follow up 'Freed', by exactly the same team sequel (plot spolier alert = freed to marry!) - indicates why it is simply a no no to have the author themself, ah, intimately onboard involved, but that even more so, if you recruit your very own husband to adapt your own novel for the screenplay:
this just 'scream's out (from pain infliction?) travesty of the kink world it purports to plunder for update conceit of 'boy meets gal, but sadly boy is deeply damaged, so gal rejects boy, boy respects (smitten by) her own mind strength of personality gal, so falls in love with, sees error of his ways, re-woos gal, who having tamed him, finds him now admirable marriageable material to finally accept and live ludricously rich lifestyle happy ever after!' (Sorry, if that spoilt the plot: you were warned above!)Even more so if priorly mistreated misunderstood boy is young and handsome and implausibly rich, too - e.g. so much so he can buy the buiness of his playing hard to get (hard to spank!) gal and protect her from sleazy (#metoo!) office boss sexual predator: and which just coincidentally means she moves up into managemnent position of her ideal job.And all because he is a misunderstood as 'I can't help my abused upbringing' sadism: we know that, coz he tells her he is just a sadist and (quel horreur) just wants to hurt women - and because of his Mom, too! See: damaged = needs loving, caring rescuing: that outburst coming just before genuflecting on his knees before her, as her having now effectively tamed her sadist - and so most certainly he's NOT a (mere) 'dominant' who just needs a companianble, ergo willing, sub - even if she doesn't realise that is what gets her mojo working with him - well, just yet (i.e. 'till he's introduced her to all his kinky 'red room' shenanigans and released the sexual adventuress hidden inside her: we know that, too, because his previous 'mentor' / elder woman tells her that: ""he needs a submissive!""):So, she falls in love with this damaged - although just coincidentally ludricously wealthy - 'sadist' but because, unlike all his previous conquests, she plays hard to get (not sure if she can deal with his kinks) he's certain she's the one one for him.
We know that, too, becuase one of his former - too obeisant, apparently - clinches follows him / her (them) around; to the extent she not only watches them sleeping together (in their room!) but later to confront her with a loaded gun (we know, coz it goes off, but fortunately aimed to just miss her):
which is despite that throughout, this absurdly rich young catch is so desirable and / or that envied, he has security with him and for her everywhere: yet at both those times they are not around! If they were my security I would have fired and replaced them long ago: 
as, incidentally, similarly too with his security now cum mecahnic saftety detail, since in the scene set up for her to finally realise she truly loves / could not live without, him (his riches?!), his helocopter goes into some sort of 'we have a problem' whilst gallivanting over a dormant volacno: yet, of course, he is so playboy skilled he not only manages to keep it (interminably) flying down to ground across some impenetrable jungle like scenery, but stll manages to spot a convenient clearing in which to crash land so accurately that although so important to be on the evening news reporting him missing, yet lo and behold, he suddenly turns up with nary a scratch (oh sorry, forehead did have a minor cut) from his own penthouse lift entrance - broadcast is still on, too. (Same for his partner, presumably both having not only climbed out of the crashed copter, but then found their way home safe and sound before the day out ....)As preposterous as the supposed kink aspect of dom finding his suppressed sub who eventually can't get enough of his red room delights **: 
that itself so well equipped, yet, as she becomes more enamoured, inquistive to the sexual shock potential within, all he can suddenly thrill her with is a leg extender, which he soon uses to merely about backside turn her over for yet another rear entry coupling with her **: 
although to be fair, 'tis true, just afore, he does thoughtfully get, ah, 'down' to her - which, no doubt mindful of her pleasure, he quite often does, but as always within a matter of seconds it seems, that's soon over for her and she's over to his seemingly desperate (vanilla!) humping of her: not so caring of your partner's needs really (and if ya wanna know what going down there can be like for the recipient, check out Rachel Weiz in recent 'Disobedience': but then that's UNDERtaken by someone who should know what's exprected - a woman.)Even as she begins to become inveigled into his sadistic (!) 'needs' she begins to minxily suggest, direct the 'kinky' sexual forplay: 
twice she engineers the scenario to now even ask herself to be spanked: 
the first he about turns her for another bum up again, and gives her (just!) four mildly wan slaps, and on (just!) one cheek and then he's at her vanilla* sex-like yet again: that's all she gets (ah, well, coz he knows it's a damaged aberration and he loves her 'normally' dosen't he?)
The next (at least in the uncut, non-theatrical version) after deliberately losing a pool game (so good she's winning up to the point that she would allow the white ball to roll into the pocket after final potted? Yeah.), the spanking she has now not only specifically asked for, but deliberately lost / played for, she now doesn't even get at all, but instead yet another turn about rear entry hump, presumably to his need, not hers, again (and really, is he so desperate that in virtually every coitus, his trousers never get much below the top of his ass: really? Do men ALWAYS keep their trews on when so engaged?!)
Even the 'oh really' kink frisson for the unknowing 'vanilla' * crowd, he 'introduces' ah, 'into' her, love eggs: soon after she is wandering around even dancing at a masked ball yet with nary a below frisson twinge - except when she is sitting: patently absurd ignorant sexual thrill nonsense!**Presumably this is seen as a supposed to be somehow sorta udated version of Fanny Hill, Story of O and the likes, where the woman of the 'sadist' conquers the obssesed (damaged!) enslaved men through their submissive's control over the realisation of his desire (kink), which in the end, so becomes her who controls him, because of the irresistible kink desire for her.
Here, he proposes to her... (althogther now, ahhh.)Overall, not only insulting to women as to how they can get their (rich, oh so rich) man of their dreams (allow him to smack ya bum, coz otherwise you wouldn't, would ya?), but preposterous to those who believe this husband and wife team script would release the vanilla!* we know that coz at one point when she takes him supermarket shopping (he's ludricously rich!) she tosses him an oh so pointed product placement 'Ben and Jerry's VANILLA ice cream tub! Geddit? What next tie in? B&J's 'Red(fruit) bum flush ice cream?** spoiling the second sequel here: 
e.g. when exploring on her own, she pulls out one drawer and there are some, er, odd shaped 'things', as, presumably referencing back to the original detailing the contract scene (recall?), for those in the know (but isn't it aimed at those who don't know - yet?) are a range of butt-plugs .. for her only to slide (!) the drawer back again, items flashed to the audience, never again referenced in this 'happy ever after' sequel.",Fifty Shades Darker
60,ragpap93,Fifty Times Sh!##!er,2,29 March 2017,Why did Anastasia get back with Christian? I mean she is so bad for him. She is so controlling and messed up in the head. He on the other hand is upfront with his kinkiness. It is a movie where Cuckoo meets kinky. Cuckoo wants kinky to change but kinky never will and deep down they both know it but live in frustrating denial. Only one more movie to go and we can breath easy because there will be no more books to base the movie on. However that has not stopped Hollywood before like the Jurassic park and Jaws sequels.

61,Kirollos-Noah,Step back!!,1,14 September 2018,"After watching Fifty Shades Darker, I was super-confused! 'cause it was better than Fifty Shades of Grey in somethings, and worse than it in somethings. Things that was really better than the first one are: It was really emotional, and romantic. The performance was better than the first one. The story was more powerful, but sometimes it made no sense, and it takes us to the things that were worse than the first one: The story sometimes made no sense. Like how Leila was really a slave to Christian? And how did she enter the apartment? A lot of nonsense things happened!

No boyfriend gets to tell you who your allowed to see or not. Or even go places without him. Your not his property for him to own and tell you what to do all the time.
If any woman has common sense, they wouldn't go for a man like Christian. Pain is not love. You don't abuse someone and call it love. Where do we draw the line between a ""intense relationship like Greys"" and domestic violence?

68,Raptorclaw155,Anastasia's Life is a Nightmare,3,28 April 2020,"Nothing about the way this film is written is even remotely believable and there is no arguing that. Nothing about this film makes any sense. Fifty Shades Darker is a film that is much more formulaic than its predecessor in the most fanfiction way possible. The first film, while difficult to sit through in its own way was, at least, structured like a film- like there were writers behind the scenes trying to piece together a semi-coherent film out of questionably written erotic fanfiction. This film moves away in that and opts, instead, to go for a very repetitive story cycle which never really goes resolved and recycles every conflict every time for the duration of the film. Half way through it might leave you thinking it's the end when you still have over an hour more of the same thing to sit through.To be brutally honest, this film almost feels like Caligula in that the story, characters, and plot all serve as a means to an end, and that being the sex scenes. The difference between them comes, however, where Caligula aimed to shock (for better or for worse) Fifty Shades Darker does as predictably as the rest of the film and delivers more of the same. There is nothing memorable about any aspect of this film- it seems only to serve as the jumping point for the series' conclusion and nothing more. It attempts to set the stage for the sequel without having any real identity of its own. The first film ended on a cliffhanger but that goes resolved almost immediately as this film starts- and what's worse is that it insults you by trying to make it look like that isn't the case when, in reality, it isn't fooling anyone. There is no conflict in the character, she's not strong, she is willing to submit to the nightmare of her life as soon as the smallest challenge to her will arises.I've probably played up my distaste for this film in this review but in reality it isn't any worse than the first film, it just managed to find different ways to get to that level of quality. The last straw for me in this film was the whole helicopter crash sequence as it is so cliche of a teenage fanfiction it bordered on unbearable. Despite all that, however, it seems to speak to a lot of people, at least to some degree. If you're curious about what this film is like, like I was, it won't hurt to give it a watch- even if it does take multiple sittings. Don't expect any more of it than the last film offered though, that is a recipe for unfathomable disappointment. This film is its own thing so take it one story cycle at a time and roll with it.",Fifty Shades Darker
69,TheConnoisseurReviews,One of the Worst Movies of the Year,4,5 October 2017,"Unlike most people, I actually found the first Fifty Shades movie, ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" enjoyable in a ""it's so bad that it's good"" kinda way and honestly I was hoping for more of the same. Unfortunately, what we actually get is a long overly melodramatic mess. The biggest offense of the film is the writing. It feels as if the book was used in place of a script. So almost every mundane and useless moment is kept in. And us as the audience suffer because we have to sit through a longer run time with not much happening. Also for a movie that marketed itself on being sexy and taboo, it's quite mild. The most intense they get is a couple of spank scenes that ultimately end in missionary and a cut away to them naked in bed. Because of the terrible writing in the film, the actors don't have much to work with and as a result they give embarrassingly bad performances. Their line delivery feels unnatural and awkward because literally no one talks like that in real life and I feel like the actors realized it, but went along for a fat paycheck. The soundtrack and style isn't bad, but with so much nonsense going on around, they do nothing to make the experience enjoyable, instead I was thinking about which songs I can add to my playlist. In short, ""Fifty Shades Darker"" is a long drawn out melodramatic soap opera that managed to become a feature length film that takes itself too seriously. It has nothing of substance and you can actually find sexier things on television. I give it 2/5",Fifty Shades Darker

From an obsessive ex sub to a douchbag boss of Ana who wants what's Christian. Oh yeah and let's not forget Mrs Robinson who is jealous of Ana and I don't know why she is a very sweet girl and wants to love Christian and show him that someone cares for him.That's basically the plot of the movie and oh yeah theirs tons of sex in the second film then the first and oh boy is their some sexy time in this film which is great. Oh sure the haters will say that it's just a sex craze film, umm so? Their are tons of films that use sex to sell the plot of the story and they don't get backlish like FSD does which is a shame because its a really great film but since the so-called critics want to bad mouth it people aren't going to see it.

Either watch it because of the ""original"" story and leave your judgmental thoughts in a separate room or don't bother watching it at all. It's a well know fact that if you've read the books you'll probably not like the films as much, and I assume that's why people are hating on it, it more exciting to create the imaginary world inside your head whilst reading it, the film does all the job for you, so that's another reason to not watch it if you know you're one of those people. I really like storytelling and I believe there are so many ways to tell a story and I'm okay with both the book and the film. I myself prefer a lot of details and background to the story and characters and that's never rarely ever given to you in a film (that's the part where you have to make it up yourself, or read the book first to get it), and I get that, because if they would, people would think it's slow and boring. I think this was a lot better than the first film, acting wise. I really have to give Jamie Dornan credit, I didn't like his acting in the first film but he really stepped up his game, maybe he got to know the cast and crew better so that he could relax a bit more.

Having established the characters in the first movie, the actors seem to be able to act now comfortably in their parts. The story becomes much more nuanced with plenty of dynamics on the go.SPOILERS from now onCan they maintain a ""vanilla"" relationship? Is he going to become controlling again and ruin things? Will she let it get out of control and ruin things also or stay on it? Who is that stalky girl and what happened to her exactly? what about his mother? and that ex of his? Will something occur with her infatuated boss?On top of all of this, I realised while watching that the series was never about a bizarre sadist control freak, it's actually about all men and the story of a woman trying to find the balance between accepting or desiring the dominant behaviour of the male archetype and maintaining strength and independence in such a relationship.While of course the fact that he is rich, while possibly relating to the power struggle, looks like it is going to be more and more used for generating further drama.

Christian's old girlfriend was stalking Anna. Finally, she cornered her and pulled out a gun and was ready to shoot her. But then Christian walked in the door and the ""drama"" was over.
The Survivor Story:
Christian of course owns a helicopter and pilots it. He has engine trouble and apparently crashed it. It is such a national story that the News networks covered it live. Oh, Dear what happened to Christian is so important to the world, that everyone dropped everything. And yet, everyone in the audience had a problem caring in the slightest. Problem was we didn't see the plane crash or the aftermath. Then Christian walked in the door and the ""drama"" was over.
The porno:
Its easy to make a porno. The porn industry cranks out several thousand every year. And the porn producers have no clue how to make a movie. And yet every porn movie is better than this one. The two principles are reasonably attractive. They have no interest in each other and it shows. There is an effort at Bondage sex, but its sort of like a TV sit-com version of bondage sex, in that there is really no sex. They raise the issue of bondage sex and then avoid doing anything sexy.
So there you have it. Four awful movies for the over-price of one. It could dominate the Razzie awards by taking four places in the worst picture category.",Fifty Shades Darker
80,JelenaG890,Laughably Bad!,1,28 April 2017,"Okay, so my expectations were not high since the first one was not exactly ""Citizen Kaine"" nor were the books literary masterpieces, but this film is laughably bad, and surprisingly, rather dull!! So, what exactly is wrong with this film? Where to even start... the screenwriter, for one, who seems like they just took up writing for fun a few weeks before shooting the film. Some of the lines are absurd - and not even original!!! Look out for a line in the film stolen, verbatim, from Dakota's mom Oscar-winning hit film, ""Working Girl."" The biggest difference between those two films? Melanie Griffith was Oscar- nominated for her role in ""Working Girl."" Dakota Johnson will be lucky to get a Razzie award. A high school student who picked up any knowledge of sex or anatomy from science class, or who had any grasp of the English language, could have done a better job writing this script. The new director also seemed in a real hurry to crank this film out-everything is so rushed and confused. Probably the most obvious issue is the acting. Jaime Dornan was good in ""The Fall"" but in this role, he has all the charisma of a cardboard box. He's supposed to be the man of every woman's dreams??? I'd be surprised if after this film franchise wraps he ever manages to land a good role again- in my opinion, this film and this role has pretty much wrecked any chances he'd have of a strong career. Charlie Hunnam is probably thanking his lucky stars he managed to get out of appearing in this wreck! To go from ""Sons of Anarchy"" to this mess of a franchise would have been a huge mistake. Dakota Johnson fares a little bit better than Dornan, but honestly that is not saying much since he is so unappealing in this role. The two also have ZERO chemistry on screen! For a film that's supposed to be some kind of great sexy film, these two actors have absolutely ZERO chemistry. Rather than feel any kind of spark when they were on screen together, I found myself sometimes cringing. Kim Basinger is a good addition to this film, and she is still radiantly beautiful and appealing on screen, but she is given very little to do here. It's too bad that she wasn't the lead- I was more interested in her character than I was in either of the lead characters. Unless you are a huge fan of the books, I'd recommend waiting to watch this on basic cable.",Fifty Shades Darker
81,Amira-Says,I've Seen Sci Fi's that were more believable than this,1,28 November 2017,"I don't even know where to begin with this monstrosity. The script and plots are written and thrown together in such a way that it seems like someone read the book and tried to write down some of those events for the script. Then they expected that you must have also read the book also so it will make sense to you. Newsflash. This movie is so poorly written and thrown together you won't have the first clue. The events are so far fetched when they a thrown in there that you can't being to take them seriously. Let's start with Christian Grey himself. He's supposedly around 21 and a billionaire. Even without talking, he doesn't even begin to be oozing power or importance when he walks into a room. And 21? I don't think so. Then we have Anastasia who is very unattractive and plain. Yet her boss corners her because he is just wanting to have sex with her ""so bad."" If that wasn't enough they have the boss saying very cringy comments like, ""I can make you *** better than your bf can."" LOL It was like something from a bad porn. Then she goes home and Christian has him fired. That's the end of it. All within a span of a minute. No build up to the event and not acknowledgement when a solution was found. Very insignificant presentation. If the writers didn't care that much about the event why should we?Then this weird chic breaks into her apartment who is Christian's ex. Again this scene only lasts a minute. No importance no real point other than it's just another event thrown in to take up some time. This events supposedly take place same day. lol Not buying it. Then Christian's helicopter goes down. Suddenly they are at his apartment worried and it's already on the news. After 30 seconds they announce he has been found and he walks into the door. Again this entire scene of events is a minute or two a most. In between all this you have some cringy sex scenes and some of the worst acting I've ever seen. Please at least make sure the actors have chemistry before putting them to bed together. It's awful. And yes I've seen tons of B movies. Was the director even there during filming? Even Kim Basinger's acting was horrendous like they did it all in one quick take without knowing the lines beforehand. It's just a bunch of B- acting, no chemistry characters, and random, unbelievable, and pointless events thrown together. I guess the real point is supposed to be their awkward relationship, but there is no dialogue really to support that only some bad sex scenes. The last movie started with him claiming he didn't want a relationship and then suddenly in this one he's changed his mind overnight with no hints, no warning, no dialogue? I've just never in all of my life seen something so random and cringy",Fifty Shades Darker

Put some kind of meta-level in there, don't take yourself so serious in every scene of this movie (there are times in this movie where the serious tone was right but so many scenes could have been a little bit more lighthearted and not so try hard heavy) and have ""better"" music, so this doesn't look like a music video (I'm looking at you, boat scene).",Fifty Shades Darker
83,DakotaTheGamer,Amazing Movie Better Than The First!!!,10,19 February 2017,This was a really good movie didn't expect this movie to be that good this movie was even better than the first one it had more sexual scenes in it than the first one the first one had like 2 this one had like 6 and im glad they got more of those scenes in there because it ain't a fifty shades movie unless it has a lot of that and it did so it was really good in that part and the story was really good as well it got really good into the story of it than the first one there are new things in this one than the other and i really like how they played the story out in this one this one has a lot of story to it which i like the first one didn't have as much and there was nothing really at all to fault about this movie it was really good so im gonna rate it a 10/10 because i couldn't find anything to fault so it was a really good movie and i recommend anyone seeing it just except a lot of nudity lol.,Fifty Shades Darker
84,Christina-Q,Makes you laugh more than an average comedy,1,23 February 2017,"The first movie was boring and very poorly made, so I didn't expect anything from this either. Actually this was the first time I went to the movie theater knowing that the movie I'm going to see is going to be terrible. I just wanted to see, if it is possible to make worse movie than what the first one was. (I did like the books. I think they were entertaining, when you don't take them too seriously.)Jamie Dornan is great looking guy, but he just has no clue, what kind of character Christian Grey is. Dornan's acting was so clumsy that it was awkward. When he was supposed to be angry and furious to Ana and he shouted ""Where the f**k have you been"", it was hysterical. I mean, there was no character or anger in his voice or body language, and it felt like he had never used the f-word before. It was like he was reading the script, but had no idea what else he was supposed to do. And Dornan hasn't obviously never slapped someone on the butt, because that scene, where he was spanking Anastasia, was so awkward that I don't even have words for it. So basically the whole movie was off and unrealistic and not in a good way. And because it was so terrible, the audience was laughing a lot. The scenes which were supposed to be sexy, dramatic or tense, were anything but. Darker was titled as a drama, so i'm guessing that the movie makers didn't plan that Darker would make people laugh more than an average comedy. And I am not even exaggerating how much people laughed during the movie. It was almost every other scene. If you expect to see some nudity, then you get something more than in the first movie, but nothing really ""shocking"" or exciting. Anastasia takes her panties off like 20 times, but that just doesn't make a movie hot, sweaty or interesting.So if you want to see a terrible movie that has nothing to do with eroticism, drama or good acting, then this is your movie.",Fifty Shades Darker

86,gangstah_vino,It wasn't as bad as the first one??,9,7 February 2017,"Hi guys.. Back again.. to review another.So as usual i will keep the review as spoilerfree as possible with rating multiple aspects of the film.Acting: Yup, here we go again. Again dakota was functionable. Jamie was stale, tried to put more emotion into his character which came out unnatural, etc. The side characters were over the top. The only actor i liked was the ""stalker girl"" you see in the trailers. She brought at least something interesting. Both moms also acted well though. 3/10 Story: The story wasn't as bad as the first one was. There was a new interesting addition to it with Christian greys past, but it was executed so poorly.. It felt like the writers were like: god.. we cant do the same thing... what about a girl from greys past that stalks him... yea yea great. There were a few events which had nothing interesting to add to the story. It was just there as fillers.. I won't say much except for ""helicopter-scene"" and you'll know what im talking about. All in All, horrible as expected. 2/10 Characters: enough could be said about mr grey etc, but the one thingI hate is constantly seeing weak women characters in movies. Ana isn't just weak... she gets convinced in a relationship she purely was against 10 minutes into the movie, gives him a kiss of a lifetime after their first date because he gave her a present, didn't go to new york for her job because mr. grey said she couldn't... etc. etc. etc. i could go on and on, but when multiple women write a story at least let her be strong in 1 single scene. she even had to be rescued by him TWICE! 4/10Dialogue: this.. i cant take seriously. Again Mr. Grey would horrible stupid lines which could only make soccer moms panties wet. It was so bad and unbelievable. You can tell the husband of the writer of the stories let in lines he normally would reject. ""You're too... dressed"" goddddd. 1/10 Cinematography: Again great. The movie overall might be sh*t but the cinematography is always beautiful and well filmed.Rated R-stuff: Yea, they did it again. Not a lot of SM this time around. This time 3 out of 5 sex scenes didn't even feel sexy, but bland. Every scene was leading up to these scenes and normally i wouldn't mind that, if it had been interesting to watch. At least the first one had some sexy mystery to mr. grey, but now he is what we all thought he was: a controlling, stalking and abusive freak. 7/10 Verdict: Why bother? its a badly scripted romantic drama with soft-core-porn intentions, which don't play out very well. You cant even laugh anymore at how bad it is. Its just bad and sad to see a movie like this make money. Bad acting, story and horrible dialogue... go see LA LA LAND, any other Oscar contenders, or the lego batman film or john wick.. go see anything but this guys!",Fifty Shades Darker
87,Kynde,Fantastic capture of the books essence,10,12 February 2017,"I have been appalled by the way this movie is trashed both by the professional reviewers and by people on IMDb.You might not like the movie, but to give it one out of ten is just a ""haters"" gesture. Like you had already decided to hate the movie in advance (or rated it without even seeing it like some here on IMDb even writes they have done!)I really enjoyed the books, and maybe it will help a lot having read the books (and understood where Christian Grey is from in his upbringing), but still I cannot see how such a complete movie can be reviewed so bad by someone actually contemplating what they have just seen, fairly. A could understand a 4-5 for sure if you disliked the movie, but 1/10 is so clearly just because of hate for the genre and the success of the franchise. The movie follows the book closely, and although the sex scenes do not take up much of the movie, there are plenty of them as must be expected. What they show is the kind of kinky sex described in the book, but without any explicit sex scenes, that has not already appeared in many other movies. But they show what that very important part of their relationship is, and that it is more than just ""vanilla"" sex, something not so often shown in other films.But also the emotional scenes in the movies are very strong, especially when Christian again fears he will be loosing Anastasia and goes completely blank on the floor in front of her.And there are plenty of action with a bad guy going after both of the main characters, a crazy ex-sub and Mrs. Robinson perfectly personified by Bassinger.Maybe it is because I felt the reviews have been unfair, that I have given it a 10 rather than a 9? But I just had a great experience watching the movie in the cinema with my wife, and would have hated missing it because I had listened to the hateful reviews.So if you enjoyed the books, then forget all these negative reviews and go watch a great movie. Can't wait for the last part next year. :-)",Fifty Shades Darker
88,cutesd,The worst kind of so-called romance,1,20 October 2017,"It's kind of amazing that in 2017 a film like this can be called ""romance"". The character of Christian is creepy, controlling, possessive, immature, narcissistic, and (if we're going off of the film's own narrative) emotionally distant and psychologically scarred. BUT because he is unimaginably wealthy, physically attractive, and f**ks well ... eh ... who cares... Ana loves him. The guy is a psychopath: he buys the company where she works because her boss is attracted to her, he knows her bank account (why??), and he keeps a file on her. Come on people, the guy is 2 hairs short of being a freaking serial killer. In what bizarro land is any of this romantic?!? Hot?!? Sexy?!?Let's not even delve into how poorly and shallowly the Dom/Sub relationship is portrayed. Let's skip over the obvious ignorance of the author in their understanding and personal experience of BDSM. Let's ignore the naiveté it would take to pair an abusive childhood with fetishism and pigeonholing sex where anything outside your basic missionary position is the realm of the deviant and disturbed. ""Only tortured children grow up to enjoy bondage."" Yes, please, let's keep running that narrative. So far we're upside down on the dream guy, we've undercut the sexual revolution we're purporting to encourage and we haven't even gotten to the worst part: the so-called heroine. Our strong feminine role-model and the ying to Christian's psychotic yang... Ana. This woman is literally surrounded by creepy dudes. Her ""friend"" photographs her then displays the prints in galleries without her permission intending to sell the photos to strangers (gross). Her boss, first is the guy who goes after the girl even after he knows she has a boyfriend (eww) then that devolves to him trying to freaking rape her in the office. And her boyfriend keeps a freaking file on her, breaks into her house, tries to forbid her from seeing other men, tries to keep her from working, and hires people to find out every personal thing about her and everyone around her ... oh but she LIKES him so that makes it all OK. Come on people this is just sick!Ana is constantly needing to be rescued. Anything she achieves is because someone else notices her not because she goes after anything. She's annoyingly mousy, indecisive, and plays little girl ... oh but don't tell her what to do ... because she's not a sub. She tells Christian to spank her so she's totally in control of the relationship ... except that he's manipulating and controlling her the entire time. And we as an audience are supposed to consider her strong. WHAT? Plus she just rips off the line from Working Girl ... did she know she did that because it seems like she just tried to pass it off as her own. And the rest of the film is like some horrible porn flick with incoherent scenes jumping to more incoherent scenes with excuses for sex scattered every 10 minutes or so just so you're reminded that this is supposed to be hot. There's no cohesion to any of it. There's random gutter girl ... Kim Basinger is Christian's Mrs. Robinson ... a helicopter crashes ... god it's a mess. And on top of ALL of that ... the sex scenes were awful. I thought that was supposed to be the pull of these movies?Please say there won't be a third one of these!",Fifty Shades Darker

As long as he is rich and good looking, then it's worth it to you and you will enjoy this movie. This movie is designed for you. There is nothing special or interesting about these characters or the one dimensional background cast. You're watching them date for an hour and a half with an vanilla sex scene for every ten to fifteen minutes of talking. There is no conflict or problems in this movie. All the scenes of potential conflicts of the trailer are resolved within minutes after they happen. Anastasia has no backbone in this movie. She gripes and complains about not doing what he wants, then go ahead and do whatever he wants anyway.So if you want to see a movie about Anastasia and Christian date for two hours and have sex, then this is the movie for you.Pros: I liked the first movie because it was so bad it was funny and the soundtrack was good. This movie is literally the two of them getting back together and dating and the soundtrack was okay.",Fifty Shades Darker
91,kshirad,Pure guilty pleasure,6,11 February 2017,"As we all know these books have been adored and trashed by people all around the world. Honestly, I've read only this part out of sheer curiosity, given that the first one was actually a bit fascinating, albeit a tad unrealistic. Then again, the pleasure that this series has given is always about seeing beautiful people on screen doing things we hoped that in real life could actually happen to us.Continuing straight from the end of the first movie, Ana has moved on with her life and is now working in a publishing company at Seattle. One day, a huge bouquet of white roses was delivered to her house and it's from... you guessed it... Christian. They happened to meet in an art exhibition and he wanted to start over. And this time, no rules, no punishment, and no more secrets. Unfortunately for them, a woman from Christian's past emerged, including his former lover and there's another problem with Ana's new (handsome) boss.Let's just get this out of the way; this movie is a pure guilty pleasure. The story is not that substantial to begin with. It's built as a side attraction to the main event; the sex scenes. And let me tell you, It's more graphic than the first one, it could be considered as porn with a much higher budget. You may think the plot is more dense and that there's going to be so much going on when in fact, there's not much. What I find quite lacking is the dramatic tension. All the conflicts they've brought up in this movie were finished so quickly and without much effort. It's like they're rushing to get to the next sex scene which there are quite aplenty.All that said, the actors are really giving their best. Dakota Johnson, just like in the first one, lights up the screen with her quirky attitude and real vigor. And I found Jamie to be more nuanced in his role here, even though he was given less material to work with than Dakota. The others were game enough but didn't give much impression than the leads.Another thing I have to say is that the screenplay is actually better than its' predecessor, and it's written by the author's husband, Niall Leonard. They actually make it quite funny and intentionally funny (contradictory to the movie title). Yet, any attempt at depth is almost nonexistent. The funny thing is that the book provides more information about Christian's past whereas here it got glossed over with only small glimpses of them.James Foley, who once worked in another erotic movie 'Fear', brought all the glitz and glam to the movie, giving it a very beautiful look. Hell, even the cinematography is so gorgeous, it could pass for an Oscar nomination.All things considered, if you really want to find two hours for an escape from real life, this is your ticket. Don't even expect to get an insight or the bigger meanings of life from watching this movie.",Fifty Shades Darker
92,constanza-nm,"It's bad, like we all knew it would be",4,2 May 2017,"I honestly think that anyone going through this comments hated this movie and I personally watched just because I wanted to watch a bad movie (Do you ever get that craving? Of watching something bad for the sake of making fun of it?) Anyways, I'm going to take the liberty of just saying things as they are, this may contain spoilers but does anyone really cares?This movie is terrible, not for one or two reasons, there are too many. But there is ONE, one in particular that drives me insane. Anastasia, a recently graduated literature student gets her dream job and becomes an editor after being molested by her boss. I am myself a literature major, can someone explain me how can I get such a great job opportunity, because so far things are quite the opposite. I know movies do not have to be realistic all the time, but this gets really dumb. If Anastasia was a real person, a real literature major she would hate this book. If she was really a talented editor she would think this book is garbage. It doesn't make any sense.The plot is ridiculous, we know that from the previous movie, but in this second part nothing major happens, where is the story here. Worst than that is the lack of sensuality in this film, is supposed to be about the sexual relationship between these characters, why there is no heat? Yes, the chemistry is a little better than in the original, but still not sexy at all. Dakota's performance is blank and quite annoying, especially in the sex scenes. The sex is just that, sex. Even when they are in the red room, they use gadgets and stuff but nothing crazy, nothing worthy of a BDSM title. The characters are boring and unlikable. You don't get to understand what is so cool about Anastasia to completely ""change"" Cristian because he does seem to be pushed into this new persona very quickly. He is a sadist (stated in his own word) however, he is able to stop being one because he is in love. That simple.I actually think that a story between a BSDM participant and a newcomer could be very interesting, but narrated in the right way. Not an obscenely rich guy falling in love with a boring girl with no personality of her own. I feel ashamed that an awful book like this became a best seller. However, I do have the hope that one day these books and movies will be remembered just as an unfortunate joke.",Fifty Shades Darker
93,nickijjohnson,The books don't translate well to film,5,13 February 2017,"What's hard for me to figure out is why the books don't translate well into films. Both of these films follow the books pretty closely with the exception of changing subtle things like settings and cutting certain things. For instance when you read the book their sex is very descriptive but the sex scenes in this film last all of thirty seconds or so. I still don't find their chemistry to be all that great but better than the first film. They remind me of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart in the sense that it's like well I got picked for the part and you got picked for the part too bad we're not that great together. Which while on that subject safe to say Fifty Shades is basically Twilight for adults. Anastasia or Anna is a virgin like Isabella or Bella. They both love literature and lose it to a man they marry (with one waiting til marriage). Our leading men both with formal names are dark and although appearing confident are insecure. Christian's sister Mia is basically Alice. Also in new moon a crazy chick was after them just like Darker. Edward's father is a doctor. Christian's mother is a doctor. Its almost as if E.L James read Twilight, took out vampires and werewolves, and put in lots of sex. I didn't like the fact that Jack was more evil in the movie than he was in the book. He's basically just used so there can be a third novel/film. Reading the books, however over the top they may be, has been a much better experience than seeing the films. I don't even think people who haven't read the books would like these movies that much because they don't go into as much detail. Also my biggest complaint was that they completely cut out Dr. Flynn Christian's therapist. They insinuate he'll just get better telling Anna his secrets when a big part of his recovery is therapy. Dr. Flynn is literally the one who tells Christian to try a relationship Anna's way. Lastly the soundtrack was terrible. It felt like listening to teeny bop music while watching adults have sex it was weird. Frigging Twilight had a more adult soundtrack! Anyway to sum up for the second time around the books just don't translate well into films. It's nice to stare at pretty actors with great bodies but that's pretty much all these films will ever be.",Fifty Shades Darker

95,showmethemoviescontact,Fifty Shades Darker ShowMeTheMovies Review,4,25 February 2017,"The next installment of E.L James' Fifty Shades trilogy features more lip-biting, leg-grabbing, cash-flashing drivel than ever before; which doesn't amount to anything more than a lack of ingenuity.The saucy sequel to the novel-turned-movie epidemic that is Fifty Shades of Grey, this adaptation was a concise continuation of the first - glossy, well-polished, and truly tedious. Though funny at points, and extraordinarily easy to keep up with, the persistent lack of chemistry between the mediocre leads made the film about as raunchy as your grans' knickers.While the franchise has established a rather successful position within the market (having made almost $150m on its' opening weekend alone), the sex-fuelled romance between the very plain Ana (Dakota Johnson) and billionaire bachelor Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) sees demons confronted and emotional deviations from the start.Dornan, while definitely more polished than his previous performance, still lacked energy and relate-ability, while Johnson was an irritatingly deficient component in her reprisal. The remainder of the cast (including an over-hyped Rita Ora) were about as unmemorable as you would expect. The introduction of various faces (Mrs Robinson, unfortunately not portrayed by Kim Cattrall) added nothing exceptional either.The cinematography which, although well-suited to the style of the story, didn't strike me as anything special whatsoever. This time around however, the music was also particularly bland in comparison to Fifty Shades of Grey - which at least complimented the picture.There isn't much to be said for the writing or direction - sex is Darkers' only narrative, which, by the end, borders on ridiculous. It still can't work out if it wants to be a classic love story or a steamy depiction that verges on pornographic - either way their brief has been ineffective.Overall, a middle-of-the-road love story; well-adapted though poorly executed, with occasional steamy moments but hardly tugging at the heart-strings. Boring and bland - I can't wait to be Freed from this trilogy.http://showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/",Fifty Shades Darker
96,cjiang-72558,It's a little off for both darker and freed movies,5,18 November 2020,"I read the books. Both Dakota and Jamie looked too old to play a 22 and 28 years old in this. They seemed like a couple in their 30s. The movie made Ana a much stronger character and Christian a much weaker character comparing to what's written in the books. The dynamic of the 2 in the books makes more sense, fresh out of college Ana suddenly fall into a life completely unknown. She's naturally unsure about things. Christian is more dominant as he has been in all things for over 8 years. Both are well read. In the books, Ana and Christian are on a journey of self discovery since they met. Both have been emotional throughout the journey. The movie did not reflect those.Dakota is the better actor of the 2, though it might has something to do with the script which is thin even though a large portion of the dialogues is from the books. Most of dialogues and emails in the books are very intelligent and fun despite many F words.",Fifty Shades Darker
97,huey2088,A Comedy,1,16 March 2017,"I couldn't stop laughing from the moment this movie started until the end. From the very bad story line where nothing really happens even though there were the 'thrilling' moments inserted to make it interesting - the girl stalking Ana; Ana's boss taking advantage of her or Christian's helicopter crashing. These scenes attempted to make it exciting but they lead to nowhere. Everyone knows it's the sex that is the selling point here. And it really shows with all the actors looking really bored or wooden because they are really struggling with an unbelievably bad script. Being a sequel, there were the erotic scenes copied from the first movie - Christian picking up Ana to carry over his shoulder; Christian exercising while Ana looks on and biting her lip. It's that catatonically bad that it has to borrow from the predecessor.The sex scenes were also comedic. Sam Taylor Johnson in the first 50 Shades made it more artistic and feminist. This time however, it is more like a porn movie by James Foley. His close up of Ana's naked body leaves nothing to the imagination. Ana's constant sighing and heavy breathing are overdone and distracting.It's not surprising this movie is worse than the first one despite a higher IMDb score. I dare not think what the next installment will be like. It will probably be split into two to make even more money. Sex definitely sells and EL James and associates are laughing all the way to the bank.",Fifty Shades Darker
98,jennifercfisher,Really enjoyed this film.why all the bad reviews!?,9,21 November 2018,I have read all the books and watched the films and Iv got to say I expected the worst dueto the terrible reviews.But I was pleasantly surprised by this film.It was fast paced and to the point and not much sex which was good.As the books do go over similar sex scenes far too much.When you read a book you do have high expectations as you have a scene etc in your head but this film did not disappoint.,Fifty Shades Darker

100,The Fresh Prince,Best erotic-drama film of all time,10,10 February 2017,"This is a very quick review, i really don't review a lot I'm worked for over 3 years in the cinema and i saw every single film ever played in the last 4-5 years. Fifty shades darker is among the finest Erotic-dramas i've ever seen. Tt's important to mention that the first movie is the most financially successful erotic-drama of all time with more than 500 million dollars at the box office (out of a small Hollywood budget of 40 million$). Dakota Johnson is a very fine actress, she is really lovely in this franchise, and the lead actor is very good as well. We can definitely feel the chemistry between them.The story keep focusing on their weird relationship, it is really a continuation of the first movie. The film is funny, sexy and well hmm...erotic. I totally recommend Fifty Shades Darker, and i'm really tired with all this stupid super-hero flicks. It's time for something different. Yeah yeah... haters gonna hate, but what's so great about being a hater? They are just miserable :)",Fifty Shades Darker
101,danishdonjuan,Dark Cinderella Story,6,12 June 2017,"A tough movie to rate for me, for there is so much to both love and hate about it I feel.On the positive the movie has great visual appeal, and is never boring because the danger of the mysterious Christian and his secret life with Anastasia trying to be careful, clever and likable at the same time. So the movie looked very appearing and kept my interest.But that said it has a lot of obvious flaws to me aside from appearing to be a darker ""pretty woman"" and ""Cinderella story"". The plot seems too very far fetched to be believable to me. First there is the fact that this guy is so rich that he can get anything he wants and is used to getting what he wants, the fact he is controlling and secretive and involved in everything. Anastasia is mistrusting of this, but not near mistrusting enough, she tries to set boundaries which she doesn't keep and though that is not perhaps unusual though not very smart, it starts to look very unrealistic when criminal acts are done by people from Christian's past. And with the extreme sex, it seems obvious that they are both addicted to a fairy-tale which can not last or work this way in any real world, for the morality, trust, self-restraint and balance needed for this to work long term is virtually non-existent.I have to agree with a few other comments here, that Anastasia really does not seem very smart or experienced and seems to have gotten most things in her life relying on stronger men to give it to her. So while the movie may play well on many female fantasies, it also in many ways insults women with the naivety of the main character, who for me also becomes less likable because she is so gullible and goes along with almost anything her partner wants without much question. She even hands him excuses and offers him that he doesn't have to talk about things, though her condition for getting back with him was no secrets.Sure you can argue that flawless brainy people might make it tough to keep such a high suspense, since you have to invent smarter opposition, but it is just not very appealing to me to watch 2 hours of a little naive girl in a grown up body, being played around by this powerful rich manipulator who seems to own everything in her world.I think it is harsh to give this movie a rating lower than 3, for it was well made and never boring, but to be a great movie I would have hoped for either a bit more intelligent characters and plot, or at least some indication that the viewer was going along for the ride, at least to be introduced to some greater point to learn from. But there was too little of this. It seemed to me an attempt to explore the powerful attraction and fears which can be in relationships, without really having a deep enough insight to take it beyond the common theme of gullible girl seduced by rich control freak.Not a bad movie, but not a movie I would have desire to see again.",Fifty Shades Darker
102,chopperlilly,Average with tinges of likability and splashes of boredom,5,9 February 2017,"I wasn't sure how to rate this movie. There were some things I liked about it and many that I didn't. What I did like about it is Jamie Dornan, who is not just easy on the eye but a good actor. I am not a huge fan of Dakota Johnson. Her acting is weak and she is very drab looking. Not at all what someone would expect Anastacia to be. However, there is a certain likability factor about her too.I liked the sets and enjoyed the glamour. I also felt the producers/directors did as much as they could with such a poor script about a virgin with a freaky billionaire boyfriend. In that respect, it didn't stray too far from the original novel, which was excruciatingly boring.There were several different story lines happening as well as numerous villains - which was just plain old weird. One might think it would make the movie more interesting, but alas, it did not. It was just more unnecessary fodder.Was it better than the first one? That's hard to say. I saw the first one two years ago and I remember coming away with a similar disappointed, bored feeling as I have right now. But that's about all I remember of that - it's not exactly the sort of franchise that stands out in your memory.50 Shades is worth seeing on video, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",Fifty Shades Darker
103,sherin-lloyd,Worser!,3,15 February 2017,"While the first movie was bad in my opinion ... the second was worse! It was too abrupt and key scenes were removed from the movie ... this made watching the movie extremely ridiculous ... considering the sequences looked abrupt and meaningless ... while I am not a fan of the FSOG series ... making a movie from a book is tricky and this was a mega fail! Don't waste your money going to the theater for this .. there was no head and tail for most scenes! For example: The Helicopter Crash, Ana's Yes, Reunion, etc. Just about everything looked like scenes were chopped and put together for two hours but don't make any sense!",Fifty Shades Darker
104,minanabil-03928,Oh its so bad terrible one of my biggest guilty pleasures of All time Its so bad it is good,1,24 February 2017,"Alright the shitty major guilty pleasure franchise based on the shitty twilight fan fiction continues so will it be better or worst than the first one or what? Thats what we will know right now ,firstly it was way way way worst than the 1st one,i wanted to see it at the cinema cause it could be deleted version but in did see it both cinema and leaked version so i said why not specially the director i love his movies so i had some hopes that they could learn from the mistakes but they made it worst the acting was way way way worst even Dakota Johnson she looks great Jarmie Dornan is right in loving her but she was worst than the first one although Grey's pleasures or his bad way in treating her was not harsh as the first one but still his acting was like a falsehood acting even the soundtrack that the first one was perfect at,this one's music was bad only countable songs were good even the sex scenes itself one in the beginnings of the movie wasn't made right but the rest were realistic again because they edited some music its not NC-17 if it was NC17 movie i would've said its great one but no, i just liked the chemistry between them but porn watchers will say its a good one but I'm not a porn watcher I'm saying its a guilty pleasure cause its laughably bad it is good and i could enjoy it without making it a good one again another shitty soft core porn feature film my rating is its not horseshit its triple horseshit or horseshit to the power of 10😂 that's why my score is 1/10",Fifty Shades Darker
105,bearcrkrd,Not as Bad as Critics Claim,5,16 February 2017,"First installment was a better movie than this one. Had not planned to see that first one after the awful reviews, but it happened. Not anywhere as bad as all the Pros said, I thought at the time. So wanted to see ""Darker"". I'm not seeing the filth, degradation, etc., that some do. 100% ""R"", yes, but no ""X"" at all. I think they tried pretty hard to make that happen, and got it done. Maybe too hard, as the whitewashing keeps the ""why"" of the male leads, um, condition, a continuing mystery. A for effort, but certainly nothing to stand in line for a ticket! Not as bad as critics claim, but an average sequel at very best.",Fifty Shades Darker
106,richardgeuter,"Pretty light, actually",2,13 November 2018,"""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" if I remember correctly, was pretty much content in setting up various subplots and side characters without ever developing their relevance or relationships to the main couple. It ended with Anastasia running away from Christian because he went too far during sex. Within the first ten minutes of ""Fifty Shades Darker,"" the two are back together. In other words, if you've missed the first installment, it doesn't matter much.One thing the predecessor had going for it, though, was the director Sam Taylor-Johnson, who actively worked against the laughable dialogue and uninspired plotting of the script. Together with her DP they even managed to sneak some interesting visual ideas into the thing. After a much-publicized falling-out, Taylor-Johnson has now been replaced with James Foley, and with her the last hint of subtlety has departed the franchise.Which is not to say that ""Darker"" is, as its title and the marketing would suggest, is a more aggressive and raunchy chapter in the trilogy, far from it. The sex scenes (that's what we're here for after all, right?) are not too far removed from what you would see in your average James Bond flick. There's maybe a higher number of sex toys on display here, and there are even some breasts and buttocks to be seen, but all in all, given the franchise's reputation, I was expecting much more out of an erotic thriller about S&M. Most of the sex scenes are even filmed in the same way (shadowy silhouettes shot from the side) and have overbearing pop music going on in the background, so it's hard to get into them all that much. The movie just seems to stop every couple minutes to show us a music video.Other than sex, the movie tries to sell itself by its thriller leanings. Throughout the movie we get glimpses of mysterious characters and hints of tension, but all of these suspenseful elements are always resolved just a few scenes later, usually by Christian appearing out of the blue. Whereas the first movie kept its subplots underdeveloped, this one is even worse. If being held at gunpoint and (later) potentially getting raped are only minor footnotes to the larger story and don't affect our protagonist for more than one or two scenes, why should we care about anything anymore in this story?I guess it's the romance the film is about. However, I rarely had so much trouble suspending my disbelief during sex scenes. You know the trope of teenagers having sex while the killer stalks them in slasher movies? The whole of ""Fifty Shades Darker"" felt like that. During the first 40 minutes or so, there are only three types of scenes: People warning Ana about Christian, Christian behaving like a dick towards Ana, and Christian and Ana having sex. I'm not Alfred Kinsey, but I don't think that's how sexual arousal works. Most of the relationship talk happens through text messages and their dates are even more music-video like than the sex scenes. It's very hard to get into the love story, especially since Jamie Dornan is not very charming in this role (he looks the part, though) and Dakota Johnson acts constantly intimidated, speaking in a quiet voice so as to not disturb her boyfriend. You want to tell her not to get in cars with strangers, not see her have ""kinky"" sex with her millionaire lover.There is indeed a thriller in this. If you replaced the pop music and the gentle Danny Elfman score with a Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross soundtrack, you'd have a less-beautiful, worse-written and woodener-acted David Fincher film about an abusive, dysfunctional relationship between an insecure weak-willed girl and a psychologically damaged rich playboy who preys on women like her. All the elements are in place, even Christian's relatives and other surrounding characters and the fact that Ana's friends only ever appear after two-thirds into the film, isolating her from real life, are in place. They just didn't wanna go there (probably because SM movies that actually break taboos aren't as easily marketable), so what we're stuck with is this mess of a movie with very little plot.I know it's a cliché to hate on these movies, but I just don't see what makes them good in any way. ""Fifty Shades Darker"" doesn't look exceptional, the acting is bland, the story just repeats the same three or four beats for over two hours, the music is distracting ... Nope, this isn't good.",Fifty Shades Darker
107,zumaondeki,Really!! Such bad reviews? Come on its not all that bad.,7,14 February 2018,"My wife and I only just got to watch 50 Shades Darker tonight and yes its possibly not Oscar winning material however we did enjoy it for its entertainment value.
The "" Control Power"" of Christens character is not as forceful as in the first story which balances both of the characters for this particular story,for the ladies there is a Love story and for everyone a modest amout of Erotica in my opinion. I dont understand why this film attracted so many bad ratings,We gave it a 7/10 because it deserves better than the current 4.6 - some people dont look deep enough into the story.

108,pyattimac,"Come on, people-- were you expecting War and Peace?",7,12 February 2017,"As usual, the vast majority of people dissing FSOG books AND films are men, and it is to be expected--the whole franchise is basically erotic/romantic fantasy/fiction, and men are not the target audience. Sorry, but it's just not about YOU! I read all three books and have seen both movies, and I enjoyed them. It is true that the second film takes several liberties as far as staying true to the events in the book, and it would have been impossible to get everything into a two-hour film. However, I agree with what Jamie Dornan said in interviews, that in the second film Christian is a bit more relaxed and also more willing to change/open up, and this was a nice change. I did miss the almost palpable tension between them at times early on in the first film (ex. the scene in Claytons). The costuming and general eye-candy elements were enjoyable. The main shortcoming for me was that they literally had to try to jam in the main events from the book with not enough time to really flesh them out (yeah, I know...). The audience at the screening I attended was almost all female, which to me was not surprising. This is a film for fans of the franchise, and as such it delivered. I look forward to the third film, and will go in with the same expectations. As for the critics, you go in cruising for bear anyway, so no surprise you find it!",Fifty Shades Darker

111,Portrait-of-a-Statue,Darker Desperately Misses A Woman's Touch,7,11 February 2017,"Directed by a man, written by a man (whose wife wrote the books), produced by a man, art- directed by a man, edited by a man... It shows. Fifty Shades Darker is missing the heart, beauty, and delicacy of Fifty Shades of Grey. The gorgeous settings of Grey are gone. The decor of Christian's apartment and office went from worthy of Architectural Digest to being inspired by ManCave.com via Pinterest. One look and you know the colors were all chosen by men.There is no psychological understanding of the characters and their emotional and sexual needs. That lack of understanding applies to minor characters as well. What motivates Elena? How does Grace go from introducing Elena as her great friend to slapping her without the slightest psychological turmoil? The main problem is the determination of the director and writer to careen into the next plot point. Those plot points are either clichéd or unbelievable. Tellingly, the plot point of the book that would have increased our understanding of Christian--his getting counseling--was left out. It's an action film about sex. Without a slow build-up, the sex is more acrobatic but not as sexy. I didn't hate the movie. Dornan and Johnson are great within the confines of what they've been given to work with. The movie is redeemed by the pretty bodies and faces and by our understanding of the characters from Fifty Shades of Grey. But I sorely, sorely missed the attention of Grey's director Sam Taylor-Johnson and writer Kelly-Marcel.",Fifty Shades Darker

113,georgepark,Darker - as in script does not equal book,5,9 February 2017,"Saw the movie tonight. I was disappointed to say the least. Sam Taylor-Johnson did a MUCH better job with 50 Shades. This is a LOVE story.For those who have NOT read the novels and/or misunderstood the story here is a correction. This story is NOT ABOUT THE ABUSE OF A WOMAN.Anastasia Steele is the one in Charge. she is much smarter than Christian Grey from the get-go. ANA makes ALL of the decisions about SEX. It is SHE who controls what Christian does to her. If she says NO, he cannot go further: EXAMPLE: at the end of 50 Shades it is ANA who asks to be shown how rough Christian can get. At any time during the 6 strikes of the belt - she could have used her SAFEWORD: RED.She choose NOT TO to have a COMPLETE understanding of how bad Christian's actions were.In that story it is ANA who tells Christian that she wants him. In this story (very poorly re-imagined by the screenwriter) Ana is ALWAYS the one who wants to be ADVENTURSOME.and this is NOT a tale of BDSM. BONDAGE/DOMINATION/SADOMACHISMChristian is damaged from his childhood interactions with his mother's PIMP. He takes those same actions himself: hitting with a belt, tied up, etc.So it is his inner troubled soul seeking LOVE in the ONLY way he has ever know. His mother ignored him and let the pimp beat him; his step mother is a busy doctor and probably had little time for him and showed little love. ""Mrs. Robinson"" introduced him to his lifestyle by slapping him hard, then f--king him.He grows up, goes to BDSM clubs around Seattle and picks up girls who are into that thing.He only uses Bondage (to keep anyone from touching him) and Domination to control the girls whom he f--ks.The contract (from book 1) specifically excludes ALL of the ROUGH, INHUMANE, AND DISTASTEFUL ACTIONS such as dealing with bodily fluids or other substances, blood, and includes IMMEDIATE CESSATION of actions at the GIRLS request.Ana is in LOVE with Christian and takes on the immense challenge of bringing Christian to adulthood. (he is stuck in a kind of pubescent sexual lifestyle.) The movie script is such a BAD version of the novel that at times it becomes humorless and uninteresting. There is NONE of the fierce passion and drama bursting from the screen that is so well written by the author. They should have kept the original director: Sam Taylor-Johnson - she understood the story and brought it faithfully to the screen.",Fifty Shades Darker
114,enekaith,Such hate over FICTION!!!,7,24 February 2017,"I have read all the books. Twice. America is too conservative for this film. I agree the movie is 'soft porn' to those who like to hide the fact that they sometimes have 'nasty sex'. Everybody has sex, it's human nature. America is throwing a childish tantrum and being hypocritical in it's reception of this movie. That being said, here is my take: Calm the f*ck down. Making a choice to watch this movie is clearly yours alone, if your money feels wasted, then no use crying over spilled milk. I love how unapologetic they were in this one. ALL THE SEX scenes were tastefully done, this movie can not have a story-line without sex. The books are less tame than the movie. Even though it brings a light to certain sexual notions of BDSM, it remains a rated-18 film for only adults to watch. Adults that can't be swayed easily by what they watch, except dumb Americans (in general). Europeans watched this for the entertainment, and the 'love' feel, which the actors did a good job of portraying. I will watch this again because it feeds the pictures i have in my head while reading the novels. The novels do a much better job however. Such judgmental reception of a movie skews quality critique when the only thing people are worried about is their personal feelings when it comes to associating with a potential significant other. It says more about the viewer than the acting or directing.They did way better in this than the first one. I personally felt Christian and Elliot were too skinny in the first one, but they bulked up. All the actors did good. Mia is my only issue, she is supposed to be way curvier, but oh well, I can live with that. Christian is supposed to be more affectionate with Mia; affectionate enough for Ana to notice how different he acts around her. That is one character development that would have added dimension to his character; made him at least a tad redeemable in the eyes of unnecessarily harsh American critique. If it was Brad Pitt... he'd get a better reception, probably outright acceptance. They almost doubled their money, so that means people are watching but no one wants to admit that they watched it, or liked it.Watch this as a guilty pleasure. It may not be true BDSM, but then again it is FICTIONAL. (except your brain can't grasp the meaning of the word).",Fifty Shades Darker

122,maryrock-58-690964,Unintentionally funny and entertaining if you don't take it seriously,2,15 February 2017,"This movie was hilarious at times, even more than the first one. It must be the element of suspense that was added which in terms of plot development fell short. The thing that is actually on point is the cinematography. The film is well shot, providing some nice scenes and the flow is good. For some reason the first one was better. I think it has to do with the over-hype that surrounded its release but i believe it was more coherent and more decent as a result. Also the soundtrack music was infinitely better. The sequel's OST is atrocious. Every single song was cringe-worthy bubblegum pop that ruined whatever mood they tried to set in, particularly in the sex scenes. There was zero eroticism in the sex scenes. They were rushed, watered down, and even boring for a so called ""erotic book"" adaptation. Ironically Christian encourages Ana to come but of course it ends before we can have a glimpse of her orgasm. The silver balls scene provides so much laughter it's hard to dismiss that one, though. The plot is laughable as a whole. We have 3 ""villains"" who are as menacing as a piece of broccoli and they offer nothing but pointless drama. The whole thing is more of a soap opera than a thriller. Christian's past isn't developed enough to make the audience to care and Ana is just too passive and compliant. When she attempts to stand up for herself Christian shuts her up with a kiss or with a fancy present. He's always overbearing, controlling, and pretty much wants her to be mute and obedient. He does a ton of offensive things that would require a restraining order but all is well when we proposes to her or takes her out to sailing. The romance is as flat as an ironing board and the actors don't do anything to convince us that these two love each other. The biggest fail of this movie was the helicopter scene. Christian's family looked like they were kinda relieved he went missing and the heart-stopping suspense lasts for one scene until Christian casually walks into his apartment with blood on his forehead like some superhero who miraculously crawled out of the crushed helicopter and arrived in Seattle two hours later unharmed. Lol. The final scene features Ana's boss who looks like a homeless junkie and sets up the story-line for the final movie in which he'll be the main villain. Overall if you try to look for interesting characters and situations you'll find none here. This is a film made just for laughter and nothing else.

128,vra101398,Oh Boy...,2,24 October 2017,"First and foremost I would like to state how awful this movie is. This is Transformers 5 bad, I'm talking Dragonball: Evolution bad. The first Fifty Shades movie was poor and I reviewed it as such, I really didn't think it could get much worse from there. OH BOY, was I wrong. Flat characters plague this ""film"" and the atrocious dialogue makes them that much worse. Not to mention that combined with the plot I was so bored and uninterested I started focusing on how many tacos I might eat for dinner. However, the worst part of this film still goes to the nonexistent chemistry between Dornan and Johnson. Their performances are so stale throughout the entire picture that after the credits started I could not turn off this garbage swiftly enough to put literally anything else on just to improve my mood.",Fifty Shades Darker
129,rocketrider231,"Better Than the First, but That's Not Saying Much...At All",2,17 February 2017,"I firmly believe that if Fifty Shades of Grey had a good writer, director, and good actors, it could have been an awesome, sexy, psychological thriller. However, the filmmakers instead went for the romance angle, and the finished product was a painfully bad mess. With its sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, I went in with an open mind, hoping that maybe the filmmakers learned from the first movie, and possibly could make a decent movie. Sadly, that's not the case. Fifty Shades Darker is a laughable, piece of garbage.Before I get into what's wrong with this monstrosity, I have to admit: like the first one, I enjoyed the soundtrack. That's the one positive that this movie has.Now it's time to talk about why I hated this movie. First of all, the romance between Ana and Christian is not interesting or immersive. I honestly never felt a connection between the two of them. With the bad acting and the poorly written behaviors of both characters, it was hard to believe that they had any sort of feelings for each other. Speaking of which, let's talk about the writing. More specifically, how utterly baffled I was by how bad it was. All I could think was ""How did a script like this go through so many people and still be this bad?"" For example, there is a part where Christian discloses something about his early life to Ana, and she says ""You never told me that."" To which Christian replies ""Yes I did. You were asleep when I told you."" I literally snickered out loud in the theater when he said that. And that was just one of the many cringe-inducing lines in the film.The film also has no structure whatsoever. It felt like the writers just made the events of the story up as they went along without an outline or plan as to how the story was going to go. For instance, there is a random scene that lasts less than five minutes where Christian is involved in some sort of accident, then comes back from the accident completely unharmed and the event is never mentioned again. It was utterly pointless and only served to tack on a few extra minutes onto the run time.And of course, with this being a Fifty Shades of Grey movie, I have to talk about the sex scenes. In short, they're bad. Just very bad. From what I remember of the previous film, there are less sex scenes in Fifty Shades Darker. However, that doesn't stop them from being completely abysmal, awkward, and painful. The sex scenes are very poorly edited, shot, and put together. All in all, Fifty Shades Darker gets a 2/10 from me. I have to admit: I am a little disappointed that this movie turned out so bad. I will not be duped by the Fifty Shades of Grey series again. Among seeing the first and second film, I have lost all hope in any sort of redemption in the final film and I most certainly am not looking forward to it. Please do not give this movie any of your precious time or hard earned money. Fifty Shades Darker is not worth your time and should be avoided at all costs",Fifty Shades Darker
130,Taxiridefan,I enjoyed it.,8,13 February 2017,"I think that this was a great film with a better developed story and a cast that was at ease with each other.While I liked Fifty Shades of Grey, I think that Fifty Shades Darker delved a little deeper into the story. While the first movie was mostly about Ana and her sexual awakening, this was about Christian and his realization that you need more than just sex.You could plainly see that both Dakota and Jamie were also more at ease with each other. None of their scenes felt forced or hindered by a lack of trust or friendship that you could see in the first movie.While many are bagging this movie for not being a cinematic masterpiece, I believe that they take movies way too seriously and that Fifty Shades Darker is a great piece of entertainment.",Fifty Shades Darker
131,moviereviewer6700,Fifty Shades of Cringe,2,26 October 2020,Having been channel flicking one night through my TV guide i came across this movie being on. I remember being dismissive of this whole franchise when it first came out but through the sheer boredom of nothing else to watch I decided to give it a go.The movie was exactly how I expected it to be. A few cheesy tame sex scenes and a lot of the one-sided story-line. The reason I decided to go against giving this film a lower rating is for the development of some plot in the movie where Ana is confronted by various women of Christian's past.For that reason alone and the inclusion of Rita Ora in this franchise I have managed to up my rating. All in all not as bad as I first anticipated but hardly the big box office picture that the hype suggests when it first came out. Was I too harsh on the criticism originally? Yeah probably but when you overhype a movie your gonna get people who can see it probably hasn't lived up to expectation.,Fifty Shades Darker
132,buckjohnsonus,The definition of sadism is making your friends watch this movie. The definition of masochism is having to endure it yourself,1,23 June 2017,"This movie took me about 10 different sittings to get all the way through. I have never walked away from a movie so many times in my life. I would compare this movie to the first, but in times of great mental anguish and pain, your brain has the capability to block certain events out, so fortunately I remember practically nothing about the first movie. I'm praying that these same mental capabilities will once again serve me well. The great mysteries of life are made up of unanswerable questions. Where did the mystery matter that supposedly created the universe come from? Does anything contain the universe? How did the extremely complex cells that make up the simplest life forms come together before dying out forever? What is the meaning of life? Why in the world would I ever watch this movie after seeing the first? There are no solid answers for these questions. The characters. There is really no way to accurately explain just how boring and hollow these characters are, but I will try. Stare at a blank wall for 30 minutes. Now divide the emotion you felt by a number between 4 and, I don't know, 20. If either, or both of these characters was killed off during the movie I probably would have actually felt some emotion, but most likely that emotion would be joy. Good love movies make you fall in love with the characters. They present beautiful people with depth, an incredible sense of humor and above average intelligence and wit. These characters display none of these traits. Sure, I can admit that Christian is a good looking guy, but that's it. The characters are devoid of actual character. The ""complexity"" of Christian is actually quite simple. It makes me feel pity for the director and the women that think this is a good movie because they clearly are so ""basic"" that they really don't understand what depth and complexity look like. This film makes me sad for humanity and reduces what little faith I had in women in general given how many seem to like this movie.In short, I would have no desire to know either of these characters in real life. It should be easy for directors to create characters which surpass people in real life because they have plenty of time to craft lines and witty banter. Nope. Crafting a persona of interest is clearly beyond the realms of possibility for the writers involved in this project. The female lead (I honestly didn't care enough about this movie to remember her name) is completely soulless and is an atrocious actress. Nothing about this movie is believable. The plot feels like it was an amalgamation of a hundred other ""chick flicks"" with BDSM thrown in. The film feels like a puree of high school level relationships where drama needs to be manufactured to make the relationship feel engaging. In real life this relationship would fail because there is zero to it, besides drama and sex. Nothing about this film makes you say ""wow"", or take interest, the viewer simply rides the tramcar of monotony. Even the sex scenes were mundane. How bad do you have to be to make people want to fast forward the sex scenes? It's like Twilight except that the somewhat interesting vampires have been substituted with Ben Wa balls. Is this supposed to be fascinating to anyone? In the end, the movie is poorly acted, with absolutely lifeless characters and sex scenes with all the spice of a sexual education film in a Catholic school. If you're in high school with an underdeveloped personality and long to hit the lottery by marrying into it, you might find this tolerable. However, if you find this tolerable, start hanging out with more interesting people, get some hobbies, listen to talk radio, or do something that will help develop you into a person of depth, with enough intelligence to see how truly horrible this film is.",Fifty Shades Darker

142,mikenow-511-400540,Cheap fairy tale for girls with daddy issues,1,23 February 2017,"My God, Where to begin? this movie was awful in so many ways that make a list would be such a waste of time. Anyway, I can mention the most prominent and substantial to me, starting by the most elementary piece which is the idea behind the whole story, in other words the subtext or message that the film delivers. This is no other thing but a teenager wet dream, founded on the most shameless shallowness and superficiality: Is the story of a naive young girl obsessed with the actual prototype of perfect spouse in every aspect important for the society, millionaire, handsome, fit, hard-sex addict, possessive and tough guy, so tough that he even resists an helicopter crash to come back without a scratch; so basically what the movie tries to unfold it's an attempt to tell a story where this girl keeps striving to catch this guy and engage him into a ""serious relationship"" without all of his flaws and addictions, in this process all of his evil ex's and spooky characters of his past will try to stop her in such predictable manners that you will have to throw some popcorn to others in theater to get amused if possible. This links to the second aspect to bring up: The Script. This script is so dull and predictable that you would regret buying your ticket in the first 15 min, it's so dummy and felts so unreal that in some point gets laughable, the characters and dialogues are so shallow and the plot twists are far more predictable than fast and furious or any bad horror movie. Linked to that the actors don't help too much, it could be enough with that script but no, the director and producers want you to suffer in every possible way, they throw you a complete platter of mediocrity performances, overacted and fictitious, filled with nonsensical dialogues and cheap jokes. In the technical aspect there's no much to say, it's another big studio fail, a nearly invisible treatment in the visual camp, mediocre photography, sound mixing and editing which is refilled with pop music to solve the problem. In conclusion, 50 Shades Darker it's the perfect opportunity to get your daughter most desired obsessions emerged, or even your girlfriend can connect to the cheap-fake fairy tale of sex and passion this movie delivers.",Fifty Shades Darker

146,adieldevilliers,Honest Review,7,20 February 2017,"Fifty Shades Darker is much better than Fifty Shades of Grey. The tone is better, the mood is better, the editing is better, acting is better and the chemistry is better. It's not perfect. But it is judged unfairly. It never pretends to be an Oscar movie. It is an average love story. The source material was widely criticized for either promoting abuse of woman, or labeled as being ""mommy porn"". Simply put it is a story written for women by a woman. It is an honest reflection of a character in an unhealthy relationship, with no filters. As a filter obsessed society, we judge when things are without filters, but secretly we crave and embrace the honesty. #NoFilter. Because it was so widely embraced in secret by women, it was labeled as being ""porn"". To make it less, and to make woman feel dirty and pathetic for enjoying it. The story as a whole is a simple love story. A woman falls in love with a man that was deeply scarred as a child. Physically abused by his mothers' boyfriend, abandoned and neglected by his mother. Surviving for 3 days with his mothers corps. Taken in by a loving family. Never dealing with his past, becoming a troubled teenager. Sexually abused and turned into a sadist by an older woman. Heavy stuff. When the only woman that ever saw the real him, runs away in fear. He evolves to win her back(People don't change, they can only evolve). The movie touched on all the topics mentioned above, but in my opinion it wasn't dramatic enough. It never builds, and it kind of falls flat. I have read the books, and I think my expectations were a little high. I expected it to be intense and dramatic, given the subject matter. unfortunately the movie runs horizontal. I would have combined the 2nd and 3rd books. The story line in Darker doesn't have enough substance as a stand alone movie. but having said that it was hot, steamy and sexy. and as a 2nd movie in a trilogy it carries the story forward.",Fifty Shades Darker

Feels like they didn't even attempt to try and do better than the first one. There are about four or five plot holes that had potential but if written well, they would have made it work on screen.Cheesy, terrible and cringe-worthy dialogue. The sex scenes are not sexy, and what makes them even less sexy is the music during the scenes. The MAJOR problem I had with the film is how Anastasia is written. This is yet another weak female character on screen who likes to be bossed around and controlled by Jamie Dornan's character, Christian. If you are fans of the book, I think you might enjoy it but they should have just left them as books.

148,davidsmail008,10 or so fun sex scenes!,10,11 February 2017,"What a person thinks of this movie depends on what he thinks is the intent, if that intent is well-done and whether or not the intent is worth doing in film. In this case, we have 10 or so sex scenes set within a larger drama. The larger drama is the pursuit of the billionaire of Anastasia Steele and the pursuit of the fiction editor where Miss Steele works of her as well.Writers could create a movie of Romeo and Juliet either with or without a sex scene and with differing emphasis on the sex scene. Depending on the depiction of possible sex in Romeo and Juliet, the question would arise as to what intent a writer might have.Is the point of 50 shades darker to tell us the story of the pursuit or to show us the 10 (or so) sex scenes while we think we are seeing the story of the romantic pursuit of Miss Steele?In this case, the background drama is tolerable and somewhat OK . . . and there are 10 or so sex scenes which are intriguing and interesting. The sex scenes include semi-public fondling in an elevator, Anna's stimulation by pleasure balls at a masked ball, the use of a leg restraint to flip over Anastasia to set her up for sex and various shots of Anna in lingerie or nude.I think the plot is mostly dumb, at times somewhat irrational, but the sex and nudity was good and fun . . . and that makes the movie worthwhile, that alone. So, a person might ask, What information is a spoiler for the movie? Is it that Christian Grey asks Steele to marry him and she says yes after holding him in suspense and also believing that he will succeed at being a better person?

155,stanleyjeans,Dornan & Johnson must be regretting this,2,13 February 2017,"My overwhelming emotion upon watching fifty shades darker is embarrassment, embarrassment for the two leading actors being involved in this car crash of a film (or should i say helicopter crash). I can only imagine having to come back and star in and promote such bile for a second time must be even more painful than the first film. I genuinely think Dornan looks embarrassed throughout the film,making it uncomfortable to watch. The image of him inserting the kinky balls of steel (no pun, he actually did) will haunt him for his entire career i am sure Johnson too. The sound track is great and cinematography was good. At one point my mind wandered on how nice the glass was within the office Ana worked at and it was at this point i considered making my run for it out of the cinema, never a good sign that you are thinking of the decor whilst watching a so called erotic film. The sex scenes were really quite tepid,i am sure Mr Grey kept his trousers on for the majority of them ; Most exciting part was wondering if he was going to get his manhood trapped in the zipper of his trousers....... Instead of thinking how steamy it all was i referred back to my constant thought that Mr Dornan must had had written into his contract nudity below the belt must be kept to a minimum, it's a shame Dakota Johnson didn't have the same as her boobies we on show quite a lot, seemed unfair !To be fair to the actors the story is so threadbare that going for a haircut was quite a major scene in the film; There were times within the film that were funny but i'm not sure of they were intentionally written to be; It was quite a cringe feast throughout.Both the main characters have been miscast, Christian Grey needed to be played by a far more sterner, bigger actor than the likable boy next door Dornan, and Ana's character screamed for someone more ..well sexier. I haven't seen Dakota in any other film but i've watched The Fall in which i consider Jamie Dornan to be amazingly brilliant, i don't see how he can flip flop between being so good and so bad; I guess it's down to the script?It's a shame that Fifty shades has been singled out for stardom as there are far better books to draw such saucy screen plays from which actually have a story to them, stories that the actors might actually have some good dialogue to work with.",Fifty Shades Darker

159,jordansanders-92728,Fifty Shades Darker (2017) - Every Shade Of Wrong,1,13 October 2018,"(Sigh).
Oh god, where to begin with this one?Let me start off by saying that the first 'Fifty Shades Of Grey' (2015) wasn't actually all that bad, it wasn't exactly good, not by any stretch of the imagination, but it wasn't the repugnant mess that some, if not most, of us expected it to be.
Weak and uninspiring maybe, but nevertheless a respectable enough adaptation of respectably mediocre source material. So what about the much anticipated (or indeed, dreaded, depending on your particular viewpoint) sequel? Is it a step up, more of the same, or a step down?
Well, let's just say it's certainly not a step up. Though it would be safe to assume that for huge fans of the first, it's successor will prove satisfactory. For the rest of us, however, not so much.If the first film served as nothing more than a two-hour trailer for the second, then the second film serves as nothing more than insipid, tedious filler, preparing us for the third. The story, or at least what masquerades as a story, picks up from the previous film.Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) and Christian (Jamie Dornan) are still separated and in order to win her back, Christian has resorted to turning stalker, pestering her with unwanted gifts and following her to art galleries until she submits to his perturbing charms. If this kind of behaviour is what is now considered desirable then Max Cady must be quite the ladies man...What follows is a series of uninteresting characters placed in uninteresting situations that I won't go into detail on. Those of you who have read the books will already know and those of you who haven't aren't really going to care.The leads themselves are thoroughly unlikable human beings, and their respective performances so hollow and wooden that Pinocchio himself looks every inch the real boy he always hoped he would be, in comparison.No doubt the film is going to illicit some visible cringing and nervous giggles among it's viewers, though not for the reasons you may have expected. No, it's not the provocative sex scenes that prompt this reaction, it's the dialogue. With more cheesy one-liners than a Top Gun reunion, it's almost unfathomable that upon reading the script the actors didn't immediately remove their names from the project. But fair play to them, they persevered and provided us with some much needed comic relief, the fact that it's unintentional is inconsequential as it's by far the most enjoyable part of the film.One shining example comes near the start of the film when Christian enters a restaurant only to find Anastasia engaged in conversation with her employer, Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson). Christian confidently swaggers on over and introduces himself:""I'm the boyfriend.""
Jack's reply: ""Yeah, I'm the boss!""
Hear that sound? No, that's not applause, that's the sound of synchronised face-palming from every member of the audience.It's not quite Woody Allen is it, with some lines even bordering on the ridiculous: ""I was trying to be romantic, but then you distract me with your kinky f**kery!"". Yep, I don't know what that means either...It's hard to tell if this is in fact a serious attempt at an adult-orientated drama or just an 'Airplane'-style parody of other, superior efforts. And if this is the case, then it's surely an underappreciated masterpiece, a dead-pan triumph and a true great of the comedy genre that can rightly take it's place among the likes of 'Blazing Saddles' (1974) and 'The Life Of Brian' (1979). If not, well then it's just plain awful.In fact, it's quite possible to assume that even the film's subject audience may well have had enough after this abysmal attempt, but there is no doubt that despite it's universal hatred and lambasting from critics everywhere that this tripe is going to make a lot of money and thusly, we will most certainly be subjected to a third.However, aside from it's unintentional hilarity and loathsome characters, above all it's main stumbling point is the fact that it's just rather, well, dull...
We anxiously linger on the edge of our seats waiting for something interesting to transpire, only to slump back down in disappointment when it doesn't.The problem is that it can't decide if it wants to be a softcore porn film in the vein of Tinto Brass or a 'Hollyoaks'-esque teen soap opera. Unfortunately in the end it falls short of both.
In fact, it's so over-dramatic and cliched that as the screen fades to black and the end credits roll, you just can't help but envisage the famous 'Eastenders' theme tune playing over the top.It so desperately wants to be cutting-edge and risqué, but it's flaccid attempts at gasp-inducing raunchiness just come across as laughable, especially when it's been done so much better, so many times before. One particular example would be Bernardo Bertolucci's 1972 masterwork 'Last Tango In Paris', which not only puts Fifty Shades to shame in terms of sexual content, but also has the artistic merit and depth to back it up.It's amazing how much sex still sells, particularly when we live in a world with a library of free internet pornography at our fingertips, so if you're that desperate to see some action, just stay at home with your wi-fi and save your hard-earned money. And for the romanticists among you, just buy your spouse some flowers and chocolate for Valentines Day, please don't subject them to this perverse form of punishment. Surely they haven't done anything bad enough to warrant this kind of treatment...The best analogy I can use to sum up 'Fifty Shades Darker' would be to reference a scene from the television series 'Jackass', aptly titled: The Omelette. Those of you old enough, (or juvenile enough, depending on how you see it), to have seen the show will know exactly what I'm referring to. But for those of you who do not, I shall explain, though I warn you, those of you of a weak disposition may want to cease reading any further.What happens is this: Jackass member Dave England eats the ingredients to a delicious omelette one by one before proceeding to vomit it back up into a frying pan, cook it and eat it again. Now, in essence, that's what this film is, a blend of perfectly acceptable ingredients, that taken on their own are fulfilling and satisfactory enough, however when blended together and regurgitated back up, the ensuing mess is not very appealing to say the least.
But nevertheless the movie-going public will happily flock to 'Fifty Shades Darker' in droves to gladly and gleefully gobble down this unappetising muck, the rest of us however, force-fed the junk will be left more than a little nauseated, with a rather unpleasant and bitter taste in our mouths.",Fifty Shades Darker
160,callumkirby,A perfect second installment!,10,19 February 2017,"In the leading up to the release of this movie for the first time in cinema, I worried that it wouldn't be as good as the first one which I thoroughly enjoyed and, sadly, watch on repeat occasionally. When I finally came round to watching it however, it lived up to my expectations and indeed beyond. I feel that in this movie the characters have a lot more personality, living up to their characters. I find the way that the actors portray the characters to be perfect and they really get across who and what the characters are meant to be, bringing out the emotion in all the scenes of the movie. When watching this movie the characters made me laugh, cry and somewhat aroused... The plot itself is also very similar to the book despite the occasional changes here and there. As for the more intense scenes...they definitely get across the mood that's for sure and are done well. All in all I think that this movie definitely lives up to expectations in my personal opinion and moves the movies closer to the finale that I now cannot wait for!",Fifty Shades Darker

I payed to see it on a film channel because I watched Fifty Shades of Grey a few times on Netflix and somehow enjoyed that one. I think mainly because of the music score and scenery, and the first half were the protagonists get to know each other. But this sequel is everything the first film was accused of by most users: flat characters, shallow, not credible, unsexy, booooooring and predictable. There is no build-up to the re-connecting of Christian and Anasasia, he just buys the company she works for and they're together again. Her boss is unbelievably jealous and I have no idea why is interested in Anastasia. Her promotion is ridiculous. Meeting 'Mrs Robinson"" is like a scene from the worst television soap opera and seems to build up to Anastia''s boss and her getting together to plot the downfall of Christian and Anastasia - perhaps a crime/horror film can be made of that but I will not watch it. I have no idea why Christian proposes to Anastasia, why does he want to marry her? What kind of marriage will that be like? it is totally out of character. Unless he locks her up in a play room for the rest of her life for him to do with as he pleases. This film is cringingly bad and cures me completely of any desire to watch number trhee.",Fifty Shades Darker

There is zero chemistry between the leads. They went so far off the true story it isn't even believable and I just cannot believe how bad the acting is!! No wonder people make fun of the movie. The story has potential to be a very twisted yet enthralling love story but sadly it is filled with boring sex scenes and cheesy acting. The scene where Christian thinks Anna is leaving and he gets on his knees and shuts down. It the book it is dramatic and sad and had me in tears. In the movie, I laughed through it because it was that bad!!Sometimes I think if porn movies had more of a plot they might be a little more interesting but after seeing this, I guess not!Thanks for destroying up my favorite books.",Fifty Shades Darker

There are movies that have bad scripts but nice costumes, bad actors but great lines, bad cinematography but great leading actors, bad lines but great cinematography. Those movies are bad but worth watching. This film is just bad. And not just bad, but worthless.

169,henri61,"drab, yet stylish",3,9 February 2017,"This movie is kind of drab and not very believable. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is it for its very stylish look and cinematography. The first movie was better: an innocent girl getting seduced (up to a point) by a handsome and powerful man who is into S&M. In this second installment, the sex scenes are sensual rather than erotic and to people who think this movie promotes abuse of women: there is very little in this movie that can be considered as such; the only guy that is abusive is Anastasia's boss and if anything, this movie shows it as an example of how NOT to treat women.The two main actors are both pleasant eye candy, more so Dakota Johnson, but maybe that's just from my male perspective. Dakota also gives a slightly better acting performance but I didn't sense sufficient chemistry between the two of them. The plot is almost non-existent; there is absolutely no suspense or build-up of any kind. If there were no sex scenes, this would seriously be the worst movie ever. And if they left only the sex scenes and took away everything else, it would be the worst soft-porn movie ever.

171,marmaidtails,Such a shame! Feels like the movie is very loosely based on the books.,2,21 May 2017,"The author and her husband should have let competent and passionate directors and screenwriters do their job because pictures are different than a written story. The books were fine; a decent captivating first person point of view about a gentle feminine character who finds reciprocated love and connection to someone unexpected. None of that translates into the movie. NONE. The female lead comes off as harsh. The binding love is non existent. The current between them, the sensual and carnal love is completely missing. Feels like the movie is only loosely based on the books. To top it all, the things the male lead says and does are simply not in line with his screen character either. He comes off weak, and pathetic, despite Jamie Dornan's attempts to save the day. The movie as it is makes it look like the actors can't act. I bet they were in stitches during shooting. Erika Leonard the author of the books made a 1500 pages long point about the power of connection between two person. She calls it an electrifying current that is in a constant flow between them. Everything else stems from there. They cannot resist one another. They are a slave of this love, cannot get enough of each other, they adore each other. Why is this lost in the screenplay? The screen characters are just lame. Didn't Mr Leonard get the books? Where is the unbearable pain, with the constantly flowing tears brought on by the profound grief of loosing such a love? There is a confusion about the red room too. It should be pretty clear that throughout their relationship its use and meaning transfers as in: ""We aim to please"" for the man. And comes in play in terms of pleasure for the girl propelled by their trusting and overwhelming love for each other. The books are such a success because they portray the binding and transforming power of love, the palpable connection, the never enough pleasing each other, the overwhelming loveliness of each others company! The characters really do care about each other. It is something we all yearn for, appreciate and celebrate, gives meaning to life. Unfortunately it's all lost in the screenplay. FSD gives out mixed messages, dangerous even.There is a profound problem with almost every scene in the movie. Cudos to Bella Heathcote, she was good. Beside money making there should be responsibility in putting novels to screen!",Fifty Shades Darker

If you have read the trilogy of the books I would suggest to watch the movies. They obviously can't fit everything in the movie that is in the book let's be realistic it's never happened and it never will! I don't understand why people who write the reviews that say ""went to this movie as a joke or because I was forced"" and then continue to give a bad review.... you actually sound ridiculous and good for you for doing that to yourself lol. Anybody who is anybody knows what type of movie this is. I would never go to a movie that I knew wasn't in any interest of mine. Aside from all that. I thought the movie was great! They did a really good job of bringing your imagination from the books to the screen. I like FSD the most because it has the most to tell in the trilogy.

Unlike the first film, this one really had a deeper story and more character development. Christian and Ana get back together after breaking up in the first film and rekindle their love for each other, but this time no rules or punishments! I thought this was a great movie and I really enjoyed watching it. There were a few good parts in the book that were left out, but wasn't a big deal in the end.

That's how much I feel for the story of Christian and Ana. Well played by Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson. No this movie isn't for everyone but after having read the books I just had to see how it would be translated onto film. I lit up like a Christmas tree when I saw this. Fast movie. Erotic beyond expectations. So happy to see Christian Grey's transformation. There were two scenes where I cried hard. The director did an excellent job conveying the characters and their situations. No need to give us everything from the books.Busting at the seams in anticipation for Fifty Shades Freed. Excellent job by all cast and crew.

Only premature boys rate this movie low because they don't have enough life experience. I wont spoil the movie because it deserves to be seen in theaters. All I say is that there is scene in middle of the movie which is one of the greatest scenes ever created. Director has outdone himself and acting is Oscar worthy. Dakota Johnson nuanced character study is a stand out. I have never before wrote a review but I after seeing all the bad reviews I had to do it.

I was looking forward to the Lelia aspect in this movie as well as the Jack creepy boss issue. I thought throughout the movie it was all rushed, only briefly encountered these story lines and I felt let down.

Christian (Jamie Dornan) finally realized that he could not let Anastasia (Dekota Johnson) go. He fought for her with Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson) and Elena (Kim Basinger).This movie is more focused on Christians past and what turned him into the person he is, he opens up to Anastasia slowly but surly and lets her touch his scared body.Christian wakes up due to a nightmare in one wholesome scene and Anastasia attends to him with comfort, this kind of made him realize how much of an impact Ana has on him AND his life, so he asks her to marry him!This movie definitely has its wholesome moments unlike the first move (fifty shades of grey)",Fifty Shades Darker

I didn't have high expectations going in due to some of the poor reviews but I left feeling satisfied and entertained. Dakota and Jamie DO have amazing chemistry despite what others have written. She is a much better written character in this story than the first and he is also much more realistic in the sense that he seems like he could actually exist (the first movie was very unrealistic to the point of laughable) I liked the dark twists in this one and they all led to an important part in the story. I.E. The helicopter scene was a bit cheesy but they needed to write that in to have Anna's character realize she can't live without him. It could've been a car crash or something a bit more realistic considering he's walking into his apartment hours later. But whatever! This is an erotica/fantasy/drama and it's made for you to escape your reality for 2 hours. These two have gorgeous bodies and amazing chemistry and the story is fun and entertaining. What more do you want from an erotica/fantasy/drama? Geez. Everyone needs to relax and let go from all the uptight expectations for this type of film.

The girl that's in the trailer has no impact in the movie. It's once again just about sex and a bad... really bad written movie.The soundtrack can be said that's decent. Some of the camera work as well is good. But that resumes all the movie. It's once again a bait for teenagers girls that want to go watch soft porn in the cinemas once again.Sorry to be really straight to the point here, but if you really liked this movie maybe you have some issues.. or it's me?",Fifty Shades Darker
199,georgia-pemberton,Why is everyone acting like this film is awful?,6,17 February 2017,"Okay!! we get it, the fifty shades series isn't the most groundbreaking films to ever be made, but why is everyone being SO hard on it, its not that bad, honestly its not. I watched this film on valentines day, (even my boyfriend didn't hate it) overall everyone in the cinema seemed pretty happy with the film. The film picks up from where the first film was left, the film sticks pretty close to the novel which was nice to see. this film for me was an improvement on the first one, probably down to the fact James Foley directed this one, once again the cinematography was absolutely beautiful, i take my hat off to John Schwartzman. The soundtrack to both of this films so far have been excellent and fitted in with the plot perfectly. the on screen chemistry between the two main characters Christian and Ana i feel is better in the second one, the film starts with Christian trying to fix his mistakes and goes on to Ana dealing with issues from his past. We get to know the characters a lot more in this film as Christian opens up more to Ana and shows his vulnerable side. and the DRAMA follows. okay here it is.. the sex scenes... are... better? i thought they were less awkward in this film, and sexier, Dakota seems to be more comfortable on screen with the nudity now which makes the scenes a lot easier to watch. overall this film is well made, funny, dramatic and romantic. 6.5/10Forget everything you have heard about this film and watch it with an open mind, who knows, you might even like it.",Fifty Shades Darker
200,sgbelverta,Fun chick flick,9,10 February 2017,"I enjoyed the movie. It's definitely a chick flick. 80% of the people at my showing were female. While critics have complained about the acting and script, my complaint was make-up and set design.The Christian Grey character now has a scruffy face. I'm not a fan, but a lot of people like that look. The problem is, the scruff varied wildly in the film, both in length and color. Now if the time period between scenes was days or weeks, this isn't a problem. If the time period is a few hours, there should be little change. I found I could tell when episodes were filmed just by looking at the scruff. The make-up department wasn't looking at stills from previous filming to match things up.The set design was also irritating. The Christian Grey penthouse seemed to have undergone a complete redecoration between book 1 and book 2. Same with Anastasia's apartment. This is such a silly error. Look at stills from first film, rebuild, use on second film.",Fifty Shades Darker
201,spore_forever,Mediocre,1,12 February 2017,"To begin with, I believe the second part was 1 pct better than the previous one. The acting was awful in this part too, same goes for the story. Females find this movie kind of attractive, well some of them. This may be a result of their hidden, unfulfilled desires or something, something that we, mortals, can't understand...b*lls**t in one word. When the expectations are so high, u don't come up with a movie like this with such poverty regarding actors, scenes, intrigue etc. The parody of the first part was better by far and that was a bad, very bad movie. Can't wait for the second part parody, bad as the previous ofc but better than FSD for sure.P.S. If a girl gets beaten hard, cruelly (regarding same methods shown in this ""masterpiece"") by some ordinary dude, that is called violence but if a girl gets beaten by a multimillionaire dude, that's love!I suppose I've said it all.

203,bgmsimmons,Fantastic.,10,15 February 2017,"This movie was fantastic, I think that may even be an understatement. James Foley has upgraded everything that we were looking for in the first movie. The script comes in with great witty one liners and the amount of sex scenes that should have been originally given in the first movie. Both Dakota and Jamie bring a new side to their characters, a better side. This movie keeps with drama, romance, sex, thrills, and even comedy. It's one movie filled with a lot of genres. If you are a lover of the books, you won't be disappointed. Some people may be offended by the explicit scenes and not so ""vanilla"" sex. If you're comfortable with sexuality, you will very much enjoy it in its entirety. A lot of people think Ana is a weakling and Christian is a dominant, but you have to see beyond what people are commenting on. She is a confident young woman who makes sure Christian knows how she feels. The soundtrack is also fantastic and perfectly fitting. All in all. 10/10!!!",Fifty Shades Darker

I miss lot of the scenes from the book for example, the auction scene, the scene there they go to this hotel to stay cause Leila has been in the apartment. But Foley had done great with what he had, and the actors performance was funny, cute and just fantastic. Dakota and Jamie is doing a fantastic job with a bad script from my point of view.

They rewrote every scene where they could have made it so good with the original scene from the book. I was most disappointed by the scene where Ana says she can't be everything Christian needs, with the proposal and all, because that was my favorite scene from the book. They wrecked it.

People who haven't read the books and fallen in love with these characters will just not understand. I love the fact that you get to see the relationship of Ana and Christian grow in this film. It's way more steamy and intimate and loving and that is what really did it for me in this one.

Boy is this film stale bread! Clunky and ridiculous. Dakota needs to take a page from Marcia Gays book she can actually cry when required not just scrunch her face up like a discarded chocolate bar wrapper. Kim Basinger should have been in it more...you have a diamond like her and show her off for 30secs at the end, tut tut! I was surprised Kim B was in it actually being the star of 9 1/2 weeks and fifty shades being a complete rip off of it, as well as the Secretary of course. There's definitely some other films thrown in there. I think that's where the author got her inspiration, a girls night in with a bottle of red, an ip dip do on chick flicks laced with James Spader and Mickey Rouke...and maybe a secret Santa joke present in the form of a vibrator. Jamie Dornan is an Irish dream boat, he's still developing as an actor but he predominantly carries the film. That's why he has to be so ripped, hes just dragging the whole thing behind him..'come on Dakota, pick up your lip its causing drag, Rita...where are you going? Stop running around in circles and get back here', ""Hi, Ho, Hi Ho"" JamieI think this film restricts his potential and its a shame his interactions with Marcia and Kim couldn't have been longer, as i think we could have seen the dual personality of this potentially good and complex character.

218,chengedmund,Dull.,2,2 March 2017,"Well ..... (if you haven't yet seen it but intend to, best to look away now). Might I say that the romance between Jack & Rose, in ""Titanic"" (1997), was FAR MORE CAPTIVATING, than this 2nd installment of the ""Fifty Shades"" franchise. According to an IMDb peer reviewer, this movie actually went nowhere. ""This movie is awful, yes, that's the best way to describe this movie. Acting, terrible, the story does not make sense. It's just about sex, and a bad, really poorly written script"" (you're better of just watching reruns of soap operas, such as the ""The Bold & the Beautiful (1987-)""/ ""Days of our lives"" (1965-), or even ""Passions"" (1999-2007) for free on the telly. ""The soundtrack stood out, and the cinematography is decent. But once again, its a film baiting TEENAGE GIRLS, to go watch (soft porn) in the movie theater (a second time around""). Its just a shame that the lead couple (Dakota Johnson, ""Anastasia Steele"", and Jamie Dornan, ""Christian Grey"") were handed such a boring script (I'm looking at you, Mr Niall Leonard. I don't care if you're married to the author of the books). No character development. And a really dull plot. No twists. No suspense. Viewers have had better sex elsewhere. Finally, KIM BASINGER: HOW DARE SHE BE CAST IN SUCH A TERRIBLE ROLE !! She was Hollywood's DARLING of the 1980s/1990s !! Batman's box office love interest !! I don't care how much she's aged !! Quite disrespectful, in casting her as an ""undesirable"" (same deal with Bella Heathcote - just so terribly underused). Instead of providing a rating, I'll propose a more appropriate title: ""FIFTY SHADES 2: THE VIRTUE, OR IGNORANCE OF RICH PEOPLE AGONIZING OVER LIPSTICK MARKS ON THEIR CHEST"". Plus the film would've worked (much, much better) as a comedy. Think Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"" (2006). I'm actually not joking about this.

I really LOVE Christian and Ana's relationship. I love seeing it evolve on the screen. I really enjoyed seeing more of Christian's turmoil and willingness to try to work on his ""mommy"" issues. I will say that the lipstick scene made me laugh out loud though. **Possible Spoilers below*** The movie wasn't exactly like the book, but touched on almost everything. I did not feel like I missed anything important from book. If I had to give one suggestion, I would have just said to add more in depth, longer scenes to the more important scenes. The scene where Christian ""submits"" to Ana was so emotional in the book. I would have loved to see MORE during that scene. It just didn't last long enough to give it the impact that it deserved.

But the SECOND MOVIE was BETTER. However, if most of you keep rating it at 1 means that you cannot accept that something bad can become good. I went to the movie and I said to myself that everyone is laughing/ criticizing/ hating it because they all expect a masterpiece of whatever they believe it should be, but do not think for one second that the movie is mainly how the book is. Books are not complex and the adventurous part is kinda missing. Thus, THIS MOVIE, tried to make the best of it, with some errors, though. 1. It did create emotion and it was sexy. Ana was sexy!Christian was OK. Also, they cannot focus much on his character because the books are always about Ana, Ana, Ana... 2. It was funny, some stupid dialogues which could have been replaced or shortened, but it also had scenes that made you smile and see that they tried to do better. 3. There is vanilla sex in this part of the movies because this is how the book is. The kinky/dark part was in the 1st book, which, as we know, the movie failed to bring it. 4. Stop being so harsh! This is it.

(I'm leaning towards bad right now).The movie did not follow the book; they combined many scenes into one sequence, then again on others. This also happened in the first movie, and I know the screenwriters need to consolidate things from a book, but really! Why did they make it feel so rushed? I mean- REALLY RUSHED. And CHOPPY. I have been to plenty of movies of the same length that felt so much more cohesive than this- it's almost hard to describe. It was like there was one 5 second scene from one part in the book, then seconds later Ana and Christian are somehow transported to the next scene in the book, 5 seconds of that, and then the next scene- through the entire movie. Nothing felt smooth or seemed to make sense. I actually think there was more dialog in the first film. There were parts of the book that had more feeling and connection. The scenes that should have been given weight to them did not have that, so that even when love is professed, you wouldn't know it to watch the movie.(As in- wait- did they just have a big moment in their relationship??)Trivia note: I did notice that Dakota used a scene from her mom when she was in the movie ""Working Girl."" I just happened to see that movie recently and noticed the scene where Ana is taking Jack's place and talks to her administrative assistant; the assistant asks her what she should call Ana now. The next lines are the same as her mom's from when she met her new assistant.The new characters are not explored at all and Kate's brother Ethan does not even show up as a character in this movie. Overall, I was really disappointed in how choppy and rushed the whole movie seemed. I would gladly have sat in the theater for 20-30 minutes longer if it meant that we got to see better character development. The book's dialog is terrible too, but at least there was a feeling that there was a connection between Ana and Christian. I wasn't expecting an Oscar winner going in to the theater- just an entertaining 2 hours, but wow- I left feeling like I wasn't even entertained.

Aesthetically, there were some redeeming qualities. The cinematography was actually pretty good. Crisp, clear shots. Decent set-up. Beautiful outdoor shots. The music was passable, though not as good as the music in the original. Hair, make-up and wardrobe were good. However, while no movie can include everything from the book,this movie is a long advertisement for the book. Here are some scene teasers- read the book to find out what really happened. It seemed very fly by night in it's assembly. Oh- don't forget to touch on this, spend 30 seconds on that..... The acting was perfunctory at best. Not that Jaime Dornan can act his way out of a paper bag on a really good day, but there seemed to be a ""phone it in"", ""let's get this over with"", quality to everyone's performance. When Marcia Gay Harden isn't convincing, there's a problem. There were a lot of really good, experienced actors in the supporting cast who were underutilized with their 5-7 total lines each. I don't think throwing Mrs. Jones 2 lines added much to the plot. Dakota Johnson did what she could with what she had to work with, but unfortunately the script was even worse than the dialog in the book. The sex scenes were bland, lacking chemistry. Whereas the first movie took it's time to set up the tone and mood for the scenes, this movie was more like- oh yea, in the book they have sex now so let's write in a quick scene before the next crisis happens.

236,labrowneyez5494,Fifty Shades Of Grey Sequel Isn't Much,8,8 October 2017,"Like most sequels, it's not quite as good as the original film. I enjoyed it overall, but I could have waited for the video.I read both books and saw both movies. As entertainment, the acting is OK, the plot holds some glamorous locations and experiences that are inspiring and interesting, and its true to the book's plot.As a romance for two consenting adults to view (it is rated R) it may nice to spark up a romance for a couple or be entertaining as relationship fantasy escape (certainly not dull or boring to date a young handsome billionaire).As an ethical or moral influence on younger women, I can't recommend it for teenage girls as I think it's unrealistic about the dark side of his sexual desires and foibles of his wealth and power (in other words, I think she's lucky didn't get hurt or killed messing around with him. Won't plot spoil though).Enjoy for what it's worth.",Fifty Shades Darker

That was painful, and I don't mean in that good, just got spanked way.Worst screenplay adaptation ever, worst dialog, worst cinematography, and worst direction. They couldn't even keep the staging of interiors consistent - this supposedly takes place a WEEK after the first movie! I can't fault the acting, they had absolutely nothing to work with, in fact I'm impressed they managed the dialogue without throwing up. The only redeeming quality, Jaimie Dornan's very buff, naked body.Really disappointing, and I loved the books and the first movie.

I saw the first movie in theaters and was totally disappointed but the trailer for this movie made me think it was going to be better. It wasn't. The scenery was beautiful and the soundtrack was great but the acting and story line were total crap. Scenes that are supposed to be totally intense are monotone and boring. This story is supposed to be filled with emotion. It's supposed to have screaming and yelling, fighting and making up. It's supposed to be intense. Instead all you get are a ton of scenes with boobs and the actor supposedly having sex with his pants on. People like this story because it's a bit kinky but it's still a story that needs to be told. I felt they left out pretty much everything that makes this story likable and what was left barely made sense. If you haven't read the books you most likely won't know what's going on. Just for reference the theater was mostly empty. Maybe 20 people watching on opening weekend Saturday night. Several people kept checking their phones and one lady was asleep when the lights came on at the end. They fooled my twice. I won't be back to see any future movies from this story line.

It's easy watching and whilst I agree he can be a bit wooden at times, I think that's the point of his character. He's not comfortable with emotion! I think it's an easy watching love story and shows how two people develop and compromise when they love each other. Yes, it will never win awards but it is enjoyable.

The movie is just wonderful and it's way better than Grey even though I loved it as well. The acting is much better with more chemistry. The music is great and it fits the scenes like a glove. The new look of Jamie is way hotter with that scruff and Ana's one is great too. Now a big WARNING FOR SPOILERS !!!!: I fell in love with all of scenes, they were well made without missing the essential elements of the story from the book. I loved the scene with Ana, Leila and Christian.. It was wonderful and how Leila knelt and the acting was very good but I wanted it to be longer even though I know they had to put many events with a limited time. The intimate scenes were very sexy and sensual with the suiting music, it was very beautiful. Now, what I didn't like was a part from the scene when Christian goes into the submissive mode and how Ana reacted, it was missing something.. I wanted more from him and her, more reactions and emotions. Apart from this it was just perfect for me as reader of the books. An advice for those who haven't watched it yet, never listen and judge before seeing it, give it a try and the decide. The movie is excellent and more than enough for the fans of the books.

It had all of the romance, emotion, suspense & of course the sex that the first one lacked. Great job with the screenplay because trying to get everything from the book into a 2 hour movie would dilute the story too much , so I understand why certain characters or stories were left out or changed. Would have maybe touched base with the psychiatrist as a character in the movie so you could truly understand how much emotional effort Christian is making to change for the better . I'm not quit sure why the critics are so harsh. Maybe they just don't understand the premise of this beautiful unique love story. Look ... this isn't supposed to be an academy award nominated movie, if you want that , then def see Lion, ( which absolutely deserves to win for best picture) . In any case , I enjoyed this movie much more then some of the critically acclaimed movies that I went to because of the critic's ratings. That's why if you ??Christian & Anastasia's love story then you will absolutely enjoy this movie. It went by fast, was a fun movie to see & like the books , I was sad it was over. I would even see it again . Def will purchase it when it comes out on DVD.",Fifty Shades Darker

Attempt has been made to give this a thriller feel but it is without any and i mean any subtleties. It is a series of glossy videos where the soundtrack directs the audience to the plot and how they should respond. In showing last night audience were laughing out loud at the dialogue frequently and {spoiler} the scene post helicopter crash there were gasps of disbelief at the rapid turn of events.

255,longanimald,God awful,1,20 March 2017,"This one... The problem is they portray men as weak unless they are constantly having sex, and women are weak if they're not always bending to their partner's every will. They say BDSM should always be flaunted and proud of. It's also offensive to rape victims. You know how abuse and rape should be treated with care and respect? Well, this messes that up. It basically says that if you walk in on your parents having sex, you've been raped and scarred for life. That is stupid. So because this guy walked in on his parents having sex, he has to abuse his girlfriend in order to get it up? I mean, who needs a loving, caring, stable, healthy relationship when you can have glorified rape? The soundtrack is terrible, the acting is terrible, the whole ""Masquerade Ball"" thing reminds me of gross underground human trafficking dungeons, the messages are terrible, the characters are terrible, and the fact that this started as a Twilight fan fiction is kind of speaking for it's quality. And the worst thing is, this setup would have worked if it was a horror movie. But this is a romance that glorifies rape and pokes fun at actual rape victims.

257,maxrau,A series of random and repetitive scenes cut together,2,5 March 2017,"Before I start going reviewing this one: I didn't watched the first one because of the enormous negative critiques and the fact that it sheds the wrong light on real BDSM practices. So the second one I watched, but only because my SO insisted to watch it with me. She read the book and everything and summarized the story of the first one in 15! seconds.But what then happens is beyond good or evil. There is practically no story. It is just predictable random scenes cut together to achieve movie length. It is meeting again + kiss, instant sex (because otherwise it would have been boring if she would really challenge him), some random party scenes, more boring sex, another scene were he crashes (he returns like Iron Man asking: What are you doing here? Not even a facial expression, which marks the peek of bad acting in this movie and how bad the writing of the dialogues is). + more sex. There are so many logical mistakes and the cringe factors, especially of the dialogues lets me give it 2 stars instead of just one. If you have at least some movie brain you will uncover constantly mistakes made by the director, cutter, writer or by the actors. So I got at least some entertainment back by spotting them. Thank god I have a GF which sees its the same and allows me to make jokes throughout the movie otherwise I would have left after 20 minutes. Finally, watching this with 15 or 16 years depending how it is age rated in your region, I can almost assume that it gives you the picture/creates a narrative that you have to be a total unromantic spoiled brat to be successful and that this, the way the movie shows it, is the way to treat a women once you have established some connection to her. I almost would have gone more into political aspects or social power relations of this movie here but it is not worth my time and also I guess people are not so interested in this aspects anyway. Throughout the whole movie I was thinking, it would be worth more spending the movie time at home cooking a dinner for your SO than spending money and time on this garbage. The producers should shame themselves and donate some money to real victims of domestic violence and cure for drug addiction. P.S. It was my first review here.",Fifty Shades Darker

This is a huge credit to the change of director I feel. It created a much stronger engagement in all scenes of the film, not just the sex. Congratulations to the director, it really is a great film that I thoroughly enjoyed watching. Please direct the next instalment. :) It was touching to see how the characters really open up, and you feel their frustration, especially Ana. The camera close ups were very much one in which you can't look away. Put it this way, halfway through the film I needed to go to the toilet but I held it cause I wasn't going to miss one second of the film.

Back to my point the first film was a let down after much of the characters lacked development, walking in to this film I didn't expect all to much from it and then WHABAM! Our socks were knocked off, breath taken away, and yes very intreaged by the plot line and set design! This film did it for me, a hard core 50 shades Christian Grey fan.

267,nicoleturco,Better than the first...,6,10 February 2017,"I've read all 3 books as well as the ""4th"" one entitled Grey (all in Christians perspective) and I've got to say that the first movie was somewhat of a let down, but this one was not as bad. In the first movie I didn't feel chemistry between Ana and Christian. I felt that it was very awkward and cold. I also didn't think that the actors who were playing these roles really suited the characters that were portrayed in the books. But, with that being said, after watching the second one my opinion has slightly changed. This time around, I found that there was way more chemistry between Ana and Christian, it is very noticeable. Maybe it's all of the x-rated scenes they must endure together, but the shift between Ana and Christian is pleasing to watch. The acting is not as great. There were times where I found myself shaking my head or nodding in awkwardness as I watched the actors recite some phrases and thinking to myself why? Dakota Johnson is a great actress and you could really see her growth and potential in this movie. Jamie Dornan has a great body, but his acting was just OK. Better than the first, but still OK and at times- un Christian-like. It was sustainable, not awful. I think that the main issue with the movie is the terrible transitioning. Some parts of the film were a bit choppy where they would cut from scene to scene- this was most likely done because of time constraint but I think that for the third film they need to have a better way of cutting and jumping from each scene. I think that if I didn't read the novels I would have rated this higher. I went with a friend who has only made it to chapter 3 in the first book and she found the movie to be great- loved the drama and excitement that this movie gave, unlike the first and wants to go back again to watch it. Overall, the movie is not bad- could be better, but not waste of money bad. If you're a fan of the franchise I would recommend the watch, but if you're just someone who wants to watch a movie on a Saturday night just because, I'd say go for something else.",Fifty Shades Darker

Jamie Dornan really upped his A game and his body was smoking hot. The tough sexy strong Christian Gray we asked for from the first film showed up and brought it all.

Waiting years and it looked like the director didn't even bother to read the books, went short on money and they forgot to hire a writer to finish the script. Plus the actress needs some acting classes or stop acting all together because my God she was like a birth control pill.I personally think that the first one was a much better produced and the chemistry between the character was more realistic.

I usually watch sci-fi and thrillers but i got really tired of this genres in the last couple of years. In days when almost every major film is about a super-hero, there comes this Erotic romantic tale about two different people who are willing to give anything just to be with each other. Dornan and Dakota are both very talented, and their background story is really interesting. I didn't find anything wrong with the film besides the obvious stuff. The film is just good for what it is. It's not an action movie, it's a romantic drama. It was well shot, well edited, has a great cinematography and cool cool cool soundtrack. Don't miss this one and don't listen to the hype.

It lost the feminine touches from a female director and female script writer. Also gone are the artistic cinematography, well lit set and breathtaking Seattle/Vancouver landscape. Erotic scenes felt blunt and impassionate unlike the first trilogy where they were wittier and more fervent. Story makes no sense, it felt rushed and lacked of any development and depth. As someone who had not read the book, I expected a rewrite that accommodates a broader audience but instead they made an exact adaption from the book for the fans. I understand the fascination from the fans but for the others, we got lost into small plots that were not even logical. And missed opportunities on not focusing more into Grey's inner world and his relationship with the other female villains!",Fifty Shades Darker
272,dreamn-50056,Great addition,10,13 February 2017,"I seriously loved this one as much as the first one! It was so good. Not as many sex scenes but it more of a romantic this time around. Loved it. I love Christian and Anstasia's acts in this movie. This one ends up being like a fairy tale. There were points of sadness, laughter, and suspense. The ending ended so abruptly so now it will have me anxiously waiting until the next one comes out! Obviously there will be another because of the way it ended. The scenes the acting, everything was well done. I wish for more dirty scenes as thats the parts that Christain is so Hot. I absolutely can not wait for the next 50 Shades to come out.",Fifty Shades Darker
273,rondever,Am i in mad city?! This movie is great!,10,13 February 2017,"I never review films because i think it's pretty much a waste of time, but never in my life i saw such a negative reaction for a beautiful and romantic film. I still remember seeing the first one - 'Fifty shades of Grey' and it was totally different than anything else i've seen before. I don't remember when was the last time that an erotic film made such a lot of money.. well, never! I'm sorry, i'm a movie fan and i've seen many films over the years. Some films are really bad (""Dragonball Revolution"" for example), but Fifty shades darker is just not one of them. The movie is funny, touching, dramatic when needed to be and overall a great experience. I really don't understand the negative reaction that this movie gets. I don't think that i'm going to be in line for the new Lego movie... i kinda lost interest in this kind of things when i was 12 years old. Give Fifty shades darker a chance, the negative comments are totally misleading and the movie itself is really cool.",Fifty Shades Darker
274,laura-85117,Great movie.. if you have read the books,9,13 February 2017,"So this movie has received much criticism... But i don't think it deserves it. Yes i see why people think it's bad, but many people judge it without reading the books. If you have not read the books, then you are missing a lot of details, and therefor the movie can seem meaningless. But a big part of this book/ movie, is not just about the sex and romance, but about Christians process. How he is at first, and how he develop personally. People are expecting this movie to be thrilling and other than just romance and sex. But when you haven't read the books, it's hard to see the big picture. I also think that's what they could have done better, they could have included his psychologist, so people so haven't read the books could get a climb of Greys thoughts. But people should read the books before watching the movie, then they can see that it is actually a really fun and great movie!",Fifty Shades Darker
275,maganalson,May contain spoilers,1,13 February 2017,"Unlike the first movie, this one's pacing felt choppy. And why did it contain so many plot holes? I know they switched directors, but did they change the screenwriter as well? The movie appeared as if it were written by someone who took up screen writing the week before filming began. Seriously, some of the scenes lacked proper transition, flow, and some scenes were so damn awkward that they were almost too painful to watch. The dialogue felt constricted and seemed unrealistic at times. And unlike the first movie's intimate scenes, the sex scenes in Fifty Shades Darker just felt flat and played out more like an unedited video from Pornhub rather than a major film production. Had I not seen the first film, I would've blamed the terrible execution of this movie on the actors. But, it's obvious they tried and unfortunately failed because they had to do the best they could with the meek script provided.",Fifty Shades Darker
276,olgpars,"Great, funny, sexy, romantic. The haters really lost their mind on this one!",10,14 February 2017,"Hey everyone, i just came back from cinema and thought i should right a review about the film. First of all, i did enjoy it very much. I'm really into romantic movies, i usually enjoy action films but my female- friend dragged me to see FSD because she thought i would like it. it's really hard for me to admit it, i am a man and i have an ego 24/7 but this time i have to put that aside and be honest with myself... it is a good movie It's not too dramatic, it's more about entertainment and joy. I had one experience with soft BDSM in my life, and it was very similar to what Anastasia experience with mister Grey. I had that routine once, it was weird but pleasure. The movie had some surprising moments (the shot, the helicopter etc), i really didn't see it coming. I don't understand why some people are so offended from the film. it's definitely not anti-feminist. Anastasia is in a complete control over what's happening and she is not forced to do anything out of her own will. She is a free woman from beginning to end. Overall, watching 'Fifty shades darker' was a very special and different experience and i do recommend it very much. (especially if you are a couple) 10 out of 10!",Fifty Shades Darker
277,solveigfossum,Must watch!,9,14 February 2017,"This movie should be on your watch list! The second movie in The Fifty Shades series contains most of the important content from the book. The only disappointing part was that there were a little bit less sex scenes than expected. Other than that this is a great movie with action, drama and romance.We see a softer and more vulnerable side of Christian Grey. He also let us know more about his past and how this affects his life today. Both Anastacia and the viewers fall in love with this new side of Christian.I give this movie a nine out of ten for hitting most of content from the book. It could have gotten ten out of ten if there were a little bit more of the sex scenes. If you were disappointed with the first movie, you should definitely give this movie a second chance.

The movie is a perfect adaptation of the books. The story for me is a broken man with a rough past who has his whole life changed by the love of one woman. Parts of his past threaten to break them. Lots of information from the books has to be left out, but overall I thought the movie was fabulous. Much love to E.L. James for writing these.",Fifty Shades Darker

The second movie in my opinion is way better than the first, but of course it doesn't follow the book word for word just like most movies that were created after a book. I definitely look forward to the last movie!!",Fifty Shades Darker

281,shepherdcj,Pure escapism,9,16 February 2017,"Fifty Shades Darker is an improvement on its predecessor. It's is meant to provide simple escapism, a light titillating fantasy and is not trying to be an epic, deep film full of luvvies out doing each other to land an Oscar! The movie was amusing at times and had quite a few scenes which were very easy on the eye. The group of friends I watched the film with all felt it to be better than the last offering and all enjoyed the experience. As you would expect the screening we attended was an all female affair which isn't surprising. I have to say what has surprised me is the amount of negative reviews here from people who apparently didn't like the first movie at all, so they went to see the second?!! If you didn't like it last time why on earth did they expect it to be more deep and meaningful this time? Do they not know what the story entails? Maybe they should refrain from viewing the third film.....a little tip here ...Fifty shades Freed is more of the same kind f thing! Life is too short if it's not your thing so maybe give it a miss. I for one look forward to watching it.",Fifty Shades Darker

I can't believe how well Jamie & Dakota played their characters compared to the first movie. In the first one you could tell that both Jamie & Dakota were nervous, uncomfortable didn't have a connection that you think they would have had and didn't really play their roles very well, but that cannot be said about the sequel, brilliant acting from both Jamie & Dakota and better story line and such a great connection between the two actors. In this movie we find out more about Christians past and he starts opening up to her more, it's not about the sex in this movie, it's about the love they have for each other and their relationship. Yes there are still hurdles in their relationship but that does not stop them from being together.

283,johnbelbi,People have completely lost their mind on this beautiful film!,10,19 February 2017,"'Fifty shades darker' is A sequel to the novel based ""fifty shades of grey"" from 2 years ago. The story is focusing on Anastasia and Christian's relationship and all of their surrounding. What can i say, i went to see the film only to figure out what is all the hype about, and i was convinced that it's going to be a disaster made specifically for young women and fantasy camps. I have to admit - i was 100% wrong. the movie was great! first of all, you can't ignore the cinematography, the landscapes, the beautiful production. Secondly, i really loved the two main characters. I saw dakota johnson in another film last year and she was charming and cute as hell. The actor, Dornan, is an interesting guy. Their love story is unique and special, and doesn't resemble anything else i've seen in cinema over the last few years. I'm really fed up with all these super-hero trash that dominant the box office. It's time for a different kind of dominant if you know what i mean :) 'Fifty shades darker' is a fantastic film, very misunderstood for some,but i guess it's the right film for the right people. It hide it's message deep in side, underneath the surface. I give it an A+!",Fifty Shades Darker
284,metshardcore,Worst. Movie. Ever.,1,19 February 2017,"My title is honesty. Of the thousands of movies I've seen, this is by far, the WORST one EVER. I can't even think of another movie that would be a close second.Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan's acting skills are so bad that they make the performances by Ian Ziering and Tara Reid in the ""Sharknado"" movies seem Oscar worth. If you mix in the awful acting with a terrible script, putrid directing and the most unrealistic story line ever written this is what you get.The only saving grace for this review is the fact that IMDb won't let me give less than 1 star.Save your money and don't waste the nearly two hours of hour life. Those two hours could be used for something better like watching paint dry.",Fifty Shades Darker

I have to say that i'm totally and 100% in love with Anastasia's character, she is so amazing! Dakota did a great job here. Dornan is a very good actor, he portrays Christian in a very convincing way. I'm so sick and tired of the all latest blockbusters, how much more can we suffer from those childish super heroes films? Enough is enough, and we need to grow up. Many people assume that the movie is about the sex, no it is really not. The sex is a metaphor for Christian's problematic personality, and it's Anastasia's job to lead him the way to happy life. If you look carefully between the lines, this movie is really about him. The BDSM is kind of sick but what can i say, there are enough BDSM communities in the world to justify this weird sex. There's no abuse in this film, Anastasia is at 100% control the whole time. Don't let the media fool you, don't let those macho guys, Haters, Ego-based maniacs to tell you that the movie is bad. ""Fifty Shades Darker"" is a great film, it's nothing like what i've seen in the last couple of years in the cinema and i totally recommend it.",Fifty Shades Darker

Lesson: if you're rich, you get everything, even a sex slave. That is literally everything from the movie. I rarely say a movie is bad, but this movie is so bad that I even hate it.

I will be buying the video. I can't wait for Fifty Shades Freed. I loved the quote Ana used about the assistant not having to fetch her coffee unless she was getting some for herself and expecting her to call her Ana and the rest they would make up as they went along. I knew right away Tess McGill had said that in Working Girl and that Tess is Melanie Griffith who is Dakota's Mom. Kudos for putting that line in there. Loved it!,Fifty Shades Darker
288,jwilliamscomputergeek,It was better than the first movie,7,25 February 2017,So first off I will start off by saying that I have read all three books so whenever I find out there is going to be a movie version I always want to see how the visual turned out. So I will start out with the good. I'll just say SPOILER ALERT!! In case I give anything away so here we go.GOOD: The story and the acting was better. I say that because I felt that while Dakota Johnson did well in the first one I felt Jamie Dornan's was a little stiff at times in the first one. I thought his acting was better in this one and Dakota did a good job in this one as well. I thought they did a good job with the story involving Leila and Jack Hyde and that the actors playing them did a good job as well. They also made sure to add some good key moments from the book into the movie. The scene with him working out...nice!THE BAD: They could of did a better job of editing. The transition from one scene to another was not always the best. I also felt and SPOILER ALERT!! I felt like they left a moment out that would have those who did not read the books understand a little more why he doesn't like to be touched. I think the audience got some idea of just how hard it is to have someone touch him on certain area's of his body during the lipstick scene but I still would have liked to see a little more dialogue happen between Christian and Ana on that subject but they may elaborate on it more once Fifty Shades Freed come out (fingers crossed). I felt that they had Kim Basinger looking a little sloppy especially during the Masquerade Ball. For anyone who read the books Elena's character was described as looking sexy and elegant. The had her looking like a waitstaff during the Ball. I felt the scene where Christian let Ana touch him was a little rushed. The way he played the scene when she was using the lipstick should have been played the same way when he finally let her touch him. I also felt like the scene when he was missing could have been longer as well. I also felt like some of the love scenes were a bit cheesy...although I did like the one when he introduced her to the silver balls. I thought Dakota did a pretty amusing job in that scene.Despite the bad I still enjoyed the movie and the love story that is Ana and Christian.,Fifty Shades Darker

290,dolceamoreserten,Watched several times,10,1 March 2017,"I feel like the people who wrote a negative review for this film have not read any of the books. For those saying that Anastasia is too shy, awkward, etc, that's how she's supposed to be. In the book, they describe her character as the awkward-clumsy type of girl. I overall thought that this movie was great. It was a thriller/romance/slight comedy all in one. There were scenes that made the crowd gasp; Leila pulling the trigger and Christian almost dying in that plane crash created suspense within the film. In terms of comedy, there were lines that Anastasia said that gave the audience a giggle (i.e. silver balls scene). And for those saying that they don't have chemistry.. are you kidding? Maybe it's just me but I sometimes wonder how they don't develop feelings while shooting this movie. It may be acting but the feelings they portray seem so real. This movie is definitely unpredictable. You can't really predict what will happen in Fifty Shades Freed; obviously Jack Hyde will seek revenge, but what about Leila? Will she also seek revenge? Mrs. Robinson? Also, that slapping scene with Mrs. Robinson was a great way to satisfy the audience. I wanted to slap her the second I saw her in that beauty salon. It was a superb film. Watched it many times because of the unique love story and chemistry Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan portray in this film. Can't wait for Fifty Shades Freed.",Fifty Shades Darker
291,cdeegan-23468,doesn't do the book justice,1,3 March 2017,"extremely disappointed. for a 2 hour movie, they seemed to have squished every possible plot line they could in without tying the loose ends together. they may do in the third film, but most of them made little sense and had almost no relevance to the overall story. to expand on this, what was the point of having Christian involved in a helicopter accident? i understand that if he had of died or suffered an extreme injury such as brain damage, that would have affected the plot line greatly and would have been somewhat intriguing to see how his relationship with Ana continued with such a disadvantage, or didn't continue at all. however, he came out of it with nothing but a few scratches, had Anastasia and his family worried sick, and that was that. completely unnecessary, and if you ask me, they could have spent more time strengthening and deepening Christian and Ana's emotional relationship instead, revealing more of Christian's inner demons and how Ana is slowly teaching him how to love instead of dominate. i thought that plot line was interesting and one that definitely could have done with more attention. it was brushed over once or twice with the lipstick and shower scene, and again, that was that.another plot line that seemed a little messy to me was how Anastasia was being stalked by one of Christian's past submissive's due to jealousy. she held a gun to her, interrogated her almost, when Christian stepped in to protect Ana. he informed Ana the girl wasn't important, that he was finished with that chapter of his life, and alas, that was that. we never really learned more about the young girl's history personally or with Christian, or why she cared so much about stalking and hurting Ana. that could have been an interesting plot line if it was continued or even ended properly rather than quickly.moving on to Anastasia's creepy boss. where was this plot line leading to? or was it a sort of filler plot to show viewers the lengths Christian would go to keep Ana safe? i'm unsure, but overall, it seemed like a slight waste of time. when the boss was introduced first, the way he looked at Ana suggested he was interested in her on a deeper level than just boss to employee, which did spark a curiosity within me to see where it would lead. it began with him quite frustratingly telling her to book a hotel room to join him in new York on some business expedition, but it was quite obvious as to why he wanted to get her there alone. it ended not long after when Ana told him she couldn't go, and he pinned her to the door and forcefully told her how much better being with him (sexually) rather than Christian would be. of course, Christian was waiting for Ana just outside, so she runs into his arms and that's that. kind of pointless? as a plot line, they could have expanded on the boss personally; why was he like that (background wise), why did he want an unavailable woman who was his colleague, knowing she was with one of the most powerful businessmen? they could have had him and Ana interact more to give the audience glimpses of his intentions bit by bit instead of him all of a sudden trapping her against a door. it was all a bit quick and could have been focused on more, if not at all.i didn't mind the plot line involving Christian's past dominant, his mother's friend. however, i do think her obsession with Anastasia was a little overboard. i mean, destroying her car just to let her know she's not the one for Christian?this sounds petty, but i'm not too sure about the choice of names. i love Anastasia, but then having her assistant/co-worker be named Hannah? Ana and Hannah - it just sounded off when they would talk to each other. i'm also not sure of this character but i think she was one of Ana's bosses and had black hair. and then when we came across Christian's mother, these two characters looked almost identical and it was fair to say i was confused for a bit. last but not least, the marriage proposal! WHAT! how so soon? at the beginning they had only just got back together after Christian had done unmentionable, sadistic things to Anastasia. and even then, Anastasia had said she wanted to take things slow, which of course failed. and by the end of the film they're engaged? it's probably just because it's a film and things need to move fast, but i was quite shocked. i thought a plot line as big as this could have been focused on more in the third film, if there is one, after they had been together longer and experienced more hurdles as a steady couple.overall, this movie was quite horrible and didn't really do the book justice! it was messy and just a bit 'all over the place'. if they do end up making a third movie, i sincerely hope for the sake of EL James that the story is portrayed and tied up nicely!",Fifty Shades Darker

The entire film seems a ugly trailer. The music is only a distant echo of that of the first film. Christian appears sloppy, inconsistent, lacking in personality. Ana has no personality, but what can you with a screenplay like this ...It seems that both the director and screenwriter have never read the books and that the author, so meticulous and careful in monitoring implementation of the first film, she went, for the second, on vacation somewhere.A special, not relevant but significant (and is indicative of a total lack of care with which it was carried throughout the film and liquidated in a hurry) is the adopted brother of Christian, Elliot that in the first film was fun and bright, in FSD chewing gum throughout the film: horrible.In Fifty Shades of Gray, Sam Taylor-Johnson had hit the mark and photography of Seamus McGarvey had made magic every detail.

It's funny, romantic, interesting, well shot and well edited. I think it should have an Oscar nominee for best cinematography because it's just great! I really enjoy watching Anstasia and Christian's relationship. The movie is a reminder that you can't force your own personal desires on someone else. This is the most feminist and anti- abusive film I've ever seen in my life. I think that the cast did a really good job, i mean the acting is really good and the story itself is very original. Most films today are pretty much crap. The super hero films are just a cash grab to make money, it's been a while since we've seen a different concept dominants the box office. I'm really glad that the last chapter will be released next year, i try not to read spoilers but I've heard it has a very interesting ending. The world need more films like 'Fifty Shades Of Grey"".

302,marthamartin-62871,I still hope they aren't expecting Oscar nominations,3,29 May 2017,"I saw Fifty Shades of Grey the day it was released in theaters. I then bought the DVD so I could watch it at my leisure. It wasn't any better on DVD. I am going to list the main things I found wrong with Grey and compare that to Darker, in this mere viewer's opinion. Let's begin with: Casting: In my opinion casting can make or break a film. It was the first fatal flaw with Grey. Virtually none of the actors matched - in any way - the books' descriptions of the characters they played. Jamie Dornan is good looking (I prefer him without the facial hair), but he is nowhere close to matching the books' description of Christian Grey. To list a few of the differences, Christian was described as a tall, drop-dead-gorgeous man whose hair simply would not lie down. A man who would not have sex without wearing a shirt to be sure he was not touched. Ana was described as young (22), beautiful, and intelligent. I simply did not see Dakota Johnson as a woman who would make Christian Grey go to a hardware store just to see her again. She was bad wrong for this part. I could go on, but won't; Acting: Awful, awful, awful - enough said? Dornan & Johnson were stiff when acting in the same scene. They appeared to be biding their time until they could get away from each other. The sex scenes were unrealistic, even for ""vanilla"" sex, not to mention the sex was supposed to be rough because that was how Christian liked it. Also, my mother spanked me and my siblings when we were growing up and disobeyed, I just wish she had spanked me as hard as Christian ""spanked"" Ana. I realize one actor can't beat another actor, but those spankings weren't even good acting;Script: The script of Grey was so poorly done that those of us who had read the book had difficulty finding the book in the film. There were so many places when the scenes in the book would have worked much better than what the script portrayed. A lot of the script wasn't even in the book; and Set design: This was so wrong in so many ways. I realize a particular location can't always be found that accurately depicts the location in the book, such as the Greys' house. But there are things that can be done correctly. In the book, there was an L-shaped, white couch in Christian Grey's office where Ana interviewed him, and a u-shaped white couch in his living room, they were both missing. In the film, instead of sitting between the sofa and coffee table, onto which Ana dropped her tape recorder, she sat stiffly in a straight chair using a pencil he handed her.Now for Darker: Casting: The only improvement in this book was the first scene with Leila in it. She looked accurate when we see her outside of Ana's office; Acting: No improvement, still the same people who relate poorly to each other; Script: The reason I gave this film 3 stars is because the script writing was more faithful to the book, but it was still a long way from being on target. There were some scenes that were shown in reverse, the one I will mention is the helicopter scene. Then some scenes were ruined for no reason whatsoever, for example, when Leila confronts Ana outside her office building the scene is ruined when Jack comes out of the building and whisks Ana away to the bar - which was not named Fifty's and where it was just the two of them and not 6 or 7 of them, like in the book; then when Leila confronts Ana in her apartment, why do they have her fire the gun she is carrying, that didn't happen in the book, wasn't necessary in the film. Also there was one scene in the book I felt was pivotal to the entire story and it was completely left out of the film. On Christian's birthday, Ana has three gifts for him, the key chain, a model helicopter, and a box containing items she has taken from the red room. They go into the red room and he ""uses"" the items she has selected on her - on the table, not on the bed. Then comes the scene that, in my opinion, sums up the entire story (all three books). Christian picks Ana up from the table, lays her on the bed, and begins playing The First Time Even I Saw Your Face by Roberta Flack. With that song as the background, he makes love to her, contrary to how he described the kind of sex he has. When reading the books, I kept waiting for this song to come into play because I felt it accurately depicted their first meeting and subsequent relationship, and wasn't disappointed when it was played in this scene. But, this very important part of the book was left completely out of the film. I'm hoping the only reason is because they couldn't get the rights to use it.Set design: Same old same old.In my opinion, Darker is only marginally better than Grey. Perhaps Freed will finally get it right, although I doubt it because Darker and Freed were filmed back to back.",Fifty Shades Darker

And I think because the actress is not goood enough the movie rating is 1/100. They should not make another one anymore.",Fifty Shades Darker
304,liliakamenova,Dull one,1,3 August 2017,"Not that my expectations were too high, but come on :-) this is worse than the worst soap opera: too bad acting, the screenplay is awful, accent placed heavily on luxury and materialism; relationships at zero level; dialogue - none; story - extremely dull or even nothing there... shame for all the money invested in this production and for its advertising! As focus was placed on the sex scenes: wrong interpretation of good vs rude sexual interaction!!! Lack of imagination and link between scenes sexual or non-sexual ones! Dull episodes that have no place in the middle of the screenplay...etc. I can go on like this and one night will not be enough to list all the bad sides of this movie. Sorry, but on the background of all this negativity I would not mention a single positive aspect of it for it would not make any difference in the general view.",Fifty Shades Darker
305,cmmcgrant,Book over Movie,7,16 October 2017,There was so much emotion in the books that the actors and actresses just could not bring to the screen. It was as if the directors and producers had never read the books. So let me correct some things that the movie missed or messed up. After their break-up Ana was devastated and was not eating properly. Christian had purchased SIP before Ana had drinks with her co -workers. Kate's brother comes to town for a visit so Ana gives him her key. When Ana gets home she is buzzed in only to walk in the door to Lelia holding the gun. Ana hits a bar across the street with Kate's brother. My favorite scene in book 2 was where Christian panics thinking Ana is going to leave him again he falls to his knees. Ana not understanding asks what is he doing a few times before telling him to look at her and he does. The movie really really missed the emotion in these scenes. The news covers the story of the missing helicopter but does not announce Christian was alive. Ana was disgusted that Elena started a sexual relationship with Christian when he was so young. Dr. Grey slaps Elena before telling her to get out of her house. Elena was not bold enough to deliberately drop a towel in rebellion before walking off in the book.I hope everyone involved in the 3rd movie reads the book at least twice before filming.,Fifty Shades Darker
306,coburnlizaitis,I just don't understand.,1,14 January 2018,"Firstly, I just cannot even begin to comprehend what I just had to sit and watch. May I point out I did not view this by choice, but due to my girlfriend wanting to watch this.Just a brief overview of this film, I have seen better acting in Eastenders from Ian Bill. I have seen more intense sex scenes in American Pie and a better storyline in Disaster Movie. Christian, you are a melt and a wet bag.Anastasia however your crusty name is spelt, you are a fragile donkey WHO NEEDS TO SHAVE THAT VERMIN OF A BUSH. I just for the life of me cannot understand how a film can be so bad that it has actually made me so mad to the point I have made an IMDB account to review this. This film is the most pointless, dumbest and poorly directed film I think I have ever come across. I just cannot even understand how or why this film got made.Also Rita Ora I understand why you are in this film. It suits you perfectly.",Fifty Shades Darker
