0,TheLittleSongbird,A night of games one doesn't want to miss,8,23 March 2018,"Was really excited for watching 'Game Night'. The trailer was great fun (one of the best and funniest for any recent film from personal perspective), the cast are a talented bunch and the pretty individual-sounding concept promised a lot. 'Game Night' fortunately was one of those films where none of its interest points are wasted. In fact they are used to full advantage and with the largest amount of impact possible. Have seen my fair share of wastes of talent and good ideas being ruined by bad execution, 'Game Night' is not one of them. It was one of those films where there were high expectations going in to seeing the film and they were during and after watching not just met but exceeded, with some of the most fun had for any film released recently in the cinema. Is it a perfect film? No, not quite. It is let down by its third act, where things do stretch credibility to breaking point and where some of the events become confused and not as inspired as the previous two thirds. Occasionally things do get a touch too silly. This is a real shame because everything is done so well. For one thing, 'Game Night' ranges throughout from incredibly funny to hilarious. The black humour has bite and there is a huge amount of wit and side splitting lines and one-liners. Easily one of 2018's best and cleverest scripts so far. On top of all that, the mystery elements have fun and tension with touches of suspense, always compelling, lively in pace and never losing interest. There are clichés but one doesn't care when such a clever, if not always novel, idea is given even cleverer and original execution.Loved the relationships and chemistry between the characters, which had humanity and basically sparkle in the best of ways. The physical comedy and slapstick are witty and inspired and the violence gets deliberately deliciously outlandish without being sadistic. 'Game Night' is directed with great enthusiasm and great balance of the material. Other great elements are the stylish and remarkably innovative cinematography (unlike any seen before by me) and a wildly atmospheric soundtrack and smart use of sound effects. And then there is the cast giving the performances of their lives and they are all never less than strong throughout. Jason Bateman is particularly good and then there is Rachel McAdams at her most delightful and perhaps best. Their chemistry is a highlight of 'Game Night', sparkling like bubbles in a glass of champagne. In summary, an unmissable night of games despite losing its way in the third act. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Game Night
1,SnoopyStyle,a small surprise,7,11 May 2018,"Max (Jason Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams) meet in a bar trivia night. They bond over their competitive nature and their love of games. The couple marries. Their creepy next door neighbor Gary (Jesse Plemons) is desperate to get into their game night after his wife left him. Max is stressed with the arrival of his superior bossy older brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler). Brooks proposes a kidnapping game. When Brooks is really kidnapped, the gang thinks that it's all part of the game.Bateman and McAdams are solid comedic actors. They're more fun than I expected. They simply work as a couple. The concept is great and somewhat different. Lamorne Morris and Kylie Bunbury are good. The Denzel thing is fun although there is one or two awkward unfunny moments. Jesse Plemons is good at his dead-eye creepiness. I have some problems with the Sharon Horgan and Billy Magnussen coupling. I like Horgan but I don't believe she would stick with Magnussen's character. He's annoying and bad at playing outrageous. He's the weak spot on the roster. There is one or two too many turns on the fake kidnapping take. It wears out its welcome rather than being a funny call back. Overall, I like most of this movie with a couple of reservations.",Game Night
2,Prismark10,Give us a clue,5,9 June 2018,Game Night would had shone better as an absurd comedy. It even has a Denzel Washington look alike at one pint. It then becomes a dark action thriller and loses it way.Max (Jason Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams) are a couple who love board games and regularly holds a games night with friends. Their awkward neighbour Gary (Jesse Plemons) who is a cop reallys wants in on the game night but Max and Annie always finds an excuse to keep him away.One day Max's more successful and swaggering older brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler) plans an immersive game that involves a kidnapping. However Brooks is really kidnapped by bad guys and the rest think it is all part of the game.It is an enjoyable enough movie but is too uneven in tone. Many of the characters are rather hemmed in as being one note.,Game Night
3,nogodnomasters,You are so smart and unfaithful.,8,27 March 2018,"The film manages to give us complete character build up in the first 5 minutes of Max (Jason Bateman) and his bride Annie (Rachel McAdams). They are avid game players and have friends and neighbors over all the time. When Jason's accomplished brother (Kyle Chandler) shows up, Jason changes gears and his jealousy shows. The next game gets out of hand as a staged kidnapping....is it real or just a game? This was a fairy decent comedy, at least one that has a slightly different plot. I don't think the film was well cast, but it was adequate. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Game Night
4,kosmasp,Way more fun than ...,8,30 July 2018,".. it should be allowed to be! You can of course be mad at the movie for some twists and turns it takes, but that would just ruin the enjoyment you can have, so why do it, when you can just have a really fun time with this? The premise seems pretty simple and I guess you are aware of a similar named movie that went a little bit more serious back when it was made.The comedy here helps, but that doesn't mean it doesn't get down and dirty and violent. So some may call this mainstream, but I wouldn't really classify it as that. It also does not really care that much about political correctness. And while it is an ensemble cast, you have two main characters who are the focus of it all. Really well made and if you are into it you will more than enjoy it",Game Night
5,jboothmillard,Game Night,5,17 March 2018,"I have seen a couple of films like this one, where characters think they are part of something fictional, but is actually turns out to be for real, e.g. WarGames, The Man Who Knew Too Little, Galaxy Quest, this was the latest movie to use this concept, for comedic purposes, it looked like it could be something funny. Basically competitive gamers Max (Jason Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams) met during trivia night at a bar, quickly fell in love, and married, since then they spend a lot of their time with friends and each other playing various games. They have been trying for some time to have children, but Max's sperm development may be affected by his stress, brought on by his inadequacy when compared to his highly successful and attractive brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler). Max and Annie hold a routine game night with their friends Ryan (Billy Magnussen), Kevin (Lamorne Morris), and his wife Michelle (Kylie Bunbury), but Brooks shows up unannounced, telling embarrassing stories and being extremely obnoxious. Max and Annie decide to work together to defeat him at the upcoming game night, which Brooks offers to hold at the house he is renting, they are also trying to game nights secret from their neighbour, police officer Gary (Jesse Plemons), who is humourless and awkward since his wife Debbie (Jessica Clair Lee) divorced him. The guests arrive at Brooks' place, including Ryan's new date Sarah (Sharon Horgan), Brooks says he is initiating an interactive role-playing mystery game, and he promises that the winner will get his Corvette Stingray. After a while, an actor playing an FBI agent (Jeffrey Wright) informs them of the narrative of the mystery, only for two masked men to break in and assault him and Brooks, the guests idly watch, wrongly assuming this is part of the game. After Brooks is dragged away, the couples begin to solve the mystery using the clues provided by the actor; Kevin and Michelle play the game fairly, Max and Annie track Brooks' location with his mobile phone GPS, and Ryan and Sarah track down the company in charge of managing the game. Max and Annie track Brooks down to a seedy bar, Annie is carrying a pistol left behind by Brooks during the struggle, she assumes it is fake, they get the keys to the storage closet, and find Brooks tied up. Annie mistakenly fires the gun, shooting Max in the arm, this confirms the legitimacy of the danger they are in, they escape, Brooks explains that he makes his living buying and selling things on the black market. A man known only as the Bulgarian is seeking a Fabergé egg, owned by a man using the alias Marlon Freeman, during the pursuit, Brooks exits the moving car to allow Max and Annie to escape. Eventually, the others learn what they are involved in, reunited with Max and Annie, they trick Gary into letting them into his house for a game night, so they can use his computer to find information about Marlon Freeman and the Bulgarian. Max finds out Marlon Freeman is actually a rich man named Donald Anderton (Danny Huston), and finds his address, but there is no information about the Bulgarian. The group go to Anderton's address, where he is hosting an underground fight club, the others search the house, Ryan finds the egg in a safe, but is caught trying to steal it. The group escape with the egg, but accidentally break it, but discover it is fake and worthless, it contains a list of names, they realise this is what the Bulgarian really wants. The group finds Brooks and his captors on an under-construction bridge and try to rescue him from execution, Brooks reveals his own insecurities throughout the years as a reason for his life of crime, he only wanted to be more successful than Max. Before the group are killed, Gary rescues them, but he is shot in the chest, Max and Annie, who have repeatedly dismissed his requests to join game night following the, try to encourage him to pull through, promising to invite him to every future game night. Gary then reveals that he faked the whole scenario, the two captors are felons who agreed in exchange for their paroles being shortened, to trick them into letting him join game night again. However, he has no knowledge about the egg or Brooks' involvement, the real Bulgarian (Michael C. Hall) appears and attacks the group, Brooks is captured after he swallows the list, revealed to be names in the witness protection program. Max and Annie take the Corvette, using the keys that Brooks slipped into Max's coat pocket, to ensure he would win, driving to the airport to stop the Bulgarian from taking off in a private jet, subduing him and saving Brooks. A few months later, Brooks is under house for his crimes, but he has still sold the list for $3 million, and earned an extra $20,000 from each person of the list after being tipped off, Annie finally gets pregnant, and the group continue a game night, along with Gary, unaware that armed men are getting ready to storm in. Also starring Chelsea Peretti as Glenda, Camille Chen as Dr. Chinand Joshua Mikel as Colin. Bateman and McAdams do well heading the cast, and Catastrophe star Horgan makes a great impression in what is essentially her big screen debut, what starts out as a new kind of parlour game snowballs into an outlandishly violent series of action sequences, the one-liners and slapstick moments are amusing, it is not always that engaging, but it is a fun enough black comedy. Worth watching!",Game Night
6,Quinoa1984,"above average, for what it's trying to do - and Plemmons is the MVP",7,3 March 2018,"If you're a comedy filmmaker (or two, in this case) working in what is currently the thing in recent comedies, there isn't usually much asked as far as visual ambition or even any real vision at all past making sure everything is well lit and the actors are in frame. As far as making the thing *funny*, that mileage may vary depending on who can stomach copious improv or walk-one from people who shouldn't even be in this kind of movie (for better or worse). While Game Night does have that last part, the directors (behind the, what, Vacation remake, the fuck? Oh ok they wrote Horrible Bosses, got it, I guess) are less inclined to follow the other facets of Hollywood comedies that dont ask much from the makers or the audience expecting more. And it's funny, and dark, and creative. It also solidifies Jesse Plemmons as a full fledged star (but more on him in a moment).These guys wanted to make a sorta spoof or take off or, if you want to cal it, homage to Fincher's The Game, only they go a couple of steps further. They have a solid cinematographer and have a grasp of getting in at least the set pieces more than one would usually bargain for - it's shot more in some ways like Fincher and other times like a professional neo-noir cinematographer is at the helm - and with Cliff (Drive) Martinez doing the music, it has the total feel of a dangerous, all-at-night thriller.... And from this comes the crazy hijinks and comedy one might expect from the premise of a group of board game enthusiasts (Bateman and McAdams as the main ones, also Billy Magnussen from Ingrid Goed West) get roped into a kidnapping plot involving Kyle Chandler.But easily the show-stealer by a mile is Jesse Plemmons as the cop neighbor with his little dog and among the great creeps in... Any movie I've seen in recent memory. How he is perfectly still, how his face barely contorts and yet one hears all the anguish from being excluded by the gamers (who once or twice had him over, saw how tightly wound he was, and never had him back) and being dumped, it's all in the eyes and voice. I'm not joking when I say it's Oscar worthy - if the Academy ever saw that this is just as hard work as what any of this years nominees did to submerge into character like a deep sea diver - and there's barely a moment when he's on screen that is not wildly funny.It's not a great movie overall, it should be noted, largely due to a couple of predictable beats and then a conclusion/final 15 minutes that feels oddly like a tacked on studio-noted or test screened reshoot - it just feels like they bite off more than they can chew, and after what seems to be the BIG reveal turns out to be not quite the last one, it doesn't stop being occasionally funny but it drags. And yet I have to commend the filmmakers for casting this so well - Bateman is not completely his usual nice-ish guy and Chandler gets to have some moments that land and shows more of what he's capable of as a performer - and that they are interesting characters throughout this. Even the arcs that don't seem to have much meat on the bones (sitcomish on the page) get carried by the actors to wonderful lengths. Oh, and it's gloriously violent at times and yet feels earned for the style of the film.",Game Night
7,zardoz-13,"A Hilarious, Surprising, and Unpredictable Comic Thriller",9,27 February 2018,"The best movies spring one surprise after another in such swift succession that you struggle to keep up with all the revelations. ""Vacation"" co-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, along with ""Accepted"" writer Mark Perez, never put the brakes on the momentum in their snappy comic thriller ""Game Night,"" starring Jason Bateman, Rachel McAdams, and Kyle Chandler. One thing that everybody hates is when somebody spoils those surprises. The only unfortunate thing about ""Game Night"" is its two preview trailers blow the whistle on a couple of those surprises. Fortunately, when I saw this madcap caper, I knew nothing about this sophisticated saga with its overlapping storylines. If you've seen the two trailers, you may not be as surprised as I was by some of the shenanigans. Nevertheless, Daley and Goldstein still conjure up more than enough chaos with their charismatic cast to keep you cackling like you've been gassed with helium. ""Game Night"" qualifies as one of those nimble epics that keeps you guessing and then knocks you for a loop. Daley and Goldstein take their quirky characters off on apparent tangents and then surprise them as much as they surprise us. The straight-faced David Fincher comedy ""The Game"" (1997) compares favorably with ""Game Night"" with its theme of sibling rivalry. Groups of couples that often congregate for good times at their friend's houses and compete over board games or at trivia quizzes are the protagonists of this witty tom foolery. While Bateman, McAdams, and Chandler are the primary leads, the supporting cast that aids and abets them is not only as interesting, but it also provides sources for running gags throughout this 100-minute, R-rated outing. Indeed, actor Billy Magnussen plays a male bimbo who is so hopelessly obtuse that he doesn't realize what a nincompoop he is.
Sibling rivalry generates the escapades of ""Game Night."" Max (Jason Bateman of ""Horrible Bosses"") is a younger brother who has suffered miserably at the hands of his stuck-up older brother. Older brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler of the TV series ""Friday Night Lights"") never passes up on an opportunity to ridicule and humiliate his younger sibling. No matter what he does to outdo Brooks, Max's plans backfire, and he ends up with egg on his face. The rivalry between these brothers is so extreme that it undermines Max's ability to get his frisky wife Annie (Rachel McAdams of ""The Time Traveler's Wife) pregnant. Meantime, Max and his friends enjoy their game nights and crave the competition that it affords them. After all, game night brought Max and Annie together, and Max proposed to her while playing charades. This energetic couple is at their nerdy best when they battle the clock to amass points against rival players. Predictably, Brooks surpasses Max on game night just as he does with everything else. Max's audacious venture-capital brother, who loves to brag about his incredible successes and wealth, blows into town in a cherry-red Stingray to participate in a game night. The Stingray is Max's dream car, and Brooks uses it to show his younger brother what he cannot attain on his own. Unlike the usual game night, however, Brooks conjures up something radically different and more challenging. Everybody is excited at the prospect of solving a mystery, and Brooks explains that the mystery involves finding one of their company who will soon be kidnapped. No sooner has Brooks laid out the scenario than armed assailants wearing masks break into his luxurious house, beat the living daylights out of him, duck-tape his mouth, and then kidnap him! Little do Max and Annie, along with the two oblivious couples with them, realize that real-life kidnappers have abducted Brooks! Moments later the fake kidnappers storm the house. Max and company learn to their chagrin that everybody has been duped. They embark on a desperate search for Brooks that turns into a scavenger hunt for a jeweled Fabergé egg. Brooks warns them that whatever they do, they must not contact the authorities because his life may depend on their reticence. 
One of the most interesting characters in ""Game Night"" is Max and Annie's next-door neighbor, a city policeman, Gary (Jesse Plemons of ""Black Mass""), who wears his uniform twenty-four-seven. Nobody likes the suspicious-minded Gary, but everybody loved his wife Debbie. Now that Debbie has divorced Gary, all the policeman has left is a cute little Bichon Frise named Sebastian. Gary carries this precious pooch in his arms to answer the door and check his mail. At one point, Max and company lie to Gary that they are not having a game night, but suspicious Gary knows better. Eventually, our heroes realize they need Gary to learn the whereabouts of Brooks and the vicious hoodlums that have taken him hostage and threaten to kill him. Two of the funniest scenes in ""Game Night"" grow out of the wrecked relationship between Gary and Max. Meantime, our heroes and heroines have no idea what they have gotten themselves into even as they descend into chaos and contend with thugs who want to murder Brooks. Before everything's over, the relationship between the two brothers takes a 180-degree, whirlwind, reversal that surprises them as well as us.
""Game Night"" takes about twenty minutes to introduce its characters and set up its complicated premise. Afterwards, it amounts to no-holds-barred horseplay, and co-directors Daley and Goldstein will keep you in sidesplitting stitches. Another memorable scene involves Max biting down on a squeaky toy while Annie probes for a bullet in his forearm. The game night trivia questions will make you grin, too, especially the Hulk question about actor Edward Norton. Another great sight gag concerns a rendezvous between a guy impersonating Denzel Washington and Gary's wife Debbie. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams make a credible couple poised to take the next big step in their marriage. Danny Huston and ""Dexter's"" Michael C. Hall make amusing villains after Brooks. ""Game Night"" is a riot from fade-in to fadeout.",Game Night
8,oscaralbert,Warner Bros. courageouly warns America that now is no time for games . . .,8,27 February 2018,". . . with its latest feature offering, GAME NIGHT. Warner labors diligently to show viewers that there is NO WAY to distinguish between what is ""Real"" and what is ""Fake"" throughout GAME NIGHT. Is that REALLY a Faberge Egg? Is the Commander-in-Chief REALLY a Russian Spy? Has Deputy Dewey REALLY been shot? The possibilities here are endless, Warner warns us, and the stakes cannot be higher. A thug gets sucked through a jet engine, disappearing like fruit in a blender, and his hostage goes ""Yaay!!"" (but immediately observes ""Someone just died""). The price at the pump drops a nickel, but Earth's last surviving polar bear croaks in the oil slick of the latest spill. The lady filling up her Accord goes ""Yaay!!"" (but immediately realizes that there won't be any more white bears at the local zoo). Warner packs GAME NIGHT with these sorts of topical ""inside jokes"" that most Americans of the Early 21st Century will appreciate (but which may fail to register with their descendants, if any).",Game Night
9,view_and_review,"Great Start, Lost Steam",6,26 February 2018,"The last thing I'd seen Jason Bateman in was Ozark, a TV series--either by Netflix or picked up by Netflix. It was so awful I was skeptical going into this movie. In this movie Bateman was more in his element--the straight man in a comedy.Max (Jason Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams) are a couple that loves games. They are ultra-competitive and they are good. They have game night once a week with two other couples in which they play things like Taboo, Scattegories, Outburst, Charades and others. When Max's brother, Brooks (Kyle Chandler), comes to town he decides to spice up game night. He employs a company to kidnap one of the game nighters and the others have to follow the clues to find the missing person. The winner gets a vintage red Corvette Sting Ray. The problems occur when they can't determine whether it's real or fake.The movie started off hilarious. The lines and the deliveries were fantastic. The movie lost steam to me once it entered the action phase. I'm not a fan of physical comedy in general unless it is done really well. Once there were chases, gunplay, fights and escapes it became less funny and it certainly wasn't good enough action to be interesting. Even though it lost steam and wrapped up in a very cliche manner I liked the overall product.",Game Night

The Max's brother Brooks, who has always outdone Max, to his brother's annoyance, throws a murder mystery night which goes horribly wrong - I mean, you don't actually get shot on game night, do you? Oh, you do!The trailer has some funny stuff in it and, to be fair, I was amused throughout. But I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected to. Jason Bateman's easy amiability serves the film well: other cast members, maybe not so much. I don't normally care for Rachel McAdams, and she didn't change my mind here. There is a running gag about one character's infidelity which lacked any humour whatsoever, yet the scriptwriters obviously thought it was hysterical by virtue of how they kept coming back to it. And the cop next door was obviously meant to be a great deal funnier than I found him.It was OK.",Game Night
11,evanston_dad,Winning Comedy,7,1 August 2018,"I watched ""Game Night"" on an 8-hour flight back from Denmark immediately after watching another comedy, ""Blockers."" While ""Blockers"" had some funny moments, compared to ""Game Night"" it came across as a random assortment of gags, and the importance of a tight script in a comedy was made clear in the comparison.""Game Night"" is very funny, mostly because of the winning combination of Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams, but this is the rare comedy that gives all of its actors moments to shine.

Wanting to go for something that she could just watch and relax to over the summer holidays, comments from a fellow IMDber led to me thinking that it was a good time to open the game board.View on the film:Reuniting with Jason Bateman after writing the Horrible Bosses duo,John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein turn from writers to directors flows with impressive ease,as they and cinematographer Barry Peterson show an eye for stylish set-pieces, that includes extended,one-shot tracking shots around an entire house,and the blending in of tracking shots. Showing their writers side, Daley and Goldstein mix snappy group one-liners with Action Comedy hits which raise the stakes of the game.Balancing between funny sweet and raunchy dialogue, the screenplay by Mark Perez plays the game with a really solid mystery, as the lively gags are built on the group unwittingly placing themselves in dangerous situations, where the seriousness of the threats,makes the groups anxieties hit the punch-line targets. Joined by terrific supporting turns from Sharon Horgan, Jesse Plemons and Michael C.

He's right and wrong. There are alot when a bad movie gets a high rating and there are not much reviews, but there are not alot when a good movie gets a high rating when there are alot of reviews. And that's something he apparently does not understand. If this movie gets a high rating when having alot of reviews there is a reason why, and that is that you are wrong and in this case being a comedy that you have no sense of humor at all. I wouldn't want those negative reviewers as friends because they just don't have a good sense of humor and that's important to me. Game Night is funny and I'm pleased I watched it. I had more laughs then I normally have with comedies and that's a good sign. All the actors brought an amusing note to this movie, and even the story wasn't bad. So for all the bad reviewers I suggest you all gather together and moan about everything instead of enjoying life and laugh once in a while.

15,lasttimeisaw,a mainstream American comedy tinged with a mild distaste of its cavalier attitude of mollycoddling the lowest common denominator,6,18 May 2018,"A reveal-after-reveal black comedy grinds out the perennial problems of a man's sibling pressure and a woman's natalism instinct to actuate an unexpected game night which goes very much awry for the game-loving couple Max (Bateman) and Annie (McAdams), and their equally game friends. Director duo Daley and Goldstein sustains a care-free, jaunty pace from the word go and never subverts the good vibes with menace from a criminal underworld, summoning three heterosexual couples to solve a blundering kidnap mystery game of Max's brother Brooks (Chandler), ostensibly spurred by material gain, the plot is pretty derivative and seems to been left on the shelf at least for more than a decade, before being dusted off with a few more twists to spice it up, a frivolously and persistently needling spat between the African-American couple Kevin and Michelle (Morris and Bunbury), is for him to find out who is the celebrity she slept with 10 years ago during their cooling-off period, and the answer is none other than Denzel Washington, albeit a fake one, who is 54 years old in 2008 while Bunbury is barely 19, egregious daddy issue is too passé for 2018, guys!A third pair is a harebrained jock Ryan (Magnussen) and his new date Sarah (British comedienne Horgan), an elder but much more sharp-witted companion compared to his usual one-off bimbos, a slavish opposite attraction byplay but sparks don't fly high. Although it is nice to see Bateman, Hall and Chandler, three TV leading man congregated together to engage some generic action and harmless laughter, the real scene-stealer here is Jesse Plemons, aka. the poor man's Matt Damon (although I will bet anyone that he will notch up an Oscar for acting sooner than his more prestigious doppelgänger), as the creepy neighbor Gary, straddling mischievously between the elaborated master-mind and the valiant policeman, and irrefutably, the least obnoxious character among the posse.And that's it, GAME NIGHT is a fun choice for a movie night, preferably with friends, not too ambitious but there is enough spontaneous laughter to cherish, in tandem with a mild distaste of its cavalier attitude of mollycoddling the lowest common denominator.",Game Night
16,Hellmant,"About as fun as actual game night should be, if you have an equal passion for film!",8,9 March 2018,"'GAME NIGHT': Four Stars (Out of Five)
 
A dark action-comedy about a group of friends who end up investigating a real murder, while attending their regular game night together. It stars Jason Bateman (who also served as a producer), Rachel McAdams, Kyle Chandler, Billy Magnussen, Sharon Horgan, Lamorne Morris, Kylie Bunbury, Jesse Plemons and Michael C. Hall. The film was directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein (the duo also co-directed 2015's 'VACATION'), and it was written by Mark Perez. It's gotten mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also a hit at the Box Office as well. I enjoyed it. The film tells the story of a couple, Max (Bateman) and Annie (McAdams), who met on game night, at a local bar, and fell in love. Now they share their passion for games with their friends, during a weekly game night at their home, and desperately want to have kids. The only problem is that it appears that stress, and specifically competitiveness with Max's brother Brooks (Chandler), are causing Max to be infertile. During a game night with Brooks, while attempting to solve the problem, actual criminals take Brooks hostage, or so it seems, and it's up to Max, Annie, and their friends to save him. The film is consistently funny, which is by far the most important thing in a comedy, and the performances are all more than decent. The crime mystery plot is also interesting enough, and it's full of (somewhat) clever twists. The movie as a whole is definitely amusing, well made, and fun. It's about as fun as actual game night should be, if you have an equal passion for film (at least), like I do.",Game Night
17,cherold,Funny and fast paced,8,15 September 2018,"Game Night is about a guy having a game night with a mystery theme that becomes too real. Justin Bateman and Rachel McAdams are game-obsessed coupole who have a weekly gaming night with friends that is hijacked by Bateman's wealthy brother. Things get out of hand, leading to increasingly crazed moments.The cinematography is hyper stylish, most notably in a scene in which the protagonists play keepaway with some bad men. It seems to have been shot in a single take, which seemed so impossibly elaborate that I've google to see if it really was one take or used special effects (still don't know). Even though this is a silly comedy, it's filmed like a hyperactive action movie. (Seriously, if you're not going to watch the movie, at least find that one scene on youtube.)Game Night has an ingenious plot (which may have plot holes but is so convoluted I'm not actually sure) and a lot of really funny scenes. Sometimes it is breathlessly hilarious. What keeps me from rating this higher is it doesn't manage to keep that going full time so you are in a continual state of hilarity (as in something like Airplane).

It manages to be extremely entertaining and is actually surprisingly well directed, with some fancy camera-work and oddly visceral fight scenes superbly solidifying its thriller elements, while it never takes its eye off its comedy roots and therefore manages to keep a smile on your face even during some of its more obvious or on-the-nose moments.

21,bowmanblue,Like rolling a 'double six',8,9 March 2018,"The main reservations I had when I sat down to watch 'Game Night' was that I'd seen all the jokes during the trailer! I'd probably advise most people NOT to watch the clip, as it does give away some (but thankfully not all) of the funniest moments. It's about three couples who regularly get together every so often and play a variety of games (the type that doesn't involve a Playstation or Xbox controller - if you can believe that!). However, one night they get more than they bargain for when one of them decides to 'up' the game to the next level by incorporating one of those games which employ the services of actors to stage a murder mystery for you to solve. Now, this would be fair enough if it wasn't for the unfortunate coincidence that this night happens to also be the one where a real kidnapping takes place, leaving our middle-class couples unsure of what's real and what's just part of the game.Despite there being three couples, it's mainly Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams who have the most screen time, therefore allowing themselves the most time for gags and character development (which I'm pleased to say there are plenty of both). The other two couples are fun and have their moments, but, in some ways, both couples are technically superfluous to the main plot and couple almost have been removed completely! But they're all good and the gags come thick and fast, many of which reference popular culture (good now, but I do wonder how many will still be relevant in 10-20 years' time. However, if you're looking for the real 'scene stealer' it has to go to Jesse Plemons who plays the creepy neighbour down to perfection (even if it does look like he's getting a little typecast after 'Breaking Bad').In a film like this you do have to suspend your disbelief a little bit to keep enjoying the story. However, the bottom line is that it is funny and, for that, it should be allowed a little slack when it comes to picking too many holes in the plot. Ultimately, it's a great movie to watch if you just want something simple, funny and good to sit through with your mates. It may not be remembered in 20-20 years' time as one of the all-time comedy greats, but it should deserve more than a little love and laughs right now.",Game Night
22,dromasca,best laughs in a while,7,11 March 2018,"I confess that I was waiting for such a movie for quite a while. It's so long since I have seen a comedy that made me laugh without being stupid, with characters I could care about without falling into melodrama, with a story interesting to follow and no super-persons involved. ""Game Night"" written by Mark Perez and directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein succeeds to be all these and made me spend some of the most pleasant couple of hours in a cinema theater recently.The characters of the story are quite recognizable for many of the viewers. They are young mid-class professionals in today's America, whose lives is centered around the hobby of playing all kinds of rather innocent society games. Never falling on the bad side of vice, the gaming passion defines their way of life with funny moments - like proposing marriage in riddles - or doubtful impact when concerning their decision or even capability of bringing children to life. When games and real life become entangled and the game in game situation turns to be more real than realistic the characters become involved in a turmoil of events where physical integrity and even lives are at risk, and viewers become part of the game. Same as the heroes on screen we know that the bullets cannot hurt (too much) the good guys and the blood spilled by them is just ketchup. The script authors just added one layer between fiction and reality, and this layer turns the film into a combination of surrealistic action movie and situation comedy gags - a few of them novel enough to extract some extra laughs.The excellent cast feels good on screen and you can feel that they had fun making this movie. A special note should be given to the lead actors Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams who add personal chemistry to their comic talents, and to Jesse Plemons, a young comedian who constructs the role of a nerd cop with a soul in manner that lets me expect some more fun from him in the future.If you look for good entertainment where neither the characters not the viewers are considered stupid - ""Game Night"" should be the choice.",Game Night
23,ThomasDrufke,Unpredictably Dark Comedy,7,1 March 2018,"As much as I hate on the comedy genre, and how problematic they can be, especially when I can name more non-comedy films that have made me laugh more than actual comedies, there's always something very satisfying about a comedy that actually lands with audiences. Game Night is a creative and, for the most part, a pretty hilarious film that keeps 2018 on the right track.Playing up the ""whats real and what isn't"" dynamic of a dark comedy, Game Night is the first major comedy of 2018 and manages to feel both unique and entirely unpredictable. Twists and turns keep you on your toes as well as rocking in your seat with laughter. It doesn't hurt that you have comedy staple, Jason Bateman, the always likable Rachel McAdams, and a well-rounded supporting cast to make the violent crime-comedy all the better.I made sure I bought a ticket to a screening that had plenty of audience members so that I could gauge whether or not my feelings were the same as the masses, and for the most part, I was laughing at what they were laughing at. It's hard for comedies to gain my appreciation sometimes, so there's typically a huge gap there. However, the two directors (who are supposedly directing the Flashpoint film) did a nice job of delivering the big laughs when needed and also a different (game-ish) approach to their shots and scene placements. In a way, the film unraveled much like a board/card game of its own. You don't really know who's going to come out on top or not until the final moments.7.3/10",Game Night

The film is consistently fun and constantly goes beyond boundaries that most comedies are afraid to go past. There are some very dark moments and the film itself is also partly a thriller, making several bold moves throughout.I did find that it got a bit too frantic at points, it needed to ground itself a tad more, but instead gets carried away with jumping from one side story to another, but this is really only a small criticism.The cast is all around terrific and they take on their unique, flawed characters brilliantly. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams are particularly stellar in their roles, with a dynamic chemistry that is consistently entertaining to watch.Fun from start to finish. Hilarious, thrilling and exciting, Game Night is a very unique comedy that I would certainly recommend.

29,ironhorse_iv,"Is 'Game Night' worth playing on your DVD? Somewhat. It's alright, but could had been a lot better.",6,14 March 2018,"Honestly, what's more fun than sitting around the table playing a game with friends and family, having a good time!? Unfortunately, it's not watching this movie. Don't get me wrong, this black comedy directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein isn't an awful movie. It's just mediocre, at best. Written by Mark Perez, the film tells the story of a couple, Annie (Rachel McAdams) & Max (Jason Bateman), whom on their 'game night', is given an opportunity to participate in an interactive role-playing mysterious game of cat & mouse by Max's wealthy brother, Brooks (Kyle Chandler), along with their friends. In order to win the grand prize, they must solve a kidnapping case. However, along the way, they must also encounter, a number of twist and turns, that will question, their sanity, as they must distinguish what's real, and what's fantasy, in a series of hilarious hijinks. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, it's really disappointing to see a film not live up to the hype of the trailers. It offers little to no suspense nor does it challenge you to solve the case. The movie reveals everything, way too early. Also, none of them, are even well explain. The movie is fill with plot-holes, like how other minor characters could had known of Brook's mystery plan. Another is Brook's positive change in character toward his brother. Where did that come from!? Another thing, the movie had way too much coincidences to be believable. All the improbable action scenes really does takes the audiences, out if the movie at certain parts. It's sad, because I was really hoping for a sophisticated comedy version of director, David Fincher's 1997 masterpiece, 'the Game'. Sadly, we got nothing even near that. It's not even in the same level as 1985's murder mystery comedy film 'Clue'. 'Game Night' felt like a really dumb down version of both films, lacking both the problem-solving skills and really laugh out loud moments, need for a film like this, to have success. Instead, it focus way too much on supporting characters, unrelated unfunny pop-culture references & jokes like Denzel Washington look-a-like, and abandoned complex puzzles & riddles that really don't add much to the main plot. Another thing, it takes forever, for the film to establish the mystery aspect of the film, about 15 minutes in. Don't get me wrong, I like the opening montage of Annie and Max being very competitive in a series of board game montages, however, it wasn't needed. None of the character friends in that opening, is even in the rest of the film nor was any key characters like Brooks or the Police Officer, Gary (Jesse Plemons). It felt like filler. Honestly, when you think, deep about it. The first game night sequence wasn't really needed, too. They could had cut that scene, and just combine, both nights together to show the sibling rivalry and creepy nature of Gary. It didn't need all, those introducing spots. Despite that, the movie is very well-shot. I totally dig the 'hot potato' one-take continuous long shot with the Fabergé egg & the establishing shot of the board game-like model turning into locations. The night cinematography from cinematographer, Barry Peterson was breath-taking beautiful. It look like something out of 2014's 'Night-crawler'. The ambient music from composer, Cliff Martinez sound like it's straight from a 1980s video game. Surprisingly, it oddly fits this movie so well! Mad props goes to him, for establishing the mood for the film. Not only that, I have to say, the high energy acting in this film, was well-verse. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams were really cute as a couple. Their characters really did, seem like they had a lot of chemistry. The supporting cast was equally as great, even if some of them, weren't really needed, such as Lamorne Morris, Kylie Bunbury, Billy Magnussen and Sharon Horgan. Also, without spoiling the ending cameo. He was wonderful as the villain, the Bulgarian. Overall: A good movie is like a good party game. It's one that can subtly allow a group of people to loosen up, talk to each other, in order to complete a certain goal or task, without, feeling like it was a boring waste of time or a mindless chore. Unfortunately, this black comedy was not that. While, there were some funny moments. It wasn't as impressive as it should had been. The movie has the same value of fun as a board game of 'Guess Who'. Like the board game, it is fun at first, but it easily can gets boring when repeat play. In the end, the movie was just not that entertaining.",Game Night

31,The-Sarkologist,What a Pleasant Surprise,8,23 February 2018,"I was actually really surprised with this film. I'm not sure what I was expecting - actually I know exactly what I was expecting - another one of those rude and crewed comedy movies that really goes out of the way to push the boundaries. It turned out that this was simply not the case at all. In fact there was no flesh in the film either, which really impressed me because it goes to show that some thought actually went into making this film. Okay, there is a bit of gore (such as the scene in the police officer's office), but I guess we can't have everything.
 The movie begins with Max and Annie at a quiz night, on opposing teams, falling in love and getting married. The thing is that they both love games, and throughout the opening scene it always comes down to them playing a game. Anyway, they have a weekly game night with a group of friends, but it turns out that Max's brother is coming to town. The thing is that his brother always seems to be much better than him, and this stresses Max out to no end.
 So, Brooks decides to throw one big awesome game night, which is supposed to be a mystery play. The thing is that it quickly turns out that it is more than what they expected when a couple of thugs burst into the house and kidnap Brooks. At first they all think that it is a part of the game, until it becomes clear that there is much more going on that what they were expecting. In fact this film is so full of twist and turns sometimes it is difficult too work out what is a game and what isn't.
 This film was actually quite a breath of fresh air. Sure, there was a bit of gore in it, which was a shame, but many of the comedies these days seem to simply have to descend into sexual innuendos and lots of flesh, and this wasn't the case here. In a way there was much more innocence about the film, and the characters involved in it. In the end it was really fun, and had some pretty good laughs as well (especially in the office).",Game Night

Were it introduces Max (Jason Bateman) and the cheesy meeting the love of his life Annie (Rachel McAdams) at a bar while having a game competition. Ever since, Max hosts game night with her and their friends. And being a champ at every game night. Until his brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler) who is apparently a successful businessman shows up. And wants to host a game night that will leave everyone with a night to remember. When he stages a murder mystery kidnapping game. When thug's breaks into his house and kidnaps him. Max and his friends are given clues to were the thugs are taking their victim. The film is a lot of fun. There was not one dull scene in there. It has a witty well-written script that made every character fun. The humor was stupid and hilarious. The cast ensemble was great. Jason Bateman's character is a guy who is always set at winning until his brother shows up which destroys his ego. Rachel McAdams is a loving supportive girlfriend and charming. Brooks (Kyle Chandler) is an ego centric, arrogant type of guy who tries to show off. Max's friends that are involved in the game are Ryan (Billy Magnusson) who shows up every week to game night with a different date of a not so bright girl. Until he brings a coworker that is smarter than he is. Then, there is a married couple that are childhood sweethearts Kevin (Lamorne Morris) and Michelle (Kylie Bunbury). Were they had a break in there relationship and Michelle had a secret in there relationship which she apparently slept with a celebrity. At last, there is Max's neighbor Gary (Jesse Plemons) an awkward, humorless, and obsessed policeman. Especially, after his wife left him. Max stopped inviting him to game night cause they could not stand his weird awkward behavior. Directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein kept the pace well moving. It is filled with dumb humor. It messes with the concept of a murder mystery game almost similar to clue. Until, the pieces of the plot comes together. When the characters cannot tell if the kidnapping is serious or just one of Brook's messed up joke. Overall, Game Night is a good comedy film. Plot may start out convoluted.

34,Floated2,Surprisingly entertaining,8,7 July 2019,"There seem to be lesser great R rated comedies nowadays, or at least films that are strictly R rated comedies (not including superhero comedies or action comedies). And although Game Night isn't completely a comedy, as it's more of a action or thriller comedy, it still somewhat fits as it provides some laughs and is overall entertaining.More so enjoyable and thrilling than funny. But what makes the film good is that the comedy isn't over the top, and isn't raunchy and filled with constant sexual jokes, as we see in many R rated comedies nowadays. Forced and over the top humour typically results in more misses than hits.Filled with several twists in the end and with a plot that was actually quite entertaining and made to be kept watching to see what happens next.The chemistry between both leads of Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdama works surprisingly well, as Rachel McAdams isn't her typical over the top and annoying unlikable character she typically portrays. Bateman is his typical character but here it works as a major reason is the writing compliments his style.Overall, Game Night exceeded expectations as it was better than originally thought of.

35,eddie_baggins,Mainstream comedy done right,8,22 February 2018,"While unlikely to ever be regarded as a classic side-splittingly hilarious comedy kingpin, Game Night is a refreshing and original mainstream experience, which is far and away the best high-profile Hollywood comedy to come our way in sometime. Directed by Horrible Bosses writing duo and Vacation director's John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, Game Night takes the one-time nerd only board game night to the big-time as we find ourselves a part of a games night with a difference as Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdam's game loving couple Max and Annie and their collection of friends find themselves trying to rescue Max's successful brother Brooks (played brilliantly against type by Kyle Chandler) from a real-life hostage situation. It's a high concept central idea and one that works thanks to Daley and Goldstein's assured and often imaginatively constructed direction and the ability for the film to both not take itself too seriously or not playing to the lowest common denominators. It feels like many moons since a comedy of this ilk wasn't filled with unnecessary profanities, sex jokes and loud-mouthed side characters but thankfully Game Night largely avoids these comedic pitfalls and just focuses itself on telling a genuinely good story with a large collection of jokes that work on their own merits. It's great to see Daley and Goldstein advance from their Horrible Bosses writing breakthrough and the relative misfire of their updating of the Vacation series as Game Night is without question the most assuredly filmed Hollywood comedy in sometime.David Fincher himself would be proud as the duo give the film a visual flair and pizazz not often found in such genre films, from the way in which they shoot some establishing shots like a real-life board game or an eye-popping keeping's off sequence in a glamorous house, Game Night is filled with visual gems that when combined with Drive and Neon Demon composer Cliff Martinez's score, create a memorable mood and setting. Coinciding with Daley and Goldstein's wins is the work of the films cast. Jason Bateman is as Jason Batemany as you'd expect but surrounded by the likes of Rachel McAdams (who looks like she's never had this much fun) and a downright hilarious Jesse Plemon's as Max and Annie's super awkward and potentially serial-killer like neighbour Gary, the whole cast elevate each other's work to a level that makes you hope this isn't the last game night we will be spending with this colourful bunch. Final Say - Like any good games night, Daley and Goldstein's film provides a lot of fun, laughs and genuinely memorable times. Game Night is Hollywood comedy filmmaking done right and by avoiding the problems that have faced its recent cohorts (overlong running times, unnecessary vulgarity, annoying characters); Game Night becomes a highly recommendable night out at the movies. 4 Fabergé egg's out of 5",Game Night
36,TheMovieDiorama,"Game Night, much to my surprise, is the best American pure comedy since 'Bridesmaids'.",8,7 March 2018,"I say ""pure"" just because 'The Nice Guys' was funnier but that was a cacophony of genres. Honestly though, I wasn't expecting to like this at all! Guys...I actually nearly cried with laughter at one point. What's happened to me!? A competitive couple invite their friends over for a game night where Max's more successful brother decides to host his own game night that will be ""one to remember"". An interactive role-playing mystery game quickly stumbles into the surreal where actually the whole scenario could be real. Think of this as a comedic version of David Fincher's 'The Game'. A rather fresh premise that seamlessly blends thrills with consistent laugh out loud moments. And boy did I laugh! An end result consisting of dark humour, the occasional unexpected twist and more film references than iMDB itself. There was a scene where I thought to myself ""wow, this is like the scene from Taken 3"" and I kid you not they actually say ""like Liam Neeson from Taken 3?"". Never felt so satisfied in all my life. The acting is nothing special, aside from Rachel McAdams who surprised me with her dialogue execution, everyone else just performed their usual comedy-selves. Y'know, Jason Bateman doing the same old thing that he does. However, it's the sharp script that elevates this above the rest. Jokes about race, unfaithfulness and wealth managed to inject personality to these characters. Adding the visual humour, like haphazardly removing a bullet from an arm and removing a blood stain from a white dog, was the Yahtzee moment so to speak. Like a game of Cluedo, the plot leaves you guessing as you try to figure out if everything is staged or not which adds to the fun of this flick. And that's exactly what Game Night is, fun. I would've liked the role-playing game to be progressed further and the third act does lose momentum with a few jokes not landing entirely. Yet, this film has taught me a valuable lesson. Roll the dice and give every film a chance, you might strike lucky and win the jackpot.",Game Night
37,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Fresh premise, clever dialogue and a fun blend of comedy and thriller elements",8,7 June 2018,"Good comedies come down to good premises with fresh ideas and ""Game Night"" offers exactly that. Something of a comedic version of David Fincher's 1997 thriller ""The Game,"" a group of friends who get together for regular game nights agree to up the stakes with a kidnapping mystery that suddenly becomes a little too real. Directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein wrote another one of the more original comedies of the decade in 2011's ""Horrible Bosses"" and though Mark Perez (""Accepted"") gets sole credit for the script, they clearly did rewrites: ""Game Night"" shares a similarly playful yet dark tone. In fact, bouncing between a breezy comedy and a high stakes thriller is their huge accomplishment with this movie.No one needed another Jason Bateman-led upper-middle class comedy, but the ultra-competitive Max (Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams) slightly tilt from the norm. Their in-between newlyweds and parents stage of married life in which they host game nights and try to avoid telling their odd neighbor (the impeccable Jesse Plemons) about them has a high relatability factor. Although the trend is more strategy-based table top games these days as opposed to charades and Pictionary, the spirit is in the right place that the social dynamic at play feels familiar.The action starts when Kyle Chandler comes into town as Max's ""legendary"" older brother and convinces the crew to get behind the lifelike mystery. After the kidnapping occurs, Perez recognizes the audience is completely aware of the main conceit of his film: figuring out what's a game and what's real. Wisely, he toys with us, giving the story some unexpected and fun turns.""Game Night"" jumps in and out of violence and levity, with Daley and Goldstein finding creative ways to give some juice to the action sequences, including a game of ""hot potato"" that appears to be done in a single take and some ordinary contextual shots done in closeups to create a humorous intensity (like shots Edgar Wright used in ""Shaun of the Dead""). They also use these overhead/distance shots that make the characters and setting look like a gameboard and pieces. These little touches don't make the film a better comedy, but they bring a creativity films like this often need. There also several references to games and movies that also contribute to its unique energy. Casting all that aside, however, the dialogue is tight and clever and that humor drives ""Game Night"" too. Not every character is as well-realized and acted as Plemons' Gary, but the ensemble has enough of the right pieces to play the comedy game competitively, especially compared to most of today's comedies~Steven CThanks for reading!

Comedy is always a subjective thing, but I have to say that I laughed a lot whilst watching ""Game Night"". There are a few cruder jokes but mostly its remarkably smart and witty stuff. The couples feel genuine and the relationships real. Also unusually, a lot of the best work isn't in the trailer. . the broader and the visual stuff is, but much of the characterisation and funnier dialogue was kept away.

Soon, Max's brother, Brooks (Chandler) comes to visit and decides to host a game night for them with a mystery theme. When

41,paul-allaer,Mindless fun with the talented Jason Bateman and Rachael McAdams,7,14 March 2018,"""Game Night"" (2018 release; 100 min.) brings the story of Max and Annie and their game night friends. In the movie's quick and fun opening montage, we see hoe Max and Annie meet at a Trivia Night and eventually marry (all while Queen's Don't Stop Me plays). Fast forward to today: Max and Annie have trouble conceiving. Meanwhile Max's brother Brooks, with whom Max has a fierce rivalry, is back in town, and invites the Game Night gang over for a game night of.... ""something different"", he promises, ""where you can't tell the real from the fake"". Soon thereafter, two burglars crash into his house and seem to attack and abduct Brooks. But are they? At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from frequent collaborators/co-writers/co-directors John Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, who most recently brought us ""Vacation"". Here they brings us an R-rated comedy that goes more for the chuckles than the outright laughs. And let me be clear: there are plenty of chuckles, and even some outright laughs. The movie benefits enormously from the obvious chemistry between the two leads, Jason Bateman (as Max) and Rachel McAdams (as Annie). The long scene where Annie tries to remove a bullet from Max's arm after she accidentally shot him, is pure gold, and that alone is worth the price of admission. There are plenty of other moments. Check out McAdams as she dances along to Third Eye Blind's ""Semi-Charmed Life"", just infectious. True, the plot is at once way too complicated yet utterly predictable, but do we really watch a movie like ""Game Night"" for the plot? I didn't think so... Before you know it, the movie has flown by. No, this isn't a 'serious' movie that is looking for any Oscar nominations. I was in the mood for some mindless fun, and ""Game Night"" delivered exactly at that level. Last but not least, there is a ton of great music in the film, both as to the song placements and the original electronic score, courtesy of Cliff Martinez (who seems to be everywhere these days).""Game Night"" opened wide a few weeks ago. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely, and people in the audience clearly enjoyed themselves. If you are in the mood for some mindless fun while enjoying the talents of Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams, I encourage you to check out ""Game Night"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Game Night
42,jtindahouse,A rare comedic masterpiece,10,5 March 2018,"Sometimes it takes you days after seeing a film to decide whether you liked it, sometimes it takes you until the final scene, sometimes it takes you an hour, however with 'Game Night' I knew within minutes I was in for a brilliant ride. The film starts off hilariously and not only does it never ease off, it continues to ramp things up until the very end. Firstly, the story is so much fun. There are so angles it comes at you from (not only do we have a kidnapping mystery of sorts, we have three seperate couples all approaching it from different angles with their individual shenanigans going on). There is hardly a weak scene to be found and if one joke doesn't land, sure enough there's another hilarious one to make up for it seconds later.Secondly, the cast were ideally selected. I absolutely love the 'Horrible Bosses' films, but an ironic weakness in those films is how much star-power there is in the cast. It leads people to think that the actors carried the film, rather than the brilliant story and writing. Here there is a more understated cast, but that works even better for the film. They're equally hilarious, but you focus more on what they're actually saying. Jesse Plemons stole the show for me. I don't love him in everything he's in, but here he was absolutely perfect. Needless to say he steals every scene he's in.It's incredibly rare for me to give a comedy film a perfect score on this site, and I'll admit I wrestled back and forth between a '9' and a '10' but ultimately decided on the latter because I just had such a great time with this one. Please if you're in any way on the fence about seeing this one, don't hesitate. It really is a work of genius.",Game Night
43,Turfseer,Fast-paced action farce rivals The Hangover for top clever concept honors,7,4 March 2018,"Sometimes all you need is a wonderfully clever concept to make a fairly successful comedy and screenwriter Mark Perez has done that here. Like The Hangover, which focused on the repercussions of a night out of bingeing, Game Night too concentrates on a night out--this time one of mayhem involving game aficionados caught up in real-life, life-threatening suspense.The protagonists are neatly drawn farcical characters, gamers Max (Justin Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams) whose whirlwind romance and ensuing marriage are depicted in the opening sequence of the film. Once they've settled into married life, we learn that Annie has been having trouble getting pregnant due to Max's low sperm count (their doctor suggests that Max's lifelong competition with his older more successful brother Brooks is responsible for the stress that has impacted his ability to impregnate his wife).Nonetheless, the games must proverbially go on, as their Friday night gathering with friends takes place on cue. The friends include a black couple, Kevin (Lamorne Morries) and Michelle (Kylie Bunbury) and Ryan (Billy Magnussen) who's brought along his co-worker Sarah (Sharon Horgan) as what he believes to be a date. Their enjoyment of games such as Charades or Trivial Pursuit is interrupted when brother Brooks arrives and promptly humiliates Max by recounting an embarrassing incident in Max's childhood. When Brooks proposes an interactive role-playing mystery game at a house he's rented, with the winner getting the keys to his Stingray, Max and Annie are more than game to accept his proposal, as they are bent on getting back at him for the earlier humiliation. Before all hell breaks loose, we also meet Max and Annie's next door neighbor Gary (Jesse Plemons), a former game participant, now ostracized by the group due to his separation from his wife.The fun begins when Brook's hired actor playing an FBI agent is assaulted by two masked intruders who turn out to be real-life thugs. They in turn, much to his surprise, kidnap Brooks, leaving Max and Annie and their group unaware that Brook's game is no longer being played by his hired actors. While Kevin and Michelle follow clues left by Brooks, Max and Annie try to locate Brooks using his phone's GPS,, while Ryan and Sarah attempt to make contact with the company Brooks conscripted to play out his interactive fantasy.Each of the couples as well as Gary have their moments of mirth, some more successful than others. The banter between Max and Annie, referencing their love of gamesmanship, makes them an engaging team throughout the narrative but not all the physical comedy works. The mishap where Annie accidentally shoots Max and his subsequent machinations in attempting to deal with the injury, proves routine and predictable.Kevin and Michelle have a nice payoff with the extended ""Denzel Washington"" joke. Here Michelle relates a story where she had a fling with the famed actor only to discover it was a case of mistaken identity. Ryan's joke about rich people hiring lower-class denizens for underground fight clubs comes to fruition when the group comes upon such a scenario in their attempt to steal a MacGuffin that will possibly save the kidnapped Brooks. But little is done with Ryan and Sarah's interaction-the joke here is that she merely finds him a boor and announces officially to the group that they are not a couple!There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep one's interest throughout, including the groups foray to Gary's house to use his computer to learn the identity of the man using the alias Marlon Freeman. There's a rather long-winded not-so-funny sequence of Max dripping an excessive amount of blood on Gary's dog and perhaps one too many closeups on Gary himself as his obsession with trying to get back into Max and Annie's group goes on for a little too long.Things pick up again as the group plays ""catch me if you can"" as they steal that Fabergé egg from Donald Anderton's house (aka Marlon Freeman), an apparent rival of The Bulgarian, the menacing underworld figure whom Brooks has run afoul of. More surprises are in store when Gary temporarily ""saves"" Max and Annie as part of a new game he's made up, only to be felled by a real-life shot from the Bulgarian's henchman. No need to chronicle the ending which involves Max and Annie's successful effort to save Brooks and stop The Bulgarian. In addition to the plot's resolution, the internal arc of Max and Brook's conflict is also resolved, with Brooks confessing to a life of being insecure and acting the way he did out of jealousy of Max. Furthermore, Gary survives and is restored to Max and Annie's group. Life's lessons are learned by Brooks as well as the group, who needed to take Gary back in to become whole again. Game Night is well acted throughout and although not all of the jokes hit the mark, the overall concept and execution of the clever plot, puts this farce up there with the more successful ones released in recent years.",Game Night

The script is clever and funny, and the cast uniformly excellent. Since the whole premise is based on the audience not knowing what's game and what's real, spoilers would be hard to avoid in any further commentary.

This is a very funny comedy about couples that get together on a regular basis to have a game night. Sometimes, it's board games. Other times, it may be charades or trivia contests. Anyway, Jason and Rachel are a very competitive married couple that usually hosts the game nights-they usually play in two person teams against each other. Kyle plays Jason's more successful, more handsome, more everything brother that loves rubbing his success in his little brothers face. Kyle comes to visit Jason and decides to host the next game night. He tells everyone that there will be a kidnapping and the object of the game is to find and save the kidnapped person. The winning prize is Kyles' fancy sports car, which, of course, Jason really, really wants. The catch? The participants will have no idea about what is real or fake. Jesse plays Jason's next door neighbor that has been outcast from the game nights-his wife recently left him and it would throw off the couples teamwork. Plus, he is creepy as all get out and does a fantastic job of playing creepy. This is one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time and make sure that you stay until the very end, after the end credits. There is a scene that shows what happened to Jesse's wife.
It's rated ""R"" for language, sexual content-no nudity-and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.

56,kluseba,Party hardy,7,7 March 2018,"Game Night is an entertaining ride but nothing truly memorable that needs to be revisited. It's an over-the-top comedy movie with a healthy dose of action and suspense. The story revolves around competitive gamers Annie and Max who recently got married and who organize game nights with their friends. After having been out of town for a whole year, Max's brother Brooks attends one of their game nights and offers to organize the next one himself. The couple reluctantly agrees because they feel Brooks simply wants to show off and humiliate his brother but they still want to give him a chance. On the next game night, Brooks announces that he has organized an interactive role-play game and that one of them is going to be kidnapped and that the others have to find that person. The price for the potential winner is a vintage car that Max really wants to get. Some time after, masked intruders get inside Brooks' house, beat him up and kidnap him. However, Annie and Max soon realize that things didn't go as planned and that Brooks was actually kidnapped for real. Along with two other couples and their strange police neighbor, Annie and Max try to save Brooks and uncover the mysteries behind the kidnapping.Game Night has several things going for it. First of all, the plot is quite quirky and offers a lot of situation comedy, a solid dose of action and tension and a series of twists in the final third that are often predictable but still well-executed. Secondly, the movie has a great pace, spending only as much time as necessary to introduce all characters and settings before the final hour quickens up the pace and never slows down again. Thirdly, some of the characters have depth and are sympathetic which is the case for Max who has intense competitive struggles with his brother, his smart and tough wife Annie, his dishonest but repentant brother Brooks and the mentally unstable neighbor Gary whose beloved wife recently left him. Finally, some of the situation comedy is truly funny and memorable and especially the dramatic final twenty minutes are perfectly executed.On the other side, Game Night also has some weaknesses. First of all, it's at times too exaggerated, for example when three twists building upon one another are revealed in a short period of time. That isn't confusing or funny anymore but simply lazy script writing at that point. Another problem is the fact that while the main characters are interesting, the side characters are extremely shallow. There is a black couple who argues about how the wife has slept with a celebrity. That's literally all you need to know about them and everything they discuss throughout one and a half hours. There is another couple consisting of a good-looking but extremely dumb guy and his more intellectual partner whose only character trait is that she is British. The fact that they don't have any chemistry leads to a few awkward laughs in the beginning but becomes seriously annoying throughout the entire movie. Another element I disliked were the boring and predictable moral lessons in the movie's more serious scenes towards the end. Protect your family, stand by your friends and live an honest life. I almost fell asleep.To keep it short, Game Night is an entertaining ride with lots of humor, a solid dose of action and even an appropriate addition of tension. Instead of watching this film at the cinema, you should rent it and watch it with your friends at home. While the movie is great to watch once, it's nothing memorable that needs to be revisited again. There are similar recent party movies like the brilliant Happy Death Day that are much more original. This movie actually is like a party. It's fun while it lasts but the next day you just want to move on.",Game Night

Many of the funniest moments in the movie are between them, so it essential that they have a good working chemistry. *potential spoilers* The scene where McAdams has to get the bullet out of Bateman's arm is hilarious, probably the funniest part of the movie in my opinion. The script is sharp and delivers on the comedy, having a good script and capable talented actors to deliver it is what's key in a movie like this.

59,truemythmedia,One of the Best Mainstream Comedies in Years,7,10 May 2019,"Originally, I really had no intention of seeing this film in theatres. To me, this looked like a run of the mill comedy; some funny bits, some slower bits, better viewed at home, where I can pause and walk around or grab food if I grow bored. I was pleasantly surprised by how fast paced this movie was; this film was, quite literally, a joke-a-minute movie. I would say 90% of the jokes landed with the audience I saw the film with; some of them were better than others, certainly, but never was the movie slow or boring.
The writing was incredibly tight. Jokes are set up and then brought back multiple times with increasing hilarity almost every time. The humor is rather dark at times, but never so dark that it makes the viewer uncomfortable. The characters were all unique and entertaining, each grew a little bit as the movie went on, but not too much; it's not a serious character drama after all.
Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams had great onscreen chemistry together; their competetive relationship was absolutely hilarious. The supporting cast, whom all had different recurring jokes that worked in with their character's personalities, complimented Bateman and McAdams's chemistry wonderfully, and switching between the different characters every few minutes kept the film feeling fresh and light. Billy Magnussen as the dimwitted Ryan was particularly funny, and though I haven't seen too much of him, I'm sure we will see more. This was one of the better comedies I've seen in a while. The pacing of the script, the actor's chemistry, and the dark humor made light, all worked wonders for this film. It won't win any awards; it's not as moving as last year's ""The Big Sick"", nor quite as irreverent as ""The Hangover"", but it is pretty darn funny.",Game Night

65,jadepietro,Game On,8,7 July 2018,"GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Game on. A fun night out, thanks to its very capable cast. JIM'S REVIEW: Who doesn't like to play games? Game Night takes this favorite past-time and turns it on its head. Mixing elements from mystery and action genres, this dark comedy is lotsa fun, even if the logics of its plot fall apart rather quickly. Well directed by John Frances Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, the film is always entertaining, largely due to the expert comic timing of its cast.Max and Annie Davis (Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams) have long been gamers. In fact, it was their love of games that brought them together. They regularly meet with friends for a night of friendly competition. Their weekends always include game night at the Davis' house and regular guests include married couple Kevin and Michelle (Lamorne Morris and Kylie Bunbury) and singles-minded Ryan (Billy Magnussen) with his ever-changing gaming partner. Tonight his new date is Sarah (Sharon Horgan). However, always excluded now is ther recently divorced neighbor and police officer, Gary (a very funny straight-faced Jesse Plemons). The teams are invited for an evening of oneupmanship to the home of Brooks (Kyle Chandler), Max's more successful and rich brother, who sets up a definitive role-playing mystery game that spins out of control and becomes a real-life caper mystery. Secrets and lies are revealed. As the clues pile up and the action becomes more absurd, more villains (Michael C. Hall, Danny Huston) are introduced as all become pawns in this intricate game.Mark Perez takes his interesting premise and establishes likable characters caught in a web of intrigue. His storytelling stretches credibility and the character's deductions of reason only serve to advance a wobbly plot. But the slapstick repeatedly hits the mark, especially by its two very capable leads. (Love that squeaky toy!) Both Mr. Bateman and Ms. McAdams make a wonderful tag team. Their banter and hi-jinks play off each other quite well and their comic double takes and reactions elevate the film.Even if the far-fetched story may not completely satisfy, Game Night makes for a nice evening out with many laughs along the way.",Game Night
66,rgkarim,Game On!,7,24 February 2018,"Comedies, another genre that crashes into theaters, like waves crashing on a beach. Whit is often lost in the flood of comedy movies, but every so often, the minds are able to once again give us something fresher to laugh at. Today's flick involved the ever-popular game night, a tradition that works its way into the homes of all ages to help with establishing friendly rivalries, a local watering hole, and the chance to drink and compete. Tonight I finish my reviews with Game Night starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams, which hopes to amp up the stakes of tradition for the chance at big wins and adventure. Let's get started on the review to determine if the house paid. LIKES:-Multiple comedy styles
-An intriguing mystery
-Decent Character Development
-Clever Adventure at times Game Night is a comedy that works well in terms of the multiple styles of comedy packed into the small-time frame of the movie. Slapstick, stupidity, one liners, over the top stunts, and overacted delivery are balanced together to keep things interesting and fun in the 100 minutes or so of content. And while much of this is dumb fun, there is an intriguing mystery to ground it all to a common point and keep things in line. How far does the rabbit hole descend in terms of crime, you'll have to see for yourself, but there are plenty of twists to keep you guessing. Surprisingly, Game Night's players have a little more background than the usual pawns of this genre, with each member dealing with some issue that plagues them. Themes like responsibility, jealousy, and self-worth are all here, gradually expanded upon as the teams try to find the clues to rescuing their kidnapped colleague. It's a clever adventure and gets my two thumbs up in terms of a unique flair. DISLIKES:-Sometimes too stupid
-Tried to Hard
-More Game Night Antics needed No surprise, this movie is jam packed with idiotic antics to tickle the funny bone. At first these gags were good, some of the running jokes building momentum to deliver some well-timed punches. Soon the audience and I started to give pity laughs at the jokes being entirely too stupid, dragging on to levels that made napping look like a better option. Even worse, sometimes the characters tried too hard to be funny, Bateman in particular putting too much behind his delivery. These moments are fairly obvious and start to overshadow the game night qualities I was hoping this movie had. Given all the mysteries, and theme of game night, I had hoped for a little more antics that mirrored the games one usually plays at a game night, like an intense scrabble mystery, or a Jenga like obstacle course. Instead, the movie resorted to the usual stunts and tactics, that while entertaining at times just lacked the originality they could have held. The VERDICT: When it comes to comedies, Game Night wins in terms of the variety of comedic ploys it unleashes in such a short time frame. With an intriguing mystery and some decent character development, you will get a decent adventure compared to most other ridiculous comedies that grace the theater. Still, Game Night suffers from overacted antics and stupidity that gets stale quickly, lacking that full-on game night cleverness you might have expected. It is a start mind you, but there is plenty to work with should a second game night be picked up should it make enough money this weekend. As much fun as this movie is, I can suggest a trip to the theater for this one for a group night out, but otherwise hold out until the rental services get it. My scores are:
Comedy/Crime/Mystery: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.5",Game Night

68,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Game Night,7,24 February 2018,"Game Night is my latest review. It's not really a black comedy for it's too cheery for that. ""Night"" is more blackish, a light comedic romp.The laughs in Game Night aren't of the belly variety but there's plenty of snorts and chuckles to garner my recommendation. No one truly seems in peril despite incidents of gunshots, kidnappings, and fistfights. Basically ""Night"" never lets you take it too seriously. It's wholly original buffoonery that just wants to have fun.Jason Bateman is in the lead. He plays yet another sad sack everyman. Bateman channels this type of role in a lot of his farces. With his congenial looks and his breakneck style of delivering lines, Game Night seems like it gives him the best, most comfortable fit. Dare I say that ""Night"" is the exemplary Jason Bateman vehicle.The story of ""Night"" revolves around a married couple named Max and Annie (Bateman and Rachel McAdams). Having in common an incredibly cutthroat nature, they invite other couples over for charades, board games, and plenty of chips and salsa. One weekend, everyone changes it up a bit and goes over to the house of Max's brother (Brooks played by Kyle Chandler). Brooks decides to turn a normal ""game night"" into a real-life murder mystery. Just imagine a combo of violent abductions, slapstick encounters, and scavenger hunts.Of note: I'm not sure why ""Night"" has been saddled with an R rating. It's not completely vehement, I don't remember hearing any F words, and there's not much in the way of sexual innuendo. I mean, a teenager wouldn't even flinch if they saw it.Anyway, Game Night will resonate if you've seen stuff like Horrible Bosses or 1987's Adventures in Babysitting. It has mild twists and turns and some aerial shots that actually look like objects in the game of Monopoly. ""Night"" also has neat closing credits that are humorous and don't involve outtakes (that's a refreshing change). A lot of the characters in ""Night"" spew movie references from material like The Green Mile, The Sixth Sense, Pulp Fiction, and Django Unchained. Normally, I find this adage tired and stock but surprisingly it adds to ""Night's"" peppy charm.Bottom line: Would I call Game Night a comedy classic? Probably not but I did enjoy it. Would I say that it's a good way to get to the theater and escape those late winter blues? Definitely. ""Game on!"" Rating: 3 stars.",Game Night
69,Kingslaay,Entertaining and decent,7,3 March 2018,An easy to watch comedy that never goes overboard despite pushing the envelope a lot. A lot of comedy films try too hard or too little and the jokes fall flat. Game Night is quite simple and packed full of laughs. The jokes work really well and the journey is hilarious to watch. Watching a normal couple and their friends getting into all sorts of trouble is quite a laugh. The beauty of the film is the not knowing what is real and what is a game. There was also a good use of symbolism if anyone picked that up with the game board streets transforming into real streets. Not an Oscar contender but serves one of the primary purposes of films which is to have a great experience7/10,Game Night
70,eric262003,Funny With a Hint of Unpredictability,9,11 June 2019,"""Game Night"" centres around an enthusiastic group of sociable party goers who love to game while but somehow unexpectedly get trapped in a world of danger as the game progresses. The film starts to play off as a comedy, but it escalates into more darker territory where the fun becomes more macabre. Under the penmanship of Mark Perez and directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, the scenes are always unpredictable to the point where it becomes surprisingly intense but the scenes are always entertaining and never once does it ever meander.The leading couple are Max and Annie Davis (Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams) who gets the neighbours to participate in their nightly games they set-up. Their marriage was brought on due to games that is implied by the opening montage like Scrabble, Pictionary, charades and more. The participants in their game include Annie's air-headed friend Ryan Huddle (Billy Magnussen) and Sarah Darcy (Sharon Horgan) who's Ryan's date who seems quite intelligent. Then there's Kevin and Michelle Sterling (Lamonie Morris and Kylie Bunbury) who are a husband and wife pairing and Max's distant but very rich brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler) who wants to host game night at his estate that he is renting.While at the house, Brooks gets the guests involved in an interactive role-playing mystery game and places a bit of a wager, that whoever can solve the mystery will awarded with his Stingray. This kind of game pays homage to the old school murder mystery dinner parties that were quite popular in the 1980's. As a whole ""Game Night"" gets it audience involved on a wild, crazy ride where there's moments of slapstick, intensity and moments that simply erupt into utter chaos.Unfortunately, Brooks gets abducted and all the other guests assume that it's all part of the game. If that doesn't get your spine chilled there is even a threat of murder from an evil-sounding deviant if the guests don't hand over a precious Faberge egg leading up to the couples to split up and find the relic while their paths continue to recross and diverge from time to time.Sure other movies like ""The Game"" among others tried this formula of carefree fun turning unexpectedly dangerous with the twists and turns that come along before. However, ""Game Night"" have some twists that work, not all, but you'll really get a kick out of the psychology within the characters Perez creates in his script and the self-discoveries that each character endures as they go on this game that has become a quest for survival. We get a better understanding why Max and Brooks hate each other and the heartbreak as to why Max and Annie can't have a child and the other events from their pasts that has haunted them for years. There's suspicion about whether Michelle has always been faithful to Kevin which has been bothering him for a long time. There's even great character development from the supporting cast members who aren't in on the game including Jeffrey Wright as am FBI agent, Danny Huston as a lowlife, Michael C. Hall as an intimidating criminal who only goes by The Bulgarian and Jesse Plemons as a cop who's neighbours to Max and Annie who wants to be parts of Max and Annie's game plans. The characters in the movie are not all who they appear to be under first impression.The movie is practically the perfect film for adults and truly has something for everyone including a high-adrenaline induced car chase, a violent scene that lead to one of the characters having surgery and a orgy cult like party that pays homage to the 1999 classic ""Eyes Wide Shut"", but it's still bombarded with issues from the characters like aging, sibling rivalry and being unfaithful. The best performances come from Bateman and McAdams who seem to have a better understanding of each other almost as though they were a married couple. Plemons steals every scene he's in even though his character is played as filler most of the time. Through all the tense moments, it never goes by way of melancholy or preachy.Though many comedies of this calibre goes by way of becoming formulaic, Daley and Goldstein ensure you they've got the tone under control. The upbeat chemistry between Bateman and McAdams benefits to the plot the way a comedy should be executed. And sure characters seem to get hurt in situations can seem deadly in the real world, still find the composure to fight back and play the game. The props used to slow down the characters are used as wake-up to inject some sense into them. This was a surprisingly good film that went beyond my expectations.",Game Night
71,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Game Night""- A wild and farcical dark-comedy with great imagination and near-endless charm!",9,7 March 2018,"Sitting in the theater watching ""Game Night"", a new dark-comedy from directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, I was pleasantly finding myself reminded of many a great film from yester-year. A high-concept laugh-riot, the film in a lot of ways has a really fun, kitschy quality that hearkens back to similarly toned flicks of the 80's. It's quite fascinating- the day before I went and saw the film spur-of-the-moment, I had just-so-happened to watch the amusing 1985 film-adaptation of the board-game ""Clue."" And in a lot of ways, ""Game Night"" almost feels like a sort-of spiritual successor to that film, except brought more up-to-date and benefiting a more modern cast, including the delightful Jason Bateman and a surprisingly hilarious Rachel McAdams.The film follows married couple Max (Bateman) and Annie (McAdams)- who met in no small part thanks to their obsession with games and trivia, and fell in love over a shared competitive nature. The two hold a regular game-night in their home with friends (Billy Magnussen, Sharon Horgan, Lamorne Morris, Kylie Bunbury), and are also looking to finally start a family, even if Max might not quite be ready yet to be a dad. However, their weekly game-night is thrown a bit amiss with the arrival of Max's successful billionaire-brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler), who hijacks the event and arranges for the group to take part in an interactive role-playing mystery game in which they must solve a ""kidnapping."" ...Except the mystery becomes all too real when some of Brooks' clients just so happen to arrive at the start of the game and actually kidnap him! With the group thinking it's all ""part of the game,"" the stage is set for a hilarious adventure as they try to solve the mystery and as a result, get pulled into a deep web of conspiracy.The great success of ""Game Night"" lays in its expert handling of such a potentially goofy concept. In lesser hands, the film could have easily imploded and fallen apart under its own weight, as it does have a degree of implausibility and requires a moderate suspension of disbelief. However, writer Mark Perez and directors Daley and Goldstein strike an absolutely perfect balance, allowing you to completely go with the ludicrous premise and buy into its many twists and turns. The film accomplishes this by playing up both the farcical humor and the genuine thrills in equal and carefully balanced measure, transitioning between the two tones with ease from scene to scene. The film establishes early that it has a degree of ""cartoon logic"" in application, yet also has real stakes and real danger at play. It's a juggling act- but one that works.I was also very taken with the incredible degree of creativity and craft that Daley and Goldstein inject into the film. The direction is just sublime, with many wild choices made that aid in the film's unique tone. The most noticeable of course being how the movie is often framed to resemble games of various types and genres, with stunning use of the tilt-shift photographic technique to give establishing shots a miniaturized ""board game"" effect and mounted camera angles during the action set-pieces that make the sequences closely resemble a modern first-person shooter or racing game. I've seen some complaints about the handling of the visual direction, but for the life of me, I can't see why. And frankly, I think those complaints are utter hogwash. Directorially, this is one of the more fluid and creative mainstream comedies of the past decade.The cast shines and creates a wonderful ensemble for us to follow. Fans of Jason Bateman will find a lot to like, as his dorky, identifiable ""everyman"" performance hits home once again. Chandler, Magnussen, Horgan, Morris and Bunbury round out the supporting characters quite nicely, and every single one is given equal opportunity to shine and stretch their comedic chops. But shockingly, the most respect must go to two specific performers that took me by surprise in the best of ways. First, is the adorable Rachel McAdams, who proves to be an absolute comedic bombshell! Most will remember her from a slew of romantic dramas with only the occasional odd comedy or thriller tossed in. Here, she goes for it in a way she hasn't before, and she's just great. She's bubbly, cute and got some genuine big laughs from me. A very happy surprise. And then there's Jesse Plemons. Oh, boy. He steals the show. While his role is relatively minor, portraying a creepy, monotone neighbor whose seemingly obsessed with Max and Annie, he's just abso-freaking-lutely hysterical. Those who only know of him from his heady dramas and his turn on the excellent ""Breaking Bad"" are in for a treat!In the end, there's really not much at all I can say to the detriment of ""Game Night."" While it maybe takes one-too-many left-turn twists towards the end and has a few odd jokes that fall flat, for the most part, it's a resounding success thanks to its excellent cast, original premise and top-notch direction. It's a charmer and a definite treat during the usual cinematic dead-period of January through March. And it comes with the highest of recommendations. Even if the admittedly-weak trailers didn't sell you on it, I'd still say give it a shot. I did, and I adored every second of it! I'm giving ""Game Night"" an excellent 9 out of 10.",Game Night

74,Troy_Campbell,"An amusing adults-only comedy, but no game changer.",6,26 February 2018,"Another adults-only comedy from the makers of Horrible Bosses, Game Night is the latest in a long line of films operating within the ordinary-people-become-embroiled-in-crime subgenre. Putting a murder-mystery game-within-a-game spin on proceedings, it's essentially David Fincher's The Game with crude humour, which is exactly as good or bad as that sounds, depending on your tastes. Writer Mark Perez and directors John Francis Daly and Jonathan Goldstein certainly don't hold back in their attempt to garner laughs. They throw everything from impersonations and horror parody to visual jokes and gross-out humour into the mix. It's hit and miss at best, but when it's funny it's really funny; a gag-inducing bullet extraction and a hilariously slow negotiation involving a dim-witted philanderer trying, and failing, to play hardball are a couple of memorable sequences almost worth the price of admission on their own. Unfortunately there are also plenty of clangers littered throughout-plus a completely misjudged subplot that tries to inject a message about growing up-that create sizeable laugh-free portions of the movie, especially in the final act. As the married couple who host the titular weekly event, Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams are a hoot when playing off each other. His straight-faced quips and her bubbly/snarky barbs are an ideal match, so hopefully they share the screen again soon. As far from being a game changer as it is from being a complete dud, Game Night is an amusing diversion that'll be most enjoyed with an alcoholic beverage or two.",Game Night
75,blumdeluxe,A better mainstream title,7,14 March 2020,"""Game Night"" tells the story of an evening that gets out of control when what seems to be a fun little event among friends suddenly turns into a kidnapping case.In most aspects this is a pretty average film. It has a cast that carries a certain quality and guarantees an audience, delivers rather easy accesable humor that is not surprisingly clever and has the looks of your average, short-living cinema feature. However, this is one of the rare cases where this mixture actually worked for me. This is not a classic or something brave by any means but it is entertaining and I guess that was the main concern of producers. Not a film to show in classrooms or to write philosophical essays about but a nice watch on a rainy evening after a hard day of work.All in all this does not need to be given awards but it speaks for the producers that they manage to avoid an overly cringy atmosphere and made this into a pleasant watch with a few pretty solid jokes instead.",Game Night

But the older brother who's cooler, richer and more handsome turns out to be a criminal and he's in trouble with a bulgarian mob because he sold his million-dollar egg to another man who paid more and he turns out to be Michael C. Hall and it was a great surprise to see him. They broke in the mansion of the guy who had the egg and they were having a rich people fight club party. They stole the egg and brought it to the Bulgarian. Gary showed up at the scene because he knew sth was wrong when he saw the search the younger brother made on his police computer and stained with blood all over his marital souvenirs and his dog because he got shot by his wife at the bar while they thought they were saving his brother. The chasing the plane scene was great when Michael C. Hall took the older brother to rip him open to get the paper from the egg which he swallowed. They saved him, he was put under house arrest and was enjoying game nights at his new old house with Gary. Max ( Jason Bateman) thought he's not doing any worse than his seemingly too cool and successful brother and there were people with guns aiming at them outside the house. I like Jason Bateman but the side characters were a lot more fun such as the officer, the dumb guy dating the Irish girl was being dumb so real and the Black couple fighting over woman having slept with a fake Danzel Washington.",Game Night

They regularly hold themed nights for their friends and these nights range from Charades to Pictionary. When Max's brother turns up (Kyle Chandler) he wants to take things to the next level and attempts to host a murder mystery night. Unfortunately things go spiraling out of control and the group of friends end up mixed up in a bigger murder mystery than they initially planned on being part of.This is a decent and refreshing romantic/comedy/action film (a rom-com-act or maybe a rom-act-com?). Unlike a lot of recent films it doesn't take itself too seriously and try to be bigger than it actually is. It stays within the remits of its genre and just enjoys being a fun movie. There are plenty of tried and tested events in the plot which make viewers feel comfortable, but there are also a few injections of new scenarios to keep viewers on their toes. Some might criticize it for not being original enough - but it was never going to be an epic film that gets talked about for years; it's just harmless fun to suspend disbelief to. There are a few twists and turns to keep even the most pessimistic viewer on their toes, and decent pacing too; you get to enjoy the movie in line with the characters on screen. Some of the twists and turns, and likewise some of the scenarios in the film are guessable, but again, I reiterate, this isn't a Hollywood epic - it's just for fun.The cast is pretty decent without being outstanding; Bateman and McAdams shine the brightest with a great supporting cast. There is plenty of character development and growth for the two central characters of Max and Annie, but the rest of the cast are intentionally not too deep and complex so they just help become a vehicle for Max and Annie's maturation.The humour was very middle-of-the road, not too highbrow but also not too crass either. There were some slapstick and bloody moments but all in all it was decent fun. I'm hard to please when it comes to comedy, and while I did not laugh out loud from scene to scene, I did find some amusement in parts so it definitely fits the bill as a comedy film. I'm sure other people would find a lot more laughter from this than I did; this isn't the films fault, that's my fault for having hard to reach tastes. The general look and feel of the movie is clean and polished - I particularly liked the zoomed shots which at first look like an overview of a games board with pewter pieces, but as the zoom develops clearly shows reality.Not normally one for these types of films I actually enjoyed it, and as such I'm willing to give this a decent 6 out of 10. I didn't feel as though I'd been cheated out of the time I invested watching this, and I found myself occasionally chuckling along with it. Harmless and decent fun - let the games begin.",Game Night

83,aciessi,Time to Play.,7,27 February 2018,"Checkmate.It's the middle of February. An innocuous sounding New Line Cinema-brand comedy called Game Night comes out starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams. At this time of year, Hollywood doesn't normally put out it's best from it's yearly lineup. Coming off of the heels of Black Panther, anyone with any idea of theater-going politics would assume that Game Night would bomb terribly and partly for good reason.. It's not funny. Well, perhaps it's box-office numbers will provide it's predictable returns, but on the contrary, Game Night is a fantastic dark comedy. Something I entirely unexpected.Game Night is Clue, meets David Fincher's ""The Game"". Dark comedy, this is. Through the laughs, you are put through a real modern day murder-mystery, as only the makers of Horrible Bosses would go about it. The jokes are sharp, sometimes subtle and exhibit a high level of creativity. Unusual for big budgeted comedies that usually play it safe with gross-out sex and fart humor. We wonder if Max and Annie, the masters of board and trivia game parties could finagle their way out of a real life board game in which there is no ""get out of jail free"" card, saying ""Sorry"" isn't enough and could result in a painful ""Operation"".. ah thank you. The rest of the cast delivers the goods. Stand out performances include Billy Magnussen as the stunningly dumb blonde, Ryan, who thinks that a hefty bargain is 17 dollars. Jesse Plemons, as the tragic and creepy Gary is by far the most mesmerizing and the most hilarious character of the film. He never takes off his cop uniform, he holds his adorable West Highland terrier wherever he goes and he has a shrine dedicated to the wife that dumped him. He's so memorable, he's practically a halloween costume in the making.Game Night is a load of fun. Silly, clever, awesome fun. That's all you can ever ask for.",Game Night

I heard it was quite a solid comedy and was down for some fun. Trailer looked decent enough, and the film had a good cast to boot. Jason Bateman works so well in comedic roles where he is the everyday straight laced man, and it's ALWAYS nice to see Rachael McAdams. Overall, the film is entertaining and funny; basically everything it should be.The film is about a group of friends who hang out by doing a ""game night"". One time when the main character Max's richer and more successful brother comes to town, game night gets taken up a notch. The game becomes a real life experience with the involvement of dangerous armed man and an exchange for a valuable item. Once the crew realize that the events are no longer part of the game they realize they need to see things out an rescue Max's brother from imminent danger.The film packs laughs in many places. Most comedies these days really fail at doing that. It has a lot to do with the sharp writing and the talented cast performances. I never knew I needed to see Jesse Plemons as the creepy cop who lives next door, but wow he nails it. There are even unexpected twists that don't seem too obvious. It blends humor and action very well. I didn't want the film to end because its never really dull. All the characters are fairly likeable and the film definitely has a re-watchable vibe.I'm interested in future collaborations of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein. They misfired with the Vacation remake, but they crafted a great, smart, and funny film from a premise that is fairly simple. Trailer gives a lot of the best moments away but you will still live the cinema content with this effort. Good choice for a relaxing Saturday evening, I'd say.7.5/10",Game Night

When real kidnappers show up and kidnap Brooks, the clueless couple - and their friends - try to solve what they think is a make believe mystery.As Directed by Daley & Goldstein and with the subtle comedic stylings of Bateman & McAdams, this film succeeds very well in a calm, funny manner. The humorous parts of this film are viewed with kind of a sideways glance vs. the usual temptation to bash the audience over the head with it. It's as if the filmmakers and actors are relying on the intelligence of the audience to mine their humor. It was quite refreshing for me, as an audience member, to be treated with this respect. And...it was darned funny.Joining Bateman and McAdams are Sharon Horgan, Billy Magnussen, Lamorne Morris & Kylie Bunbury as the other 2 couples competing to solve the mystery. All are funny in their own way, but Magnussen rises slightly above the rest for his take on ""the dumb blonde."" But, surprisingly, the person who steals the film is Jessie Plemons as Max & Annie's strange neighbor. Plemons, heretofore known to me only as a dramatic actor, plays his character with such a deadpan earnestness, that I started chuckling whenever he just showed up on the screen - a very good sign, indeed.If you are looking for a good, funny, film (one where you would be comfortable sitting through with your spouse), then run, don't walk to GAME NIGHT, it will be well worth your time.Letter Grade: A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)P.S.: Stay through the end of the credits, it will be worth it.",Game Night

The performances are the highlight of the movie. Jason Bateman is outstanding as Max. Rachel McAdams is spectacular as Annie. Kyle Chandler is excellent as Brooks. Sharon Horgan is great as Sarah. Billy Magnussen is superb as Ryan. Lamorne Morris is awesome as Kevin. Kylie Bunbury is amazing as Michelle. Jesse Plemons is hysterical as Gary. Michael C. Hall, Danny Huston & Chelsea Peretti are brilliant as, The Bulgarian, Donald Anderton & Glenda, respectively. The supporting cast is impressive. Game Night is a must watch for fans of action-comedies. Go & have one hell of a time!",Game Night
91,dave-mcclain,more fun than your typical real-life game night,7,25 February 2018,"""Game Night"" (R, 1:40) is listed on IMDb as a ""comedy crime mystery"". That's a good summary in three words, but here are three more: bloody good time. Max and Annie (Golden Globe winner Jason Bateman and Oscar nominee Rachel McAdams) met in college during a barroom trivia game - and they haven't stopped playing with each other since. They're very competitive and hardly ever lose - at anything. Eventually, they got married and began holding regular game nights in their home, leading to a constant rotation of game night attendees, as their friends presumably got annoyed with Max and Annie always winning - and being kind of obnoxious about it. Their current group of game night friends includes Kevin and Michelle (Lamorne Harris and Kylie Banbury), along with Ryan (Billy Magnussen) - and his dumb blonde of the week (women who are all somehow dimmer than he is). Oh, and Gary (Jesse Plemmons), the cop who lives next door, used to be part of the group... until his wife left him and his natural nerdy, uptight, clingy creepiness rose to disturbing new levels. Now, Max and Annie work very hard to avoid Gary, keep him from knowing when the next game night is, and tell their friends how to get to their home without Gary seeing them.But the focus of the plot is one particular evening - a game night which is different from all those which had come before. For one thing, Ryan's date is meant to be a ringer, a co-worker named Sarah (Sharon Horgan), who's British (which Ryan is convinced automatically makes her smart). This game night is hosted by Max's charming, but mysterious and even more competitive older brother, Brooks (Kyle Chandler) - and the game played will not be of the board variety. Brooks announces to the group that he has hired a company of actors to come in and stage a kidnapping mystery. Enter a fake FBI agent (Jeffrey Wright) to explain the rules - followed by a pair of masked thugs who knock out the first guy, beat up Brooks, bind and gag him and take him away. The game night attendees watch and express how impressed they are with how realistic everything seems, not noticing that Brooks' protestations and pleading eyes are trying to tell them that his abduction isn't part of the game. As everyone works with his or her partner to try solving the mystery (even as Kevin and Michelle have an ongoing argument over the results of an earlier round of ""Never Have I Ever""), the real challenge (temporarily unbeknownst to the participants) is coming to understand that what's happening is real, and then to figure out what's really going on - and what, if anything, they can do to help Brooks and survive the danger to all of them.""Game Night"" is more fun that typical game nights. It's well constructed, creatively shot and terrifically acted (especially by McAdams). The last couple scenes are unnecessary and unentertaining, but the movie's still very enjoyable.

92,bob-the-movie-man,Miss Scarlett at the Airport with the Jet Engine.,8,23 March 2018,"""Game Night"" is an American comedy film starring Jason Bateman (""Horrible Bosses"", ""Central Intelligence"") as Max and Rachel McAdams (""Spotlight"", ""Doctor Strange"") as Annie: two hyper-competitive professionals who invite other couples around to their house for a weekly night of charades and board games. The regulars are long-term couple Kevin and Michelle (Lamorne Morris and Kylie Bunbury) and complete buffoon Ryan (Billy Magnussen, ""The Big Short"") and his revolving door of generally vacant girlfriends. Estranged from the group, after his divorce, is the creepy police officer Gary (Jesse Plemons, ""The Post"", ""American Made"") who lives next door.But Max is not content (affecting the mobility of his fishes!) as he has a severe inferiority complex about his enormously successful and cocky older brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler, ""Manchester by the Sea"") who beats him at EVERYTHING. When Brooks barges into their game night things get heated and after he organises the next game night as ""something different"" things take a sharp left into The Twilight Zone.As befits the quality of most modern American comedy films, its all complete nonsense of course. But actually, this is quite good nonsense. The script by Mark Perez (his first movie script in 12 years!) while following a fairly predictable path early in the film is littered with some good one-liners and funny scenes (a bullet-removal is a high-spot) and includes a memorable twist in the final real that I didn't see coming.Much of this is powered by the chemistry between Bateman and McAdams. McAdams in particular should do more comedy, as she is very adept at it. Playing the one bright spark in a parade of vacuousness, English comedienne Sharon Horgan also adds a butt to Magnussen's one-tone joke very effectively. The surprising comedy player though is Jesse Plemons who I thought was just uncomfortably hilarious.It is normally unusual to find special effects in a film like this, but here the team (headed up by Dean Tyrrell) should be congratulated for some very subtle but effective effects. Most of the long shots in the film of the neighbourhood/streets etc. are of models which only fade to live action as you zoom in. In the opening drone-fly-over of Max and Annie driving home I thought all the housing looked model-like but as we zoomed into them arriving home I thought I must have imagined in. Only in the subsequent scenes did I realise I was right after all! But it's so very subtle. I suspect many of the audience were similarly fooled (and many who've seen the film and are reading this will be still going ""what??"")! There's a kind of explanation for the randomness of these effects during the (very entertaining) end-titles.It's unusual for me to laugh at a comedy so much, but this one I really did. Every comedy film is allowed a little latitude to get the odd strand wrong, and this one is no exception (I didn't think the spat between Kevin and Michelle really worked)... so it's not perfect, but novice directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein (who's only previous film project was 2015's clearly missable ""Vacation"") have pulled off a really entertaining watch here.(For the graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks).",Game Night
93,AngelHonesty,Not bad for a comedy,7,27 December 2020,"The majority of the movie had many scenes that made me laugh, alone with a good action packed paste to keep things going mixed in with a few heartfelt scenes. I loved the cast in the movie, especially how Batemen and McAdams play off of each other, they made a fantastic couple in the film creating some fun humor. It was nice that the movie wasn't over the top with sexual jokes and no nudity for once. But near the end of the movie it started to get exhausting with too many twists leaving me tired and eager for the movie to end. Great start, decent middle, not so great ending.",Game Night
94,springfieldrental,2nd Time is just as good as the First,9,21 March 2018,"The second time seeing this movie--it is that good--was just as enjoyed by me as the first time I saw it. Because of the twists and turns of the plot, punching a ticket for ""Game Night"" for the second time brought out additional elements that, because of its rapid-fire delivery, skimmed over me the first time. The script by Mark Perez is one of the most brilliant screenplays I've witnessed in a long, long time. The insertion of comedy every few seconds presents a streaming line of physical and verbal jousting rarely duplicated in film today. And every actor is cast as if he/she were born to play their parts. Rachel McAdams should be up for Oscar nomination with her hilarious yet understated role of a frustrated wife who wants to get pregnant.  One scene in particular is the sequence showing all cast members handing off to each other a stolen faberge egg in a mansion while be chased by the bad guys. Directors Daley/Goldstein learned their lessons from Kubrick/Scorsese in memorable long tracking shots by creating one of the best one-take sequences on the screen I've witnessed in many a year. Can't say enough about this movie which is still hanging around in the theaters a couple of months after its release, a testimony of how unique it really is.",Game Night
95,kjproulx,A Surprisingly Very Good Comedy,8,23 February 2018,"Good comedies are extremely hard to come by these days. For every great one, there seem to be roughly 20 terrible ones. That's not a great track record to have, but in all fairness, the great ones feel like such a breath of fresh air when they hit theatres and are talked about positively in the public eye. So, I think you can see where I'm going with this. Game Night is one of the best comedies I've seen in quite some time. It doesn't break new grounds in terms of humor, but when a movie can hold your interest and keep you engaged even when there's no comedy in a specific moment, it's doing something right. It's rare for me to say this, but I think you'll be hard-pressed to assume that you'll see a better mainstream comedy in the coming months of 2018. If you're looking for an entertaining ride at the movies, here's why I think you should check out Game Night.Following a group of friends who gather together for a night of board games and charades once a week, they're in a state of shock when an old friend and brother of one of them shows up to play. Giving them an invitation to his place to continue their tradition elsewhere, a murder mystery night turns into a night of twists on top of twists. Are people actually being murdered? Are the double-crossers really double-crossing? These are questions that constantly come up throughout this movie and that's precisely what made it such a good movie as a whole. I loved the fact that it didn't try to come up with stupid jokes as filler.The comedy in Game Night is terrific and very well-written. I found myself laughing both at the humor itself and how writer Mark Perez was able to callback certain moments and extend jokes to make them even funnier as the film progressed. On top of that, this movie is filled with twists on top of twists. Some of them are played for gags and others for either drama or character development. Quite honestly, this is a film that I didn't expect to be as well-written as it was, due to his previous works. Having written movies like Accepted and Herbie Fully Loaded, I was worried that many of the jokes were going to feel juvenile or fall flat on their face, but I was dead wrong. Just goes to show that you can't even truly judge a movie by its trailer anymore, no matter how good or bad it looks.I can't believe I'm going to say this about a silly premise like this, but not only does this movie have a great script in terms of comedy and drama, but this is a unique film from a visual standpoint. Whether they make the town look like a board game or use the camera as a character, Game Night is a very well-shot movie. The way this movie transitions from scene to scene or how it makes you feel like you're watching/playing an elaborate game yourself was very inventive.In the end, I honestly can't think of any glaring issues, other than the fact that many cliched tropes are used in order to make certain plot devices easy to accomplish. Yes, there are a few easy ways out that are taken here, which can definitely lead to some eye-rolling moments from audiences, but that's to be expected for a comedy like this. From the fun premise to the well-executed story overall, and the addition of hilarious gags and surprisingly emotional moments, Game Night is a complete blast. This is the definition of popcorn entertainment that really works. Even though it's not perfect, it's perfect for what it sets out to accomplish, which is to keep its audience engaged.",Game Night
96,AhmedSpielberg99,Awesome concept ......... OK movie,6,15 May 2018,"Let's begin with the positives. With that said, I think it would be fair to start mentioning what grabbed me from the beginning, and it's the cool direction. The visual style is quite polished and cranky. That wasn't just a mere feast for the eyes, but this cool direction also helped to set up the tone for the movie. That tells us this movie would be a slapstick comedy that shouldn't be taken seriously, but it would also has a touch of dark comedies and some smart jokes. And that's what I got ........ sorta!The premise itself is superb! Honestly, I am not a big fan of comedy movies, specially new comedies, but the concept of Game Night is what make me insist to watch it.The movie has some twists and jokes that as smart and genius as its premise. But there are some things that made Game Night a good comedy film but nothing more. 
The chemistry between the actors is what made these smart jokes work. As when these actors don't appear on screen together, there is almost no joke that hit the mark. That's not just because the dialogue between smaller groups of characters isn't as smart as between the more bigger ones, but also because the minor characters, despite the good performances and the different personalities, aren't interesting at all and just not funny!
Kyle Chandler's character, Brooks, is the only secondary character that I found interesting and very funny, and Kyle Chandler's performance made his character even more interesting. 
Jason Bateman was okay specially when I compare his performance to McAdams's. She seemed to me as she hated every single joke she said. Alas, her character has some of the best lines and smarter joke of the movie, and Rachel McAdams just ruined almost every joke with her sluggish delivering of jokes.
But as I talk about uninteresting characters and bad performances, I have to mention the actor that has the most annoying character of the movie, and maybe of all movies I've seen in recent times, and his performance that made this character even more annoying and infuriating. Of course, I'm talking about Jesse Plemons and his character Gary, the king of all tedious characters. You know this character that is so weird, creepy and vague that supposed to be funny, Gary is exactly this character, or at least that's what I should have had instead of a character that kept turning me off every time appeared on the screen. And these times aren't few for a secondary character.Also, after the first act the humor retreated as the comedic set pieces were now and again and half way through the movie they were almost not there. Overall, I liked Game Night but it hasn't lived up to my expectations.(6.5/10)",Game Night
97,Neptune165,The part when he put up 17$ I was dead,6,15 July 2019,"I love how Gary played with our expectations. We are supposed to hate him, and think he's super creepy. But he planned the whole thing to make you think he's such a badass, so he can be included. And we do think he's a badass for a bit, until we learn it was all him. The credits cracked me up, seeing him practice a car slide. This movie was more hilarious than I expected to be. Clever script and a great cast. I actually found it super funny. I laughed a lot. Rachel McAdams was good, but Jesse Plemons's cop character was the stand-out for me. Every line of his just about had me dying. And yes, the camerawork is super cool and inventive! Very refreshing to have a studio comedy that puts effort into the film-making",Game Night
98,brankovranjkovic,Game Night: Black comedy adventure.,7,5 March 2018,"This revolves around a competitive couple who host a weekly game night with friends, but without the creepy cop neighbour!. One evening we see three couples arrive and the host's older successful brother, each couple have their own back story and great chemistry with each other and in the group.All goes well and the brother decides to host his own murder mystery night next time at his lavish 'Tony Stark' type pad. But this time something goes violently wrong, it turns out real kidnappers arrive (not actors) and he's abducted. The group need to rescue him, and so the adventure begins. At this point we're not sure what's real and what's the game, we see plenty of twists as the plot develops.I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this film, it's really funny with some laugh out loud moments and lots of chuckles, whereas so many recent so called comedies have been disappointing, such as 'Girl's Trip', 'Bad Moms' and 'Sausage Party'.This film is adult humour but didn't rely on swearing or vulgar humour.",Game Night

102,Alexander_Blanchett,Much funnier than expected,8,12 September 2018,"Much better than I expected and already so far one of the funniest and craziest film of the year. Great entertainment from the beginning to the end even if it is often a bit over the top and not always logic, especially after the twist but its hell of a lot of fun due its great comedic timing and really, really fun characters. 
Jason Bateman's humor works here just perfectly, even if the character he plays is the usual thing he does, it fits.
Rachel McAdams was often a bit over the top and really portrayed her character in a too silly way, but she was still charming and made the character work in the end. 
Bill Magnussen was surprisingly funny and he has a hell of a great character who deserves a spin off or even his own show. 
His chemistry and comedic timing with Sharon Horgan was fantastic.
The true star of the film was Jesse Plemons however. He stole every scene and owned it. Such a hilarious performance! He is really good in playing the good hearted creep. Kyle Chandler also has an unusual fresh turn. Nice to see him not in a serious role or character.
The soundtrack was original but fitted the energy of the film. I liked the screenplay and some of the little twists. Definitely a fun and entertaining movie that has a huge rewatch value.",Game Night

104,CANpatbuck3664,One of the Best Comedies of the Last Couple of Years,9,26 February 2018,"Game Night had a premise that could have potential, but I still wasn't sold on it. I don't mind board games but I'm more of a video game kind of guy. While elements of the plot can feel familiar (several of the movie's subplots barely skirt cliche, a rivalry between brothers, tensions over having a baby etc.) like any good comedy, its when the plot shifts that you need to start pulling out things from your bag of tricks. Game Night moves at a quick clip and the central mystery never stops being interesting. Is it realistic? No. But I thought it was plausible enough that I didn't have to start picking it apart. I was too busy having fun and even when you think you have this thing solved, it kicks up a couple of notches introducing new characters and some plot twists.If you can follow the plot along, the next thing you need are some funny characters. Game Night doesn't lack for those fortunately. Max (Jason Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams) are funny but it more comes out of the actors' chemistry than how much you like them. There were 2 characters that really stole the show for me. The first was Gary (Jesse Plemons) Max and Annie's painfully awkward neighbour. Awkward comedy is so hard to get right but Plemons hits just the right note and he plays it for all its worth. The other standout was Ryan (Billy Magnuson) who was just so dumb in a completely entertaining way. Between those two, I was in stitches the entire time and I wouldn't mind seeing another adventure with the Game Night crew.What maybe surprised me the most about Game Night was that it had a slick sense of style. The car chase scenes aren't amazing but for 2 directors primarily known for comedy, they more than get the job done. There's a chase scene in a house where the camera is constantly moving and swiveling around the characters that was cool. The scene transitions use nice visuals like a scale model of the neighbourhood, even the title cards introducing the studio were fun with the game pieces falling in the background. This movie was actually shot and filmed well despite being a comedy and that's a rare accomplishment.Game Night isn't populated by the A-list, but you have a group of actors/actresses that all deliver reliably. Jason Bateman is as consistent as you get for a leading man comedian and he holds up his bit of the movie with ease. Rachel McAdams is a constantly underrated talent, she's funny here but as I mentioned above, her chemistry with Bateman is great and carries the movie initially. Kyle Chandler does a good job playing against type as Brooks, he's versatile and its hard to believe it was the same guy in Friday Night Lights. As I mentioned earlier as well, Jessie Plemons and Billy Magnusson were my two favourites in the supporting cast, they're awesome. Sharon Hogan, Kylie Bunbury and New Girl alum Lamorne Morris round out the cast with some fun comedic performances respectively.The final thing that I want to mention is that if you didn't get it from the above paragraphs, the movie is also hilarious. There are several scenes that elicited multiple chuckles from me and even when something misses, the movie moves on so quickly that it doesn't give you time to process that miss. The structured jokes and the one-offs all worked pretty consistently for me and I have no complaints about the movie not performing on what it needed to get right the most.Going into the theatre, I thought Game Night had some fun ideas, but I really wasn't expecting anything great. Comedies are very hot/cold, what you think is funny, someone else might be rolling their eyes. I really loved the first Horrible Bosses and that's what gave me some hope for this. This movie completely blew away my expectations. I saw this with a good friend and we were cackling throughout. They have some memorable characters, the performances range from solid to great across the board, and even with being really funny, they do interesting things with the plot like a couple of genuinely unexpected plot twists. I loved this movie, it doesn't earn a perfect grade, but I would put this in my top comedies that I've seen in the theatre lately. If you're a fan of dark/adult comedy, this is worth going out of your way to see.",Game Night
105,cliftonofun,Not Shakespeare (but pretty fun),6,3 August 2018,"Not exactly Shakespeare, but pretty fun nonetheless - a little whodunnit, a little crazy adventure, a little silliness, a little farce. The cast mostly makes it work, mostly because Bateman and McAdams are good enough to carry a story like this one. If anything, this movie reminded me of Keanu: a little dark for a comedy, but worth your time if you are in the mood for a laugh.",Game Night
106,apryla-58795,I don't want to play this game anymore,5,2 January 2019,"I had heard how ""good"" this was supposed to be but something about it put me off and I avoided it. Then my husband wanted to watch it so at a weak moment I said ""WTH""...should have gone with my gut. This had potential but with only about 15 minutes left to go I was like ok this just (to use a line from Jason Bateman) ""jumped the shark"". I actually got up
and left the room. I was fully planning on not finishing it because I knew it was just gonna go downhill. My husband wanted to finish it and sure enough it went off the rails. There was one too many twists and it just got super campy. They turned into bumbling idiots who just kept stupidly lucking into narrowly escaping harm. Plus Jason Bateman hurts his arm early on so badly that he no doubt would've been incapacitated within short order yet he goes for another hour or so with full use of it and even gets into a major fight and manages to get one over on the bad guy...uh huh right sure.Jason Bateman (in spite of a lame script) is so funny and I never get tired of his deadpan humor. He was mostly doing his normal act by phoning it in but he's still hilarious even when he doesn't try...he's just that good and has such screen presence. I love that he's had such a long career without flaming out or turning into a has been. He's in everything-and I'm not mad about it.Jesse Plemons wasn't funny he was just plain annoying. He held that straight shtick for far too long to the point where it just got embarrassing.Rachel McAdams is adorable and can act yet this was beneath her and she was reduced to window dressing. The scene in the bar where she's holding the gun and giving orders to the ""bad guys"" is just straight stupid. I was really surprised she took this role.What's up with using a bunch of no names? I mean I recognized some of them but couldn't tell you anything I've seen them in. The ""dumb"" guy actually did a good job. He had some funny lines and made me laugh. I don't know who the heck the ""Irish"" actress was. Never seen her before and it was just an odd choice. She just did not fit in this at all. The black couple were my favorite - he's hilarious (he's got more talent in his eyeball expressions than some other actors have in their whole bodies PLUS his Denzel impression was funny) and she held her own even though she is really new to Hollywood. She's beautiful and can act so I'm sure she'll have a long career if she wants one.Danny Huston?! WTH was that guy doing in this?! He was in it for about 3 minutes! Wasted.Jeffrey Wright is too dignified to have participated in this drivel.Kyle Chandler is looking busted. He's who they thought would be a good choice for being the better looking older brother?! Ok his eye bags were so pronounced in the one scene where they were down on the ground on the bridge that I was like ""that angle is NOT doing you any favors buddy."" Why didn't they use Rob Lowe or someone who actually is better looking? Jason Bateman is so obviously better looking than Kyle so why did they try to make HIM out to be not as good looking? Kyle Chandler just did not bring anything to this at all. If they had a part for an older brother who was an alcoholic who lived in a trailer park then he would have fit the bill perfectly. His expiration date is up for the good looking parts. Bad casting.Michael C. Hall looked high. He was wasted in this...he's supposed to be all bada*s but he came off more like a preppie playing around with ""Daddy's"" money having a temper tantrum. Weird. He's the one they thought would best portray a mercenary type character? He's who they were supposed to be terrified of?! If he was truly supposed to be someone who has no mercy he's NOT just gonna let all those witnesses live after they take the brother. So unrealistic.Also ""pooping out"" a tiny piece of paper and it still has legible names on it?! Are you kidding me right now with that? Cringe worthy.I don't know who these directors are but I'd say they just called in all the favors they needed on this one...and it didn't even pay off in the end.God! I hope they don't make a sequel!Kindly decline this Game Night invitation. Make your own fun. You'll thank me later.",Game Night

It's a really polished and well made movie, with great acting and comedic scenes by well known and accomplished actors.Besides all the good I could say about it, about everything from the fake business used in the plot to the very nicely made ending cutscenes, I'd say the real star of the movie is Rachel McAdams, but maybe that's just because I have a tendency to like her a lot in movies.

108,statuskuo,Surprisingly Joyful,7,25 February 2018,"The movie self-destructs to the finish line but what leads up to it is fun and it actually is about something. 
A group of gen-xers get together to have a game night. The typical host's brother attends one fateful week and ropes them into a mock kidnapping mystery game. It's not the puzzles or clues or even as the trailer would have you think. In fact it spends a lot of time away from that expectation. So without getting into too much, it is a deeper feeling of what it means to...grow up. Yes, as we age, these games we play turn not only about amusement but really become two-fold. 1) to keep your mind sharp 2) the comraderie of hanging onto old friends.
See most of the time is was never about the games themselves but the time inbetween the spins or the tosses or the competition. It's spending time with friends who start to spin off into the ""real world"" This movie is also about perception. Most people are constantly being compared or compare themselves to others' lives. Mental games we play with ourselves and with each other. Which manifests itself into the anxiety we face today. In the end, it should be about the ones we care about the most that matter. Yes, the premise of this movie is silly, and completely illogical. But the deeper message has nothing to do with the shenanigans that you see in the trailer. For us in our 40's it will make more sense. For the younger crowd, I hope they discover the importance of interpersonal relationships away from the internet.",Game Night

I love Jason Bateman, but he tends to lean towards the really raunchy movies. I appreciate that this one was a little cleaner. He and Rachel McAdams make a joke about child actors that don't do anything with their lives, which is especially funny, because Jason Bateman was a child actor in the TV show Silver Spoons: Season 1.

110,andrewroy-04316,"A legitimately hilarious comedy with surprisingly strong peripherals and plot, Game Night is way too much fun to not love",8,12 August 2019,"This is going to sound ridiculous, because they are wildly different, but my thoughts on Game Night are similar to my thoughts on American Hustle. Are they perfect movies with pristine plots? Maybe not, but between the great performances, humor, and relentless fun energy of the films, they're so easy to get caught up in.
Game Night lived up to the rumors I'd heard about its humor, but exceeded my expectations in both creativity of the plot and technical elements. The jokes pretty much all land, as the script is great. never overplaying or repeating the same jokes but relying on strong chemistry between actors and clever lines to deliver humor. I thought the plot was simple and obvious - Brooks set the whole thing up, duh - but the twist with how the whole night actually happened and what the situation with Brooks really was was super smart. Yes, the plot goes into some wild directions, from the accidental gunshot to the crazy hot potato with the egg to the climactic plane fight, but it never goes off the rails completely. McAdams is really phenomenal in the lead and frankly one of the best performances of 2018 for me, and the whole ensemble is effective (though Ryan could've been a little less stupid). The peripherals were all very good - a good score, very creative cinematography, and lots of small touches and details, down to a hilarious end credits scene. Even the romance was well done, with what felt like a real relationship and nice scenes with a bunch of fast takes. Comedies never get a lot of respect, and there have been few really good ones lately, so the ones that are genuinely funny and also work from a filmmaking perspective deserve to be considered great movies period, and Game Night is one of them.",Game Night
111,sbweightman,Really enjoyable and funny with fun characters and good jokes.,9,28 September 2018,"The style and setting is familiar, but the film is fresh and inventive in how it plays out within its conventional premise, although it does get a bit silly towards the end.",Game Night
112,thekingsdom,Ok with a few chuckles,6,25 June 2018,"This film is ok. Nowhere near a 10 but it's something to watch on DVD. There's a few good laughs, it's pretty cheesy but if you want to just switch off and go with it, it'll do the job.",Game Night
113,PyroSikTh,Way Better than it has any Right to be,8,6 March 2018,"Game Night follows Max and Annie, a couple whose lives revolve around games and competitions. They hold a regular game night with their friends where they play everything from charades to board games, and have been doing so for years, with a variety of friends. Max's 100%-win-rate brother is in town and invites the whole group to his for game night, which promises to be the game night of all game nights. He plans to stage a kidnapping that they have to solve, but of course everything goes completely wrong and the group find themselves in an actual kidnapping situation.The plot takes a number of twists and turns as various clues crop up and revelations are made as to the reasoning behind the kidnapping. Game Night does a very good job of making its plot important and fitting the jokes around it rather than the other way round. This results in most the jokes feeling natural and ever more amusing thanks to the situational context surrounding them.On the note of humour, Game Night doesn't fall back on gross-out comedy, and cringe comedy is dialled right down. Instead it derives much of it's humour from awkward or silly situations and the characters acting accordingly. Jesse Plemons is definitely a standout on the humour front, playing his character completely deadpan. The awkward silences he shares are simply hilarious and his character's over-the-top nature manages to not break realism. We all know someone like Gary. Billy Magnussen also manages to provide a lot of the film's humour through a dimwitted character that never feels overdone or poked fun at.Rachel McAdams was the real surprise for me. She usually takes such serious roles, and seeing her not only take a comedy role, but absolutely kill at it really impressed me. Her comedic timing is on point and she plays off Jason Bateman really well. Bateman is his usual Bateman. While that can sometimes be a turnoff, the situations Max finds himself in really benefited from the Bateman treatment. Kyle Chandler is a little weak as always, and doesn't offer many laughs despite the handful of jokes he's given, and Jeffrey Wright, Danny Huston and Michael C. Hall make some cool but unmemorable cameos.But as I said at the beginning, Game Night has its own identity, and does not forget about the finer aspects of filmmaking. The film has its own visual quality with some really cool cinematography and use of CGI. The first taste you get is a zoom-in to Max and Annie's house, but the combination of CGI and a special camera lens makes the whole city look like a game board. It's not the only time it's used either, as it augments almost every wide shot. There's some other really imaginative uses of camerawork as well, included fixed rig cameras that follow the subject perfectly as they rotate, swerve, or flip, creating a fantastic sense of movement. The camera rotating with a door lock builds up the tension, a camera attached to the inside of a car door reinforces the urgency, a camera swerving with a car as it attempts to avoid another puts you right in the middle of action. There's also a thoroughly entertaining and extremely well put together longshot as the group pass an egg around a mansion as they're chased by goons.Another cool little detail is the references to various games. The aforementioned longshot is a quite literal take on Hot Potato, but there's also a reference to Jenga as characters pile boxes on one another to reach a skylight, a reference to Operation as Annie attempts to take a bullet out of Max's arm, a reference to Monopoly in Gary's dog Bastian, as well as references to Mouse Trap, Clue, and Game of Life, amongst others I probably didn't spot.Finally the music was yes. Cliff Martinez does what he does best with a fantastic synthwave score that almost feels like a video game at times. The synths add a lot of tension and perfectly match with the action while not forgetting about the more quieter moments as well. And I'm a massive sucker for synthwave.Game Night was a massive surprise. It's a solidly made movie in almost every respect. It's jokes are genuinely funny and the pacing of the jokes never slows or lets up. They're also used to augment situations rather than building the situations round the jokes which typically makes them feel forced. There's a heap of cool little details and extra little thought put in from director's John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein in the shape of references, cameos, use of cinematography and editing, and of course Martinez's brilliant score. Rachel McAdams, Jesse Plemons and Billy Magnussen garner the biggest laughs, but the group of actors as a whole play off each other so well with a communal sense of comedic timing. I give Game Night a really good 8/10. Go watch it. It's way better than it has any right to be.",Game Night

117,sweidman-28016,Marvel Keeps Getting Better and Better,7,28 October 2018,"Seeing it on the Ultrascreen DLX!Black Panther is Marvel's new installment in their Phase 3 of the anthology. This movie was really good. It felt more like a comic book/superhero movie than most of the other ones. Every character had great development and had a good purpose. They weren't some character thrown in that wasn't strong at all (ex: Darren Cross/Yellowjacket in Ant-Man). I really liked Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis as the main antagonists, more Michael though. Andy had a lot of fun with his role and was one of the best parts of the film. Michael did excellent with his part as Erik Killmonger. He had great development and you could see his perspective of things. He wasn't just a bad guy they were up against, he was another character that you could feel for. I love Letitia Wright as Shuri. She was hilarious and such an interesting character. Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa was amazing. He was perfect for the role. I knew he was going to do great ever since Captain America: Civil War. The score by Ludwig Göransson was really good. The effects in the movie were pretty good, however there were some parts where they looked kind of incomplete. I really liked the cinematography in the movie. There was lots of color to the film, except for a couple scenes where it was hard to see what was going on. For me, parts of the beginning felt just a little slow, buts that's only because they had to setup. Other than that I thought Black Panther was a movie Marvel needed and a great new face for superhero films. It is my third favorite Marvel movie now (1 being Spider-Man: Homecoming and 2 being Captain America: The Winter Soldier).

Some of the gags are very very funny and the comic timing is admirable. The scene where McAdams removes a bullet from Bateman's arm is just adorable. There's some cool tilt-shift shots, a lush vibrating score, a Jesse Plemons and enough twists to make a pipe cleaner jealous.",Game Night
120,chicagopoetry,Had Me Laughing Most of the Time,7,26 February 2018,"To be honest, Game Night had me laughing out loud more than any comedy I've seen in many, many years. This isn't to say Game Night is some brilliant masterpiece of comedy, but it more so reflects how poor most comedies have been in comparison. Game Night is a good comedy, bordering on great but with a few issues that hold it back from getting there. As I said, I was laughing out loud in the theater, so if this is what you expect from a comedy, go for it.The chemistry between Batemen and McAdams is good and that's the first hurdle this raunchy romp manages to clear. In fact, all of the characters are likable which is refreshing. And even though the plot borrows heavily from other films such as Date Night or Pineapple Express or dare I say even After Hours, nevertheless it works. It's funny and entertaining.It's odd that there are so many references to pop culture, especially to other movies and to film stars. You would think there would be more references to games, since that's the theme of the film, but the only real reference to a game (other than the scenes during which they are actually playing a game) is a lengthy metaphor involving a classic video arcade game.There are a few things that held this back from being genius instead of just good. For one thing, there are a few moments where my suspension of disbelief was shattered. The most major instance of this involves a serious injury that seems to appear and disappear depending on whether or not it is needed for a sight gag. Also there's a major plot twist toward the end that comes out of nowhere and seems just too far fetched, but if you stick around for the credits there's a rather hilarious montage that explains it and so that can be forgiven. Also, some of the jokes that were really funny at the beginning are used again and again and become impotent by the end, especially those involving a rather slow minded individual who says stupid stuff.One of the most unforgiving flaws of this film is that at least three of the best gags in it are given away in the trailer. One in particular involves a jet engine. I won't go into spoilers but if you've seen the trailers, you know what I'm talking about. This could have been one of the most surprising, shocking and hilarious moments of the entire film, but since I already saw it in the trailer, it barely got a chuckle out of me.But let me go back to what I said at the beginning. It had me laughing out loud. In fact, even after leaving the theater, for a couple of hours I was remembering pieces of it and laughing out loud about it after the fact. Rachel McAdams was particularly smart and funny throughout and even though the plot is convoluted beyond all measure, if you can forgive that and roll with the slapstick you'll have a hell of a good time.",Game Night

A good film to have in the background, on a rainy day whatever purpose you might have for it is meaningless given the pretty high quality. A good cast (some better than others), decent plot and great execution of it there's the odd shot which is a bit jarring and unusual and it can at times be a bit complicated than needs be but on the whole just good mindless fun with great references and some high skilled camerawork too",Game Night
129,coreyjdenford,A winning game,8,2 March 2018,"This review of Game Night is spoiler free **** (4/5)IT MIGHT BE possible that the poster for Game Night might put you off, on it we get the following eight words ""from the guys who brought you Horrible Bosses"" those words there might be a slight indication that the film warns you that it's going to be just as bad, just as dry and perhaps just as messy. But, as the film starts it's almost the complete opposite to those exceptions - directing duo John Francis Daly and Jonathan Goldstein (they only wrote Horrible Bosses) prove to be a winning team, in both the comedy and the crime caper genre. Dedicated married couple Annie (Rachel McAdams) and Max (Jason Bateman) who constantly join their group of friends for a weekly game night which also acts as a welcome distraction to their ongoing debate on whether they should start a family (she's always pro, and well he's against it's a never-ending spiral). However their sacred gaming tradition falls apart like a Jenga tower on a wobbly table when Max's irritatingly successful estranged brother Brooks (Chandler) stages an elaborate murder mystery - complete with fake thugs, blood packets and even going as far to involve federal figures. Only for it to be interrupted, forcing the pair and their group of close pals to save him from the clutches of actual criminals. What follows during the film is a delightfully absurd, terrifically dark and wickedly funny mission to find his brother.This may sound like it's going to run askew during its particularly tight-as-a-whip 100 minute running time and granted it isn't a perfectly flat-out run of laughs - during a saccharine moment during a game of Pictionary that openly jars given it's surrounding madness - still the film has plenty on offer as Daly, Goldstein helped by Mark Perez (writer of Herbie: Fully Loaded) throw plenty of twists at the audience mostly at the characters' expense it's funny in that sense - in particular it's the physical objects that generate the most laughs. Though it's not as if the film is original in its casting choices though, for this you might blame the choosing of Jason Bateman - a safe bet - but it's one where the film suffers in the long run. Yet, amid the unfolding madness the film happily gives its supporting players something to do. There's the handsomely dim-witted Billy Magnussen who finds himself unexpectedly falling for Sarah (Sharon Horgan). But the real show-stealer is Jesse Plemmons' creepy westie-loving police-man. But the film isn't just after mindless laughs that will have you wetting yourself (admittedly you still do), it doesn't resort to slapstick territory, instead the film has a razor-sharp screenplay and a fleshed character story given us lead characters that we actually care about. How often can we say that about a comedy?VERDICT: With a terrifically talented cast turned loose on a loaded premise with a whip-smart script Game Night is definitely more exciting than the real thing.",Game Night

I do like Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams, so on that basis alone, I picked it to watch. It began pleasantly - those two are actors I'm very happy to spend time with - and swiftly the movie became very funny and progressively more wild. Again and again, I was open-mouthed with surprise and delight. It's very funny - quite original - and ingenious!Sooner or later, the versatile, charming, lovely Rachel McAdams will finally become a fixture at Oscars time - so fine in serious drama such as Sunlight, romantic movies such as The Notebook, very funny movies such as Mean Girls and something ingenious and wild like Game Night. She's really one of the best of her generation of actresses - fabulous!I'd also like to see Jason Bateman in some more serious work - he's so wonderful in comedies.You'll really like this - it's also suitable for everyone.

It has enough subplots for an espionage thriller, subterfuges, mistaken identities, a McGuffin people are willing to kill for, and several reasonably well-developed romantic relationships with credible jealousies, misunderstandings and other tribulations. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams are great in the leads and project a very realistic relationship with ups and downs, doubts, conflicting goals, etc. Supporting performances are capable, particularly by Kyle Chandler, Lamorne Morris, and Camille Chen. Jesse Plemons handles a very weird role with aplomb. Production values are good, although nothing spectacular and the chase scene is a little lame. An excellent script by Mark Perez, brings an unfamiliar subculture to vibrant life. Kudos for avoiding the currently trendy pitfall of departing from the plot to make some sophomoric political statement.

141,ritera1,Fun despite the many plot holes,8,31 January 2019,"When it's funny, it's forgivable.Moved fast and dispensed a lot of story and character in quick, clear fashion. It really wasn't a stretch for the capable actors as it was all on the page, but they were still enjoyable. Especially Jesse Plemons, who stole the show. Thought there was miscasting in Kyle Chandler, who is a good actor but really was not the right fit for the character.Some very good direction from two generally dull directors in the execution of a few complicated scenes, especially when they were running around the mansion and passing off the egg.But it was still heavy on the plot holes. I could buy the great coincidences for the sake of fun.Catching up with the kidnappers was okay and holding them at gunpoint fun. But after locking the door, there was no reason why they tried to break into the room to stop the rescue. They needed at least the bad guys finding another gun and starting to shoot off the lock. At least a reason why they were no longer afraid of that real gun.Okay, the brother wanted to make it up to Bateman but we find out that the keys were in Bateman's pocket all along. It made the brother's initial hunt a risky and sloppy venture. But we needed the keys close by for the finale.Then back at Plemons house and the access to the police computer open? No. I did buy that the password was his wife's name. And the dog scene was funny.When they're at the mansion and summarily agreed to continue despite the risk was brief and not really credible. I barely was okay with the gate opening at the right time but not okay with the pathological way they just went about searching the house with no interference. Yes, it needed to move along and most audience members would not mind. But I did.And, of course, the gate was open again when they had to escape.Then having the list of witness protection list was a bad device. That's it? It's a paper in the egg? Why didn't the first bad guy already break the egg? And why like that? A piece of paper? Stupid.Okay, it was not a surprise when Plemons appears on the bridge scene but the eventual reveal was too much. He sees blood (off-screen) in his bedroom and it's a surprise when he's told his grand plan got way out of control. And it was incomplete. Plemons has the brother kidnapped...to what end? There was no message that the kidnappers gave the witnesses to then lead them to not go to the cops but instead, I assume, go to Plemons. The kidnappers asked for the egg, something that Plemons knew nothing about. How did the kidnappers know about it?The Bulgarian element was amusing and wrecking the 'vette and the plane was fun. The element with McAdams at the belt was amusing, although I did not see the box on top until the payoff.And as a side note, nothing was really resolved with the young guy/older woman. Was she even in the last scene?So yes. Good if you turn your reasoning brain off.",Game Night
142,WalkdenEntertainment,"I Do Love A Good ""Game Night""?",8,10 January 2019,"Three couples (all friends) regularly meet for ""Game Night"". Game Nights includes the involvement of classic group games such LIFE, Pictionary and charades etc. But this time, one of the members takes Game Night to the next level as the night starts as off with new Murder Mystery style game. Needless to say, this style of game (well... that is if it's actually just a game) takes Game Night and the characters to a whole new level.While Game Night has many humorous characters, most of the film focuses heavily on one of those married couple- Max (Jason Bateman) & Annie (Rachel Adams). The two met and fell in love at a Trivia night where they discovered they are as equally competitive as each other, but are also stronger when paired together for Game Nights. In the present day, Max and Annie are beginning to question each other as to whether they are ready to start a family or prefer their current lifestyle. I enjoy these two characters as leads because within a matter of seconds, Max and Annie are believable and their interaction with each other is hilarious.I personally have no complaints with the film's humour. Actor Jason Bateman is well known for comedy films (Horrible Bosses for example), but I truly enjoyed seeing Rachel Adams remind cinema audiences that she too has what it takes to have fun and be humorous (after all, she did once star in Mean Girls & The Hot Chick). I personally wouldn't change our leads for this film. The jokes between these two alone had me curious as to what was actually scripted or made up on the spot. It didn't matter on the situation, they were always funnyGame Night is a comedy but to my surprise, it's also a mystery and thriller. I was surprised how many times I found myself laughing at this film and then found myself rather curious as to the mysteries the film kept unveiling. Our characters witness and involve themselves in rather painful (yet cringe worthy) situations. The film's ideas are also fresh and creative, which is just so rare to see with comedy films today. I mean sure- there might be times where this film will make you think how similar it is to the time Michael Douglas appeared in the classic thriller The Game from 1997, but Game Night adds witty humor and creative dialogue. Not to mention, the film feels rather modern as it makes jokes about well known films, pop culture, technology and of course....Board game references which we all can relate to. I also noticed the film has a fun style of transitions, using what appears to be model houses (possibly from well known board games?), streets maps and even throws in fun techno music tracks which had my foot tapping away as the film kept moving along at a speedy pace.Overall, Game Night has plenty of creative comedy and references that will surprise many. While the film's plot at certain times can be questionable, this didn't stop me from having a good laugh and enjoying something fresh and new. Actors Jason Bateman and Rachel Adams were cast perfectly, in particular to Rachel Adams, who reminded us that she still has what it takes to have fun in film. Game Night never felt boring and for its duration, the film moves at a fun pace, managing to keep me invested (and very interested) as to the film's final outcome.

144,SafReviews,Good movie,8,24 November 2018,This is a good movie to watch as it is a unique and intriguing story which you've haven't seen on any other movie. There are a few funny moments along with some good action scenes; trust me you will not get bored during the movie. This is probably the best comedy/action movie of the year and i would highly recommend anyone to watch this movie.,Game Night
145,doorsscorpywag,Jokeless comedy mystery goes nowhere!,4,8 May 2018,"The most important element of a comedy is that it is actually funny.
Sadly Game Night barely raised a chuckle for me.It is a good story where a mystery game night becomes a real life and death race to save one of the gamers.But the laughs never come. The cast try in vain to raise one but fail miserably.The acting is OK and the movie moves along nicely from one implausible situation to the next.
These scenarios were just aching to be funny but the jokes never come.
Having a silly look on your face when something happens or being 'British' are not a recipe for being funny.
That takes comedic talent and this cast did not have that.I was looking forward to seeing this and really wanted to enjoy it but it never raised itself above a half decent comedy thriller minus jokes.Shame as it could have been really good.",Game Night
146,austin0731,A breath of fresh air in today's comedy film scene,7,21 March 2018,"Game Night is the comedy genre's long awaited original concept that turned out really good, while keeping to certain comedic tropes with similar comedic archetypes the character relationships and partnerships played a large role is Game night's success as a ridiculous, over the top comedy. Much like when the first Hangover reinvented the genre, Game night follows suit in a world where comedies are just not regarded as good or well made. Much of Game night's success comes down to the chemistry of the actors, each pairing (Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams, Lamorne Morris and Kylie Bunbury, Sharon Horgan and Billy Magnussen) brought a different and funny dynamic to the film. I thought in particular that Jesse Plemons' role as the creepy neighbour Gary was just comedy gold and would likely not be pulled off if not for the actor himself, brilliantly cast and acted. Game Night was just a thrill ride of how one fun night turns into disaster after disaster, game within a game until a completely ridiculous and over the top end game. Definitely a worthwhile watch with many laughs and genuine character relationships that audiences can absolutely connect with.",Game Night
147,Gubby-Allen,Brilliant,8,20 August 2020,"One of the best and funniest films that I have seen in ages. I was not expecting too much, chose it more for the murder mystery plot. That was good too, but the characters and the humour was the highlight. Everyone in it added to the film and hilarious scenes throughout along with a few twists. I rarely rate anything a 10/10. I can count on the fingers of one hand the film's which I have seen that are funnier than this and either from Monty Python or Airplane.",Game Night
148,galahad58-1,Bored Game,4,1 August 2018,"Today's comedy has degenerated to f-bombs and sex jokes over intelligent writing, puns, and situations. Gone are the days of My Cousin Vinny, Airplane, The Pink Panther, etc. Now it is a world of clueless writers who have no sense of humor past the terrible f-bomb routine. 
Look at how much idiotic moments are spent between the two characters discussing an affair - and which celebrity it was - it was a waste of writing and time on the screen. 
The premise was interesting, but the direction, script and acting could not take it to the level of comedy that this could have been. Rachel McAdams is the only reason it was not rated even lower. 
This is for the low-brow who likes Will Farrell, Seth Rogan, or Melissa McCarthy - the folks who have one f-bomb joke and have lived on it forever.",Game Night
149,asifahsankhan,Surprisingly good.,8,7 May 2018,"Game Night shares its directors with the execrable Vacation, which should trigger alarm bells for discerning viewers. However the same duo worked on the script for Spiderman: Homecoming, which was pretty great, and co-director John Francis Daley gets a lifetime pass just for being in Freaks and Geeks.All this is by way of saying that Game Night is much better than you might expect. An attempt to marry a crime thriller with an ensemble comedy, it succeeds mainly due to a pleasantly convoluted script by Mark Perez.There are the expected scenes of actors riffing all over each that populate most modern comedies, but also hints at a bigger budget and attention to aesthetics like nifty camera work, tilt-shift photography, and some decent action set pieces.Jason Bateman has probably done enough of these man-child roles at this point (it's unsettlingly weird watching his character wonder whether he's ready to have a kid at age forty-nine), but he's reliably amusing. So is Rachel McAdams (seemingly channeling Rose Byrne in Bad Neighbours), and there are some nice surprises in the supporting cast like Sharon Horgan from TV's Catastrophe, and Jesse Plemons being funny enough to steal the whole movie.Your mileage may vary when it comes to the various bits of comic business in Game Night, but a lot of seemingly-improvised non-sequiturs reveal themselves to be carefully planned setups for later gags, which is a nice change.The suspension of disbelief needed to sell the dramatic parts of the story is undermined somewhat when characters react in a blasé fashion to, for example, being shot. But it's that cheerful detachment from reality that makes the film such a easy watch.Culminating in an end credits sequence that plays like Fincher in a particularly goofy mood, Game Night isn't great, but it's surprisingly good.",Game Night

Luckily no high pitch hysteria or people flown down from the cuckoo's nest, except for the cop, but then again totally fitting in this story. Enjoyable, action packed and a few good laughs. I totally recommend.",Game Night
151,FelipeCarrillo,A hilarious and surprisingly clever comedy in which the spectator has an assured victory,7,27 April 2018,"There is something riveting about Warner Brothers Pictures' and New Line Cinema's newest and unexpectedly twisted invention. The latest film by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein is a tangled onslaught fertile in physical humor and plot quirks that in the hands of other filmmakers would have meant an endless noisy-pretensions havoc.In the last few years, big-studio megalomaniac comedies have opted to employ a mostly scatological, black and sexual humor as unique narrative channels, if not, look back on time and realize Hollywood's comedy releases huge box office results, where a family trip, a holiday, a high school reunion, two unlucky-in-love friends or two irresponsible parents become miraculously commercial structures, they hide behind hollow teachings to emanate a torrent of filthy ineffective jokes that lead to a trick misbegotten experience, films with a homologous purpose to those embarrassing horror flicks, they ""satisfy"" with the same elements, more of the same misery, powerful minds don't know how to exploit rich ideas into compatible stories, destroying old templates and presenting them under a ""novel"" filter only implies to draw more unsubstantial juice from incompetence. Fortunately, a few ideas begin a grateful revendication for the genre. Such is the case of ""Game Night"", a film that, on the surface, supposed another possible rotten movie for the studio, but, to the surprise of many, the first American comedy of the year has described a hopeful future since its result incites to wait, without suspicion, more works like these upcoming in theaters, not because of its humbling message or its film excellence, but because it's a comedy that produces real laughter, through various and constant visual gags that fulfill its function not to relapse into off-color and incurious jokes again and again.It opens with a thematic alteration on the production and distribution companies' habitual logos, a technique that shows irrefutable personality and conviction with the unfolding idea. I keep firm the belief that when a studio uses this sort of visual harmonization denotes full confidence with its audiovisual production because just like Marvel Studios and Universal Pictures, the captivating and playful entries of the classic logos of New Line Cinema, Warner Bros., Davis Entertainment and Aggregate Films are fantastic. A kind of warning 'bout what's to come. A stylish initial move.As far as the story is concerned, several peculiarities can be highlighted. You're right, it's a banal and fanciful storyline, but it doesn't matter too much when the narrative approach works as it does here, indeed, the risky turns, that the script takes, end up being more laudable because it's a plot that could easily fall ridiculousness, tediousness and predictability broadens its radar with a diabolically twisted game night where physical and emotional comedy complement each other in an exciting way, getting a really strong connection between audience and characters. No one can refute that the story of Mark Perez is sensationally effective in his narrative wit, very few jokes feel false, or out of place, every push-line is sidesplitting and placed at the right time. His screenplay handles an unusual humor range given that it sets up fiercely funny circumstances on such trivial matters as the seminal glands of a stressed man or a woman who cheated on her husband with a supposed Denzel Washington clone or as inherently comical as a bullet extraction or and bloody incident in a room sacredly pristine. ""Game Night"" works and takes hold on this sort of moments, spilling and developing a series of unreal twists that become delightful as the story goes on. Turning the table-game formula into something so bombastic, enjoyable and disturbing is an example to follow for the upcoming comedies from major studios. God!, such a great time I had with this insubstantial anomaly. Within the general reach of the genre, narrative decisions are correct and although I thought the stretch of the last ten minutes was going to be unnecessary as it's typical in this kind of works, it wasn't, since after the roller-coaster ride, this last ten minutes give a more appropiate conclusion to the flick. The script accepts by way of mockery that oversaturates the story with twists and instead of considering it a weakness, transforms it into a strength satirizing this resource until the end, the film parodies constantly different blockbuster actors ranging from Liam Neeson up to Vin Diesel, some pop-culture references providing a particular and bearable atmosphere to the story.What does success - in every sense of the word - depend on a feature film? It'd be thorny to analyze what justifies such a phenomenon, however, one thing is clear: ideal casting choices play a vital role, and here, yes they did. Although many aren't happy with this, Jason Bateman has done so well with comedy, since whenever this man signs one up, miraculously, the result is not a critical garbage. As already happened last year with ""Office Christmas Party"" and now ""Game Night"", a film in which he plays a more likable, wisecracking and sincere character. Bateman teams up with ""SNL"" comedian Rachel McAdams, another American comedy giant. They both have an impressive feeling that was difficult to predict, their scenes as a duo are among the best in the film, a competitive couple that truly amuses the spectator through their nonsense and funny actions. Likewise, the other couples performed by Sharon Horgan, Billy Magnussen, Lamorne Morris and Kylie Bunbury polish with charisma the characters, getting the audience to consider them key pieces in this whodunit, each of them uses an independent humorous category in order to fit their sub-plots together in an appropriate way in the diversity of the narrative, even so they take a little part in the main story. Enigmatic and dark Jesse Plemons deserves a special mention, who, without any prognosis, ends up being an important part in all this perversion, his wretched personality is credible and never stumbles over ridiculousness or overacting because he balances the loads correctly, another great comic role, even if it is not comical, for the ""Hostiles"" actor.The commitment that the directors had with this work is palpable. From unusual artistic braveries to the never-strenuous twists and turns, here there is a sort of superiority with regard to the others of its kind because, with such a simple premise, they erect a crazy nightmare against the clock in which they must find the disappeared person before it is too late. It's clear that the filmmakers didn't want their movie to be another scandalous big-studio production and focus all their efforts on it, and they obviously projected even their latest creative weapons in this fabulous flick.A fundamental component of a satisfactory cinematographic experience that usually takes second place in comedy movies is the soundtrack, however, on this occasion, there was something that caught my attention. It cannot avoid using of certain smash hits - in fact, few - yet Cliff Martinez's compositions combined the traditional resonances of terror, drama, and action to produce an explosive, exciting, and peculiarly special score, given that, personally, he got to show hilarity coming from the images to be consistent with the sound accompaniment going from car chases to a frantic hunt throughout an onerous mansion, an unexpected finding. Hilarious, fast-paced and unexpectedly twisted, ""Game Night"" by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein is the perfect choice for a day of good studio films, a work that appeals to comical visual and narrative without warning, providing a courageous extremely amusing experience. American comedy genre begins 2018 with the right foot thanks to Warner Bros. Pictures' latest incursion. Hopefully, this pic will not only be a money magnet because it's a fresh proposal, which is expected to serve as a model to follow, not to copy, for all its competitors, which must roll the dice strongly, given that Kevin Tsujihara's production studio is winning the game.",Game Night

154,danybur,Hilarious sitcom and action,7,18 April 2021,"SummaryA fun comedy that combines some marital romance, entanglements, thrillers, and action around a group of friends who meet every Saturday to play board games and other entertainment, but go out of control when they decide to play role-playing games.Review:Max and Annie (Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams) get together every Saturday to play board games and other entertainment with their friends (mime, guess, etc.). But on one of those nights, Brooks appears, the successful brother and millionaire of Max (Kyle Chandler) who proposes to the group to participate in a role-playing game. But things don't go as planned and everyone gets caught up in unexpected and dangerous adventures.The John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein film is a successful combination of emotional and tangled comedy, thriller and action film, with numerous frankly very comical situations. It works for its rhythm that does not decline, for its timely twists, for the good use of misunderstandings, for the ingenuity of the script and the chemistry of its cast. On the other hand, the ""matrimonial"" dynamic with its underlying leitmotif and the relationship between the siblings are not so attractive, although the latter is the trigger for the action.The action moments work very well and there is a remarkable sequence shot in a scene that takes place in the house of a millionaire. On the other hand, the effectiveness and simplicity of some comic scenes (such as the one that takes place in an agency) are worth highlighting.Within an effective cast, Jason Bateman stands out with his face of resignation, Sharon Horgan, as the occasional companion of one of the friends and especially Jesse Plemons (the great actor of Fargo 2 and I'm Thinking in Ending Things), who steals the film as a disturbing neighbor, upset police officer who has been excluded from game night.An ideal comedy for a Saturday night, precisely.",Game Night

156,harrylosborne,A casual comedy with a bit more to it,6,29 January 2021,"Jason Bateman's recent furrow into more dramatic roles with the critically acclaimed Ozark has proven that he really is a consummate actor. Here, he returns to his comedic roots in a comedy that actually has a storyline - even if it isn't that clever.Joining Bateman are some other great performances, such as Jesse Plemons (one of the best rising actors right now) and Kyle Chandler; however, I did feel a couple of performances didn't make a lot of sense, particularly Sharon Hogan as an out-of-sync Irish date.The story is darker than most comedies of this ilk, setting it apart from a lot of the rubbish being pumped out today, plus still has enough action and a budget to keep up.By the end, there were some good laughs for all walks of people, and as family comedies go, I would happily recommend.",Game Night

158,monkeysgalore,Surprisingly Good,8,4 February 2019,"Amid all the remakes and super hero movies, an underrated gem comes to us in the form of Game Night. Game Night really is an excellent movie. It was solid entertainment, with hilarious comedy, hard-hitting, but never overdone action, some romance, some mystery, and all this is only made better by the actors' performances, and an excellent chemistry between the very watchable Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams.The plot follows Bateman and McAdams as game-obsessed couple, Max and Annie. They're obsession with games is prevalent, but there's more to their relationship then games, and they really love each other. Max and Annie host a game night often, and several of their friends usually come over to participate, aside from their recently divorced neighbor, Gary, a depressed, lonely cop. When Max's cooler, vastly more successful brother Brooks shows up for the latest game night, he invites them over to his house for the next game night. The group goes there on the night of the next game night, and Brooks promising a fun night of mystery and role-play, but the group soon gets tangled in a real mystery.The only other film I've seen Bateman in was his side role as the high school bully in Central Intelligence (2016), and though he played a jerk in that movie, he was still funny, but he really shines in this film, at least to me. He's just naturally funny and likable, and he really made this movie, aside from McAdams. McAdams is also really funny and likable in this, and she and Bateman make a truly excellent comedy duo.Mark Perez has written a really great script with this, and not once did I ever find myself bored with what was happening. It doesn't appear that he's written anything else, but if he did, I'd be interested. This was also a valiant, solid directorial effort by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein. They haven't really directed anything big before this, but I hope they do, as they really demonstrated a mastery, or at least adeptness for scenery, cinematography, and making a film like this work.I honestly really liked the story, as it seemed pretty original, at least when you look at most of the other stuff coming out now. The plot kept me on the edge of my seat, and kept me interested. I honestly felt invested in the characters, at least, Bateman and McAdams' characters, which doesn't happen often for me with one-off movies like this. The plot was interesting, fast-paced, and intelligent, and it was bolstered by excellent cast performances all around.There's also some nice character development, which was especially surprising for a 2018 action comedy, as most movies like this nowadays are usually very violent, profane, vulgar, and stupid. While this movie was profane, and at times violent and vulgar, it never took itself seriously, and always knew when enough was enough. The characters are handled well, and the reconciliation between Max and his brother was nice, though the high point was his relationship with Annie. Though they obviously love games, it doesn't dominate their relationship, and they still manage to have real feelings and conversations, and are still able to handle the important things (I won't spoil what).The comedy is hilarious, with some real gut-busting scenes, and the chemistry between the two leads, as I mentioned earlier, is great. The comedy tends to be more witty and smart than slapstick and over the top, a plus for me, and it helped me enjoy the film more.There's a surprising amount of fast-paced, well-directed action, such as the house fight scene, the car chase, the mansion fight/chase scene, the bridge shootout, and the final shootout/fight scene on the plane. Much more action-packed than I expected, which was a great surprise. During a car chase, they even acknowledge how similar the scenario is to the end of ""Taken 3"", a reference I appreciated.Overall, this is a really excellent, pleasantly surprising, hilarious, action-packed comedy that I really enjoyed. Aside from a lot of unnecessary language, and some inappropriate conversations, there's not too much to worry about in the offensive material department, and I'd definitely recommend it.",Game Night
159,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Jesse Plemons and Billy Magnussen are worth price of admission.,6,3 March 2018,"Jesse Plemons definitely steals the show. I laughed everytime his character was on screen and Jesse played him perfectly. Billy Magnussen was probably my second favourite from the film and I got a decent couple of laughs from him too. But for the most part, I thought this film was kind of stupid. I realize that with a premise like this, you'll have to suspend some disbelief. In real life, I doubt the friends would have thought the initial kidnapping was fake and part of the game. Especially with his stuff breaking left, right and center. But in this movie, I can accept that they're completely oblivious. It makes for a funny outcome. Or like, in real life I doubt that people would continue to argue about petty crap like phone settings when something serious like a gun shot wound has happened. But in a movie, it works. Afterall, its a comedy. But at a point the movie gets almost too nonsensical. Just too unbelievable. Or it feels like they just forget past things all together. For instance, theres a scene (and it is in the trailer) where Jason Bateman's characters wound opens up and he starts bleeding all over the floor (as he's trying to stealthily look up information). Dog comes in and starts licking up blood, and so of course the blood starts dripping all over the dog instead. Dog gets drenched, shakes itself and so the blood goes all over the walls etc. Its an amusing scene as you see his horrified face and know he's thinking ""How the hell am I gonna fix this?"". But right after he decides ""Eh, screw it"" and leaves. He suddenly isnt leaking blood everywhere anymore. And we never see him get re-stitched or it isnt implied. I mean, if you're gonna bring out a gag like that, you gotta follow through. Or as another example, towards the end Kyle Chandler is being kidnapped again. And the bad guys shoot out the tires and then drive off for the airport. Yes, Jason Bateman has car keys in his pocket to his brothers other car and he did say that his house wasnt too far from where they were, but even if you forget the plausibility of them catching up to the bad guys, there still would have been police back at the house. Are we supposed to believe that they snuck past an active crime scene? Or perhaps earlier LaMorne & Kylie's characters were able to convince the police not to investigate further, but we never see anything of it. Even when all the friends meet up again theres never a line from Jason or Rachel where they ask what they told the police. Its like the screenwriter either got lazy or just plain forgot what happened 5 min prior. Theres a couple other scenes like that, but I think you get the drift. I gave the movie a 6 mainly for Jesse and Billy. I think if anything they're worth the price of admission. There was a couple of funny scenes that didnt include them, but not many. Ive certainly have seen worse, but I dont think this one is gonna be sticking with me.",Game Night
160,Jared_Andrews,"Filled with Laughs and Action, It Will Please a Wide Audience",7,10 March 2018,"Sparks fly in the movie's opening scene. We're introduced to Max (Jason Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams), the obsessively competitive captains of their respective teams at a bar trivia night. The movie pokes a bit of fun at classic ""love at first sight"" moments with separate shots of the two staring lovingly at each other. They connect instantly and are soon married.  This scene paired with the opening credit sequence and reveal of the title, Game Night, is the equivalent of the directors throwing open the doors to boldly and loudly announce their presence. They grab the audience's attention and fill them with promise about what is to come. It's the most auspicious start to a comedy since The Hangover. The statement is made-these guys are here to take chances in their aesthetic directing choices, so get ready for a ride full of rises and drops and twists and turns. After the title reveal, the movie jumps ahead in time. Max and Annie are hosting game night. It starts off like any other, until Max's brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler) shows up. He obnoxiously announces his presence and subsequently humiliates Max in front of his friends, just as he has since they were kids. Before the night ends, Brooks promises to host next week and take game night to the next level with a mystery, of sorts. The next week's game night starts off tame, as Brooks explains that someone is going to be taken. It'll be up the rest of the group to find this person, and the first to do so wins Brooks's new car. So, of course, no one bats an eye when two men storm in with guns and forcibly take Brooks away. But it doesn't take the other game night guests long to realize that this was not part of the plan. From there, the night's events ensue in hilarity and surprises. Jesse Plemmons makes an appearance as the odd, uninvited neighbor and immediately steals the movie. His awkward, monotone, always-in-uniform police officer schtick deserves real acclaim. That guy has serious talent. Who knew that the bully from Like Mike would turn out to be such an accomplished actor?  Plemmons also delivers the movie's best line. I won't spoil it, but it involves Tostitos. Overall, the performances are fun, though eclectic, which is fine because the story is set up in a way that this one couple can go here and do this funny thing while this other couple goes here and has their own funny moment. They're each bringing their own variation of humor, which gives the comedy a broader appeal. The directors are clearly having a good time balancing the array of characters within a convoluted plot. They make daring choices that stand out. The choices don't always work, but they always catch your eye, which is enough in a movie like this. The filmmakers clearly wanted to add a little extra spice to keep the viewers on their toes (or more accurately, hunched forward, since they are sitting down). I don't want to resort to hyperbole here, but the movie nearly reaches the point threshold of thrilling. There's the right amount of story to juggle. Anymore would be overwhelming and too much less would make the movie dry.I'm still not sure if the entire story checks out. A few moments felt like plot holes, but I can forgive minor infractions. The end of the movie felt kind of like two kids had cleaned up just enough after their party so that mom and dad wouldn't notice. They might be suspicious, but they can't immediately say with absolute certainty that something was wrong. I, the suspicious parent, saw the house still intact, shrugged and left well enough alone.The recommendation here is pretty easy. People like this movie. I recommend it to virtually anyone looking for a fun time at the theater.",Game Night

The cast of the movie was all around great. I love Jason Bateman and it's nice to see him work with material that showcases his charm. His dry delivery was perfect in this movie. Rachel McAdams also was cast well and had some nice on-screen chemistry with Jason Bateman.Character-wise the entire ensemble cast is hilarious. Each individual had their own personality and really added something to the movie. I love a good dark comedy and Game Night delivered in every regard.

It's pure entertainment and also a homage to different modern cult classics.McAdams and Bateman chemistry is amazing. One of those couples that no one would ever imagine that could work so well together. The same about the other supporting characters.

167,WubsTheFadger,Game Night,8,13 March 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerBeing a huge Jason Bateman fan, I just had to see this film. When I first saw the trailer, I was not amused at all. The trailer was unfunny and lacked originality. The film, in contrast, was amazing. The story was hilarious and completely original. The characters were all unique and had their moments of hilarity. The plot twist was smart and well timed. This is probably one of the most intelligent comedies you will ever find in Hollywood and I would highly recommend it.The acting is very good. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams have great chemistry and play a loving couple perfectly. Both of them are hilarious in their own way and Bateman hammers down his hilarious one liners. Jesse Plemons delivers the second-best performance as a creepy cop who is genuinely an awesome character. Kyle Chandler, Sharon Horgan, Billy Magnussen, Lamorne Morris, Kylie Bunbury, Michael C. Hall, and Danny Huston all perform very well.The pacing is a little slow and the runtime is overlong (The film loses steam towards the end).I would say that 80% of the jokes and gags were funny and well timed but the other 20% were unfunny and overused. The Denzel Washington gag was probably the funniest joke in the entire film.Pros: Hilarious and original story, Jason Batemans' and Rachel McAdams' good chemistry, great acting, a good amount of the jokes were funny, and the Denzel Washington gagCons: Some slow pacing, an overlong runtime (The film lost steam towards the end), and some jokes were not very funnyOverall Rating: 8.0",Game Night
168,n-kefala,Bateman and McAdams rule together,6,8 April 2018,"Is it a thriller? A comedy? A little bit of both, actually, and it mixes both genres in entertaining ways. ""Game Night"" it's very funny and surprisingly clever with a script by Mark Perez that makes all the pieces fit together. It has a perfect balance of slapstick, plot intrigue and emotional sentiments. Every character is interesting and funny and develops really well throughout the film. It is a sharp adult comedy that earns genuine laughs and manages to surprise. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams make ""Game Night"" even more fun and have a magical pairing. I am sure that they should do more films together. Even if the humor in the film is pleasant and conventional for the most part, the characters themselves are massively enjoyable.",Game Night

172,rutzelb,Better Than Expected,7,2 June 2018,"A group of guys and gals get together, quite often, to play Game Night, but this time something goes wrong when Max's (Jason Bateman) brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler) joins in. As comedies go this is better than expected with lots of good lines and very little raunchy stuff. The pacing is very good as is all the acting performances which is to say no one overacted and that's a good thing. There are some twists in here and at one point one would think the story ends, but no, not finished yet.The choreography for the fight scenes is spot on just like In a Jackie Chan movie. Kudos.The funniest part, for me, was when Max's wife Annie (Rachel McAdams) tries to take a bullet out of Max's arm and gives him a squeaky toy to bite down on for the pain that will ensue and it works, as this is a very funny scene. Well, maybe it was just me. Jesse Plemons plays Gary, a next door neighbor who is also a policeman and who is always seen in his uniform and is someone the group doesn't want to play Game Night with. You'll see why. Notables: Danny Huston as Donald Anderton, who hosts Fight Club in his house; Jeffrey Wright as Agent Henderson; Camille Chen as Dr. Chin.The other Game Night players: Lamorne Moris as Kevin; Kylie Bunbury as Michelle; Billy Magnussen as Ryan; Sharon Horgan as Sarah; I still maintain that Jason Bateman has the best timing for comedic roles than anyone else in Hollywood and should actually give lessons to many ""so-called"" comics.

174,AnishMisra,Game Night Review,8,18 November 2018,"Game Night is a film directed by Jonathan Goldstein and John Frances Daley. When I heard about this film, I was really not very excited although some of my friends had a look at the trailer for this one and said it will be a fun movie. The film released and had got much appreciation. So I finally decide to watch the film and I would have to say that my friends were right.Plot: Follows a group of friends whose game night turns into a real-life mystery after one of them is kidnapped by apparent burglars.Story and direction: I really had no expectations before when I decided to see it. But really, the concept of the film is so great that I didn't realise when those 100 minutes got over. And also, the direction is top notch. Each second in the film is full of surprises. I was just shocked that a film meant for just entertainment had just so many wow moments. Each and every joke is laughable at. Also, the subplots introduced in the film don't deter the pace, infact it adds to the characters storylines which made me know them so much better. There is one pop culture reference in the film where I was going like ""Oh man, they are directly coping the scene"". And they happen to address that too. I mean the film is so self-aware. If I really had to nit-pick the film, it would be the fact that the film sometimes becomes too convenient and you do feel that how is that possible. I mean there are a lot of coincidences which is impossible in real life.Performances: Jason Bateman was the captain of this ship. His comic timing is superb. He was a natural. Rachel McAdams also does justice to her role. Although in one or two scenes I did feel that the performance was forced rather than natural. Billy Magnussen and Sharon Horgan also were pleasing to watch. Lamorne Morris and Kylie Bunbury were impossible to ignore. It's always a treat to watch Chelsea Peretti and and Michael C. Hall. I didn't expect Kyle Chandler to have a taste for comedy. Jesse Plemons impressed too.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where the gang go to rob an egg from some gangster. In addition to the scene being funny, I loved the way it was shot. I may be wrong, but I do feel that scene was shot in one take which highly impressed me considering the film was just meant to be an entertainer.Verdict: For those who want to relax and enjoy a movie, I highly suggest this and surely you will not be disappointed. For those who are more serious cinema driven, I would suggest you stay away from this. I belong to the former category so I did enjoy the film and it was a fun ride for me. The film left room open for a sequel and I will be waiting for it. The makers should really brainstorm for the sequel otherwise it will be a mess and some films have been a witness to this mess.For Now, I am going with an 8/10.",Game Night
175,iantrader,Maybe there wasn't enough vodka in my popcorn.,2,8 May 2018,"Great blurb. But it takes too long to get going, it's terribly derivative - check out The Game - and, simply, it's not as funny as it thinks it is. Sometimes they just flog and flog a joke when there's not even a joke there to flog.Never really been a Jason Bateman fan and am I alone in thinking Jesse Plemons' character is just a little overacted (in an understated way)?

Last 40 minutes unfold to be pointless and catroonish.

When Max's brother (a truly game Kyle Chandler) shows up back in town, the stakes rise considerably. Fellow players Lamorne Morris, Kylie Bunbury, Sharon Horgan and Billy Magnussen add to the fun, but it's Jesse Plemons, as the sad neighborhood weirdo, who earns best supporting gamer.It is written by Mark Perez who's previously written Herbie: Fully Loaded and The Country Bears. Sadly the film is not that well written and there are so many more cool and funny opportunities that could have happened here. But it's Jason Bateman and Rachel Mcadams who save the day. If it wasn't for their comedic timing this film would not have succeeded.
Directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein (whose previous hits included 2011's Horrible Bosses) have delivered a hip, happy, winner. It may not change your life: it's not trying to. But if fun is your goal, you're hitting the jackpot here. The film is just meant to make you laugh, it's not trying to change the world.

In 'Game Night' she stepped into Jennifer Aniston's territory of rather dumb, flat comedies. Did she really think it's a good script?Although I wasn't intrigued by the concept from the beginning, it had some semi-sophisticated jokes, which made me laugh slightly. But once the 'real' game started, It lost me. It became the usual case of trading sophistication with fights, shots, guns etc...

I suppose it could have been worse and I could have missed out on this gem for years to come but thank goodness it didn't come down to that.Jason Bateman doesn't have very much range as an actor. He's basically Jason Bateman in everything he does, but he can be genuinely funny and he does carry this certain ""IT"" factor that I think has allowed him to succeed in his career. He is perfectly cast as the not-so-successful younger brother to the suave Alex Chandler's older brother. Rachel McAdams, who is almost always a sweetheart and is always attractive, shows off some great comedic chops here too.But what really puts this film over the top are the behind the scenes folks in directing and writing that make this your way above average comedy with a dose of suspense. John Francis Daley (Freaks and Geeks) and Jonathan Goldstein (Horrible Bosses) make for an excellent directing pair taking Mark Perez's wonderful script and giving it some awesome visual aids to make the cityscape look like pieces on a board game.Shout out to the rest of the ensemble, particularly Jesse Plemons, who out does himself again as the very odd neighbor to Bateman and MacAdams characters.",Game Night
183,themovieparadise,Flat Out Not Funny,4,2 March 2018,"Comedy is a hard genre to get right on screen. It is one of the most subjective kinds of films there is, and even comedies that are generally defined as being great can still fall flat for some people. That is simply the nature of the art of comedy. Unfortunately, this results in us, the consumers, not getting very many good comedies. Instead, there is an overabundance of brutally sh*tty comedies that make you dig your face into the palm of your hand and question why you wasted $10 and two hours of your time to watch this garbage. This was exactly my experience with Game Night, the new film from Vacation directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein. I doubt many people were counting down the days until they could go see Game Night, nor could anyone be blamed for thinking it looked like a steaming pile of sh*t. The trailers never came across as if the film could actually be anything worthwhile. But then, the unimaginable happened. Reviews began dropping for the movie, and it suddenly was certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes with an 81% critics rating. I had never intended on seeing Game Night, but after seeing the surprisingly strong reviews it was getting, I decided to go check it out. However, I have come to regret that decision.

187,tmpsvita,There are some good stuff but in general most of the potential is wasted,5,13 May 2018,"A black comedy based on sketch and misunderstandings pouring tributes and quotes from the popular culture of cinema and board games in which I placed great hopes and expectations because full of potential but that unfortunately fails to achieve its goal.
A comedy based on numerous misunderstandings and twists can not afford the luxury of predictability and in ""Game Night"" everything is too predictable; looking at it you can understand every step it is about to take and the time lapse between the intuition of the spectator and the event of that step is too long, the film takes too long to take place and so ends up being really uninspiring and banal despite the 'excellent concept.
It also takes too long to get moving because of an initial part too long in which little or nothing happens if not the presentation of the main characters, and when it starts does not provide the expected entertainment dose because it is saturated with jokes and even quotes overlap each other making themselves too little spontaneous, thus being forced and unrewarding, especially for someone like me who loves quotes and jokes, but in this case I would have preferred that they had given priority to quality than quantity. Also because most of the jokes are obvious, and therefore also predictable, or too stupid to be fun even because of some inadequate and ill-calibrated comedy times.
Too bad because the ideas were very promising but in the end the film gives the best of itself ""only"" where you do not expect it, ie directing and editing, secondary aspects in a film like that, which still allow the film to be for least pleasant from these points of view. Thanks to an intelligent direction, even brilliant with regard to different shots, which blends with considerable harmony with a montage that instead results, in the most interesting scenes, fluid and animated giving the right rhythm in several moments, especially in the final phase that proves to be the one that succeeded better reaching to involve a minimum the public.
Also noteworthy are the special effects often used with great ingenuity and creativity, especially in the shots from above where these are used to show everything as if it were a board game.
But until the end the film chases up trudge and look really tired to a spontaneity and a bite that can never really reach despite being approached several times, fading into a screenplay not entirely convincing that it is not stupid, as shown in a few scenes really hilarious, but that unfortunately behaves like that for most of the time, making the whole movie a comedy not so black nor funny or engaging that you forget quickly and that leaves no sign, eventually wasting its great potential.",Game Night

For me, this movie is sooooo funny and laughable, that makes whole audience laugh so much inside the theater, especially the ""pull out the bullet"" scene, oh boy, it drives me like hell and oh god, Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams are encountering their character each other and the existence left is just humor, tragedy, and epic ending.
I miss Rachel McAdams with her sense of serious in all of her acting, but in this movie we can see other talent of her, that makes her looked smart, funny, happy, and witty because in this movie, she is acting as the wife of Jason Bateman, who wanted to help her husband to overcome his inner fear: being loser of her older brother. When this brother came up with the idea of game night, there is unexpected event coming; the real criminals are coming and nobody notices it. Yup, the drama begins. You can see this actress very great in fighting, jumping, and having sense of high tense. That's my lady, that's Rachel McAdams.
In this movie, the main characters are helped by their friends who are also coming to play the regular game night and they never expect that they will be involved in criminal and mafia world, just because the old brother did the mistakes on the past. The conversations between them are also so funny that makes us forget about our daily problems and make us rethink that maybe we have such silly friends like them in our real life.
As seen on the trailer and on the poster, this movie is about the game, that makes us think that this is one of serious movies like Liam Neeson's, but this movie is better. From the very beginning of this movie, audience will know that they are being tricked because there is real kidnapping, other than a game night planned by one of the character and in the middle plots, audience will never guess what is happening next, but I guarantee you that each scene is important that leads you to understand the main idea of the story and I can guarantee you also that you will be laughing so much and enjoy this movie. Even though there are slapstick jokes and some dark comedies, but this movie is enjoyable for all. There is nothing serious in the plot, but it will never make you bored and never do forward button. I can not even categorize this movie, is this action, drama, or just slapstick movie, but for me this movie is funny, surprising, slapstick, action, and drama in one screen that will make all audience happy!

The comic tone was well maintained, which isn't as easy as it looks. Because it's a Warner Brothers production, it helps to think of it as a live action Looney Tunes, which is why the sometimes painful injuries that characters suffer repeatedly seem to have no consequences two minutes later. Plemmons was brilliantly creepy. Bateman and McAdams will never make anyone forget William Powell and Myrna Loy in the Thin Man series, but they have excellent chemistry together, and the last shot foreshadows a sequel if the grosses are high enough.",Game Night
192,garethvk,"Not A Comedy Not A Drama, But An Interesting Hybrid",7,22 February 2018,"Max (jason Bateman), and his wife Annie (Rachel McAdams), are a loving
couple who met during a trivia night at a bar. Gaming has been a regular
part of their lives, and they are often involved with hosting game nights
for their friends. Max and Annie seems have it all save for a family and
when it is determined that stress may be leading to the problem Max
attempts to resolve the issue. Max has issues with his older brother
Brooks (Kyle Chandler), who he sees as ultra-successful and rubbing his
success in his face. The fact that Max has not seen his brother in a while
is not an issue, the fact that the brother who seems to beet him in
everything has returned is enough to set the mild-mannered Max on edge.
After an enjoyable game night, Brooks offers to host the next one and
although Max knows this is just Brooks looking for a way to show off his
house, he accepts the invitation.Upon arrival, Brooks tells Max, Annie, and their friends that they will be
playing a mystery night where a group of actors will stage a kidnapping
and they must unravel clues to solve the mystery. The fact that Brooks is
offering a prized car that Max has long coveted is all the motivation he
needs to winn the competition.The game starts and a group of goons arrive and rough up Brooks and kidnap
him in front of the guests who all think this is part of the show. They
soon come to reallize that Brooks may not be the person he claims to bend
that the kidnapping may indeed be real and not part of a scripted game.What follows is a mix of comedy and dramatic mystery that while unfolding
slowly at times,is filled with some funny moments and great characters.
Bateman has his likable everyman persona down well in the film and the
supporting cast does a great job playing in the wacky adventure without
every getting to madcap. The breakout star of the film is Jesse Plemons
who plays Max and Annie's creepy police neighbor who is deeply disturbed
following the breakup of his marriage and has taken things to a new level.
You will want to stay through the credits as there are some extra scenes
which round out the film nicely. ""Game Night"", is a pleasant enough film
that cannot quite determine if it is a comedy or dramaedy, but it does
enough good things to make it an enjoyable outing.

196,Amthermandes,THIS is the adult comedy of the year!,9,28 March 2018,"In case you haven't yet read the description or seen the trailers, it's best to know just the very basic plot and not read too much into it. ""Game Night"" is about a group of friends (and one family member and one stranger) engaging in a traditional board/party game night, while trying hard not to include their creepy, socially awkward, yet sympathetic neighbor. A fake-kidnapping-treasure-hunt kind of game goes awry when actual kidnappers take the main character's brother. Hilarity ensues as a chase and a race against the clock commences. All in all it's a well balanced, creative, unique comedy. The humor isn't boring or cliche, the plot is fun, the characters are great. There are some very unrealistic moments and character decisions, however it's a comedy not to be taken seriously, so with suspended disbelief it's quite enjoyable. There are even some neat camera tricks and shots, including a Tarantino-ish continuous action shot that was a lot of fun. Anybody complaining of it lacking originality obviously was either watching the wrong movie, or doesn't have a basic understanding of film theory/history. As an avid board/card/party gamer myself, I had a blast, especially with all the subtle and unsubtle game references. One thing that bugged me however, was as hardcore of gamers as they were, they really only stuck to the most common and mainstream games, when there are SOOO many different kinds of games out now, but I assume they went with those games because they represent the larger companies and so bigger revenue from product placement I guess. Gary was excellent. All the characters were great, even the idiotic ones, but Gary kinda stole the show. It's been a while since I've laughed throughout an entire movie, but this was it. Grab some friends or a date, do not pass go, and go straight to the theaters for a fun and chaotic time. Side note accompanied by a minor, personal rant: I am sick and tired of every modern R-rated adult film feeling the need to fill itself with raunchy material. I was thinking just the other day that if a box office comedy film was aimed strictly at adult audiences, it'll either be a low-brow ripoff of something else, or just another vulgar yawn-fest like ""Hall Pass,"" or ""Knocked Up,"" or ""There's Something About Mary"" (ok, the latter was actually pretty funny, but you get the gist of it). So, ""Game Night"" was something of a can of fresh mountain air from ""Spaceballs,"" as while it did contain sexual content, it was kept at a low level, while the rest of the film was keeping it at an adult level without overdoing it. It was just the right amount of humor on an adult level.",Game Night

200,eparazak,Game Night is a pleasant surprise rather than a terrible romp.,8,28 February 2018,"When I first saw the trailer to this movie, the first thing that came to my mind is that this movie could be pretty good or very bad. Let's talk about it!Game Night is a movie about a group of friends who hold game nights at Max's house. One day, his brother Brooks invites Max and the party over to his house for a ""next level"" Game Night. It turns out that he's putting on a murder mystery. As it goes on however, we learn that the game may not be what Brooks lead onto and I'm not going to say anything else about it.I went into this movie with the idea that it could either be good or bad. When I walked out of the theater, I felt satisfied with what I got. This is a hybrid of a mystery and a comedy and they're both very effective at utilizing both genres. The comedy was sharp and I was sitting in the theater laughing at almost every joke. The screenwriter(s) did a fantastic job with the comedy. They don't resort to low-brow humor like innuendo jokes either, the humor I thought was pretty effective. It also helps that the characters are all pretty likable. From Bateman's Max to even Plemons' Gary, they seemed like normal, everyday people who just wanted to have a good time. As a murder mystery, what's interesting about this is what direction this movie's going to go in. As I said there are many twists that the story takes that leave you on the edge. They allow us to also get insight into Max's brother Brooks and why he acts so stuck-up to him around his friends.I do have a bit of a flaw with this movie however. There is a sideplot involving Lamorne Morris and Kylie Bunbury's characters where Morris finds out that she possibly had an affair with a celebrity when they were not together. The movie constantly cuts back and forth to that plot, which honestly made me feel like groaning because I didn't find it to be as important as the actual plot at hand. Everyone would be in a hurry and then the movie would cut back to this plot and I found it pretty annoying.Even with my problem with this movie's sideplot, Game Night is still a pleasant surprise that holds a mix of both mystery and comedy. This is a movie that, judging from a trailer may look mediocre at best, but it terms of its execution, it can turn into something fun instead.8/10",Game Night
201,Better_Sith_Than_Sorry,"Take a chance on ""Game Night""",7,5 March 2018,"Competently well done, fast-paced ""Game Night"" largely satisfies as the sometimes drama/mostly comedy it was meant to be. Plot in a nutshell: Max (Jason Bateman) and friends gather for their usual 'game night' but get more - way more - than they bargained for when Max's brother comes to town. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams are eminently believable and engaging in the lead roles, and the supporting cast felt spot-on. There are plenty of good one-liners throughout the film and a few (for me and the audience) laugh-out-loud moments; my brother in law apparently REALLY enjoyed the egg-hitting-the-windshield scene, everyone in the theater heard him lose it!While some people are calling this 'wildly original' - for those who might remember, I could not help thinking about 1997's ""The Game"" while watching this. Not that that's a bad thing; ""The Game"" was a pretty good flick (check it out if you haven't seen it). But to be sure, ""Game Night"" also goes in other directions, namely comedy, and it mostly hits the mark. Another reviewer correctly stated that not every joke lands, but within a minute or so it's followed by another that does and the quick pacing means you're never dwelling on much for very long.My only real criticism would be that in the latter stages of the film, it felt like it was trying to out-do itself with twist on top of twist. It was a bit of a roller-coaster, almost as if - pardon the pun - the filmmakers were playing a game of ""Can You Top This?"" with each other, going for one more surprise or two than was really necessary. Overall, though, ""Game Night"" works on several levels and never takes itself too seriously, nor should you.7.5/10. BTW...beginning with the opening credits, the film is littered with references to traditional board games that might go unnoticed, you'll probably have to watch it a 2nd time to catch them all!",Game Night
202,v-ley,"Terrible, terrible film",3,24 June 2018,"I'm such a big fan of Jason Bateman & I enjoy Ms McAdams as well, but not in this. Both took this to another level of stupidity. Even if that's what was called for, it is way over done by her. He tried, you can tell, but this was just not a good pairing at all. 
Things were either over done to distraction or they just weren't remotely acted well. I had waited for so long to see this movie and what a let down. There are moments of laugh out loud but very few and far between. Most of the best parts were seen in the trailer, other than that, a total waste of time.",Game Night

Imagine my surprise when I was treated to one of the best comedies I have see in quite a while. Bateman and McAdams are as likeable and charismatic as you would expect and the rest of the cast are pretty great too. It helps that this cast were given well written, interesting characters to work with. This film also boasts brilliant and creative camera work as well as very imaginative transitions that help to draw the viewer into the story and show that a lot of thought and effort was put into the making of this film. There are a small handful of jokes that don't land and a small number of logical errors but for the most part it is a very funny and entertaining thrill-ride, also stay during the beginning of the credits as they are very well done. Keep away from trailers for this film as they do give some things away that are better not to know going in, once this hits Netflix definitely check it out.",Game Night

This isn't a comedy to be studied by film students for a hundred years but it's not terrible either. It's a go at that tried and true 1930's format: the screwball or mix up comedy.Yeah, the people are idiots but they have to be to be drawn into the mix up. We even have a mild virtue signal that nobody in the film seems to have ever seen a firearm before because, you know, even if they'll save the day, guns are evil and must be confiscated except from police and military. A guy gets severely shot but doesn't seem to be all that inconvenienced by it even if it leaks blood at a rate which would end up killing him in a short while.My point is you simply need to calmly go with it accepting it at face value rather than thinking you'd never do such dopey stuff so it's annoying to see others do it too.

Some jokes are very funny, but most of them are dragged to much, taking them to a stupid level of absurdity.

Although I get the whole purpose of the character of Gary, I just wasn't a huge fan of that. The guy who played Brooks was also lacking a bit, which is the only reason it didn't get a 10/10 for me.

216,DarthPaul85,"A fairly ""safe"" comedy without too many jokes.",6,2 March 2018,"I'm a fan of Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams, and I thought the premise was cute, so I figured the movie was worth seeing. Meh? It reminded me a lot of ""Date night,"" with Steve Carrel and Tina Fay. I think Date Night was funnier, but if you like one you'll probably enjoy the other. The trailer gives away pretty much everything- not that it really matters, but I was kind of disappointed the film didn't throw in a few more genuine surprises. 
The characters (actors) were good, but I was disappointed the film didn't give them more chances to shine. Jesse Plemons is the best part of the movie, and he's used *just* enough. The other characters felt underused. The script feels a bit light. I expected a bit more humor about playing games- the premise was there to play up more of the banality/irony/sadness of adult game nights, but those moments are glossed over fairly quickly. The film balances telling the story with inserting humor fairly evenly, which means a few scenes feel like they are (unnecessarily) humorless. I suppose on the flip side, the film holds on to some integrity and stands out from a more ""over the top"" farce. Overall, It wasn't a bad comedy, but it's pretty low-energy. Nothing too offensive or wild, fairly ""safe"" material. Most of the jokes felt safe for PG-audiences (or course, the language and violence are very R-rated). I'm not sorry I saw it, but I probably won't see it again. I'd wait for it on Netflix if I were you.",Game Night

There are plot holes large enough to driver a tank through. There are action devices so unlikely that they aren't credible. (To be fair, however, they are there for comic relief, not credibility.)

Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams had awesome chemistry and were hilarious as a couple. In fact, all of the couples worked well together and the relationships were all unique in their comedy dynamics. Another reviewer on here compares this to *shudder* Hot Tub Time Machine 2, and says this was full of pop culture references. All I can say to that is they must have seen a different movie or is WAY out of touch (unless a Fight Club reference is still considered pop culture).

229,bodhi-13262,Far more entertaining than 'Black Panther'.,7,24 February 2018,"Only a mere week after the release of a MARVEL Blockbuster, 'Game Night' sneaks its way into theaters just in time for some unwinding laughter in the wake of the overly-hyped 'Black Panther'.1. Max and Annie (Jason Bateman & Rachel McAdams) are a competitive gaming couple who host a ""game night"" every week for their friends. However, when Max's egotistical and over-achieving brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler) pops into town for a visit, he decides to compete with Max and host his own ""game night"" by setting up a kidnapping/mystery for his guests. However, when things don't go according to plan, Max and Annie ultimately find themselves in a game that turns more dangerous than they can imagine. The plot is simple, but its the clever writing that makes all the difference here. The movie has a few generic moments between Max and Annie, but they are brief as the story moves fast. Every scene has a carefully thought-out set-up that ultimately and surprisingly pays off unlike most recent comedies in the past few years.2. While I thought his performance might be different this time around, Bateman plays the ""Straight-man"" once again as with every role he takes. Rachel McAdams is the stand-out of the two, as she seems to be having more fun with the role. Never have I been a fan of hers, but as far as comedies go, I wouldn't mind mind seeing her in more roles like this. Personally, the funniest charcter in this entire film is Ryan (Billy Magnussen), the couple's dimwitted friend. He may appear to be the typical dumb-guy to most, but he's more naive and charming than anything. Magnussen steals every scene that he's in and every time he spoke of did anything, it had me rolling. He also has a cute yet subtle romantic sub-plot with the new girl he's dating, but unfortunately, the film skips their resolution.3. Kyle Chandler (Brooks) and Jesse Plemons (Gary) previously worked together on my all-time favorite drama-series 'Friday Night Lights', but it's refreshing to see them in this where they finally get to showcase their comedy chops. Plemons plays Max and Annie's neighbor who's also a recently divorced cop with a weird vibe to him. Despite his creepy tone, Plemons brings the humor in subtle ways and has a bigger role in the midst of things than one might think. Sharon Horgan (Sarah) and Kylie Bunbury (Michelle), I can't decide who I have the bigger crush on because they are the most gorgeous women (in a classical beauty sense) I've seen on screen this year. The film isn't flawless as some characters banter over irrelevant things while in risky and time constrained situations.After their last feature 'Vacation', I didn't think there was any coming back for the writing/directing duo of John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein, but they surprisingly redeemed themselves with this film. This is a comedy I wouldn't mind going back in theaters to see, because I had a good time and left feeling happy. My advice, skip seeing 'Black Panther' a second time and go see this, it won't disappoint:)",Game Night

It was another throwback from the 80s - 90s movies that wasn't all about educating society or enlightening them to whatever (fill-in-the-blank) issue educating us to whatever Hollywood's most recent ""cause"" is, but simply entertains. The actors fit their parts perfectly. The storyline is riddled with so many holes, you could squeeze through them, but I didn't care because I was too busy laughing at the truly non-gross-out humor we so rarely get to see these days. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams (as Max and Annie respectively) were seriously challenged as the best actors in the movie by the entire rest of the cast, including a cameo at the end by Michael C. Hall (Dexter). Lamorne Morris (New Girl) and Kylie Bunbury played the very funny couple who spend most of the movie discussing a one-night stand she had with a Hollywood celebrity (or she thought) before they were married, and Billy Magnussen (Into the Woods) and Sharon Horgan play the hilariously mismatched couple, Ryan and Sarah whose main humor is his total ignorance about everything and her rolling eyes at how stupid he is. Then there was a surprising turn by Kyle Chandler who plays Max's wealthy brother, Brooks, and Annie's creepy next door neighbor, Gary, who coincidentally is played by Jesse Plemons - both Chandler and Plemons starred in the great TV show, Friday Night Lights together. This group has serious chemistry all together, including the small part Michael C. Hall has.As a comedy, I would probably peg it as somewhat slap-stick. But if you just sit back and just watch it as it is, without thinking too hard about it, you cannot help but laugh at the genuinely funny things that kept happening as the story progressed. It actually reminded me a little bit of Saturday Night Live in it's early days, before it became a political mouthpiece. There was continuous chatter between the characters, no matter how serious the situations they were dealing with, which made it even funnier. I suspect this is another movie that the regular folks like me will love. The artsy-fartsy folks will be scratching their heads wondering what the heck just hit them. To say Jason Bateman, so excellent in the Netflix show Ozark, has serious comedic flare is an understatement. Having seen Rachel McAdams in other comedies, this was a lark for her. If you can put aside your need for total reality for one night and just sit back and let it flow over you, you will love this movie. I wish they made MORE like this today! I gave it 8 Stars because it's not a great movie, but it's a FUN movie. It's entertainment of the purest form. At nobody's or group's expense. It pretty much sends up all stereotypes, and is an offend-free movie. Highly recommended. The best time I've spent watching a movie in a while! Rent it and watch it.

My lack of experience in comedy makes me hesitant to watch them, which is strange, considering the level of depression that hovers around our day to day lives in a near-constant reminder of just how terrible life in America is becoming. I need to just sit back, relax, and try to enjoy more comedies.I didn't want to watch GAME NIGHT. And I'm kicking myself, because I almost let it go by.Jason Bateman (who plays the lead, here) was kind of a prick when he was a kid. Every movie he was in, and every show he was a part of, all I saw was a smiling smart-ass whom I truly despised. I'm amazed the man is now a regular part of the A-list. I wonder if he was humbled, somewhere along the line, which made him great.Because he is. Paired with the ever-awesome Rachel McAdams, who I first saw in THE NOTEBOOK, and now realize that hers and Ryan Gosling's performances are the only reason that movie is as good as it is, they have chemistry. They have camaraderie. They make it all work: a believable, loving couple sticking together through some really incredible crap that's thrown into their lives.The whole cast does their part, here: Kylie Brunbury (Michelle) does such a great job here that I was surprised to see she hasn't had that many major roles to play (yet). Lamorne Morris (Kevin) adds his own chemistry between him and Michelle, to add some great comedic moments. Kyle Chandler (Brooks) has come a long way from EARLY EDITION, the thing I remember him the most for. Even Michael C. Hall gives a great performance, even though he's in very little of the movie.Sure, the plot's been done before: what the main characters think is happening is actually REALLY happening in front of them, instead of it being fake. But I laughed. I laughed, and then I laughed some more. Even when I thought the jokes were ridiculous, when I thought they might be WAY over the top, I was still laughing. The best comedies are all about FEEL, about creating a consistent stream of funny that we accept, even when the jokes sometimes don't hit as hard as they should.And GAME NIGHT has that in spades. It's funny. REALLY funny. And it's even touching, in several moments. I had fun with this movie, and recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh.Cause you'll have more than one.

It wasn't crazy enough to get the double play, but it got an out out of nowhere. Based on the trailer alone, there were very low expectations. Definitely looked like a cheesy, predictable, and typical spring comedy. But it provided a fresh surprise.
 Taking place in your average group of friends' game nights, they started with a premise that I could get behind. As a lover of board games and game nights with friends, the beginning of the film was almost an excerpt from my life. Specifically, the intro montage. That montage started the movie off with a bang, hitting me right in the déjà vu. Sadly, the movie from that point on, was only able to build upon that for a short time. As the movie continued, it held on for as long as it could to get to the end, it faded.
 Luckily for it, they were able to get the audience to the end. It wasn't the bang shock finish of a perfect movie, but a lingering end, that almost left a bad taste in the mouth, but was able to give a few more jokes (and a fantastic credits sequence) that reminded you of how good the movie actually was. 
 Bateman and McAdams were able to drive the plot along, with some minor plots being less exciting than the others. But with fantastic comedic timing, and no comedic timing was better than supporting actor Jesse Plemons, playing the creepy, weirdo next door. His character helped to bridge the gap between the pure humor and the slightly off-putting/creepy nature of parts of the film. 
 Looking to the future, I think this will be a movie that will be revisited every once in a while, not the best, but hopefully not forgotten.",Game Night

Although it is at first potentially promising, with an entertaining backstory and graced with handsome visual polish, this film very quickly becomes a pitiful parade of idiocy by its main players, so to speak. Almost nobody in this film doesn't make a fool of him or herself at one point or much of the time. Jason Bateman does his best with the wretched script. Rachel McAdams hasn't been this bad since ""Morning Glory"". The only bright spot is Jesse Plemons, who gives a chilling performance as a loner cop. But he, of course, cannot hope to carry the film.A screwball comedy is a tried and true genre, but this one suffers from too much self-consciousness and too many characters who proudly wear their stupidity on their sleeve. Perhaps the unintentionally hilarious fact about this film is that it could wind up being a documentary on how people who are brilliant at Charades might be woefully incompetent in most other facets of life.

This film is written by Mark Perez (Accepted). It stars Jason Bateman (Arrested Development), Rachel McAdams (The Notebook) and Kyle Chandler (Argo).This film is hilarious and a rather great action film. The direction is brilliant, especially the car chases which are surprisingly thrilling. You don't expect great action and direction from a comedy film, but it is truly breathtaking direction. In one scene the directors make a chase around a house even more heart ponding because they shot it in one take. But by far the best thing about this film is Jesse Plemons (Battleship) as the main characters next door neighbor. He is so funny every time he was on screen I laughed.But the film is a tad overlong with one to many twists at the end making it seem like the creative team had tones of different endings and didn't know which one to go with, so they just did all of them.

There was so much hype around it. So many reviewers and people had explained that it was one of the best Hollywood comedies in a very long time. But then it got comparisons to The Hangover, which I'm not a fan of. Maybe I had put too much on the film, that I wanted too much from it. But it didn't wow me like it did with most people. Even now I'm seeing it on favorite lists and best film lists. I wouldn't put it that high. But I did, after the second time I saw it, enjoyed it much more than I did the first time.Game Night stars Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as Max and Anne a married couple who met at a game night and now throw game nights at their house for their close friends. When Max's brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler) shows up, he stages a murder mystery game night but things quickly escalate out of hand. Their fun game night turns into a comedic mess with mysterious characters, action, drama, suspense and a hilarious incident with a neighbor's dog. Rounding out the cast is Jesse Plemons as a neighbor who used to join in on game night, Lamorne Morris, Kylie Bunbury, Sharon Horgan, and Billy Magnussen. There are a few cameos in the film that I won't spoil here.Directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein do a very smart thing in shooting the film more like a thriller or an action movie. There are wide shots, long tracking shot and a nice vivid color palette to the cinematography. It makes for a more immersive feel of the film. It doesn't look like a comedy at all. When the comedy happens they are forced, it comes natural either from the characters or the situations they find them in. Plemons character is there for comedic timing but it works with the rest of the film. I wouldn't really consider this an action comedy but it gets there. Being R Rated (thank you, filmmakers, for that) the film is surprisingly violent. Characters get beaten, shot and there's one gruesome death near the end.Bateman is doing his usual shtick but it works well for the film. McAdams seems like she is having a blast and she shines in the film. He character you can not root for the entire time. They have great chemistry and like all couples their share of ups and down. If anyone outdoes McAdams is Plemons who steals every scene as their police officer neighbor who doesn't get the invite to game night anymore for a reason best seen then explained here. He's creepy, he's odd, but he's downright hilarious almost every time he's on screen. I've seen him in things before but this is his break out performance and I'm very excited to see him in this the upcoming Antlers with Guillermo del Toro on as a producer.When the film gets wild it's nice to see the filmmakers have seen a few action movies. The scenes are shot well and not edited to death. There is a chase that builds some nice tension with also being pretty funny. The directors use some angles and types of shots not normally used in a comedy. I'm happy to say they shot the film like a movie, not a comedy. After this second viewing, I can very much recommend Game Night as a pretty funny comedic thriller. I don't see them making a sequel but when the final moment in the film, I wouldn't be surprised. This is definitely a gather a group and all laugh together type of film.",Game Night

262,littlemankazoo,"A fun, darkly comedic detour",6,3 March 2018,"A comedy that has actual DIRECTING behind it along with some interesting visuals and cracks at Edgar Wright-styled editing tricks, 'Game Night' is actually quite entertaining for what is, by-and-by, a mainstream dark comedy.The film's cinematography at times is crafted to appear like the events we are witnessing are all part of a board-game itself, which presents interesting visuals for action scenes and establishing shots.Other things to note that are exceptional is the synth-based score, which is NOT what I was expecting to get coming into a comedy. Whether or not it ""fits"" the film, I would debate, but I found it fun.Along with these is the performance by Jesse Plemons, which is wonderfully deadpan and creepy. Most of the laughs come from his brilliant performance, I found, and all of them are certainly earned.My problems, however, come in the form of that there is just simply too much fat that wasn't trimmed from the film that make it lumber about. The film itself is only a brisk hour-and-40 minutes, but I will admit firsthand that this film DRAGS in portions. I cannot believe that a film that felt that long was only 100 minutes. Scenes drag-on to cram in references to other movies, or to try to get additional laughs from an audience that can feel the length just a bit. It feels convoluted at certain points, and I would argue some less-patient audience members would start checking their watches with this film.In addition, a clear inspiration to these filmmakers was director Edgar Wright's work, as much of the editing tricks and shots are clearly inspired by his own ""flavor"" of comedy. In the end, they work and look great when they're included...but I then have to ask myself: ""Do they BELONG in this film?"". In the end, it just makes it feel more and more like Diet Edgar Wright.That said, I cannot say I DIDN'T have a good time with this film. When it's funny, it is FUNNY, and I can't say I dislike a comedy with clear direction and writing that doesn't sound like it was written by committee.If you need some time to kill and want a fun little detour of dark comedy, this isn't such a bad one to check out.6/10",Game Night

""Game Night"" is a blast, a sharp adult comedy that earns genuine laughs without going lowbrow or diving into raunchy humor.
Directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein maintain a positive tone throughout and keep the laughs flowing at a steady pace. Bateman and McAdams are a lot of fun together, and it's exciting to see McAdams enjoying herself on screen for the first time since ""Doctor Strange."" The rest of the cast is great and seem to really play off each other.

The rare major studio comedy that actually feels like a film, rather than a soulless exercise in assembly-line filmmaking, thanks to such creative choices like Cliff Martinez's thumping score and Barry Peterson's cinematography, which not only introduces new locations as if zooming in on a board game piece, but also sports a surprisingly well-executed long take. Lamorne Morris and Billy Magnussen are some of the obvious standouts among the film's enjoyable cast of characters, but Jesse Plemons is the true MVP, stealing every single one of his scenes with ease. The film isn't without its problems, with the convoluted third act jumping the shark almost to the point of parody, and not all of the jokes land (although most do thanks to the cast's great comedic timing), but nonetheless GAME NIGHT makes for a perfectly fun time at the movies.",Game Night

Xavier, Esq.We all have that friend that takes a joke too far, or know a person who tries way too hard to be clever, or laughs at exactly the wrong place during the joke - right before the punch-line is delivered. Well, Game Night is like having all those people in the same room together at the same time - and it's frequently hilarious.Max and Annie, played by Jason Bateman and Rachel MacAdams, are an overly-competitive married couple who excel at playing and winning games like charades, scrabble, and Dance Dance Revolution - it's how they met and the tie that binds. When Max's brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler) one-ups the couple by staging the best game night ever, sibling rivalry and deadly hijinks raise the stakes to an all-time high.The Good: Game Night is a clever, funny movie that takes advantage of unexpectedly excellent acting by Billy Magnussen, Lamorne Morris & Jesse Plemons - they're the bit players who shine a bright light of hilarity throughout the show.The Bad: Inception-styled game-within-a-game staging that gets old after a few deliveries, and game-board styled camera angles that underscore the obvious fact that we're watching a movie about - you guessed it - games. Co-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein never seem to strike an even tone thoughout - except one of constant one-upsmanship. The movie never stops being fun, but you get the feeling that all the car chases, cardboard villains, gunshots and blood-splatters are the result of a massive brainstorm-styled meeting where everyone in attendance contributed their own ideas of what might work - and all of these delicacies were thrown into the pot and cooked at the exact same temperature. Unfortunately, fun and funny aren't always related to one another.Game Night is a great movie for a February release - it gets us out of the house and whets the appetite for Spring - but blockbuster material it isnt.

270,aigoalies,Good Comedy With Some Cringe Moments,6,26 May 2020,"Lets start with the good. This movie was extremely funny basically all the jokes landed for me and I was laughing the entire way. This comedy was also extremely refreshing with a unique premise and pretty well executed. The only thing holding this movie back was the cringe moments that appeared throughout the movie.Game Night had a total of 4 different subplots they were trying to balance along with the main plot of being a comedic crime/thriller. The subplots themselves were not inherently bad but the way they were dealt with was. The first subplot was the girlfriend cheating on his husband with ""Denzel Washington"". This inherently is not a bad subplot and was actually pretty funny with the flashbacks and drake song. However, what makes it cringe is the fact that it was dealt with and brought up in literal life or death situations like finding the egg. The second subplot was the fact that Jason Batemen was infertile and also not wanting a baby (Juno?). This was the truly cringe subplot and unfortunately the one brought up the most. It almost felt like they were just trying to throw this typical subplot into the movie to make it more
""mainstream"". If it wasn't for this one subplot, this movie might have been an 8 or 9. Once again it is brought up during life or death situations and leads to cringy and cliche monologues. The third subplot was the dumb dude (forgot his name) falling in love with the smart British lady. I actually didn't mind this one but they sort of left it unfinished with the last scene of them, as I remember, being her calling out their conversation being extremely awkward and then suddenly three months later, they're dating. The fourth subplot was the fact that his brother had been lying to him. Once again I didn't mind this because it was a heartfelt moment but it was very close to being cringe.Some other problems with the movie comes with the use of humor during life or death situations, like for example the couple arguing about the phone while jason batemen was bleeding to death. Another problem of course was the unrealisticness of the entire ordeal and multiple plotholes that arose. My recommendation would have been to either make a comedic thriller or a typical comedy, instead I felt like I watched a typical comedy and an intense thriller mashed into one.Obviously I'm harping on the negatives that hold the movie back instead of the positives but overall I had a good time and some good laughs.",Game Night

Let's forget that all the characters act in ways SO FAR removed from how any normal person would, that it's entirely impossible to suspend disbelief. Let's forget the lazy jokes which consist of 90% pop culture references and 10% stupid gross-out humor. Let's forget all of that. Answer me two questions: 1. What were the characters? 
None of the characters make a LICK of sense, nor do they have any defining traits. For example, what more do you know about the African-American couple other than that they're African-American and a couple? How does the bait-and-switch running gag with the blonde guy actually being an idiot make sense, if he's so stupid that he's actually mentally retarded, but apparently still has a fancy job? Who is the Irish woman except ""Irish woman"", and why doesn't she GET OUT THE MOMENT SHE FINDS OUT IT'S (partly) REAL? Who are McAdams and Bateman, except for non-stop quippy morons who seem unfazed by being shot and watching people die gruesomely? 2. What was the plot?

It is apparent that the actors had a fun time in the filming of this movie as well, as their performances reflect that and make for some of the best gags I've seen in recent memory.Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams' character have an entertaining, believable romance that the story doesn't hinge too heavily on, but instead make for a character dynamic that is electric and entertaining to watch anytime they share a scene together. Jesse Plemons almost steals the show in this movie, his line delivery and mannerisms make for some of the funniest situational comedy I've seen all year. He was a delight anytime he was on screen and I wish we got to see more of him. As for a couple gripes with the movie, there's a handful of scenes where a character tells a joke - that is funny - but loses momentum when another character intervenes and explains the joke out loud, as if the screenwriters felt the need to explain the joke to the audience directly.

Of course there's a twist, but you have to watch it. Listen to the dialogue as there are plenty of one-liners you might miss. Specifically, moles and semen. Like I said, very funny and rewind if you have to re-watch scenes to get some of the jokes. That's always a good sign. My wife and I re-watch this every time it's on regular TV. Guessing you can watch it on NetFlix or Amazon, that way you won't miss out on some of the swearing. By the way, this movie references many other movies, especially Fight Club.

Brooks: I got the Tony Stark part, but then you went full nerd on me.""Taking the fun concept of a Game movie and turning it on it's head multiple times. A lot of silliness and over the top action, it's exactly the type of movie that just fills you with happiness on rainy night.Fantastic cast of Jason Bateman, Rachel McAdams, Kyle Chandler, Sharon Horgan, Billy Magnussen, Lamorne Morris, Kylie Bunbury, and Jesse Plemons. Their comedic chemistry is really good, it's directed well, and has a great script. I really hope that they get to make a sequel.I don't want to spoil any of the plot so this is a short review...don't even watch the trailer before seeing this movie, just watch it and enjoy it!",Game Night
285,MarkoutTV,"Compared to most mainstream comedy, it's Citizen Kane",7,3 March 2018,"This was nice.As far as mainstream comedy film goes, this was as good as it gets. I went to this film on a recommendation with only the knowledge that Jason Bateman was in it, which is fine. That's the only motivation one should need to see a film, because Jason Bateman is the man.But because I went into this film not knowing much about it and ended up endlessly entertained, I would want any readers of this to experience the same way, so I'm going to go light on the plot. Jason Bateman and the unexpectedly to me hi-fucking-larious Rachel McAdams are a couple that fell in love due to their fiercely competitive nature. They are both serious when it comes to games and once they are a couple, they are unbeatable together.Now married, Bateman's brother comes to town much to his chagrin. His brother is a rich and successful Playboy and the only person that Bateman has not measured up to competitively. Soon after, Bateman's brother invites the couple as well as their normal party guests to a game night at his house. But as it so happens, it is far from your normal game night and soon our characters find themselves in over their heads in the quest to solve a great mystery.That's all I'm giving you plot wise.I wouldn't call this film ""smart"" the way others have called it. There are a couple plot holes (or at least muddy bits of plot that could have been explained better), seemingly ham fisted twists and more than your average dramatic conveniences. But compared to most mainstream comedies, this is Citizen freaking Kane.Where this film is indeed very smart though is in the dialogue and creativity. The film is a non-stop joke factory and the vast majority land. All the main actors here have great chemistry and comedic timing with one another, and the writing is so funny that you will not spend any significant length of time not laughing or smiling. To boot the characters will find themselves in some truly absurd and hilarious situations, some of which had me in stitches. In fact this is easily the most I have laughed at a film in quite some time, especially in a theater.Jason Bateman's comedic delivery is at it's typical brilliance here, but Rachel McAdams blew me away with her performance. I am not too familiar with her work and although I've seen comedies with her in them, I've never seen her be the funny character in those comedies. Here, she shines with completely natural comedic timing, whether it be her witty comebacks, her selling of the absurdity of situations, or her physical comedy. She impressed the hell out of me.Joining our married couple on their grand mission are four supporting characters who serve as the regular game night party guests. Wrapped up into this unexpected situation, they all have a role to play in solving the mystery, and they are all super funny, both in their own right, and when bouncing off their fellow partygoers.Sometimes it's nice to go to a theater and simply be pleasantly surprised and entertained. That's rare nowadays, especially when it comes to comedies. To see a comedy that relies on good writing and character work, and not on bad improv, farts, sex, pop culture or any of the other go-tos and to have it actually be funny; well, it's simply such a breathe of fresh air. Go see this film if you just want to be entertained.Oh and before this movie I couldn't tell you who Jesse Plemons was, but he looks like a discount Matt Damon and I love him.",Game Night

295,Tkbn3812,Funny movie with plenty to enjoy,8,20 May 2018,"Game Night is a great Mystery-Crime-Comedy film. It's got a very basic yet intriguing premise; a group of friends who think they're taking part in a typical game night accidentally involve themselves in a true criminal mystery.Rachael McAdams and Jason Bateman both shine in their roles. The acting by everyone in the film overall is brilliant but these two have such a great chemistry, I'd love to see more movies from them in the future. Seriously, their couple of Max and Annie are such fun to follow throughout the entire film.Also, I thought the humour was very good and well balanced with the rest of the film. There were some great jokes all over the film; the whole Gary character, the entire scene where Annie tries to take a bullet out of Max (so perfectly awkward!), the ultra-cringey yet still-humorous Ryan. Also, there's this funny but somewhat weird storyline with Kevin and Michelle; very funny at first but the novelty wears off after a little.Now for the criticisms. This movie is a great comedy but not a great mystery. Basically because there's no mystery. It's actually pretty disappointing, because the entire movie is meant to revolve around the whole Murder Mystery game concept, and yet it throws that way before even halfway. In fact, I'm gonna be honest, this movie did a good job with the concept but not a great job. It did a great job on the comedy front, but the Murder Mystery concept could have been so much more! Shame.The constant twists get a little tiring at the end (at least they self-parody it by the end though). The final act is funny yet too quick. I dunno, I guess the movie just needs a little more refinement here and there, in terms of plot.Still, it's a great comedy. Just not as great a mystery/crime movie. So don't watch this movie if you're hoping for a great mystery-comedy. Just watch it if you want a great comedy.",Game Night

I will have to say that this film was great surprise to have a smart R-rated Dark comedy. Justin Bateman and Rachel McAdams have terrific chemistry in film. The performances of Billy Magnussen, Sharon Horgan, Lamorne Morris, Kylie Bunbury, Michael C. Hall, and Kyle Chandler were spot on. I honestly believe Jesse Plemons gave the performance of his career while channeling Michael Shannon performance in Natural Animals. John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein direction of this film was major comeback considering their first film was Vacation, I hope they do direct the Flashpoint film but only if the writer of this film comes along to write the Flashpoint film. I can see this film being nominated for an Oscar for best original screenplay for next years awards season. I had two small issues with film one was a joke that I found offensive, next was that the film was ten minutes too long. I am going against most other film critics; I am giving this film 9 and ¾ stars out of 10.",Game Night

298,hp-33729,Jason Bateman is Jason Bateman... again,5,8 May 2018,"Jason Bateman plays Jason Bateman again in his millionth mediocre attempt at comedy. These days it feels like he releases a flick every single week. People seem to like these half-assed movies though, because as of writing this review Game Night has a 7.3 rating on IMDb, which is honestly baffling to me. How can this movie get such a high score? Game Night is boring, jokes that land are scarce, the characters are all uninteresting and annoying, their actions are rather cringe inducing than funny, and definitely not in a good way like Ricky Gervais did it in The Office. It is also 20 minutes longer than it should be, there's so much time wasting going on before the plot starts rolling that I almost turned it off. The story itself is OK, but it's clearly underdeveloped and maybe this type of plot works better in a thriller like The Game with Michael Douglas anyway.Other things that caught my attention are the over the top camera work, the loud acid soundtrack that doesn't really match the movie, and the weird, unnecessary fight sequences that go on way too long for some reason. Feels like the director is trying too hard to show off his skills. Less is more guys, but be on point.All in all, it should be a 5 out of 10.",Game Night

304,aliahmedashraf,Sadly can't rate it a zero,1,25 May 2018,"Let me start off by saying that the only reason I went ahead and watched it was because of the 7.1 rating on IMDb. Can't unfortunately rate it a zero. Hated Kevin for being an annoying pain in the ass by constantly nagging and berating Michelle. You're supposed to be a grown man. So what if your wife slept with another man? You were both broken up at that point. Next we have the dumbass who later grows some brains, Ryan. Asking stupid questions, reacting stupidly and just being a stupid gap-filling character to use up the run-time of the movie. I'm very surprised how Sarah decides to stick around to the end of the movie keeping in mind how stupid Ryan is ($116 bribe, anyone?). She's STILL with Ryan after the ""Three months later"" bit. Gary the divorced police officer, for me, was not creepy at all. Infact, most people would have earmarked him to be the villain but unsurprisingly, he turns out to be the savior in a way. The egg scene at Danny Anderton's house was lame and not believable i.e. when Max ""catches"" the egg thrown FROM BELOW by Annie. Also, you can't just WALK INTO a huge house unnoticed. More eyes are bound to be on you because you're not even dressed for the occasion. The scene where Max gets shot in the arm and Annie casually just decides to operate on him and sew him up was ridiculous. Apparently Annie reached the bone and they're tapping on the bone like it's no big deal and that it doesn't hurt. Similarly, when Max is on the police database computer, the dog decides to become a vampire and licks the blood. No house-dog in their right mind would ever lick human blood. And finally, the end scene where the kidnapper dude gets sucked into the plane's turbine. 1) The speed wasn't enough to suck him into it but it happens anyway and 2) Annie just witnesses a guy being sucked into a turbine and DYING in front of her in a rather gruesome way to which she doesn't even flinch and instead says ""Yes!"" followed up with a bland ""Oh no, he died!""

Stuff like Early Man and Black Panther and I would go the length and say Maze Runner 3 have been on point.

Then we have the worst movie of last year, Fist Fight. Now here comes Game Night, a sucky, failed attempt at making people go to the movies.There is but one thing I think is good in the movie. Actually no, two things since I feel generous.
-Jesse Plemmens gives a charismatic performance as the fat guy in the group.
-There was a joke towards the beginning of the movie that had me bawling with laughter.
Now the flaws. There are a bunch.These actors give fine performances, with the exception of Jesse Plemmens who is pretty decent. It's just that the script in which they were handed was so forced with the most blatant pop culture references I have seen in a while, movie, TV show, anything!The movie has a really cool concept. does it deliver? no. All the movie comes down to is just a tired rip-off of many other films and a lazy cash cow that will probably make a lot of bucks.

307,jroyals-04341,Misfire,3,19 April 2020,"This flick aired on TNT last night and neither one of us had seen it but based on the cast and what I had read, I told her we should check it out. We were intrigued by the first 20 minutes as the setup gave us hope even though neither one of us hardly laughed at that point which should have been a red flag. Nevertheless, things really started to get interesting when the Brooks character showed up as this movie needed rescuing and Kyle Chandler is just the actor to do it. Then what followed was not only funny but the vulgar, tasteless humor began to snowball and it was just awkward. Just vulgarity for cheap laughs. What worked in Horrible Bosses fell flat here. Of course, in that flick you had more talented cast members alongside Bateman such as Jamie Fox, Colin Farrell, etc. and Charlie Day playing the stupid character. This one had Bateman and Chandler. Unlike other reviewers, I don't see the appeal of Rachel McAdams and never have; she is not funny and needs a talented cast around her to carry a movie for it to succeed (e.g. Wedding Crashers). In order for this movie to work they should have cast someone like Julie Bowen as Bateman's wife. Bowen killed it in Horrible Bosses, not to mention Modern Family. Even Jennifer Aniston would have worked much better than McAdams who is just cringeworthy as she tries to execute the Amanda Plummer coffee shop scene in Pulp Fiction much less. I get that the neighbor (Jesse Plemons) was supposed to be creepy but didn't need to be beaten over the head with it to the point of it not being funny. What we did watch was painful and embarrassing and thank goodness it was TNT where there are commercial breaks so I could suggest we change the channel and spare my wife the rest of this trainwreck.",Game Night

It's a notch below crowd favorite comedies such as 21 Jump Street or Horrible Bosses. It belongs more to the B level class of comedy movies such as Horrible Bosses 2 or Central Intelligence or Due Date or Hangover 2 etc. There is nothing ground breaking about the plot, some of the wise cracks are great but the mundane almost cliche to the point plot that you can actually foretell what's going to happen next puts a dampener on any comedic flourishes. The plot is really tired, basically a mishmash of The Game, Hangover and whatever the script writer wanted to throw at the wall. I went to see this movie because it had an above average rating on IMDB and for a comedy (or horror) it's tough to even get rated high so I thought it would be a somewhat higher quality affair.

Tilt shifts shots and a synth soundtrack are used aplenty to give this film a hip and unique feel. There is an ambitious, continuous action shot that is genuinely engaging and subtle uses of CGI that add authentic comedic effects. Performances from Rachel McAdams, Jesse Plemons, Lamorne Morris and Sharon Horgon range from enjoyable to highly memorable. Yet, despite all this praise, the fundamental flaws of Game Night hold the movie back in a major way.While clever details and wit do make their way into the script, the meat of the story is spent meandering through cliche scenes primarily motivated to get cheap laughs. This is to be occasionally expected in a comedy but there comes a point when the story being told becomes practically nothing at all. This issue is only exasperated by the performance of Jason Bateman, who spends much more time coming off as a jerk than anything else. Condescension can be a funny trait to dip into but when it is the only note our protagonist plays, it becomes hard to root for. Deceptively packaged with sleek techniques and a surprise supporting cast, Game Night amounts to a story about almost nothing and an unintentionally dislikable hero.Writing: 2/10

I didn't go into it with high hopes, but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. There's quite a few moments that raised a bit of a giggle, and there was one moment in it that literally had me crying with laughter because it was so ridiculous.
Rachel McAdams was the biggest surprise of all, I'd classed her as a drama actress, but she's got brilliant comic timing. The cast overall is really well put together, there isn't one bad apple in the bunch.
It's a fun, simple-but-sometimes-smart, slightly slapstick, dark comedy. Much better than I was expecting it to be.",Game Night

I was aware of the setup of the movie: Hard-core, competitive ""game night"" friends get whisked into a real crime scenario but believe it is all part of the game. I was concerned that this premise would go on so long that the characters would all seem stupid (like, really, they can't catch on to the fact that this is life and death for real?). Fortunately that wasn't the case. The characters did wise up in a reasonable amount of time, but by that point, they were so deep into trouble already. Well done.

For me however it should have focused more on the situations and relationships that produced these laughs rather than the inevitable action sequences that then stretched credibility too far.

But the problems, oh my.The over-the-top comedy so often just missed the right spot. It wasn't believable, yet at the same time not crazy enough to take it to the next level. So many of the jokes fell in between somewhere, right in that gap where it's jarring and just not funny. And to make it worse, all of the 'gamer-geek' part of it was wrong too. It missed on both the cliche stereotypes as well as reality, and was just a complete mess. Probably the most awkward moment was when they showed up to ""game night"" at his brother's with three of the most cliche board games ever, when none of the game nights actually featured any board games at all, but rather party games.The acting, on the other hand, was good. I felt like the actors did way more with what they were given than what the rest of the movie deserved. If the script had been on the same level as the acting, it could've been an easy top-notch classic comedy. Instead, it wasn't all that funny most of the time, and very forgettable.",Game Night

The story was surprisingly easy to follow considering the way it starts is you think it's going to branch into three different storylines but they shut it down quickly. Probably my favorite part of any Jason Bateman movie is him freaking out on people. Usually give a synopsis but can't really without giving away too much of the film. A lot of the actors are familiar faces with the exception of a few. The cast was certainly diverse in the character concepts. Love when comedy films keep an ongoing joke throughout the film; ya know something they can call back to throughout the film saying ""no we didn't forget and I'm sure you didnt"" also had the classic main character background story that progressed throughout which makes for a feel good happy ending.

348,lindarctica,Smart movie that's guarenteed good time!,7,31 May 2018,"While it is adverted as a ''hilarious'' comedy, i must admit my mouth corners didn't agree. Got a good chuckle out of some things but the hilarity kinda falls flat on it's face. With the humor being the bulk of what the movie has to offer, it's not much. Not to mention the ton of pop-culture references that will be outdated pretty fast. (Dear moviemakers, never popculture reference fleeting media hypes.. just don't.) however...with that minor point out of the way, there is actually nothing left but praise. Hilarious? neh, not so much, but still a damn good time! The setup is simple: people play a game where someone is supposed to get kidnapped, then that happens, but the kidnap happens to be real.... so you wanna think!! And then come the tripple fake-pay off that it is fake after all - then it isn't - then it is again and then it isn't... or is it??? That point was maybe kind of lame but it didn't matter, because that was not the vocal point of the movie. The vocal point was how smart it was all put together - something you especially notice in the end credits! (my god.. the details!) And that is something this flick n.a.i.l.e.d!! 
The acting was very good and the person that did make me laugh the most was Rachel McAdams with her dryer-than-sahara humor, or her just reacting to things.
The rest of the cast is kinda ragtagged along but that's ok for this type of movie. You don't wanna look for deep-going character development, you just wanna have a good time. It's just a lighthearted, good, fun movie, nothing more, nothing less.",Game Night

363,MaxHuskins,Fun for Everyone!,7,20 March 2018,"Initially, I thought was going in for a generic action-filled comedy, just for a fun time, I didn't even think I'd bother writing a review of this movie but you might be surprised since my expectations were far surpassed! First of all the writing is pretty damn good, the plot makes sense and is filled with fun twists and turns, directions that you wouldn't expect. The characters were human and relatable. The dialogue felt natural, was witty, funny and realistic. Every single plot device and plot-line came back by the end of the movie in a form of a complete story. The mixture of types of humour in this flick are also great, very well timed punchlines, good physical comedy and funny use of editing. However, my ABSOLUTE favourite part of ""Game Night"" was the cinematography! The use of the camera is incredible, especially considering the genre and calibre of this picture. The camera is a character that is motivated and serves a purpose, tells a story and conveys emotions and feelings. There were so many shots throughout the film that I would fangirl about, trying to figure out how they were made, think to my self ""Oh shit, that's so cool."" They made the best use of their technology and it made sense without any gimmicks. Everything from Tilt&Shift shots of the city to make it look like toys, to cool drone shots of cars that felt like a ""Need for Speed"" game, to clever transitions in between scenes. I cannot wait for this movie to come out on BluRay so that I can sit down and do a breakdown of all the amazing camera work and editing. Completely blown away and fascinated! Another thing I really liked about this movie is its sound design and (for the most part) the soundtrack, with the exception of them using ""Don't Stop Me Now, by: Queen"" which fit the tone but is far too overused in movies every single year.Overall I really enjoyed my time with this one and would say you should grab all your friends and family, go watch this movie and afterwards grab a couple of drinks and have a game night.

In today's world, much of comedy is dependent on nasty sex jokes, gross visual gags, or juvenile bathroom humor with very little thought or mental application placed into the writing or story. I truly believe that this film is the absolute anti-thesis of this: while there are a few of the aforementioned sex jokes, they're delivered at a minimum and make sense in context. If you like to laugh, go see this. Even if you're not a comedy fan, go see this. I can guarantee you will laugh and walk out with a broad smile on your face.

398,bobbygarlandson,Great. Surprisingly.,9,23 August 2018,This one has to be the most surprising movie of the year. Best? Haha. Don't be stupid. Surprising. Why? Because I watched expecting a normal Hollywood comedy. You know exactly what I mean. What I got was:1: It is actually funny. Not original funny but it was funny. I laughed a lot. Especially whenever Jesse Plemons is on screen. He should have his own movie. Make a sequel and make him the main character. 2: The way it was filmed was very innovative. Lots of very cool shots. Very different for a Hollywood comedy. Almost like you are watching a expensive action film at times. I hope these guys get to make a 'proper' action movie. Come on Hollywood. Give them a chance. If not they can stick to making movies like this as they do it very well. 8/10.,Game Night

The car door used to change POV when it was opened and closed. The camera following the shaking of the vehicles outside of the car. The fuzzy foreground/background shots creating a look of a model shot even though it's real (gotta learn how to do that). The entire game of keep away with the egg was editing eye candy.",Game Night

Bateman plays the same character he always does and my guess is the only character he knows how to play- this dimwitted twerp that has some bright moments and although dumb as he may be, is still not the most stupid out of the whole cast. The movie is also a series of logical inconsistencies which can only exist because the writer/director are either too lazy or they know that the audience doesn't care. Well, I do. The only reason I give this movie 2 stars is because the creepy neighbor character- definitely the most interesting one throughout the entire movie.",Game Night

Jesse Plemons as the kinda scary policeman neighbor, Billy Magnussen, Kylie Bunbury, Lamorne Morris, and Sharon Horgan all do great as the Game Night guests.

However, I wasn't sure a film would be able to capture or sustain the essence of gaming couple-tension for a full movie. I was happily surprised. I just know I laughed too hard throughout the whole movie, and hope I wasn't too annoying for the other cinema patrons. That said, I'm pretty sure they were laughing hard too.

I have noticed this with increasing frequency, the ""f"" word sprinkled liberally throughout the script if only to demonstrate that the code allows it.

Then I started hearing positive hype around it so I tentatively checked it out and I gotta say, I got my money's worth and then some!This movie is downright hilarious at times, and when it's not making you laugh out loud it's making you chuckle throughout which makes for a fun ride all the way through. The cast all work well together with the standout being Rachel McAdams being the standout to me, like she is in most of her films. The running gag of that one guy trying to figure out which celebrity his wife slept with was consistently funny with the payoff being absolutely hysterical. It was also nice to see Michael C. Hall in it. I haven't seen him since ""Dexter"" wrapped and I always love seeing him. Super under appreciated talent in my opinion. The writing was clever and funny, the direction was surprisingly very good, especially for a comedy. Some scenes were shot and edited so well it kind of left my jaw hanging. As for negatives, the plot is a bit predictable at times. They try to give a big twist near the end with that weird cop played by Todd from ""Breaking Bad"" that I figured out pretty quickly. It also gets a bit over the top near the end, kind of like the first ""Ted"". It's nothing new or groundbreaking, it's just an enjoyable, well written and shot comedy that will make you laugh throughout. It knows what it is, succeeds in what it is, and celebrates what it is.

Filmmaker duo, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein (Vacation) team up again for a crime-comedy about frequent game night friends (Jason Bateman, Rachel McAdams, Kyle Chandler) who are entwined in a real-life mystery.Highlight!
The film contains a great amount of well-timed hints and jokes for those familiar with gaming culture humor as well as a partnership of characters for an entertainment of subplots to develop.Remarkable?
More than the expectations of competition and cooperation, is the subconscious question of what matters most, winning the game or simply the thrill of the game itself. Through exploits of the group and the pairing of couples, Game Night greatly sets the challenge of finding authenticity in one another.Here's to fighting with a unity of hands greater than chance or approach to the face of a card or to the roll of a die!

We are laugh so much and we all agree, this is one of the best comedy movie. No sex scenes, though the jokes refers some, but i'm glad they focus more on the game and characters involved in.

Max's brother Brooks is now back in town on business and decides to host a game night of his own. His idea of a fun game is one where actors are supposed to come in to kidnap one of the players and the rest have to follow clues to find them. However, the game turns out to be a little more real than everyone thought.This movie has non-stop laughs coming mostly from the sharp dialogue and the absurd situations that the main characters find themselves in as they race to solve the mystery. There are also many twists and turns that you don't see coming, making this a very fun ride that is best watched in a cinema full of people or with a group of friends. Each of the main characters has some great lines; however, the stand-outs would have to be Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams, both giving great comedic performances and making a very believable couple. Another stand-out is Jesse Plemons as the slightly creepy and recently divorced policeman who lives next door.

457,brotheryour,Terrible!!!!!!!!,1,23 February 2018,"I went into this film at the prescreening I attended expecting something truly great -- instead I got this piece of garbage! 
Let's begin with the main issue: the title is Game Night, the poster predominately features game pieces, and yet, there are very little games throughout the entire film. Instead, what do we get? A convoluted, implausible, kidnap comedy. While the plot is actually really smart, and the movie itself is hilarious -- funnier than any comedy I've seen in the last five years -- I cannot get past the film's misleading title. A title should give viewers a taste of what the film will be about -- it is supposed to define a film, encompass it under one clever phrase that is both creative and informative. Think of the film Finding Nemo. It tells viewers that this is a film about finding Nemo. What happens? They find Nemo. I'll give you another perfect example, and it's another Pixar movie -- Cars. What a great title. Short and sweet, clever and catchy, and perfectly describing what the film is about -- cars. Think back to last year's animated masterpiece, The Emoji Movie. This is the very pinnacle of title-making greatness. It's a movie, it's about emojis, so it's called The Emoji Movie. No prospective viewer will ever be confused as to the film's subject, nor will they be misled by the film itself. It's a film that is exactly what it promises to be in the title -- an emoji movie. 
Which brings me to the sad case of Game Night. It's not a confusing title -- in fact, it would be the perfect title for a movie about a game night, where a group of colorful characters huddle around a board, rolling die, spinning spinners, pulling cards, moving their avatars up and down the board, etc. But alas, that is not this film. This film is about a kidnapping, and that's what its title should have been -- Kidnapping or The Kidnap Movie or something. Then at least I would be prepared for those elements. Instead, we have a Hollywood trick -- tricking viewers into seeing a movie about a game night, only to fail to deliver on the title's promises. Shame on everyone involved in this picture. RATING: 0.5/10 (Half a star for being a great movie that is truly one of the best comedies of the decade -- nine and a half potential stars missed for the misleading title)",Game Night
458,JoshuaMooreBE,A Comedy Worth Watching,7,1 March 2018,"I was genuinely surprised by Game Night. While it is by no means anything spectacular, the film brings more to the table for the comedy genre during these days where really great directed comedies seem to be difficult to come by. This is easily John Francis's best-directed film yet, with a clear effort in making sure that this will be a comedy that can be not phrased or hailed, but remembered. This movie easily could've just been another ""Horrible Bosses"" or ""Why Him?"" but the direction and effort show that the John wanted more from it than that. The film was very good at keeping its tone consistent, and it's helped by all these really cool shots that make the real world look like a board game. Tracking shots are used consistently, long choreographed scenes that have one take are used consistently, and CGI is used very fluidly to improve how all these shots work.But as great as the cinematography and direction is, not all of the jokes in the films are bullseyes. While most of the film is genuinely funny, especially from Rachel McAdams character, the film really likes to use ""drag on"" jokes, jokes that are only funny to the people that are fans of ""The Office"" style of humor. As much as the dollar bill bit was killing my sides, any of these jokes that involved Jason Bateman, not so much. I enjoyed his performance but he is much better suited for the quick and witty kind of role. But how funny a movie is will always be up to an individual, and this individual thinks there were a lot funnier jokes than unfunny, so it was worth it to me.SPOILER TALK: I think some people might feel cheated if they watched the trailers, hoping that the film carries the joke that the characters believe its a game throughout the whole movie. This plot/joke is pretty much dropped before the halfway point. But it didn't bother me as I think the joke would've gotten stale after awhile. It's a very funny and clever way to set up the events to follow in the film. Now I wasn't the biggest fan of the double switcharoo at the end, but that's only because it was rather predictable.I recommend checking this out,. It's not amazing, but it's certainly one of the better comedies to come out in the last year or so, being carried by the all the artistic choices made in the direction.",Game Night

The story is contrived, the plot makes no sense, is riddled with logical errors. I know, it's a comedy, they're allowed creative freedom, but they're not bending anything for the sake of greater comedy. It's just a whole mess of talented people trying to make anything out of the lacking material.

It was almost as if the actors weren't even trying in some spots, I can't remember laughing at even one of the lame jokes.

Most of these movies are aired on a TV network at some point where they edit out a lot of this foul language, so don't hide behind the ""artistic license"" argument. That doesn't hold water with me. I watched this on Amazon Prime and I can choose ""closed captioned."" It would be REALLY SIMPLE to also add an option to choose a version of the movie approximating the TV edited version. The technology is there and this movie was wonderfully funny with a great cast and great storyline, but there is a sizable public out here that really doesn't like enduring a surprise ""F-bomb"" or God's name taken in vain.

I have not laughed this hard in a movie since I can remember. Everyone in the theater was cracking up at the ridiculous screenwriting and the scenarios the characters are put through.
Game Night centers around a group of friends who have a weekly game night and avoid including their creepy neighborhood cop. Until one night the protagonists brother ""Brooks"" shows up and offers them a different kind of Game Night; one with no board or cards. From there on the film stays unique but also creatively keeps the laughs coming.
The chemistry between the characters is believable and awkward.
Whats even more impressive about this hilarious effort is the soundtrack by Cliff Martinez who brilliantly sets the perfect synthesized tone throughout this gut buster.

483,pstevens-17076,Jason Bateman Shines,8,23 February 2018,"This hilarious gonzo comedy has a sharp script, clever direction, and an excellent cast. In Game Night, writer Mark Perez and directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein have crafted a tightly structured story with little visual tricks that turn out to be significant. That said, the movie really lives and dies by its cast, and this is a top-notch ensemble. Morris -- dependably funny on TV's New Girl -- gets laughs from his bubbling jealousy and dead-on Denzel Washington impersonation, clicking well with Bunbury. Horgan drily delivers as someone who's far too smart for her date; you'll likely wish there was more of her in the film. Magnussen is spectacularly idiotic as Ryan, which is a gift. Open-hearted blockheads are always welcome in comedies such as this, and Magnussen -- who's shown his dramatic chops in the likes of Birth of the Dragon -- hits it out of the park. Plemons' dead-eyed Gary generates big laughs by doing as little as possible. His stony ""I see you"" face and monotone delivery steal every scene he's in. (At one point, he happily invites the group into his house ... and, with a frozen smile, slowly backs into the darkness.)And as Max and Annie, Bateman and McAdams have great chemistry. Their timing together, their small reactions to each other; they really read as a couple who love each other, have a lot in common, and accept each other's quirks. Oh, and they're really funny. Bateman, as usual, is an effective straight man with subdued wit. McAdams gets to be a little wackier than usual and has some superb reaction moments. They're an appealing pair, and we're happy to follow them through this gleefully bloody comedy with a fair amount of twists and genuine laughs.",Game Night

None of them can be relatable, for something to be funny it has to be relatable and I cannot for the life of me believe that anyone over the age of 14 is going to find any of these ""adults"" relatable.

The plot plays out like so many films of its kind that are churned out of the hollywood machine: the central characters are dealing with problems in their personal life and are trying to sort them out while violence and crazy stuff goes on around them, a dumb clumsy but funny friend is thrown in for added laughs, it's all there.
I will say, I was pleasantly pleased by the extra twists and turns the film includes towards the end, some of which I genuinely wasn't expecting, but the overall story was just too predictable and 'seen it all before'.
The film is also helped by everyone's favorite charming loveable good guy Jason Bateman and the effortlessly likeable Rachel McAdams with a decent supporting cast (Sharon Horgan of Pulling and Catastrophe fame was criminally under-used, in my opinion).
In summation, this film suffers from to much predictability, stupid and unnecessarily outlandish action sequences which some viewers may enjoy, but which I find to be utterly useless. The comedy aspect doesn't seem to have been the writers' priority as the funniest moments are few and far between. Someone needed to punch up the humor and then maybe this could have been a decent action/comedy.",Game Night

The soundtrack is an effective retro synth style, and the cinematography works with it to create various effects that subtly reference different kinds of games, you'll know what I mean when you see it.

I guess I'm a cinephile, and I'm just as critical of movies that are trying real hard as the next fella. Im also usually very selective about what I will watch, but I was out-voted on this one so I watched it. I was pleasantly surprised. It made me realize too that I need to lighten up sometimes and just take a movie for the only thing it wants to be: a fun ride This movie isn't Felini. I don't even really like Felini, but you understand my meaning. There is no character study here, no biting social commentary and the only allusions in it are to other movies and cheap board games. It isn't Shawshank and it doesn't want to be. It's a ""romp"" I guess, and it's a perfectly good way to spend an hour and a half. These troglodyte reviewers here, slamming their narrow, bony graying fingers down feverishly to condemn a movie that fails to be what it never meant to be really need to lighten up, Francis. It's called ""Game Night"", guys. Bateman is good, as usual, if not quite as enthusiastic about this one as I've seen him, but maybe that's the role. Jessie Plemmons is fine, but his character needs a little more something or other-I dunno what. The rest of the characters are good, funny and the timing is excellentSo if a good belly laugh every few minutes is worth your total time spent on this film, I recommend the investment, which is something I needed to re-learn myself.",Game Night

There were some ideas used in the movie that had obviously been done before and done before very well, I.E. ""The man who knew too little"" or ""The Game"". But this movie didn't feel cheap and the acting was phenomenal. I'm 35 so the references that were thrown out were right up my alley. I liked how cerebral the movie was, I didn't feel like they went for very many if any cheep laughs, everything was well written and extremely gratifying. **Spoilers ahead** I would have rated this movie a 7 but the scene where Rachel Mcadams did Honey Bunny from pulp fiction, with what she thought was a fake gun almost made me choke on my cheez its. It was so damn funny. The movie is fast paced with a great all around story that centers around a group of friends Game night and batemens character's releationship with his brother.

As far as films go it's a brilliant length at 100 minutes and it's not over done, like most film drag out as long as possible but with this the plot keeps you going right until the end! This hilarious comedy will keep you on your toes and wanting more! Based off 'game night' when max's Brother Brooks wants to switch it up it all goes a bit gung-ho and uplanned to say the least!! With shooting,big bad guys, fake eggs and black market dealers this is definitely a film to watch if you have 100 minutes of time!

The trailer does give away most of the funniest parts but the movie is entertaining throughout. Some have called this a action/comedy hybrid but this was certainly intended to be a pure comedy.

560,RealGhostbuster,Better than I should have expected,7,18 May 2020,The comedic effect of this isn't as powerful as the trailer for it is. However it does manage to present most of the comedic gems from the trailer in a way that doesn't seem just like random scenes thrown in the midst of a boring as heck movie -- which I've seen happen more times than I should be allowed to remember. What keeps the movie from being boring is mostly the premise itself. It's basically a suspense film but also with some lighthearted drama interspersed. It's all done in a very tongue n cheek manner which allows for the humor to be more appreciated.,Game Night

Even without the comedy, you'd still have an interesting story with satisfying character development. Without the laughs, there are sequences that are well shot and could easily have been in an action movie. When you add in the humor, you get a unique combination of a movie that seamlessly blends comedy, action, and thriller in a way that, to me, never felt forced or out of place.",Game Night
573,mariz8_y,I WAS PLAYED.,3,7 May 2018,"The trailer is misleading. You'd think that the whole movie is about them thinking that they're on a game, which might have been a great chance for jokes, but they figure out right away that it's all real, and the movie shifted to a kidnap comedy except there is no comedy. Some points:
1. I love Rachel Mcadams. I love Jason Bateman. But to be honest casting them as bothers would've been better because they have zero chemistry at all. 
2. Pregnancy issue did not contribute to anything in the story except to add to the dialogue, to make the movie longer.
3. Infidelity jokes over and over is pointless
4. Characters are over the top. Stupid friend is way too stupid. the young woman she brought, way more stupid than him, and they show her always taking a selfie (in the middle of the game, of course). Weird police neighbor is too weird. (BUT excellent acting as always by Jesse). 
5. The long chase scene in the big house, where they pass the egg around, is frustratingly stupid. Just catch one of the gang, and then use that person to make the others surrender the egg. For them to be able to escape, in a house full of fighters, and heavily guarded (with a gate, I might add), is like a scene from a cartoon.
5. I miss Dexter. I've always wondered what he's been doing lately, this movie is a waste of his talent. 
5. Plot twist galore. it's like the writer thought ""hmm, I'll let the people think it will be like ""The Game"" but I'll add another plot twist so that they'll be pleasantly surprised in the end. Trust me, just watch ""The Game"".Lastly, and most importantly, I want to know how to earn money by writing good reviews. Obviously, there are paid ones here. If you are hiring, I can do way better reviews than more than half of the paid ones here. I'll make it more realistic, because seriously, 10 out of 10 is as obvious as a big neon sign that says I GOT PAID.",Game Night

To be upfront I some advanced session tickets from the Australian distributor, won in a competition. So we all saw it for free, but if I wanted to see a good comedy this one is worth paying to watch.The humour is good, nothing too highbrow but you won't find any crass humour here, just good fun throughout the film.The film does have its silly moments and the twists towards the end stretch believability, but you don't really care as you don't watch this film to critique, but just to enjoy the ride for a few hours.

A lot of comedies turn me off lately because they rely too much on adolescent humor that's gross or mainly sexual jokes. This movie got laughs the old fashioned way and felt like a smart Cary Grant / Katherine Hepburn comedy. It also made me think of the types of British comedies you see Simon Pegg in.There are a lot of reviewers who panned this quite harshly and when I read those reviews I feel like they were watching a different movie. I'd be interested to know how old these reviewers were - perhaps older people will enjoy this more than people in their 20s? (I'm in my mid-40s). Some complained about the acting - I think everyone was spot on. Some complained the plot was predictable - I actually found myself surprised at several turns the plot took and found it quite funny when the audience was clued into new information that the characters hadn't figured out yet.Rachel mcAdams had great chemistry with Jason Bateman and the supporting cast were each terrific. The characters were well drawn and funny, and the side plots were all engaging and humorous.

618,fhassemer,Better than expected; surprising turns,8,21 April 2018,"There are lots of things to write about that movie. Let's start with the cast. In my opinion, the cast worked very good together. I, personally, could not imagine Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams together that good, but they embody their roles really well. The other couples and roles worked really good together, too! Only the scenes with the creepy neighbour, who is not invited for the game nights anymore, are created a bit too strange, uncomfortably and obvious.
The story itself was quite round, but had quite a lot of unexpected turns. Do not get me wrong, in the beginning, I was very happy about not knowing the exact solution of the story. But then, there was a point, when it just came a bit too much. To many surprising turns, too many gags.
And of course, I am very happy there was a happy ending.To sum it up: 
An unexpected unusual, a little excessive Hollywood comedy, including a very huge quantity of jokes/gags and turns, a great cast and a competent director, who did a good job in cutting, directing and building a nearly never ending tension.",Game Night

Exactly, put enough effort into understanding the complexity and realise it's brilliant.",Game Night

623,o_connornancy,Get the Word-of-Mouth going!,8,11 March 2018,"I couldn't talk anybody into seeing this with me, so I went by myself! Had read some good reviews, and with Bateman and McAdams I didn't see how it could be bad... It's really VERY funny, in a smart, adult way (by and large!) the cast is phenomenal, the interactions and repartee between characters are so natural you feel they've known each other forever. The plot starts out fairly predictably, but then the twists begin, and pretty soon it's preposterous, but by that time you don't care. There are so many quick funny bits I could see it again, just to be sure I caught all of them. See it, then talk it up if you liked it, as I think and hope you will!",Game Night
624,james-23415,Very Enjoyable Movie,8,16 March 2018,The wife and I went to see this movie a couple of days ago. We both enjoyed it very much. It does start out a little bit on the slow side. Not really that funny and somewhat drags on at first but it does pick up speed about a third of the way through the movie. Then the laughs begin and does not stop till the end of the movie. Rachel McAdams was great. Really enjoyed her in this movie. Overall just a real funny and enjoyable movie.,Game Night
625,antooprey,Awful Awful Awful,1,14 March 2018,"What a waste of 100 minutes. Probably the worst film I have seen in ages, with humour so dark I could'nt see it. If I had been the editor this movie would have been cut to about 3 minutes with most of it left on the floor. Jokes were obvious and adolesent; plot obvious and boring. To those who enjoyed this, I recommend intensive therapy.",Game Night
626,skatehard,Very Funny,8,25 March 2018,"There haven't been many good comedies that made me laugh consistently through the film in the past 10 years, but finally they broke through. This is a good comedy. Lots of laughs throughout and it covers both snappy dialogue humor as well as slap stick humor. This is definitely one of the best comedies I've seen in many years. Was it worth the price of admission? I lean towards yes. It's not a must see at the theater. You will get equal enjoyment I think from watching at the theater or at home, but it is definitely worth a viewing. Crass at times but overall funny and not too over the top.",Game Night
627,gurrattank,OMG!!!!!!! Hate Comedies but LOVED DIS ONE,10,4 April 2018,"I am Sheldon Cooper for comedies and we went to see some other movie initially but that theater was down so my friends suggested this one. I didnt resent but i absolutely hated the idea.But OMG OMG OMG!!!!! It is so much fun. Lots of non stop entertainment. You dont realize where those 2 hours go by.I am saying this from the entertainment point of view. It was a fast paced breadth of fresh air and non stop laughter. I cannot believe i actually understood most of the jokes. I would recommend it to all those who want to just go and enjoy the movie experience and have fun. I loved it.Don't know how critics act because one of my buddies who absolutely analyzes every angle of movies to review and give ratings gave it a 7/10. So, 10/10 from entertainment aspect. If you wanna go crazy laughing with your buddies, please go watch this. BTW, Rachel McAdams looks absolutely stunning.",Game Night
