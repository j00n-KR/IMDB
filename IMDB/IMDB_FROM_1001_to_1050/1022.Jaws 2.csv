0,TheLittleSongbird,"Acceptable sequel, but lacks the qualities that the original had",6,5 April 2011,"I will say this, Jaws 2 is much better than the abomination that is Jaws:The Revenge, but at the same time it lacks the qualities the original did have. The original film is a masterpiece and one of Steven Spielberg's best movies. Not only was it brilliantly directed and wonderfully scored, but it was genuinely atmospheric too. In fact, Jaws was the film that made me afraid to go into the sea.What let Jaws 2 down pacifically was the narrative and story, too predictable and sedate for my tastes. The dialogue also lacks polish, with some of the more tense moments not quite coming across as believable and the more humorous moments feel forced. The direction is lacking in tension too, which is disappointing considering that was one of the main reasons why the original worked so brilliantly, while the film is not as efficient pacing-wise with one or two scenes feeling rather overlong.However, the production values are far from cheap, in fact with the crisp enough cinematography and editing and authentic locations it is quite striking. John Williams' score is still as thrilling as ever, another component that made the original so genuinely atmospheric, the shark attacks are well done with enough suspense (though it could have perhaps been a little more) and the shark is adequately menacing. The acting is fairly good, all the characters are likable enough, and the actors seem to be having fun in alternative to looking and sounding bored.All in all, acceptable while lacking. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Jaws 2
1,Leofwine_draca,Worthwhile follow-up,7,8 August 2016,"While not as impressive as Spielberg's classic shocker, this sequel still packs a punch and comes across as a solid example of a horror/thriller hybrid. There are no really stand-out memorable scenes as in the first film (the whole last hour on the boat was brilliant, actually), and there's also nowhere near the same kind of tension build-up, but for a monster movie this does fine: there's plenty of characterisation to build realistic characters; fine photography brings the beaches and ocean to life and give the film exactly the same kind of sun-bleached look as the first; and the film's central character, as played by Roy Scheider, is simply excellent.This time around, Scheider's character is obviously more ""seen it all before"" and world-weary. Nobody believes him about the shark until it's too late, either, thanks to a well-executed false alarm on a crowded beach where he goes mad and shoots at a shoal of fish in the water. Scheider's skilled acting is what makes this film worthwhile and is where most of the interest lays; his multi-layered hero is given a heart, a fact which makes us care for his safety and well being. The supporting cast are also pretty good, with some actors reprising their roles (Gary, Hamilton), and other newcomers doing pretty good. My only regret is that some of the teen screamers go a bit over the top, where silence might have had a better effect they're keen to scream at the top of their lungs.While the shark was kept hidden for most of JAWS, here the rubber model pops up frequently as a reminder. A jump scare in which a mangled, burnt body washes up on the beach to give Scheider a shock is a scene which equals the exceptional ""head floating out of the boat"" moment in the first film. From there, the shark is given free rein to attack just about anything, from a helicopter (hilarious moment) to boatloads of partying teens (and can we really blame it?).While not as epic as the one in the first - how could it be? - this film's ending is still pretty good and sees Scheider once again going one-on-one with the beast. The shark's death is a fitting ending for both the monster and the film. The law of diminishing returns meant that the two further sequels got progressively worse and more cheesy, but JAWS 2 is still a respectable, well-made film which is well worth a watch for monster fans, and provides a worthwhile sequel for the first film.",Jaws 2
2,SnoopyStyle,Only Scheider and Hamilton left,6,11 March 2014,"Years after the first shark attack, police chief Brody (Roy Scheider) is investigating a supposed accident off the shores of Amity Island. When a killer whale is found on the beach, Brody is sure another shark is hunting off the coast. However mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) is once again unconvinced. He's more worried about putting the shark attack behind them and luring new business onto the island. Brody spends the day scanning the waters from the beach tower. He mistakes a school of bluefish for a shark causing a panic. When he presents a photo of a shark's eye that one of the dead scuba divers took, nobody would believe him. Discouraged, he is about to quit when a shark attack is confirmed. His kid and a bunch of other teens are stranded by the attacking shark on a rocky island.The film is trying to marry Jaws with a teen slasher movie. The return of Scheider and Hamilton helps with the old formulaic adult story. The problem is that there isn't a compelling teen in the movie. All the young characters are generic and unimpressive. There is nothing surprising or new. We are left barely holding on to the side of the boat.",Jaws 2
3,Hitchcoc,What a Waste of Time!,3,23 December 2016,"""Jaws"" was one of the most frightening pieces of cinema ever created. It is a combination of sight, sound, and terror. It has some truly epic scenes and some absolutely memorable lines. So the producers have the gall to create a sequel that is about as bad as a movie can be. Everything that was startling and exciting in the original is lost here. There are people getting themselves into ridiculous situations because of their base stupidity. We have a helicopter attacked by a shark. If I had my way, a real great white shark should have shown up, eaten the cast, munched on the director and producer, and ended the movie with a huge burp. No script. No believable plot. No nothing.",Jaws 2
4,Sleepin_Dragon,This second Shark packs a punch.,8,23 January 2018,"If I were to make an appropriate comparison, Jaws 1 was a White shark bite, ferocious and huge, Jaws II would be a bite from a Blue Shark, still nasty, but lacking the ferocity. The film reminds me of the Halloween follow up in so many ways, the first being a moment of cinema where the game was changed, a massive act to follow, both feel like a direct continuation of the first, both have quality, but lack the originality and impact of their predecessor.Jaws II is slow to start, but as it gets going it really cranks up the tension, featuring some really good, tense moments. The shark has become a psycho killer instead of just a predator, and is now intent on killing its victims in the way Michael Myers did.Some good strong special effects, I thought in several scenes the shark looked very realistic, I've never been a fan of the ending though, it's just a bit silly. Roy Schneider clearly did not want to do this film, and I think it shows in his performance, he is not happy.It's a pretty good sequel, trouble is the original is a classic.",Jaws 2
5,gavin6942,Another Bruce?,6,15 October 2016,"Police chief Brody (Roy Scheider) must protect the citizens of Amity after a second monstrous shark begins terrorizing the waters.In October 1975, Steven Spielberg told the San Francisco Film Festival that ""making a sequel to anything is just a cheap carny trick"" and that he did not even respond to the producers when they asked him to direct ""Jaws 2"". He may be right, but sequels have their place, and this one does a fair job of capturing the spirit of the first film... much more than the future sequels.Of course, it remains a sequel and not near as iconic as the original. But that should hardly be a surprise. You can only have one ""Jaws"", really. But the continuing adventures of the Brody family are worth exploring, whether they have the same level of intensity or not.",Jaws 2
6,jboothmillard,Jaws 2,3,7 August 2007,"With the worldwide success of the blockbuster adventure thriller from director Steven Spielberg, a sequel was pretty inevitable. Three years since the previous film, the music might still be composed by John Williams, and Roy Scheider does return as Police Chief Martin Brody, but this film is just ridiculous. The island resort town of Amity is trying to get back to normal since the previous incidents, but there is evidence that leads Brody to believe that another huge shark is terrorising the town, which there is. It is the same story with Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) not learning anything since the last time, and only Brody's wife Ellen (Lorraine Gary) is comforting him. Brody does lose his job, but he still heads out to sea to save a gang of teens on a boat, and his son who he finds out is with them. The first film saw the shark blown up in an eruption of blood, this time he is electrocuted and cooked by biting a large cable. Also starring Joseph Mascolo as Len Peterson and Mark Gruner as Michael 'Mike' Brody. Sheider does add a few moments of okay chat, but that is just the biggest problem with this sequel, too much chat and decisions and not enough shark action, and when there is you can tell they haven't got a real one. I have only given it two extra points for the last 20-30 minutes of the film, the rest is just pointless. Adequate!",Jaws 2
7,ccthemovieman-1,"Slow To Get Started, But Then Has Some Bite",6,13 December 2007,"No, this wasn't as good as the original, but it wasn't bad, either. In fairness, the audiences knew what to expect in this one and had already been shocked by the killer Great White Shark. Thus, it was no way audiences were going to react to the sequel as they did the first Jaws movie.It didn't have Steven Spielberg directing, but it did have the same locale with same principal characters on ""Amity:"" mainly Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), his wife Ellen (Lorraine Gary) and Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) so one didn't feel as if this was a completely new film. There was continuity to it, and we have the same problem (a big shark eating people). The main difference is that it is just a few years after the first horrifying incidents.This story mainly involves Chief Brody's teenage kids and their friends. Overall, the film moves a little slowly the first hour, but picks up dramatically in the second half. In fact, it turns out quite intense, just like the first film. The main mistake the filmmakers made - which they wouldn't do today, was that it was too slow for too long. That, and the fact that the area residents apparently had a short memory; unrealistically short.Anyway, the shark looks more realistic.....and if you can hang in there, you'll be rewarded with some good escapist entertainment in the second hour.",Jaws 2
8,Tweekums,A solid sequel to a great original,7,17 May 2019,"Four years on from the events of 'Jaws' the population of Amity Island have got on with their lives; the tourists have returned and they don't want to think about sharks. Then a couple of divers go missing and two women are killed in a 'boating accident'; Chief Brody is in charge of the investigation and after the body of a killer whale, complete with bite marks, washes up he is convinced that there is another great white shark in the waters round the island but the town council doesn't believe his claims. Then a group of youngsters, including Brody's sons, go out sailing... inevitably they have a run in with the shark and Chief Brody will have to take to the water again to try to save them.Not surprisingly this isn't as good as the original film; that would have been very difficult. It is however pretty good. There are plenty of scary moments, certainly more than I expected in a UK-PG rated film. It starts well with the divers being killed as they explore the wreck of the Orca, the boat from the first film, and follows that up with an impressive explosion. We then get the chief's fears not being believed which did feel like a bit of a rerun of what happened in the first film. Things get better again when the youngsters sail into danger; the shark may be shown a bit too much and it looks no more realistic than that in 'Jaws' but the young actors do look genuinely terrified which helps make it acceptable. The cast is decent enough although Roy Scheider stands out with his fine performance as Chief Brody. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the original.",Jaws 2
9,ma-cortes,Acceptable sequel based on the characters created by novelist Peter Benchley,6,6 February 2010,"Bone-chilling movie with scary scenes , nice direction and contains similar plot , (screen-written by Carl Gottlieb) , to first entry directed by Steven Spielberg . The film is developed in New England in a shore community named Amity where previously the townsfolk were terrorized by a giant shark that attacked to pacific tourists at the local beach . Police chief Brody (Roy Scheider) , happily married (Lorraine Gary) tries to convince to local authorities (the Mayor again as Murray Hamilton) who reluctant listening him to empty the resort place , but he's dismissed and they think he's nutty . But the large shark attacks and the victims are eaten and making a real carnage and those serving for lunch . Some adolescents (Keith Gordon , Donna Wilkes, Mark Gruner among others) are sailing on their sporting boat s, when the giant shark threaten them. Then , the policeman, the deputy (Jeffrey Kramer) determine to track down and kill it. The sheriff Brody is forced to fight for their lives in a mortal confrontation.It's a passable following with a correct creation of tension , thrills , terror and brief gore. The shark attacks images deliver emotion , united to a thrilling score by master John Williams (though he copies the original soundtrack prized with an Oscar) who heightens the suspense . It packs luxurious and atmospheric cinematography by Robert Butler .The original picture considered a real classic won three well deserved Academy Awards , this one is quite inferior but results to be professionally directed by Jeannot Swarc . During the pre-production, production designer Joe Alves recommended Jeannot for the film-making's position because of the collaborative work they did together on 'Rod Serling's Night Gallery . Followed by other two much worst sequels , they were respectively directed by Joe Alves (Production designer of the original) titled ¨Jaws 3D¨ with Louis Gossett Jr , Dennis Quaid , Bess Armstrong and ¨Jaws : The revenge¨directed by Joseph Sargent with Michael Caine, Lorraine Gary, Lance Guest and Mario Van Pebbles . Rating : Average, but indispensable watching for the ¨Jaws¨ series fans , as you will have on the edge of your seat.",Jaws 2
10,BA_Harrison,A sequel with bite.,8,22 September 2011,"Water skiers, divers, parascenders, sailors and swimmers: the coast of Amity Island is like an all you can eat buffet to a Great White Shark. Only three years after destroying Bruce, the man-eater who came to sample the island's local delicacies in Spielberg's summer blockbuster of '75, Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) finds himself facing another toothy terror with an equally voracious appetite.Although there's very little in the way of originality in Jaws 2, the film being little more than a mechanical rehash of elements from the first film (Brody screams 'shark'; nobody believes him; Brody hunts shark), this sequel from director Jeannot Szwarc still has enough bite to make it a fun flick (and it's a bloody masterpiece compared with the sequels that followed!).Admittedly, Szwarc is no Spielberg, and his handling of the film's scenes of domestic drama is less than scintillating, but he rises to the challenge when required to deliver suspense and action, with plenty of well crafted and shocking shark attacks guaranteed to have the audience jumping out of their seats in fear (which I imagine was the top priority for studio execs—nothing pulls in the crowds like teens being chomped).7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.N.B.— Horror/exploitation fans... keep an eye out for early appearances from Keith Gordon (Dressed to Kill, Christine) and yummy Donna Wilkes (the teenage high-school hooker in Angel).",Jaws 2
11,moonspinner55,More shark + more Lorraine Gary = less thrills,3,6 April 2003,"I wasn't a big fan of the shark killings in the first movie (Steven Spielberg showed off quite a morbid side of himself, and a perverse delight in bloody carnage), and this sequel, with empty spots left by Robert Shaw and AWOL Richard Dreyfuss, is filled with shark attacks. Still, the overblown B-flick is less unpleasant than the first film simply because it's such a cartoon. An early shark attack on a water-skier is so ridiculous it's embarrassing. Poor Roy Scheider, tanned to the point of being mistaken for a Mexican cliff-diver, is lean and alert throughout as Chief Brody, but the script offers him empty heroics and nothing more. Screaming teens take up much of the running time. But nobody was fooled; the picture made money but the lack of a star-director or solid supporting cast left everyone languishing in drive-in hell. *1/2 from ****",Jaws 2
12,BandSAboutMovies,The movie they didn't make,5,16 July 2021,"Jaws 2 wasn't going to make anyone happy.How do you recapture the magic of a film that took so many by surprise, even if it was calculated to do exactly what it set out to accomplish? Then again, until Rocky II came out, this was the most successful sequel in history.Producers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown realized that if they didn't make this movie, someone else would. You know who wouldn't be coming along? Director Steven Spielberg, who referred to sequels as ""carny tricks"" and had such a bad time making the original that there was no way he was getting back on the boat.John D. Hancock, who wrote and directed Let's Scare Jessica to Death, was the pick to make it instead but after execs saw the dark movie he was making, they let him go. Of course, the fact that he didn't want Universal President Sidney Sheinberg's wife Lorraine Gary (Ellen Brody) to be on the boat rescuing people may have had something to do with his firing.There's also the matter of what his version of the movie was going to be about. Taking the idea that the town of Amity was in debt to organized crime, the film would open with a boarded-up ghost town with no tourist economy - and the mob coming to collect - being saved by a new resort being built on the island before a second shark appears.Strangely enough, this is when Spielberg considered returning, planning a movie based on to direct Quint's Indianapolis speech. However, the sequel would have to wait a year until he could make Close Encounters of the Third Kind.Production designer Joe Alves and Verna Fields proposed co-directing the film, but the Directors Guild of America objected to one of their members being replaced by a crew member who was not in their union. Jeannot Szwarc, who made Bug and eventually Santa Claus: The Movie and Supergirl, came in.You know who wasn't all that happy at this point? Roy Scheider.The actor had quit The Deer Hunter two weeks into production due to creative differences, so Universal offered to just let him out of his three-movie contract if he made Jaws 2. He claimed that there was nothing new to do in the movie. He went so far as to act mentally deranged so they would fire him, but his new deal made him 400% more than the first movie and got a percentage of the film's net profit.However, he pretty much got along with Szwarc like a human and a shark. He felt that the director ignored the principal actors and was wasted time with extras and technical shots. In a mediation meeting, talks devolved into physical violence and then letters were exchanged.You have to love that the very day a new hotel opens on Amity Island, a new great white shows up and starts killing divers and water skiers before surviving a boat explosion to murder even more people and a killer whale. Take that, Orca!Police Chief Brody knows it's a shark. He tells Mayor Larry Vaughn again and you'd think Larry would learn by now, but he claims there's no way a second shark could come to Amity. And you'd think that Brody's son Mike would know by now that sharks are out to kill you and all of your teenage friends, but if people weren't stupid, we wouldn't have a movie.",Jaws 2
13,Coventry,"""You're gonna need a better screenplay""",4,23 October 2005,"Ha! Anyone get my semi-clever review-title joke/reference towards the famous quote of the original ""Jaws""? No, okay...onwards with the review then. A couple of summers have passed and the little island town of Amity suffers from an increasing amounts of mysterious deaths again. Tourists and divers go missing, half eaten corpses of humans and even orcas wash ashore, etc... You would expect that chief of police Martin Brody has a lot less difficulties convincing the townspeople for the potential danger of another great white shark, but no... Everyone in Amity seems to suffer from amnesia, the mayor is still corrupt and greedy and even Brody's own children carelessly continue to sail in the open sea like there's nothing wrong. Simply because nobody believes Brody, the first half of the screenplay is just a repeating of Spielberg's original and therefore very dull and unbelievable. When everyone eventually acknowledges the shark-problem, the film doesn't really get more exciting, since the over-sized shark goes after a group of screaming youngsters that you don't really care for to begin with. Even though the budget for this first sequel has clearly gone up enormously, the hi-tech special effects and underwater-cinematography looks less convincing. Every small success-element that made the original the first big summer blockbuster ever is shamelessly re-used here, like John William's score and shrieking girls in colorful bikinis. Roy Sheider clearly knows that he's stuck in an inferior and repetitive role, but he's a professional actor so his performance is still very adequate. All the other acting performances are bleak. With yet another two dire sequels in the 80's , ""Jaws"" is one of the most overrated franchises in cinema history.",Jaws 2

15,hitchcockthelegend,Something fishy going on here!.,5,4 September 2008,"Police Chief Brody, four years after ridding the Amity waters of a Great White Shark, finds there may just be another on the loose. Once again he finds opposition from the townsfolk, once again he hopes he isn't proved right, once again............Tho this, and all the subsequent sequels, were not called for, and outside of cash cow greedy executives, wanted, this could have been far worse. Using the same formula as Steven Spielberg's monstrously successful original from 1975, the makers here have achieved a level of B movie entertainment, but it only just about keeps its head above water {hrr hrr hrr}. Having both Roy Scheider and Lorraine Gary return from the first picture puts a bit of gravitas into the proceedings, but come the final third of the picture, all sense of credit has given way to a teens in peril slasher formula. It's here that we realise that the man against beast heart of the original Jaws is sadly missing, we of course will be with Brody all the way, and little boo jump sequences are handled adequately, but after having no worthwhile story to care for, we now simply expect the obvious, and sadly after getting it, it feels rather flat. 5/10",Jaws 2
16,Theo Robertson,Like Most Sequels It's Not Very Good,4,3 November 2004,"!!!! MILS SPOILERS !!!!If this was made today I would have jumped to the conclusion that this was a recruiting film for Al Qaeda . Seriously I would have , how on earth can an audience empathise with what must be the most unsympathetic characters in cinerama - American teenagers ? Not just any American teenagers , ones who have been spoiled rotten by their parents , drink even though they appear under age and have lots of sex . Are we supposed to relate to them as they sail around the Atlantic Ocean ? It's also a fact that people who go sailing around in boats are very stuck up so right away I was hoping they were all on the shark menu . I was bitterly disappointed that some of them survived to the end credits and let's not forget that one of the victims who weren't part of the brat pack ( Captain Birdseye helicopter pilot and Mrs Napalm Lady in the boat ) deserved to die because they were hopeless actors . I get the feeling that empathising more with the shark rather than its victims wasn't part of the game plan It's not just this that spoiled the film . It's also badly paced with Sheriff Brody wandering around the beach making sure no one is going to be gobbled up by the shark which is something we saw in the first movie so there's little plot advancement or character development . There's also a lapse of logic to all this since despite several people being killed by a shark in the previous movie no one is willing to believe a shark has returned to the waters . There's a motivation for this scepticism from some of the characters ( Money - Just like in the first movie , or any Peter Benchley novel ) but other characters would have no motivation for wanting to disbelieve Brody especially when all the evidence is staring them in the face There's another thing I found lacking and that's the lack of character conflict in the script . In the original much of the movie is carried by Robert Shaw's character disliking Richard Dreyfuss's character along with Sheriff Brody . Here there's little character interaction because most of the characters are screaming teenagers who are on the verge of dying at the jaws of a great white shark , and I so much hoped the shark was going to be the sole survivor at the end",Jaws 2
17,Hey_Sweden,"""Sharks don't take things personally, Mr. Brody.""",7,17 July 2013,"The sequel with one of the most mocked and spoofed taglines of all time, ""Jaws 2"" naturally is no classic compared to the terrific original. But it's still pretty well done, if slow to get started, and emerges as a pretty good sequel. One does indeed miss Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss quite a bit, but Police Chief Brody's (Roy Scheider) story is compelling in its own right, as his demons threaten to get the better of him. The large assortment of new characters isn't terribly interesting, but Scheider is a treat to watch as he reprises the role of Brody. The shark scenes do prove to be worth waiting for.The story (the movie is scripted by Carl Gottlieb, co-writer of the first film, and Howard Sackler) is easy enough to predict: another rogue killer great white stakes a claim in the waters off of Amity Island. Brody suspects the worst early on, but of course nobody will believe him, not the mayor (Murray Hamilton) nor the new bigwig in town, Len Peterson (Joseph Mascolo). Ultimately it's entirely up to Brody to save the day as the shark, terrorizing some and gobbling up others, sets its sights on a gang of teenagers out day sailing.While we wait for the action to really take off, the movie centres around Brody and his futile attempts to warn people of the danger and the toll that it takes on him. One can't help but sympathize with this guy, especially since we know he's right.The shark effects are basically comparable to those in the first film, no better and no worse. Bruce mark 2 never gets around to actually eating very many people, but he does figure in some absolutely priceless moments: one involving a ski boat driver, and the other involving a helicopter.Lorraine Gary is appealing as before, once again playing Ellen Brody, and Jeffrey Kramer also returns as Deputy Hendricks. New cast members include lovely Ann Dusenberry, Donna Wilkes (""Angel""), Gary Springer (""Dog Day Afternoon""), and actor turned director Keith Gordon (""Christine"") as some of the kids.Director Jeannot Szwarc (""Bug""), brought in to replace John Hancock (""Let's Scare Jessica to Death""), may not be as masterful as Spielberg but he's no slouch either, and he's assisted by such talents as composer John Williams, editor Neil Travis, production designer Joe Alves, and cinematographer Michael Butler.All in all, a good if not great movie with some good action and suspense - not to mention a hell of a conclusion.Seven out of 10.",Jaws 2
18,Doylenf,The thrill is gone...a mechanical sequel...,5,9 October 2006,"As good an actor as he is, ROY SCHEIDER cannot reprise his role in the first JAWS and be half as effective if the script and director are not up to the challenge of producing a first rate sequel. Putting Scheider through the same paces again in Amityville, with the John Williams music looming over the soundtrack whenever appropriate, is not enough. There are no new elements to the story of shark attacks--and, in fact, it all seems just as mechanical as the shark itself that is shown once too often.Some of the shark scenes are effective, particularly the opening scene with the divers and the one with the girl on water skis, but the moment the film hits dry land the story hits rock bottom and drags on and on until the next incident. The presence of a few familiar faces doesn't really help. Missing are Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw and the gripping story that made the first movie so terrific. As a replacement, we have some annoying teen-agers who've been warned not to go sailing just yet, one of whom is Scheider's son.As sequels go, this is barely fair...but the fright factor is not strong enough this time to prevent you from going into the water again.",Jaws 2
19,preppy-3,Stupid sequel,5,12 May 2007,"Another shark attacks Amity (the same place attacked in the first film). Sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) again has trouble convincing Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) that a shark is attacking. Right away this movie throws reality out the window--Vaughn was convinced at the end of the first movie--why is he so ready to disbelieve him now? This movie ends with a bunch of annoying teenagers adrift in the water with the shark ready to attack.This movie concentrates more on the Brody's home life and their kids. None of it is terribly interesting but it's better than the scenes dealing with these utterly boring teenagers. Those kids don't talk like any teenagers I knew (and I was a teenager when I first saw this). Basically this movie has a terrible script which nobody can make work. Also it's too long and pretty dull--I had my finger on the fast forward button a lot during the last hour. No real fireworks happen till the kids are attacked during the last half hour. Also look for the scene where the shark opens his mouth and you can plainly see the machinery operating him inside! I seriously gave up on this when the shark knew enough to drag a helicopter down(!!!) that was there to save the kids!There are a few things (very few) to recommend this. It is well directed by Jeannot Szwarc--particularly when you consider he was chosen to replace the original director at the last minute. Scheider didn't want to do this movie--he was forced into it--but he was professional enough to still give out a good performance. Lorraine Gary is back as his wife Ellen and she's good also. Hamilton is very good especially considering his character does a complete turn around from the first movie! The shark attacks are well done and pretty scary--especially when Tina and Eddie are attacked. Still, all of this doesn't help a film that's far too long and has a terrible script. This can be wisely skipped.",Jaws 2
20,LeonLouisRicci,The Amity Horror Returns and Causes Teens to Scream A lot,5,4 February 2016,"The Budget for this Movie was Three Times that of the Original. But it's Not Even a Third as Good. The Movie has no Heart or Soul, just a Lot of Teens Posing for the Camera and Screaming, then Posing and Screaming Some More.In Fact, anytime the Shark is Not On Screen the Movie is Dismal, Slowly Paced, and Boring. Roy Scheider Reluctantly Reprises His Role to fulfill a contractual Obligation and it shows. He Feuded constantly on the Set with the somewhat Inexperienced Director, especially on a Big-Budget, and Roy Scheider stated that He was Fawning over the Kids all the time to the Dereliction of the Entire Production.The Shark Attacks are OK and it's Not the Worst Sequel of All Time. But it is Big, Bloated, and Empty. Some of the Shark behavior has been Criticized as being Ridiculous, but that could be Said of the Original.Overall, full of Pointless Scenes and with a Lack of Style. It Looks like it was made by Amateurs and all that Money was mostly Wasted.

21,poolandrews,"""I have had experience with sharks."" More of the same but still enjoyable.",7,24 October 2005,"Jaws 2 starts with two divers exploring the underwater wreck of a boat named the 'Orca', a name that will be familiar with those who have seen the original Jaws (1975). Suddenly they are attacked & presumably eaten by a huge 20 foot long Great White Shark. Just as the small coastal community of Amity is returning to normal after being terrorised by a Great White some years previous, the unfortunate divers abandoned boat comes to the attention of Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) & his Deputy Jeff Hendricks (Jeffrey Kramer) who discovers a camera on the ocean floor nearby the deserted boat. Strangely a boating accident occurs where Terri (Christine Freeman) a water skier & her friend Diane (Jean Coulter) are killed when their boat mysteriously blows up & two local teenagers Tina (Ann Dusenberry) & Eddie (Gary Dubin) discover a mutilated Killer Whale washed up on a beach which Brody thinks was killed & mauled by a Great White Shark, a theory seemingly confirmed when local marine biologist Dr. Laureen Elkins (Collin Wilcox Paxton) agrees with him. Can Chief Brody convince Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) that another Great White intends to eat it's way through the residents of Amity?Directed by Jeannot Szwarc after the original director John D. Hancock was fired Jaws 2 had a lot to live up to after the huge critical & commercial success of Spielberg's brilliant original, personally I think it's a pretty good film & I think it had an almost impossible task in following & trying to live up to or even better the original. The script by Carl Gottlieb & Howard Sackler is a little slow at times but just about managed to keep me interested & entertained for it's near 2 hour hour duration. When all said & done Jaws 2 is pretty much exactly the same as the original, many of the ideas & themes are brought up again & reused. But as I say it's still all quite enjoyable & there isn't much else you can do with the basic premise without it becoming totally ridiculous & for proof I point you in the general direction of the absolute disaster that is Jaws: The Revenge (1987)! The character's are well fleshed out & are likable enough, even the teenagers which is unusual in a film. I wish the shark had eaten a few more people on screen & the gore content is distinctly lacking compared to the original although there is a chewed up Killer Whale, a burnt corpse & a bit of blood. The attack scenes work well & director Szwarc manages to create some tension but he ain't no Spielberg that's for sure. With a budget around the $20,000,000 mark Jaws 2 is a very well made film with nice widescreen cinematography that captures the sea & landscapes, that fantastic Jaws theme from John Williams is back & the special effects are OK but the shark still looks a bit rubbery & fake. The acting is good throughout & Scheider puts another fine performance in. While not as good as Jaws, Jaws 2 is still a great film in it's own right & well worth watching & better than either of the subsequent sequels Jaws 3-D (1983) & the awful Jaws: The Revenge the least said about which the better!",Jaws 2
22,utgard14,Shameless Cash Grab But Still Watchable,6,6 May 2014,"First sequel to the Spielberg classic doesn't have that film's artistry or, well, much of anything that made it so great. But, as far as popcorn movies about killer sharks go, this one's enjoyable. Obviously it's missing Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss, but there's still Roy Scheider and several returning supporting actors. As a lot of sequels tend to do, it tries to repeat the basic plot of the first movie. Once again a great white shark is terrorizing the island of Amity and it's up to Chief of Police Martin Brody (Scheider) to stop it.Did a sequel need to be made? Of course not. But it was made and they did about as well as could be expected following such a terrific film. It's surprising that the movie turned out as well as it did considering the troubled production. I won't go into detail about it here but you should read up on it. It's a miracle they turned out anything better than a turkey.

For instance imaging it wouldn't have Roy Scheider and all the other characters and actors from the original in it. A big plus is that it also have the special comedy elements in it that the original also had, without it it would have been a terribly boring movie to watch. Another thing that makes the movie worth watching is the fact that John Williams did the musical score again.However the idea of letting the movie evolve around a group of teenagers on boats was a very very bad idea and made this movie just an average B-monster movie. The story also lacks the tension and the scary moments that the original all had and some of the dialog is just laughable.Still the movie isn't that bad, somehow it knows to manage to create the same special atmosphere that the original had. However it just misses the great main characters of the original as Quint and Hooper, instead now we've got Jackie, Polo, Timmy and all those other teenagers that are nowhere interesting and special enough. It makes the movie just silly.Nowhere as good as the original but still a decent movie that lacks some things of the original.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Jaws 2

To paraphrase Yogi Bara, it's déjà vu all over again. That said, while this movie is certainly watchable this sequel is hardly as good as its predecessor. While part of the reason may be the similarity of the plot, to me there were two other reasons which were more significant. The first was the incredibly ludicrous scene involving a helicopter. The second was the appearance of the shark which didn't quite resemble a shark at certain key moments. Again, this movie was watchable.

This one more or less repeats the same story only to embarrassing results. Roy Scheider returns as Chief Brody who can play this role in his sleep. Actually, he should have been asleep for all the good this film does his career. After his heroics in the first film he is reduced to embarrassing scenes where he believes he sees sharks and screams foe everybody to evacuate the beach area only to discover that it wasn't what he thought. He eventually gets fired, which Scheider likely wished was a reality for the film. The screenplay plays like the standard slasher flick only instead of a masked madman, we have a shark snacking on everyone who enters the water, including one imbecile who lights herself and her boat on fire thus killing her but the shark survives. Lorraine Gary returns as Scheider's wife, and Murray Hamilton returns once again playing an authority figure making bad decisions, such as being part of this film. Jeffrey Kramer plays Brody's less than intelligence deputy. Donna Wilkes appears as eye candy before being discovered hiding in a boat after her boyfriend became shark food.

29,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"Not as good as the first one, but actually really decent",8,4 August 2017,"As Amity prepares to open a new resort complex, a series of boating accidents in the local waters prompts suspicion another shark is in the area and when it's confirmed the local police chief mounts a rescue attempt on a group of teens trapped by the creature.There is actually a lot to like in this one. One of the best features in here is that the shark is featured prominently and gets a chance to show off how great it looks due to the enhanced screen time. It's more believable and there's some really good suspense from its deformed and scarred face as the burn marks go the extra mile giving this beast a little more menace to it. Since it really looks more demonic being as mangled as this is and with the personality demonstrated, it makes for a more effective threat. There are a couple of great early attacks, starting with the divers being ambushed while discovering the shipwreck and a later scene where the fin surfaces behind an oblivious water-skier and trails them underwater. All of these attacks lead to the film's one truly imaginative scene, the debacle at the beach when what he thinks is the shark turns out to be nothing more threatening than a school of bluefish. The suspense apparent at the beginning is obvious, as the approaching figure does vaguely look like a shark at the spot from which it's spotted at, and the ending resolution is a nice twist. The film's main feat is the sailboat massacre which is a long, drawn out affair that really serves for quite a great time. from the moment the fin breaks the surface causing general pandemonium to the continued assaults and breakthroughs of the defense barriers that follow, this sequence never stops. Throwing in the fear of devourment with a couple of really well-done stalk-and-bite scenes that really hold up quite well and a few clever touches in their struggles helps this out. The helicopter downing is handled nicely, having an obstacle thrown at them that hammers home the hopelessness of the situation really clearly. The method for dispatching the creature isn't new, but it's nicely handled and really gets some suspense going, especially the shot of the massive creature bearing down on it. All in all, this wasn't all that terrible for a sequel. There really isn't a lot here that this doesn't do right, and most of that is the fact that film feels too padded out at times. It takes forever to get to the assault on the sailboats, and the wait to get there is filled with certain scenes that really don't need to be as long as they are. One of the most annoying things, though, about this film is the repetition of the we-can't-close the-beaches plot thread from the original. This attitude is inane for anyone who lived through Amity's previous nightmare summer, and even more so in a man whose son spends all of his free time out on the water. The repetition of this useless and really irritating subplot really takes most of the film's energy from it, but beyond these, the film isn't that bad.Rated PG: Graphic Violence and Language.",Jaws 2

As sequels go, this isn't bad, though Steven Spielberg did not return as director, fellow ""Night Gallery"" director Jeannot Szwarc stepped in, and did a fine job, since the scenes on the ocean are quite effective, with a memorable finale.

Unfortunately he is unable to obtain proof and the Mayor refuse to believe the threat has returned, while various swimmers and boating enthusiasts carry on, regardless to the fact that they are potential bait....At the time of it's release, Jaws was the biggest film in the world, and the film still echoes across the world today, every time a person who has seen this film steps into the ocean, they always think of this.So it was inevitable that a sequel would occur, but without the Spielberg magic, it just doesn't thrill like the original did/does.Jaws 2 is nothing more than a retread of the first film, but this time, it's a little more urgent for Brody, because his family are right in the middle of the final set piece, and he has to kill the shark in a more elaborate way than he did the first time.Gone is the warm chemistry that Brody, Hooper, and Quint had in the second act of the film, that male bonding made that film more human, rather than it just being about a shark.This is nothing more than a nautical slasher movie, you can see the victims from a mile off, and you watch the film wishing you were back on the Orca singing 'show me the way to go home'.Scheider is as wonderful as ever, but it just becomes too mundane for it's own good. Who knew nearly forty years ago that studios would think that a name would be a license to print money, even thought the first film was nothing short of a phenomenon.Parts three and four get regularly lambasted for being two of the worse films ever made, but the third one has Manimal inside the shark with a grenade, and the fourth one?

Still reeling from the shocking horrors of the first movie, Brody seems paranoid about another Great White shark attack at the local beaches and loses his job because of it. The shark ultimately zeroes-in on the Brody's two sons and their teen friends on the open waters.While not great, like the first movie, ""Jaws 2"" delivers the goods. It's basically just a continuation of the story minus Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw), focusing more on a group of teens. The only problem with this is that the youthful cast lacks the acting chops of their elders, but they're passable and the cringe-inducing moments are kept to a minimum (pretty much). It was a good decision to include the teens because the first movie focused on adults, particularly in the second half, and ""Jaws 2"" does the opposite. Speaking of the youths, they're highlighted by a few cuties: Tina (Ann Dusenberry), Jackie (Donna Wilkes) and Lucy (Cindy Grover). The best scene is when the shark takes down a friggin' helicopter (!).Amazingly, this sequel was made only three years after the original and cost 2½ as much (!), but made significantly less at the box office, even though it was still quite profitable.The theatrical version runs 116 minutes while the TV version runs 131 minutes (I saw the long version).

I love the woman who plays Mrs. Taft in the Jaws films. I love Murray Hamilton who I always confuse with Hal Holbrook. They could be brothers. She seems just real as the character.

It started all with Planet Of The Apes (1968).It came clear to the producers that the first Jaws (1975) was a major success so a follow-up had to come but they had one problem. Steven Spielberg didn't want to be involved anymore. So they hired another director who didn't understand to make monster flicks so the fired him and came out with Jeannot Szwarc who already had a big name in the series genre. He wanted to create a special atmosphere with shots not seen in the original one like for example, the camera on the shark itself.On part of the scary parts it did work out fine but I watched it with my 12 year old daughter and she said, well, it take a while before things go wrong and the shark do appear. And that hit the nail. I had the same feeling but I must say that once the shark do start to terrorize Amity this get moving on. It do has a few jump scenes like for example the burned body and the helicopter scene.

38,StevePulaski,We're gonna need a bigger tolerance,6,3 October 2013,"The biggest problem with Jaws 2 is it ain't no Jaws, and it feels like writer Carl Gottlieb and Howard Sackler wrote the film with the original's screenplay sitting right next to it. The film has some seriously suspenseful sequences, a handful of decent location shots, but doesn't have that ""come from behind"" vibe its predecessor had the benefit of. The feeling of watching a great film that was plagued by problem after problem is traded for a film that feels like mediocrity and money were the prime goals from the start.What made Steven Spielberg's Jaws such a surprising and terrific motion picture was that, despite numerous production problems including going grossly over-budget and having three mechanical-shark failures on set during shooting, it had several people that took the project seriously and made it a truly captivating picture. They were director Spielberg, editor Verna Fields, and music-composer John Williams. Those three, along with the gifted cast of characters, made the film what it is today and are to thank for its mark on classic cinema.The only soul to reprise his role from the original film is Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, who must now deal with another great white shark terrorizing Amity Island. As in the first film, the entire town is panicked, the backbones such as the village, the managers, and the police of unsure how to respond, and Brody continues to not be believed by his peers about the dangers of the shark even though it's common knowledge that he battled one before. You'd think that the people would consider that Brody has been through this and has a viable idea about how this sort of thing works.Immediately, we have a conflict that feels stretched and rather perfunctory. Perhaps the film doesn't work as well because it has very, very few people from its predecessor on board with it. Only Scheider, Williams, and writer Carl Gottlieb return, but you can see it's a challenge for them to try and liven material that was exercised to capacity in a film just a few years ago.Thankfully, there is suspense present, but the use of it, along with the editing, is gratefully inferior to the original film. Consider the scene where a woman is on a boat and her friend is several feet away from the boat and a shark fin appears out of the water. It now becomes an unintentional race to the boat between the shark and the man and director Jeannot Szwarc keeps the focus on this scene for maybe thirty, forty seconds. This is easily one of the strongest scenes in the film, but like every good scene in the film, I can't help but wonder how Spielberg and Fields would've conducted it and what tactics they would've employed. To add fuel to the fire, it has been reported that Scheider and Szwarc had numerous on set disputes about creativity in the project, only leading for one to assume that, doing this before, he knew that Spielberg had the talent and ingredients to make the project work.The final element to mention in Jaws 2 is the shark. It is a known fact that the original film was plagued by difficulties with mechanical sharks, with having all three on set fail in some way or another. But Jaws 2's problem is the sharks look inherently fake and I can't find any information that says the crew had difficulty in getting the sharks to work and function fluently. What does this say about the capability of the crew on Jaws 2 compared with the crew of the original Jaws film?Starring: Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary, and Murray Hamilton.

39,Smells_Like_Cheese,"As far as sequels go, this one deserves another bite!",7,13 April 2003,"When Jaws was released in 1975, I don't think audiences knew what hit them. People were scared to death to go into the waters and Jaws became the very first summer blockbuster. As set by example by later Hollywood, it made money, WE NEED A SEQUEL. Well, Jaws 2 was an actual book, but why not capitalize on it's success? Jaws 2 actually is a decent movie, I don't know why this film is so picked on. I think because it does have a bit of a slow start, but the ending is fantastic. This was one of the first times we saw good looking teenagers terrorized. Arguably yes, it's silly to think the shark would come back for a second bite, but why not just let go and have a good time with this one? I went back for seconds and still like this movie.Once again, Mayor Vaughn doesn't share Brody's belief that the town has another shark problem and warns him not to do something hasty. The following day, while Brody is in an observation tower, he sees a large shadow produced by a school of bluefish, which he mistakes for a shark. In his haste, Brody orders everyone out of the water and fires his gun, causing a panic. The town council fire Brody for the beach incident, with Mayor Vaughn being the only one to vote against dismissal. The next morning, Mike sneaks out and goes sailing with his friends, but has to take his young brother Sean along to stop him telling his parents about Mike's trip. But as they sail on the waters, the shark decides it's time for some afternoon lunch and terrorizes the teens. Martin realizes with his sons missing, they may be in trouble and goes to save them and their friends.Does the movie have it's flaws; yes. The acting is alright and the plot is a bit silly. The beginning is a bit slow and the story isn't as interesting as the first film with intelligent adults as clearly this was made more for the scare and bringing back old characters for the fans. Not to mention that the boat scene was a bit sloppy where the dumb woman is grabbing a bottle of gasoline to light the shark on fire I'm assuming but looses her balance and dumps it on herself and proceeds to shoot a flare gun! Yeah, she had it coming. There is a really bad mistake caught on film when the shark reaches in to bite Michael, Jaws scraps it's mouth on the boat and the mouth bends as if it was plastic, lol. But one of the things I like about the film is that it still does give a good scare with the teenagers. Especially when Marge has to save Shawn out of the water and she can't get back up on the boat and keeps slipping, as you see Jaws going after her and it just breaks your heart when Shawn witnesses her death. Also I have a guilty pleasure for the actor Keith Gordon(Christine, All that Jazz, and Back to School), this was one of his first films and he does a very good job. The cast seemed to really click and did a good job working together. Plus you have to love how ""marine"" Martin Brody gets when he faces down Jaws for his last time and goes for that money shot. Jaws 2 is definitely flawed, but honestly a fun film that too many people judge harshly. I think it's just a fun popcorn flick that you need to let go and just have a good time when sequels had good intentions.7/10",Jaws 2
40,MovieAddict2016,This Time it's Kind of Personal!,5,12 April 2003,"A film like ""Jaws 2"" proves that we can, indeed, get too much of a good thing. Action and shark over substance and character development. Somewhere along the way ""Jaws"" went from being about deep, intelligent characters in intense situations to shallow teenagers in B-monster-movie moments.""Jaws 2,"" or ""Jaws2"" (no space in between ""s"" and ""2""), takes place four years after the horrid events in Amity, seen in the first film. Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider, commonly mistaken for Rob Schneider with today's audience) is a veteran of a shark attack, of course. And like most sequels involving characters who once battled a beast of some sort and survived, Brody is now the official expert on sharks. When a boat blows up off shore, Brody suspects a shark. When a killer whale is found dead with chomp marks, Brody suspects a shark. Heck, you could blow up the state of Arkansas and Brody would probably think it's a shark.Soon Brody loses his job because the town mayor (Murray Hamilton, reprising his role shortly in this film because he had to stop filming to attend to his sick wife) doesn't like poor Brody, even after the events of the first film. Then Brody's seventeen-year-old son goes out on a sail boat and before you can go, ""Duh-duh-duh-duh"" JAWS is coming at him and his friends. Brody goes, tries to save them, and you can guess what the outcome is.Okay, here are some things I noticed that hindered this film:1. The first thing that hits you over the head here is how this film is painfully a copy in every way of the first film, only about ten times worse. There is no suspense--they show the shark from the beginning on. In a documentary made just for the ""Jaws2"" DVD, the director says that ""The shark has already been seen, so there's no suspense--you might as well show it."" Well, this is a bit true--I hate when horror sequels wait till the end to show the creature (""Predator 2"") even though we've seen them in the first. But the way they do it here is painfully un-suspenseful. The film really contains no sense of suspense.2. You'd think that everyone in the town would have learned their lesson last time: Brody was right about a shark, and he saved the day. Here we see everyone turning back to their old ways and ignoring Brody. You could give excuses for this, but the fact of the matter remains: It's just another retread of the first film, done on a much lesser scale.3. The shark here is shown too much--he looks like a rubber ducky in a bathtub. Kids scream as it attacks boats and helicopters--yes, helicopters (that looks strange on paper)--and the shark comes out of the water head first to swim forward. Now, unlike the first film where the shark was never shown very well--because of mechanical problems or not, they still didn't show it--they show the shark many, many times here. And unlike the first when they DID show the shark, in ""Jaws2"" they make the shark look utterly unrealistic. In the first the rubber shark swam like a shark--this thing swims like a giant piece of rubber in an ocean.4. The director obviously went for action over story: Steven Spielberg masterfully crafted an instense and scary film, yet at the same time provided a very interesting character study. Here, we just see blood, guts, and big rubber sharks--something that might look good in a B-horror-movie, but not in a ""Jaws"" film.5. What are the remote chances that another 25-foot Great White Shark (capitalized for effect) would be off the coast off the small town Amity twice? Perhaps this will answer that question:After finding a killer whale, Brody asks a marine biologist (filling in Richard Dreyfuss' most-missed shoes), ""You don't think if one shark dies, another shark could come and""--he gets cut off by the marine biologist, who says, ""Sharks don't take things personally, Mr. Brody."" Well, that's funny, according to the tagline for the forth film they do. Perhaps that is one of the confusing elements of this film. Is the shark attacking because Brody killed the other one four years ago? Or is it just an odd coincidence? We may never know.Steven Spielberg had the smarts to move on after the first project, as did Richard Dreyfuss, and Roy Scheider should have said ""no,"" too, because you can't flog a dead fish and expect people to jump. (Did that make sense? Sorry, I had a good catch-phrase in my head but it didn't come out right.)The first film should have been a stand alone, but in the case that they should make a sequel to one of the most cherished films of all time, for heaven's sake, make it good!So now I come back to my original question.

Plus the film's ending is unforgettable - I remember this ending even though it was years ago since I saw the film (I've just recently acquired it for my film collection and watched it again. It's even better than I remembered it to be).The movie is exactly what you would expect from a Jaws film: kids in the water, a few attacks from Jaws and Police Chief Brody is the only one in the beginning that believes the attacks are from a very large shark as he had to deal with 3 years earlier.I still think this is one of the best horror movies - in particular for the summertime! :) 9/10",Jaws 2
42,disdressed12,more unbearable suspense and tension,9,2 May 2007,"this movie is quite good,in my estimation.it doesn't differ much from the original,but i think it has more suspense and intensity.this movie really had my adrenaline flowing and my heart pumping.being a sequel,obviously it would have less impact than the first one.as entertainment,think it is better than than the first one.it does not have the flaw that the first one had,at least i don't think so.also,we get to see the shark more.i like the story a bit better too.i think a lot of people automatically give lower rating to a sequel,just because it is a sequel.many people believe sequel could never outdo it original,particularly if the original has the impact that the original ""Jaws"" had.i don't happen to agree with that point of view.when i say,i think ""Jaws 2"" is better than ""Jaws""i am not minimizing ""Jaws's impact. i think Jaws was a brilliant film,but for me,its sequel is slightly better.For me,""Jaws 2"" is a very strong 9/10",Jaws 2
43,OllieSuave-007,"Slight above-average sequel, not too bad.",7,29 January 2014,"In Jaws' first sequel, Roy Scheider returns as Police Chief Martin Brody. This time, four years after the events of the original ""Jaws,"" the town of Amity suddenly experiences series of boating accidents and disappearances and Brody discovers that a second Great White Shark is the culprit, making the waters deadly dangerous again.Like the first movie, the special effects were great, especially the execution of the shark. Again, you see scenes of people being dragged beneath the waters after the shark's huge fin creepily rises out of the ocean. John Williams' haunting music theme is brilliantly heard once again and director Jeannot Szwarc did a find job, making the movie which I think didn't surpass its prequel still exciting and fresh with a pretty intriguing plot.While a entertaining movie, I didn't like the plot-line where Brody's concerns of a second shark are ignored by the townsfolk and the town's local government officials. It makes Brody lose credibility and the town people's IQ drop several points. And, Brody is almost a supporting character as much of the action and scream scenes involved Brody's son Mike and his group of teenage friends - making this film more like a teenage horror/slasher flick.Again, it's a sequel not surpassing the original movie, but still worthy for a fright night.Grade B-",Jaws 2
44,sddavis63,More Of The Same,4,27 June 2018,"If I were going to offer just a brief summary of this movie, it would be simple: if you've seen ""Jaws"" then you've seen ""Jaws 2."" I've seen ""Jaws"" and I quite enjoyed it. But watching this first sequel was a bit of a letdown. It's not that it's particularly a bad movie. It's not. But it's just the same story, tweaked in a few places, but in substance the same. There's a giant great white shark off the coast of Amity Island attacking people. Police Chief Brody (played once again by Roy Scheider) realizes this and tries to get the town to take action to protect people and the town refuses, leaving Brody to eventually have to hunt down the shark. (And I do have to say that the climax to the final confrontation seemed somewhat less than believable.) In any event, it's OK, and Scheider slipped easily back into the role of Brody. But for all its similarities to ""Jaws"" and in spite of the fact that it's OK, I really have to knock this sequel down several points from the score of 8 that I gave the original. Basically, there are three reasons for doing so:(1) The sheer lack of originality hurts this. It's pretty much predictable all the way through. Sure, as I said, the story is tweaked here and there - but basically you know what's going to happen; you know where this is heading. It's not a ""thrilling"" or frightening movie the way the original was.(2) The absence of Richard Dreyfuss was unfortunate. It was understandable. Apparently he was busy with ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"" while ""Jaws 2"" was being shot. But I really liked his character of Matt Hooper in the original. He partnered with Scheider well, and Brody and Hooper were complementary characters. Hooper gets mentioned in this sequel. Brody's wife (played by Lorraine Gray) is shown talking to him on the phone, finding out that he's in Antarctica and unable to return to help her husband out.)(3) I'd make the same observation about the absence of Steven Spielberg as director - who was unable to take part in this for the same reason as Dreyfuss. His directing was missed. He had a crisp style about him and put together not only a frightening movie but a well paced and very interesting movie. Jeannot Szwarc is a good director, but to me didn't seem to quite capture the right feel for this. The pacing seemed off. He didn't seem to have as sure a hand on the genre.Having seen this, I'm honestly not sure that I wouldn't have been better off just re-watching the original. (4/10)",Jaws 2
45,thesar-2,Jaws 2: The Definite Electric Boogaloo,4,13 June 2011,"Jaws 2 gets dumped on. All the time.Let's begin by never, ever comparing it to the masterpiece #1 was. With that being thrown out, it's not a terrible movie. It's exactly what a sequel (especially summer sequel) should be: more of everything.In this case: more blood, more attacks, more shark sightings, more sexuality (girls, duh,) more inventive kills/chomps, and more ways of ridding the world (uh, beach/water) of the title menace.They delivered in spades. Now, on its own, it's not great, but it's fun.When I was a kid, I loved sequels more than the originals. Why? For the very reasons already stated. I was an impatient kid (well, kinda still am) and I wanted to get right to the reason we came to the show. I was the same with Superman II vs. Superman: The MovieYou got to see Superman right away(!) in part II when you'll have to wait an hour plus in the original.As an adult, I can contest the originals are oodles better, but from a kid's POV, I liked – and rewatched – the sequels more.That all said, just watch this movie as a sequel. No real depth, no real message. Roy Scheider reprises his Chief Brody role from the first one, amongst most of the other reoccurring cast members and adds very little to his original starring character. Again, he plays a wild-eyed, water-hating chief who has since survived a shark attack and spews lines to anyone who would listen, such as: ""But I'm telling you, and I'm telling everybody at this table that, that's a shark! And I know what a shark looks like, because I've seen one up close. And you'd better do something about this one, because I don't intend to go through that hell again!""(Thank God, he chose not to return to parts 3-D and The Revenge. Because, his rants, or reason he chooses to stay close to water, would be even more far-fetched as the later sequels will become)Anyways, suffice to say, everyone ""thinks it's safe to go back into the water"" and lo, there's another shark near Amity Island near New York, USA. (In a funny side note, Brody thinks it's after revenge for the destruction of the first movie's sharkalso named: Jaws? I hope that wasn't the inspiration for the horrid part IV)That's about it. Really. Let's see, I've already mentioned Brody trying to convince everyone lightning struck twice and there's another shark. Okay, fine, throw in a group of kids, including the two Brody boys, who drift out into the ocean while Jaws has its fun with them. Brody must come out and kill Jaws again in an unrealistic, but ""fun"" way.Did I mention Jaws eats a helicopter? Am I losing youif I haven't already?Again, forget remotely comparing it to part 1. Remember it's just a mindless, summer movie and have a little fun. And think 1970s, a lot. I mean all the boys are attracted to a girl sooo plain that she would've even make Devine look pretty.",Jaws 2
46,gridoon,The only worthy sequel is still a DULL movie.,4,14 September 1999,"The ""Jaws"" series is much more famous than it deserves to be. The only entry REALLY worth watching is the first one, which is a very good movie but no masterpiece - the subject is too insubstantial. ""Jaws 2"" is preferable to the abysmal ""Jaws 3-D"" (the bomb of the series) and to the passable but dumb ""Jaws The Revenge"" , but it's still a dull sequel - actually a dull rehash of the first movie, without any sense of style. The pace is slow and there are just too many idiotic, ""Friday The 13th""-type young characters that you don't really care about. And ""Jaws The Revenge"" may be a worse film, but it certainly has a better look.",Jaws 2
47,lost-in-limbo,Craving bloody seconds.,6,28 November 2009,"I guess you could see the fin coming. No surprises a sequel was churned out since the original was a whopping box-office smash hit that left a terrifying impression on most movie-goers and would launch Steven Spielberg's career. I haven't watched this sequel in quite awhile, but some moments do linger in mind. This one scared me when I was a kid when I first saw it, as the following day at school was pool day oh great timing that was. Anyhow I've seen the other two sequels more often than this one (for me to say that Jaws 3-D would be the best of the sequels), and every once in awhile I'd catch bits and pieces of the original on TV. Now re-watching it again, I see it as a worthy follow-up that truly outdoes the third film (which I still don't feel is as atrocious as it's made out to be). As sequels go, ""Jaws 2"" does what one should do. Give us the repetitive formula, but along the way more of the shark (robotic as ever) and bringing back the main character in police Chief Martin Brody (the soundly likable Roy Scheider) to once again come to grips with a great white problem. Scheider and especially a sincere Lorraine Gary have really grown into the roles. Jeffery Kramer and Murray Hamilton also reprise their roles. Joseph Mascolo, Mark Gruner, Ann Dusenberry, Donna Wilkes, Keith Gordon and Marc Gilpin are also acceptably fine. The script the actors have to work with keeps the witty humour intact, but cook also up the harrowing points and growing anxiety in a predictable manner.Director Jeannot Szwarc's handling plasters out the jarring jolts with reasonable intensity even with its steady pacing, but it does lose a bit with showing the shark early on and within most of its attacks. The mechanically rubber creation doesn't look too bad. Nonetheless I guess that's what the audience wants, after being kept in the shadows for most of the original's running time. His out to exploit the concept, which it does come off and he makes the water feel just as ominous to what's lurking in it. We open with John William's majestically booming score (and quite a lively one too), which immediately imposes that this is going out big for the occasion. In some regards it's bigger in its excitement, but not particularly better. I found the first hour to be actually rather well developed and grippingly suspenseful (even though its kind of exercising the original), but when the focus starts to centre on the annoyingly rowdy teenagers later on and that of their troublesome sailing trip it seems to lose a bit of something and go on for a bit too long. Also they would go onto kill off the most affable teenager character (who really doesn't get all that much to do, but makes an imprint nonetheless), which at least makes it quite an effective moment and the best staged death sequence. Surprisingly the amount of teens it has at its disposal, too many survive.",Jaws 2
48,ElMaruecan82,Just when Martin Brody thought he was out...,6,5 November 2019,"How do you get from Steven Spielberg to Jeannot Szwarc? No offense to the director who made a decent thriller, but his name put in the same sentence than Spielberg has quite an awkward effect and confirms the crucial weight of a director's vision and the line it draws between the average and the awesome. Szwarc didn't make a sequel for the ages, but let's at least give him credit for taking the best from what was at his hands: a good cast, a good writer (Carl Gottlieb) and decent special effects and didn't make something as bad as ""Jaws 3D"" or its infamous ""Revenge"" sequel.Naturally, ""Jaws 2"" is nowhere close to the magic of the original film and that's a fact, but that shouldn't distract from the other fact which is that as far as horrifying special effects, jump scares and sudden deaths go, it delivers, without trying to emerge from the ""horror thriller"" surface, taking for granted the presence of Roy Scheider replaying the shark-weary Martin Brody and a few characters from the first film, including Murray Hamilton as the unethical Mayor Vaughan and Loraine Gary as the comforting wife. It is a good continuation of the first ""Jaws"" to the degree it makes us feel at home in Amity Island and if we were to compare it to the next sequels, it's got what it takes to leave us satisfied.So maybe ""Jaws 2"" is one of these movies that deserve a second look because 'after all', they're not so bad despite the elements of badness they have. But what elements are we talking about? Some say the film's Achilles' fin so to speak is the shark itself as we see too much of it. Remember in the original film (of course the review is likely to mention it), we never see Bruce until perhaps the third or fourth on-screen death and its most impacting moment comes near the climax, when Brody turns his face to the camera and is muttering some wisecracks while Bruce says hello right behind, that was the rewarding pay-off of such a long wait and it's perhaps one of the most terrifying moment of cinema's history followed by the iconic ""You're gonna need a bigger boat"".I'm not sure the shark should have been kept off-screen, some critics and Youtube reviewers pointed out that it would have helped to leave some doubt over Brody, depicting him as a shell-shocked man trying not to succumb to paranoia, until the disastrous bluefish mix-up, in fact that's exactly the way it goes in the film when we take the Amity perspective. But the director (forgot his name) seems to go straight to the point with the terror, there's a shark, he knows it, we know it and he's not kidding us viewers. I like that straightforward approach in the way it kept everyone in Amity Island but Brody clueless for the most part, even the first deaths with the two scuba divers, the water skier and her driver didn't leave any ""hint"" that would suggest a shark's presence.Yes, the shark is quite a tricky fellow, but the catch of that choice is that the shark is more of a monster-like villain collecting victims with such an unappeasable appetite it seems to kill for fun, and the more we see it, the 'faker' it looks from a biological perspective and the more cinematic as cheaply-designed to terrorize it definitely is. Let's not forget Spielberg didn't show the shark just for artistic license but also technical reasons. In ""Jaws 2, we never see any real eating or biting and the horror is more suggested than shown, a honorable discretion that prevented the film from turning into a grotesque gore feast.However, a more problematic aspect on the field of realism is that it's hard to imagine after all they've gone through, no one would in the city council would really believe Brody... even if nothing points out that it's a shark who made all this mess... it's also hard to believe that a guy like Vaughan would be elected again. There is more than a stretch of imagination the film could withhold if you add the fact that Brody's sons have aged dramatically in the span of three or four years so maybe these are the elements that spoils the film a little, but the angle taken by ""Jaws 2"" is so different from the original than one should watch it as a movie in the same vein than these ""dead teenagers"" movies where kids are trapped by a mysterious killer in an isolated place.What would be adapted ad nauseam through the ""Friday XIII"" series (and other cheap 80s slashers) was still a new horror trope the same year than ""Halloween"" was made and watching these wealthy kids being capsized, eaten or terrorized by a shark with no holds barred as far as who'd die is responsible for many effective moments. They might not all be the best actors but within the limitations of their role, they do find the right tone when they're supposed to play scary. It's not much a youth driven film than an adaptation of ""Jaws"" in a more specific context: young kids going sailing and one of the bad-ass Daddies to the rescue, and what a rescue!The special effects are modest but effective when they have to be, the film doesn't leave any lasting impact apart from a series of shocks and thrills, but it's a good production of its time and a good sequel on its own right and last but not least, it's got one of the best tag-lines with ""Just when you thought it was safe to go back to water again...""",Jaws 2
49,g-bodyl,Decent Follow-Up To A Classic!,8,2 January 2014,"Jaws 2, the second installment in the Jaws franchise, is not a bad movie which everyone is claiming to be. It's just not a classic film like Steven Spielberg's Jaws was. This film is more in the reign of a B-type horror film that is entertaining and very thrilling to watch. Each scene involving the great white shark was very intense and kept me hanging on tight. I was sort of disappointed about the lack of suspense, but then again we already saw the shark in the first movie so there is no point in adding any more suspense.Jeannot Szwarzac's film takes place four years after the events of the original movie. Business is starting to increase after the deadly events, but after some unexplained disappearances and a chomped-up killer whale washes ashore, Chief Brody begins to suspect another shark may be nearby much to everyone's dismay and disbelieving attitudes.The acting is really not that bad. Sure the teenagers really did nothing memorable, but they weren't awful and you might have pitied them by the end of the movie. Roy Scheider who returns here is really good and he adds character to this movie. Murray Hamilton returns as the mayor and does a good job.Overall, Jaws 2 is not a classic by any means, but it still is a good film. Granted, this isn't the beloved character study that Spielberg made, but instead this is a decent slasher flick that does not do anymore than thrill. It's the perfect B-movie. I'm glad we get to see more of the shark here and despite some technical flaws, the shark still works in good way. I also liked the return of John Williams's theme because maybe that's why I felt so intense while watching this. I rate this film 8/10.",Jaws 2
50,CuriosityKilledShawn,The ONLY decent Jaws sequel,7,20 April 1999,"In the wake of Steven Spielberg's original game-changer there came many, many imitators, most of which were so lazy that they were just named after whatever leviathan might be eating people on that occasion (Orca, Piranha, Great White, Alligator) and they were all absolute garbage (although Orca does have some decent melancholic pathos). Jaws 2 seems to have been degraded by the flurry of imitators, but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. It's actually quite good.Three years after Martin Brody destroyed the original shark another (with a rather cool Phantom of the Opera burn across its 'face') has come to Amity Island and is gobbling-up the locals. No one wants to listen to Brody's suspicions, leaving him to deal with it all on his own. His two sons, meanwhile, go out sailing with a bunch of friends and are terrorized by the shark when it paralyzes their flotilla.Many critics have compared Jaws to a teenage slasher movie, which I think is unfair. That particular sub-genre didn't really take-off until the release of Halloween, which came out 4 months later. Plus the teenagers in this movie are actually likable and have decent characterization. Even the stuck-up Mayor's son is good character. In a modern movie he'd die horribly as creating unlikable fodder is a common way for lazy writers to encourage blood-lust in the audience.However, the movie is very, very short on blood, which is one of its biggest faults. These shark attacks are far too clean and sterile. The first movie had way more, why not this one? Jeannot Szwarc is no Steven Spielberg, and struggles to build tension and suspense. His effort is ""not bad"", especially during early scenes such as the dead whale, and body in the surf, but the poor editing of the action scenes suggests he couldn't capture much on camera and left it to the editors (Verna Fields did not touch this film) to put it together any way they could. Brody is somewhat demoted to a sideshow character in the second half as the teenagers shout and scream at the circling dorsal fin. A better balance of scenes could have been found here.John Williams' score is a step-down from the first, though still a good score in its own right. It's just a pity that the movie has only ever been released in Mono as the music could use a decent, spacious remastering.I feel that if a different, more prominent 70s director had taken control of Jaws 2 (such as John Frankenheimer or Willia Friedkin) then we might have ended up with a tighter, more exciting film. As it is, Jaws 2 is merely a respectable sequel before the excruciating awfulness of the further two that followed.",Jaws 2

53,ironhorse_iv,"Just when you thought, it was safe to go back in the water. Jaws 2 takes a bite out of you. What a corny, but fun, movie!",6,18 January 2018,"While, it's true that Jaws 2 is not as good as the original film. For movie lovers, around the world, they still have their jaws on the floor. It was very highly successful as a summer blockbuster. In spite of everything, it was briefly the highest-grossing sequel in history, until 'Rocky II' was released in 1979. So, it's still worth checking out. However, I do understand, why some fans & critics, might hate this sequel. After all, this movie directed by Jeannot Szwarc does seem unnecessary. It mostly follows the same thread as the last movie, by having another great white shark terrorize the small tourism community of Amity Island; with Police Chief, Martin Brody (Roy Schneider) going out in the open water to stop it. Nevertheless, it didn't bug me, as much, because how much new scenarios, and open water locations, the writers put, into this film. Still, if I had to nitpick, some of the new characters, the writers put into this movie, didn't really stand out, much. While, I didn't mind, the story shifts focus from Chief Brody and Amity's officials to the teenagers, Brody's son, Michael (Mark Gruner) hang out with. I just wish, some of them, had a little more of a persona. It was really hard to figure out, who was who. However, I do like how the writers didn't turn the mayor's son, Larry Vaughn Jr. (David Elliot) into a stereotypical bully, since Michael's dad was in odds with his father, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) throughout this movie, and the last. As for the new adult characters; I found them, to be, the worst. Even, if you put, all the delete scenes of Joseph Mascolo's property developer character, Len Peterson trying to hook up with Brody's wife, Ellen (Lorraine Gray), back into the film; it wouldn't make much of a different, to the main plot. In short, the property developer's botch romantic subplot adds nothing, but run-time. His scenes should had been merge with the mayor, and Peterson should had been cut from the film, all-together. As for diver instructor, Tom Andrews (Barry Coe), that fought off, the shark, before Brody came to the rescue. His short introduce scenes really come out of nowhere & quickly ends, so it was really hard to root for him, since we know little about him. As for the new shark. It's a mixed bag. I felt like the action scenes with it, were a little over the top & unrealistic. Seeing a Great White Shark take down a helicopter & blowing up several large boats, while, having half of its face, burn off does seem highly stupid & illogical. On the other hand, those scenes were also fun to watch, even if the creature doesn't act like a normal shark. Nevertheless, I also felt that the movie would had work better, if they were little more ambiguous on showing the creature, so early in the film; by cutting down on composer, John William's iconic memorable theme music & hiding the shark, from view. Yes, I know, that recognizable score struck fear in the hearts of people for years; but just think, how good, the movie's attack scenes, would had been, if the audience weren't hinted at the threat. Not only does, these tactics, hide the malfunctioning cheesiness special effects of the 1970s, but it also might enhance the subplot of Police Sheriff, Martin Brody's going a little mad, a lot more. It would add something new to the film, by turning the generic man vs nature horror, into a psychological thriller like 2011's 'The Hunter'. After all, it's clear that the movie was going with, Brody suffering from PTSD on account of the events of the first film. So, why not, go all the way, with it! Raise the stalks, by making him, have pressure from all sides, doubting his validity & sanity. Show the town in extreme financial troubles, due to corruption and the loss of tourism; with him struggling to keep his job, in float, with his family intact. Make it seem like the shark might be all in his head! Until, the twist, when it's not. It might make the unnecessary sequel seem a little more interesting. Despite not going with the route that original director, John D. Hancock was going for; Roy Schneider is still great in this role, even if he was a bit disinterested in reprising, due to many reasons; including conflicts with Universal Pictures to whom he was locked into a multi-film contract with, and frequently clashing with new director Jeannot Szwarc who replace Hancock, during production. Honestly, if there is any highlight from this movie, it would be, Schneider. Roy made this B-movie, very watchable. Sad to see him, leave the franchise after this. Although, that's tragic, I would rather see, producer, Steven Spielberg, actor, Richard Dreyfuss & screenwriter, Howard Sackler take; with the film series being taken to a prequel focusing on a supporting character from the first movie, time on the USS Indianapolis and it's sinking during WW2; however, production on 1977's 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' was running behind and they declined to participation. Sad to see that happen. Look, I wouldn't for say, it would had been a great movie, seeing how 2016's historic film 'USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage' tanked, but it could had been better than the sequels than we got, later, after this film. Overall: despite the difficulties with production with reshoots being done in the winter, due to malfunctioning, and behind the scene turmoil, I have to say, 'Jaws 2' isn't that bad, as certain critics make it out to be. Szwarc & his crew somehow, made an entertaining decent movie, out of a film series that was already in troubled waters. This movie is kinda a guilty pleasure of mine. It's worth taking a dip, in.",Jaws 2

But it's still a very good movie.Plot In A Paragraph: 4 years on from the shark attacks of the first movie, things finally look to be on the up in Amity Island. But when a couple of divers go missing and a mother and daughter die whilst water skiing Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) fears that a new shark has come to Amity. Once again those in charge of the town trying to play it down because they feel Brody is paranoid. The main reason to watch this film is Roy Scheider, he gives an intense performance as you can see his paranoia show on his face. The worst thing is there is a sense of de ja vue as just like in the first movie Brody tells everyone there is a shark, and the powers that be won't listen till it's too late. The script has the potential to explore how Brody's fear of another shark affects his loved ones but it chooses not to in favour of wasting screen time on the teenagers (including Brody's eldest son) who Brody needs to save at the end of the movie. Another element of the story under explored is the property developer Len Peterson (Joseph Mascolo) whose obvious feelings towards Ellen Brody are never really explored. There are some good deleted scenes on the DVD that would have made the movie better, but they were scrapped do the movie could focus on the kids developing summer flings. Steven Spielberg didn't return neither did Richard Dreyfuss leaving Roy Scheider to pretty much make ""Jaws 2"" work on his own. And he does a superb job.

58,johnnyboyz,"Treading in the same water as the first, yet doing things worse.",5,27 April 2007,"Although eagerly anticipating the sequel, I was aware of the negative opinions surrounding Jaws 2 and even though it had been a long time since I'd last seen the first film, (which I remember loving) I was still looking forward to some suspenseful, beach located, shark action. It turned out that Jaws 2 felt more like a bit of a re-make than anything else.The reason for this is that it's main character from the first film returns and so does the actor (Scheider). The character of Hooper (Dreyfuss) seems to return but in another form. From what I recall, he's given a smaller, almost, wimpy role in Jaws 2 and it doesn't help when some iffy acting is thrown in. Since Brody is now the all action, hard bodied hero; the need for a 'Quint' character isn't necessary.Jaws 2 gets some things right but most of the time misses the mark. Spielberg's first Jaws film is really the inspiration for this film and the director doesn't bring too many new things to the sequel. The elements of suspicion and attempts at persuasion are still there but whatever else is missing has been replaced by a subplot revolving around a group of Amity teens and their lusts for sailing and one-another. Consequently; they hang around at bars and on beaches, talk to each another and do quite a bit of screaming when in peril.The actual premise for the film is something rather perplexing. The shark seemingly comes from nowhere and the feeling I got was that it had some kind of vendetta against the town in which the first shark was killed. Making this film a revenge flick was a daft thing to do as although I don't know much about sharks, I'm pretty sure they're not smart enough to want to go all out in an act of revenge due to an earlier killing. Maybe the shark from the first film was a friend or family member; who knows? Since the character isn't human, you can't give it a back-story.The script is another point of interest. I thought the script was a little laboured with poor teen dialogue but it also contained certain holes that really opened up at just the wrong moments. One of these was the fact that there was more than one photograph of the shark taken at the beginning yet Brody only has one to show the board. Another is the fact that although these shark attacks have happened before, the board ignore Brody's pleas and shrug him off. I understand the need for suspense but this was too unrealistic. It has happened before, Brody has the experience and know-how of sharks due to the first film but it now, apparently, counts for nothing. This made the film frustrating and longwinded.Although interesting at times, with a reasonable finale and some genuine good moments involving the real star of the film (the shark); Jaws 2 never really feels like it's able to elevate itself above that B-movie, cheap thrills, horror routine that, arguably, defines late 70s to early 80s films of this genre.",Jaws 2
59,matthewssilverhammer,Not As Bad As It Could Be,6,11 August 2021,"Horror sequels from this era are often dumb and/or cheap. Jaws 2, for all its flaws, isn't either of those things. The scares are fun, the universe of Amity is recaptured nicely, & the final quarter differs enough from the first's climax while still delivering solid thrills. Its downfall is that much of the early narrative & teen emotions are dull & unnecessary...how many white youths are we supposed to remember & care about???

60,insomniac_rod,"Worthy sequel that focuses more on the shark and the human's lives after ""the attack"".",6,20 February 2010,"This time the big shark we all love gets to be the star of the movie. Unlike the original, this one focuses more on the shark and gets toned down in the suspense, thrills, and fear generated by the animal.But I'm not saying that it's not a worthy sequel. In fact, it's a very well done Horror movie but it lacks the winning formula of the original.The atmosphere is still present and the fear for the water raises anytime someone gets into it.To be honest, I think the movie feels more of a slasher movie rather than a solid, tense Horror movie.The plot gets more interesting this time. I really enjoyed the way the characters try to get over the situations from the original. That means there's an intention to connect the events of the original with the sequel in a manner that the shark isn't the only element to notice. But also the human lead characters and their life after the attacks.Give it a try. A worthy sequel.",Jaws 2
61,Anonymous_Maxine,"After a spectacular first film, Jaws has already belly-flopped.",5,10 November 2004,"Before I go on, I should say that Jaws 2 is not an absolute disaster in the way my summary line suggests. Yes, it's a bad movie, but there is enough of the strength of the original still clinging to the material to make it almost worthwhile. Roy Schneider gives another great performance as Brody, the Amity Island Chief of Police, and a lot of the same tension is there in the atmosphere and tone of the movie, but the script could have been written by a junior high school kid and the shark has turned from a vicious but natural predator and into a movie monster.The massive lapses of basic logic are encompassed mostly by things like the way Brody is shunned by everyone on the island, even the Mayor, who is anxiously trying to attract investors and tourists to his island. The last thing he needs is someone running around yelling about a shark, he has to get the island back on its feet after those last shark attacks I really hope that this is meant to be a brilliant display of magnificent greed, because otherwise it is nothing less than jaw-dropping stupidity. This guy is trying to save the island from all the trouble that it went through after the last shark attacks, and so not only does he ignore a sudden proliferation of missing and dead teenagers, but he and his whole panel of advisors see a picture of what is unmistakably a shark's eye and claim to see nothing. Wow.That picture of the shark was probably the best part of the movie, particularly the scene where Brody is in the darkroom watching it get developed. The circumstances under which the picture was taken make for an excellent scene, probably the best in the film, but one that is quickly ruined when we have to sit and watch a whole panel decide that it's safer to assume that it's a picture of nothing. After all, they could get SUED. Needless to say, there is no mention of what to do when a lot of people turn up dead from shark attacks and it is revealed to the public that these people not only promptly ignored photographic evidence, but fired the man that brought it to their attention. 'Sued' does not even begin to cover it.When two kids turn up missing early in the movie, one of the island's three police officers is assigned to drag the bottom of the water, an assignment to which he complains, 'For how long? It's gonna be dark soon!' The only thing he didn't say was Wah! Wah! Wah! And not only that, but when they succeed in accidentally pulling up the power line to the island, he says, 'Let's get out of here before we DO find something!' That's some excellent police work there, little buddy.The movie is able to exist because of the difficulties that Brody has in convincing anyone that there really is a shark out there. This is what allows for the creation of much of the tension in the movie, but it is also the source of a lot of the stupidity in it. When a bunch of tourists or investors or something is being taken for a tour, the mayor looks up and is dismayed to see Brody up in a lookout tower watching the water. He tries desperately to distract anyone from seeing him, apparently unaware that anyone with a thought in their head would see a guy in a tower watching the water, and immediately identify him as a lifeguard and not give him another thought. Not in this movie. When asked if anyone had any questions, it's not hard to predict what some lunkhead is going to wonder about. Not tourist traffic, not real estate costs, not the costs of managing resorts or anything rational like that. They want to know why there's a guy in a tower watching the water. Please.By the way, why does no one notice the fin in this movie? Every time the fin pops out of the water, everyone is looking the other way, even just after an attack, when it would seem that everyone would be watching the water frantically. When a group of divers has a run in with the shark, they ascend in a panic, and because they came up too fast, the air in their lungs and blood expands and one of them finds himself with perforated lungs and an embolism. While he is being attended to, his friends mention that something must have spooked him.Now, I've been diving and I've been snorkeling, and I have to tell you that when you wear one of those masks, everything underwater appears in perfect clarity before you, exactly as if you were looking through clean air. So are we supposed to believe that these guys didn't notice the 25 foot shark that was not more than a few feet away from them? Now, in the movie's defense, Roy Schneider is just as good as he was in the original film, it's just that he had nothing to work with. He had badly written lines, as did everyone else, and then he had these ridiculous bouts of idiocy written into his character. When he finds the tiny sailboat with his son and a couple friends on it floating out in the water, he hugs his son and then tells him to get to shore. Any real father, or policeman, would have grabbed him and yanked him onto his boat rather than leave him out floating around where he found him. Then when he's trying to rescue the kids off the wrecked boats near the end of the film, he gets spooked when the shark shows up and, despite being the CHIEF OF POLICE, succeeds in crashing his boat into the rocks and stranding all of them. Brilliant.Oh, and in keeping with the subdued level of thought put into the movie, no mention is made of anyone who might have been in contact with the water, and thus a fatal amount of electricity, at the end of the film.But hey, that's just details",Jaws 2
62,jzappa,Jaws That Cut Both Ways,7,28 May 2010,"It's fitting that Jaws 2 is a sequel, a second film, because it is totally a double-edged sword, equally comprised of positive and negative elements. Of course it's but a fraction of Spielberg's classic, and yet it's about as good as, maybe even a little better than could be expected, with some great scenes that are just about on par with the original, and some authentic scares. It has Roy Scheider returning with an effectively brooding performance as Police Chief Martin Brody, who must confront another Great White terrorizing the waters of Amity Island. And yet again, after all they've been through before, the Mayor just doesn't buy Brody's claims. But what's interesting about the story this time is how Brody deals with the shellshock of his experiences from the first film, how it pains him to have to go through the same thing as before, how overprotective he's become with his kids, who are older and more desirous of their freedom.I like that the plot varies from the original rather than following all the same structural footsteps. It does open with some unassuming swimmers turning into a scrumptious meal for the unseen shark just as the first film did, but director Jeannot Szwarc puts an interesting twist on it by setting this entire sequence under water. We hear nothing but music score, we are immersed in the muted blue-green environment of the predator. However, I comment on the diverging story less because it's a particularly strong point for the movie itself and more because the movie can essentially be considered the first slasher sequel, basically taking a successful initial horror plot and making the source of the horror not so much a mysterious force but a slasher killer, so to speak, so amidst the pendulum of set-ups for teenager-killing, at least we have a character strand that grows from what the first movie subjected its surviving characters to.Made in 1978, hot off the blockbusting coat tails of Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Star Wars, spectacle-minded producers and audiences alike seem to have begun to forget that the most effective suspense came from what wasn't always being shown and what wasn't entirely understood, and that the imagination is able to conceive far worse than the objectification of a simple mechanical monster. Nevertheless, Szwarc centralizes the dismay by intercutting between the teenagers, Chief Brody, and the government's endeavors to save them, generating enough tension to keep us stimulated. So as a slasher sequel, it's not half bad.However, the aggravating and constantly screaming teenage characters don't make for very sympathetic victims. I'm resisting the temptation to compare them to the characters in the first movie, which wasn't just a horror movie but had a whole other level of male-bonding between these three unlikely partners who form a kind of diffident brotherhood on their mission. Jaws 2, as a stand-alone film, is not about making us fear for the victims but anticipating the now-traditional slasher-movie spectacle of screaming kids, flailing bodies and blood in the water. Even explosions and electrocutions. It's just not as disappointing because the scenes are so well-constructed as action set-pieces.By the same token, John Williams' pulsing theme music does return intact as a surviving main character from the first film. Here, Williams is broader in his leading tones of approaching terror, he makes more use of an orchestra, using longer single notes and tones for effect as well as the astoundingly famous alternating pattern of two notes. I don't like the sequel's score better than the predecessor's score, but I like how it's built upon, just as other enduring central characters have been.Coming full circle to the double-edged sword notion---and that is not a term I often use, by the way---Jaws 2 is inevitably going to be seen as an average movie because of the reflexive comparison to Spielberg's film. But let's look at Jaws 3-D and Jaws: The Revenge, two of the most deplorably stupid, utterly boring and shamelessly campy cash-ins one could ever stumble upon, two films that are only accessible in the mainstream because of their unfortunate affiliation with one of the most successful movies in American cinema history. Now look at Jaws 2, which by comparison is a vastly superior, very skillful and thoughtfully continuous shark attack film. It is the go-between flanked by the milestone which inspired it and the disasters which it inspired. Once again I can't get out of this hole with the double-edged sword thing. I suppose the verdict is that it's the best one can practically expect from a sequel to a turning-point film by a different director.",Jaws 2

The storyline follows the same Massachusetts small town in the first Jaws and the PTSD that went with the original experience.

This movie is directed by Jeannot Szwarc (Ironsides) and stars Roy Scheider (French Connection), Lorraine Gary (1941), Murray Hamilton (The Graduate) and Joseph Mascolo (Heat). The storyline tries to pick up nicely from where the last one left off but had too many recycled elements - like no one believing the sheriff despite the previous film, the mayor and sheriff not getting along, etc. I will give this film credit for doing a good job with more great underwater shots. They do a good job of presenting the family dynamic as well. There's also some fantastic horror elements in this including the helicopter scene and boat crash.

67,lukem-52760,"BEAUTIFUL & BEST SEQUEL IN CINEMA HISTORY, ROY SCHEIDER IS BRILLIANT!!!",10,26 August 2018,"Jaws 2 is an excellent film & that's a FACT!!!
Roy Scheider is a legend of cinema.
Of course it doesn't beat the original first film but that doesn't matter as Jaws 2 is still so much fun & is full of adventure & Horror.
Chief Brody is my favourite movie character ever & Roy Scheider is one of my top 5 favourite actors of all time. Scheider as Panicked Chief Brody has been such a huge important part of my movie world as i grew up obsessed with movies & that character was always there because of the impact the Jaws films had on me from a young age. Roy Scheider was a household name for me as well as Richard Dreyfuss, but Chief Brody always had a special place in my movie loving heart, a fantastic character brought to life by an outstanding performance from one of the best actors of the 70's, although he always seemed undervalued, Scheider was instantly cemented into Cinema history with his performance.I grew up watching all the Jaws films they really are big & popular films from most people's childhood so there's alot of Nostalgia for these films & i will admit Jaws & Jaws 2 are the best of the four films easily & Jaws 3 is still good silly fun & even Jaws the revenge is very good in my opinion again a film i have watched many times growing up.
Jaws 2 is a really well made sequel & feels & looks like the first Classic Spielberg film so that's cool & of course we have the brilliant ROY SCHEIDER back as Cheif Brody, i love that character & was my fave in the first film, Roy was a fantastic average joe blue collar actor with an intense presence & just so great to watch in anything & he always gives an excellent serious & intense performance as the scared & troubled Chief Brody, who is one of my all time favourite movie characters. In this fantastic sequel we get to spend nearly the whole movie with the great Chief Brody as this is his movie & doesn't have to share the screen with the great Richard Dreyfuss or Robert Shaw, here Scheider does some of his best acting as we see him as a loving family man who is having his worst Nightmare happening again. Scheider plays an ordinary man in very un-ordinary stressful situations perfectly, a truly outstanding actor & one of my top 5 fave actors. Scheider has always been a main face amongst my movie loving world & was one of the very first actors i ever sort of knew from very young along with Schwarzenegger, Bill Murray & Dan Aykroyd.
Everytime i see the great Roy Scheider in anything i get a nice warm Nostalgia feel for him as he's a guy I've watched for years since growing up watching the Jaws films & i also always loved him in Blue Thunder, The French Connection & even the 90's sci-fi series Seaquest, so yeah Scheider is a familiar & comforting face & screen presence to me. I also think Scheider is very underrated as he's as good as the likes of Pacino & Deniro but doesn't get the recognition they get?
Anyway I've been a Roy Scheider fan since very little with his Chief Brody character that remains His best work/role as an actor in my opinion.
Jaws 2 is ridiculously underrated & yet it's one of the greatest sequels ever made in my opinion!!! The movie looks great with beautiful cinematography just like the Classic first film & it's still full of fear & tension with it's Atmosphere, it's scary & tension filled Horror in a very ""Slasher"" style & feel. The Shark is terrifying & some scenes are scary as hell just like the first film.The music is also excellent in Jaws 2 & i really like the whole youngsters vs shark towards the end it felt like a fun summer slasher flick but with a big shark picking the kids off instead of Jason Voohees or something so really cool & really fun.
Any film starring Cheif Brody is gonna be great.So yes Jaws 2 is a perfect sequel to a classic & a big comfort having chief Brody back!!! A CLASSIC in it's own right, i have so much love for this excellent film it's underrated but BRILLIANT.",Jaws 2
68,JoeKarlosi,Jaws 2 (1978) **1/2,6,21 June 2005,"(Possible Spoilers)JAWS 2 has always been a strange sequel for me to rate. My first encounter with this much-anticipated followup to the classic original came at a Drive-In back in 1978. At the time I was 16 and a huge fan of the first movie, having seen it several times back when I was only 13. With a carload of teenagers around my own age, we took the summer drive one evening and watched the new sequel. I was greatly disappointed at the time realizing, even at that young an age, that this was an uninspired cash-in with no real story and a quickly contrived plot to utilize a group of know-it-all kids who are on a carefree sailing trip only to become fish food for the newest Great White shark. Subsequent viewings on home video never improved things that much, though I always maintained that Roy Scheider was exceptional in his return role as Chief Brody.Well, time has been kinder to JAWS 2 for me lately, and I've come to enjoy it enough on its own terms, even though it pales greatly in comparison to Steven Spielberg's classic. It's still got a weak script, and it's still contrived, but I've come to give the ""teen bait"" angle more of a free pass. I used to say that JAWS 2 and its teenage victim scenario was too much like a cheap slasher film cop-out, in the vein of a Friday THE 13th flick or something along those lines -- Take a group of irritating kids - throw 'em out there as fodder for the killer, and tally up the body count. But recently I got to thinking that when you really analyze it, the now-formulaic slasherfests were not even around when JAWS 2 made its theatrical debut. Even the first HALLOWEEN (the one that started it all) didn't come out until four months after JAWS 2's June '78 premiere - in October of the same year.A few years have passed since the last picture. Chief Brody is still on the job as sheriff at Amity Island, married to Lorraine Gary. Brody hears about two missing divers, and later two women who vanished during some sort of water skiing mishap. When he sees the chewed remains of a giant killer whale washed ashore, the chief feels a gnawing sense of deja vu and suspects he's got a second Great White on his hands. Retrieving the divers' camera at the bottom of the ocean and developing its film, Brody comes up with a photograph of bubbles and what appears to be the black eye of a killer shark.Once again he confronts Mayor Murray Hamilton (also back from part one) about his hunch, but is dismissed as paranoid. Brody's anxieties come to a head when he fires his gun on a crowded public beach, shooting up a school of bluefish he mistakes for a Great White. He then finds himself without a job and with two missing sons who have taken it upon themselves to go sailing with a group of other young friends against dad's orders. Way out on the ocean, the teenagers are being terrorized by this latest man-eater. Their tiny sailboats are getting smashed and at least one of their friends gets devoured. Even when a friendly helicopter pilot sets down to help out he finds his own aircraft being bitten and pulled under the surface where he meets his doom. It seems like all hope is lost until daddy Brody shows up in a stolen police boat and lures the shark to bite down on an electric power cable which puts a fiery finish on this dashed-off chapter of the JAWS saga.The real assets to the film are director Jeannot Szwarc (who inherited it when original director John Hancock retreated) and returning star Roy Scheider. As director, Szwarc does a capable job with the script he's got, making many scenes much more interesting than they otherwise might have been. Scheider had recently walked off THE DEER HUNTER and Universal agreed to forget about it if the actor would do the Jaws sequel. Once the studio offered to count this film as two for Roy, he reluctantly agreed. He gives a very good performance despite his misgivings for the project, and he's extremely effective as a tormented man at odds.The biggest problem with JAWS 2 is its script. While the whole business about Brody's nervous obsession is involving, little else is, really. Reportedly, Steven Spielberg and JAWS star Richard Dreyfuss wanted to participate, but they were committed to further work on CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND. So rather than wait it out, Universal wanted to go ahead with the sequel at any cost and what the price turned out to be was a great story. As it turned out, we got the aforementioned ""teens in peril"" approach, with a film aimed at a younger audience. JAWS 2 is not without merit; some of the shark sequences are well staged, and one scene that is especially chilling features Ann Dusenberry as a terrified teen found cowering inside her tiny boat after her boyfriend has just been eaten by the shark; it sends shivers down the spine. Yet the film just can't compete with the awesome power of the original, and in particular the marvels provided through the conflicting characterizations from Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw. **1/2 out of ****",Jaws 2
69,drystyx,Worst movie sequel ever made (and that's with stiff competition),1,2 January 2007,"Jaws 2 followed up a pretty good movie, with such a lousy sequel that it made the original look like a classic. I was pretty close to a teenager when it came out, and even then I thought it was a goofy portrayal of teenagers. It looked as though someone tried to create original real dialogue, but didn't know how to. Everything is very contrived, even to the point where the only non blonde girl teen is killed (courtesy of director-writer combo so neo Nazi that they couldn't even be sublime about it). During this era, however, it was probably impossible to produce a movie without killing some non-blonde woman. So although I count this as a spoiler, it really isn't, and it helps make the film lack any suspense, whatsoever. WE know which characters will be killed almost to a tee. Its pretty close to which is worse, this or Jaws 4. Both make you shake your head with the feeling that you're watching complete garbage and wasting your time. I give the nod to this one for being worse because of the one dimensional characters so bad the writers didn't even know they were one dimensional.",Jaws 2
70,slokes,We're Gonna Need A Bigger...Helicopter!?,5,6 September 2008,"""Jaws 2"" was an inevitable sequel, perhaps, but not a good one. Even by the standard of slasher sequels, for which ""Jaws 2"" is a forerunner, coming out earlier the same year as the first popular slasher-film hit ""Halloween"", it's only okay, and only after you sit through a great deal of boring exposition.Three years after a Great White fed off the human population of Amity Island, Sheriff Brody (Roy Scheider) could be forgiven for thinking it's safe to go back in the water. Little does he know a second shark has already begun eating divers around the shipwreck he escaped, and is making a beeline for his two young sons. He could even be forgiven for thinking it's personal this time.""Jaws"" was the great scare film of the 1970s, and the possibility for a ""Jaws 2"" that works is not far-fetched. So what if Great Whites don't really hold grudges, or take up station along the Eastern Seaboard? But the filmmakers this time seem so bent on delivering the thrills of the first film, they forget about the story and characters that made ""Jaws"" such a timeless adventure story.Give director Jeannot Szwarc credit for capturing the look of the first film, the sun-bleached sands and lapis-lazuli horizons that gave ""Jaws"" much of its vibrancy. He's no Spielberg, but he's not helming the same kind of first-class script. This time Brody's wife is working for a callous developer, and the focus for more than half the movie is on a group of teenagers who include the Brody offspring, growing faster than Chia pets.The film even recycles the friction between Brody and the Amity Town Council, never mind his saving the life of the son of Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) last time. This time, when Brody reports a killer whale carcass with suspicious shark-like bites, Vaughn shamelessly replies: ""Martin, don't press it this time."" Yeah, because you were so off-base last time.The problem with ""Jaws 2"", other than excess length, is it expects its audience to share Vaughn's amnesia. When Brody goes out on a boat in search of his sons, we're supposed to forget that he did this before, and not so stupidly alone. When he goes mano-a-mano with the Great White, we aren't to remember that this was exactly how ""Jaws"" went down, with a rifle instead of a power line.Scheider is good, though, playing the part with the needed extra brio to compensate some for the absence of Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. ""I know what a shark looks like, because I've seen one up close,"" he shouts, eyes agog. ""And you'd better do something about this one, because I don't intend to go through that hell again!"" Nice scenes, too, help lift the film on occasion. In one, Brody loses it when he thinks he spots the shark off a beachful of bathers (it's just a school of bluefish), and fires his revolver at it, pretty much ending his public-service career. But his youngest son is there to help him pick up the emptied cartridges in the sand.The final confrontation with the shark, which corners several young people off the coast of Amity, has its moments, too, though signs of desperation as well, none more than when the shark goes after a Harbor Patrol helicopter, taking it and its pilot out by chomping on one of its floating pontoon struts. Well, the first one took out a whole boat, I guess, but that time it was attached to the vessel with harpoon lines.There was no reason to make ""Jaws 2"" except for the money. Thirty years later, the sequel doesn't exactly reek, yet only serves to diminish the first film's considerable legacy.",Jaws 2

The plot has two major problems :- a) we've seen it all already, and b) no-one tells a story like Steven Spielberg. Since script writer Gottlieb was never going to be able to surprise his audience, he had to devise a way of scaring them more than they were in the 1975 film. His bid to present us with such a situation fails and we are left with a rather implausible and unsatisfactory finale.Production values are again good, John Williams pens another appropriate score whilst lead players Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton perform well.

However, in defense of ""Jaws 2,"" if you compare it to something like the slickly made recent shark attack film ""The Shallows,"" I have to say this film's shark sequences are far and away more effective. I believe it's because even though the shark in ""Jaws 2"" is clearly a mechanical prop, seeing something physical attacking the characters on open water is much more visceral of an experience than watching a CGI shark attacking Blake Lively. Overall, this is a satisfying enough of a thriller with a pretty exciting climax, even if it's nowhere as good as the original (although it's far better than parts 3 and 4).",Jaws 2
73,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"A sequel that entertains, while feeling rushed in places",7,15 November 2019,"It's been agreed upon many times that people should not mess with the classics. No matter what the genre, some original films do not require a story to continue further. While the occasional sequel lands on its feet and strikes a memorable chord, very few do and don't live up to the hype. Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) revolutionized the way people went out to see movies. But what also made the film successful was just how close to home the film hit viewers. The reason for this was that the villain (the shark) was depicted like any other shark in natural wild life, mostly. As the story neared its end, it did become increasingly strange how the ferocious meat eater was able to have such a complex memory bank. Aside from this though, the story felt grounded and quiet realistic in its intent making people all the more scared to venture into the sea.For the sequel, the story continues with Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) patrolling the beaches of Amity Island several years later. After a bunch strange occurrences where people end up missing, Brody begins to suspect a new shark has arrived in town. Meanwhile, his wife Ellen (Lorraine Gary), Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) and Len Peterson (Joseph Mascolo) try to keep things under control to the public. Also Brody's son Mike (Mark Gruner), who frequently uses his own sail boat is tempted to keep going out to sea thanks to peer pressure from his friends. Written by Carl Gottlieb (from the first film) and Howard Sackler (The Great White Hope (1970)), the script does a fairly decent job continuing the story. There are still parts though that make it not as effective as the original. Direction was headed by Jeannot Szwarc who would later direct the average spin-off Supergirl (1984).The execution of the story is fine, because there are several scenes that viewers will genuinely care for with the characters on screen. Seeing Roy Scheider (even though he regretted) and other cast members return was an appreciated welcome. It helps give the fans of the original, characters they can get behind. It also seems that Ellen Brody and Jeff Hendricks (Jeffrey Kramer) are stepping up in the public spotlight. There's even a reference to Matt Hooper from the original film. Instead, this time Collin Wilcox Paxton comes in as Dr. Elkins, to help Brody identify the shark. The parts the screenplay suffers from the most though are moments involving the shark's motivations. The actions are more out of character than the last beast. However, that does not mean it doesn't entertain. The other flaw is that some subplots are just left unfinished, just like the original in some ways.As for horror elements though, the scares are still there to some degree. Because this story is set in what is very much the real world, the peril certain individuals endure can be quite the experience and the acting from them is good too. Most of this goes to Mark Gruner and his other cast mates like Gary Springer, Donna Wilkes, Gary Dubin and Ann Dusenberry. Coming across a shark as big as the one from this or the original film would be very scary indeed. While there isn't as much dismemberment as the first film depicted, there's still blood and mangled corpses lying around. The effects were also just as great as the original. The shark no longer has that weird cheek flap over the bottom half of its mouth. There's also an easter egg to that of the Orca of the first film and a couple of pyrotechnic sequences for other visual flares.As for camerawork, Michael C. Butler worked to provide the look of this film. While he was in no relation to Bill Butler from the first film, the cinematography is practically equal to that of original. The underwater scenes are shot competently, showing the viewer all kinds of angles. And so is any scene above water with or without the shark, Music was also another great component to the entry. Composed once more by John Williams, the score revisits it's very familiar thumping tune as well as adding in new motifs for the sailing scenes and underwater ones. It's its own score in a way and again equally matches the original composition created years before. Even luckier for collectors was the fact that the score was re-released completely with all other tracks. A very nice set to have.Mostly, this sequel very much continues the intensity to that of its predecessor. The actors and the situations they get involved in are believable. The music is another classic addition and the camerawork is spot on to the original. The only problem this entry suffers from is more preposterous scenarios and maintaining the trend of not completing subplots.",Jaws 2
74,Sandcooler,It's not anything,4,6 April 2008,"If there's one rule to sequels, it's that everything should be bigger, louder, faster, gorier and with more flashing colors and stuff than the original. Same goes for rip-offs, if they're not the same thing altogether. Don't bother being original, because you have no talent. If you would have talent you wouldn't be making horror sequels. Jeannot Szwarc (that's barely a name) tries to put in suspense but in those thirty years, the fear has just been converted into boredom. Yes we know the shark is there and usually I know whether somebody dies or not. And if I'm proved wrong, I'm still more bored than surprised. Jaws is above blood and guts, which is too bad because there's not really anything else to offer, considering the serious pacing problems. People get killed off-screen, people just get dragged down, people have to wait forever to get killed, and the memorable scenes that should justify the cool poster are seriously lacking. It tries to be classy, like an adventure thriller but it's not. It doesn't try to be cheap horror but it should have. Extra points due to fairly realistic shark.",Jaws 2
75,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Didn't these nitwits learn *anything* from the events in the first film?,3,21 July 2014,"The original Jaws is one of my all time favourites, and has been for my entire life. I've watched it countless times, and l've even had the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen, in a re release in 2012. I spent my life, however, avoiding the sequels, not wanting to sully and tarnish the memory of the first film. I finally caved in last week, and watched all four of them on television. I'm not going to compare this film to Jaws III, or Jaws The Revenge, because those films had not been made at the time this film was released, so audiences couldn't say that in response to this film on its original release. Can you follow that? Apparently, many people commenting on this film can't.A lot of the original cast and crew (director Spielberg, Dreyfuss, and, initially, Roy Scheider) declined to participate this sequel that no one asked for to one of the most popular films ever released, so what could possibly go wrong with doing it anyway?Plenty. An overly self aware intro, in which two divers are surveying the wreckage of the Orca, serves as an early example of continuity porn. And was the shark swimming around the wreckage to celebrate the anniversary, like people celebrate anniversaries now for seemingly every event? Nearly twenty minutes elapse before anything of note happens, so the film takes its time getting started, and then once it has finally gotten up and running, it isn't worth the trouble. Four years after the events in the original film, another great white shark is stalking residents, specifically teenagers, in Amity, giving this sequel more of a slasher movie/ teens-in-peril feel than its suspense-filled predecessor had, and Scheider's character returns to battle with the shark again. But he was turned from an unlikely hero, an everyman, in the first film, to a sort of hybrid between Richard Dreyfuss' shark expert character from the first film, and a raving, gun- waving nut, in this second film, even firing wildly into the water (from on land) when he thinks a shark might be present. Part of the suspense in the first film was not knowing which one of the three men would kill the shark. But here, we know who it will be: Scheider's aforementioned raving and gun-waving nutjob hero. In his defense, Scheider does the best he can do with the subpar material, but he just doesn't have much to work with here. The shark scenes are mediocre, the climax is contrived and weak, and it all pales in comparison to the first film. Far too much time is given to showing us (lamely) what the original film only hinted at, and did so much better. The music score in the first film complimented the film itself, but here the music score is distracting, like it is trying to draw attention to itself and away from the film.The original film's screenwriters (Carl Gottlieb and Howard Sackler) were rehired to basically rewrite the highlights from the first film and replay them ad nauseam, and after a while, the whole ordeal looks more and more like a TV-movie ripoff of the first film, with elements of slasher flicks added.",Jaws 2

The victim who managed to scorch the Great White at the beginning of the film made the Shark more menacing & evil looking than the first film did.

77,Chase_Witherspoon,Rubbery sequel but still entertaining,7,2 May 2011,"An even larger Great White shark terrorises the Amity island community, this time threatening a group of teenage sailors who drift aimlessly after a collision, menaced from below by the fire-scarred white death. Roy Scheider returns to familiar territory, but this time without the benefit of the A-list co-stars that accompanied him on the last adventure; while there's plenty of familiar faces in the wings, it's surprising there weren't more ""name"" actors, considering the success of the predecessor. But then ""Jaws 2"" isn't a storyboard masterpiece, more a collage of attacks loosely woven into a beach party theme.Memorable for its water-skier scene, much of the production crew reunited for this effort, but the characterisations lack the depth of the original. Future soap-star Mascolo and Hamilton (reprising his role) are virtually interchangeable in their varying shades of obstinacy, while former studio stable-hands Collin Wilcox and Barry Coe are sorely wasted in frivolous bit parts. Gary Springer is perhaps one of the few younger actors who manages to make an impression, the rest look and act like virtual amateurs.As for the title star, technological advancements apparently took a hiatus in the three year interval following the original, the mechanical shark's rubber mouth bending vertically as it takes aim at a limp morsel dangling over the edge of a sailboat.Plenty of tension and just enough petrol in the tank to last the distance, if it wasn't for the inevitable comparisons with its older sister, ""Jaws 2"" could almost be a good movie in its own right. All in all, it's moody, suspenseful and professionally detailed with the finesse that one would expect from a big-budget Hollywood movie. Better than the average sequel.",Jaws 2
78,dunmore_ego,"New Shark, Old Story.",6,2 March 2009,"We know what's going to happen: you go in the water  you get eaten. Pretty much.A comedian once noted that reporters of shark attacks always sound surprised: ""A man was attacked by a shark at the beach today!"" Well, how surprising can it be if sharks live in the water? As Quint (Robert Shaw) said in the original and best JAWS (1976), ""Cage goes in the water, you go in the water, shark's in the water..."" The comedian noted he'd be surprised if there was a shark attack DOWNTOWN. Ipso facto, JAWS 2 spends so much time neck-deep in sea and surf it's no surprise everybody's getting eaten.Not directed by Steven Spielberg (rather, Jeannot Szwarc, who has the distinction of having one of his movies featured on MST 3K - CODE NAME: DIAMOND HEAD, which he directed just prior to JAWS 2 - some pedigree he brings to the table!), and missing two of the major characters from JAWS (Dreyfuss and Shaw), JAWS 2 was sunk before it was launched.Roy Scheider reprises his Sheriff Brody from JAWS (the only one who seems to be taking all this seriously - his acting job and his Sheriff's job), Lorraine Gary is still his blond-suffering wife, the mayor is still Murray Hamilton and he and his council elder nutjobs are still in-denial when a new killer shark threatens their tourist trade on Amity Island.There's no denying the events in the first movie happened, which makes the mayor even more incredibly insane - when Sheriff Brody alerts him to the new shark, he might as well be reading his sides from JAWS, as he poo-poos Brody's assertions and warnings. Has the man no short-term memory? The climactic threat this time is towards Brody's two young boys, one of them a typical 70's teen - anti-authority, bad hairstyle, terrible acting and worse looping.But we feel no sympathy for any of these people who have heard all the warnings, lived through the first shark frenzy in JAWS, and still insist on putting their warm, salty bodies in the open sea.They're just asking for it, in the same way this film can be described: ""EAT ME!"" --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",Jaws 2
79,pyrocitor,"""Gutted"" sequel offers vaguely clunky charm in lieu of originality",5,26 January 2010,"Just when you thought it was safe to trust that the newly founded 'blockbuster' film (a concept born from the incredible financial success of Steven Spielberg's classic Jaws) could justify its massive popularity by balancing a penchant for thrills and excitement with genuinely quality storytelling and vivid, compelling character development... of course there had to come the sequel. However, while subsequent entries in most horror franchises prove generally capable of matching up to the less than lofty demands of their predecessors, when following a film as universally revered as Spielberg's aquatic classic, inevitable shortcomings would seem near inevitable. However, shortcomings are one thing, but it would hardly seem too much to ask that a sequel at least muster the effort to generate a plot not exactly identical to that of its predecessor, but it would appear director Jeannot Szwarc somewhat missed the boat on said front, making Jaws 2 nothing more than a pale carbon copy at best.The real problem is that mirroring the exact narrative template of the first Jaws (shark arrives to terrorize Amity Island, Chief Brody's demands to close the beaches during busy tourist season lead to his isolation, but he is forced to protect the town against the shark regardless) comes across as ludicrous as well as lazy, making the town's unwillingness to take the shark threat seriously in the wake of the previous tragedy an almost farcical affair (a trope which could have been exploited for poignantly troublesome social critique in more capable hands). Furthermore, Swarc's plundering from Spielberg's film manages to neglect the original's interesting supporting characters (instead offering a tiresomely banal subplot involving the town teens, including Brody's sons), technical prowess and infectious sense of heart – in short, the attributes which made the original such an abiding classic. Instead, the flimsiness of the plot comes across as even more of an overt excuse for thrills, this time gorging on cheap shocks rather than the tastefully taut tension of its predecessor. Similarly, while Spielberg's unconvincing shark prop led to his genius innovation of largely hiding it from the audience, thus amplifying the sense of threat and dread, Swarc blithely exhibits his antagonist freely, undercutting any sense of threat by the sight of the visibly fake shark lumbering through the water like a rubber toy dragged by a string (particularly when drowsily attacking an aeroplane, an unfeasibly, 'need-to-see-it-to-believe-it' low point) and providing too docile and dopey an antagonist (apart from the fleeting excerpts of admittably thrilling real shark footage) to generate much fear, or much of a point.Nonetheless, in spite of such ample complaints, there remains a particular elusive charm about the film which remains somehow sufficient to continue to win the viewer's interest throughout. To his credit, Swarc gamely instills his film with a much needed sense of self-effacing humour (when Brody speculates on the latest shark attack being related to the previous incident at Amity, a marine biologist sternly replies ""sharks don't take things personally, Mr. Brody"" – if only she had been around to inform those responsible for the monstrosity that is Jaws: The Revenge), and generates a scattering of actual thrills and scares in the midst of shoddy special effects and mishandled emotional directing. Similarly, the film's script is (surprisingly enough) a relatively quality fare, counterbalancing the action with human drama well (albeit at a tryingly sluggish pace) and coughing up memorable lines here and there in the midst of things. While the film falls easily short of conventional movie-making standards, let alone the standards of the first Jaws, it is this strange sense of quirky charm and scattershot quality which somehow keeps it from warranting outright dismissal, particularly in the wake of the two downright abysmal further sequels to follow.While his return as gruffly lovable Police Chief Brody may have been ill-advised, Roy Scheider manages to be the film's single best attribute, rekindling an impressive quantity of the charisma, cheeky humour and surprising potential for grave drama (his drunken 'celebration' turned miserable self-reproach upon his being fired is viscerally affecting and memorable)which made him such a compelling protagonist in the first place. It is a pity that none of the rest of the cast can match up to his level, as most returning characters such as Lorraine Gary as Brody's long suffering wife and Murray Hamilton as the slightly more sympathetic yet still greedily tourism oriented Mayor appear largely on autopilot, offering bland and listless reprisals of previously intriguing characterisations. However, the worst is the film's excessive focus on the town teens (likely vying for a 'young, hip' viewing demographic), as the collection of stereotypical and uninspired performances and writing alike prove one of the film's greatest disservices.While it is easy to imagine Jaws 2 functioning as a perfectly functionable and mildly entertaining disposable suspense/adventure thriller in a cultural vacuum, its inexcusable re-hash of the framework of the first film make the rampant similarities far too irksome to properly appreciate the film's paltry collection of strengths. Nonetheless, the clunky but slightly more lighthearted retread of its predecessor makes Swarc's film an amiable watch nonetheless, but one in which the question ""why am I not watching the 'good' Jaws?"" is bound to inevitably surface countless times.-5/10",Jaws 2
80,areatw,An unimpressive and unnecessary sequel,5,9 August 2018,"As with many sequels to classic films, 'Jaws 2' is a big disappointment. Everything that made the first film so special is missing from the sequel. It's flat, slow, lacking in ideas and originality, and the tension just isn't on the same level as the first film. The storyline was never going to be as good, but I still expected something a lot better. It feels very safe and uninspired, in contrast to the original which took so many risks.You can't help but judge this film against its predecessor, which is probably why it has so many negative votes. Judging it on its own merits, it's certainly not a bad film and is still quite enjoyable. Obviously when a film is a huge success, as 'Jaws' was, a sequel is inevitable, but given how unique and memorable the original was, subsequent films weren't really necessary. 'Jaws 2', while not bad in its own right, isn't good enough to justify a sequel.",Jaws 2
81,TheUnknown837-1,"sequels are rarely ever a patch on the original, many sequels are mediocre",5,18 July 2007,"The first ""Jaws"" is, in the opinions of many people, one of the finest movies of all time. It broke box office records, became the most successful film of all time and held that record for two years, and is still today regarded as a classic and one of the most terrifying and chilling horror films in the history of motion pictures. It is of no surprise that with a film that successful that the producers would want to throw in a sequel or two to cash in our the success of Steven Spielberg's epic masterpiece. This is typical studio behavior and as a result, ""Jaws 2"" was a film that was quickly rushed into production, thrown together quickly, and is overall not a patch on the original film. Not that it could have been if more effort was put into it, but ""Jaws 2"" is overall a mess. It's not a terrible movie and is far better than ""Jaws: the Revenge"", but is a mediocre horror film and is neither frightening nor compelling.Thankfully, one of the positive aspects about this film is that we have many of the cast from the first film returning to reprise their roles. Including Academy Award-nominee Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary, and Murray Hamilton. All three of these are wonderfully talented actors and actresses and excel in their roles almost as much as in the original. The down part is that they don't get their great moments again. Murray Hamilton's part almost seemed unnecessary, for his character does very little in the film and is not developed very well. Roy Scheider, once again playing Police Chief Martin Brody, did well at his job and the screenplay was designed to keep him showing fear for sharks and not so much fear for the water as a homage to his last lines from the first ""Jaws"". Lorraine Gary does not really fit quite as well as Ellen Brody as she did in the first film, again, because of the weak development. Her character was given more screen time here, but did not work out all that well.As for our new members of the cast, they are mostly a large group of teenagers who instead of driving cars, like to take small sailboats and sail recklessly across the Atlantic Ocean. And as you might expect, some of them will come upon our antagonist, another fearful great white shark, who also gets shown on screen a lot, as a result, making it less frightening and more revealing. Its attacks on the teenagers, in fact, it's attacks on all of its victims are not unexpected and only once in the film do we really get a moment where we MIGHT jump a bit with shock. The responses of the sailing teens is always the same: hysterical screaming, pandemonium, shouting, and one of them getting chomped. These characters get very little development and we really couldn't care less for any of them when they get eaten. We don't even remember their names or really remember anything about them. And unfortunately, the ones who get eaten are mostly the ones who we get annoyed by the least.As I stated before, the shark in ""Jaws 2"" is shown at a much greater deal than the shark from the first film. This shark is probably a bit more realistic than the first one, but is overall, not a very frightening villain. Not concerning its looks, but just the way it is handled. The way it attacks after a not very suspenseful moment, how we always have plenty of warning before it attacks and know exactly when and where, we can tell when it's going to fail in its attack, and so on and so forth. And too much footage was used of real sharks, which differ quite greatly from the mechanical shark, so that you can easily tell they are two different techniques. Unlike in the first ""Jaws"", where the combined live action and mechanical sharks worked out to great the illusion of this killer, terrible animal that hunts and kills mercilessly.""Jaws 2"" is a mediocre sequel, however it is watchable. Like I said, it was created simply to cash in on the success of the first ""Jaws"", so that the studio could make more money, which they did. But I was kind of hoping for a film with more suspense, thrills, and creativity put into it. Basically, it's an okay horror film with a fairly good John Williams music score in the background.",Jaws 2
82,baumer,"Nothing will ever compare to JAWS, but this is a great sequel",9,28 June 1999,"It's strange, I wonder how this film would have been received if it was directed by Spielberg instead of an unknown. Because this film is about as intense as they come. Granted, it lacks in the personal relationships and that is what made Jaws such the classic that it is. We all know that there is no way a sequel to Jaws could ever live up to what we experienced with Jaws, but this film is about as scary as they come.Here, I must admit that the characters take a back seat to the shark. But is that necessarily wrong? We have already seen the shark in the first one so the mystery is gone, so now the only thing to do is make sure the audience is scared out of their minds. And that I can assure you is done with just as much perfection and attention to detail as the original. Take for example the opening scene where two divers are looking in the Orca ( Quint's sunken ship from the first film ). They are playfully taking pictures in front of the sunken ship. Then suddenly, a shot from behind them, and the ominous music. You know they are going to be eaten, but the scene is done with so much tension and perfect pacing that you are scared all over again. And when the shark finally does strike, we experience that primal emotion all over again.The story is a fairly simple one but affective at the same time. Brody ( Roy Scheider ) is convinced there is another shark in the waters off Amity and he is having a hard time convincing the town idiots that he is right. But this time his two sons are a little older and they will be involved in the final confrontation with the shark.There is one other scene that I wanted to point out and that is a scene where a picture is being developed. Brody is given a camera of the missing divers from the beginning. The developer then tells him that the pictures are about to be processed. As he stands in the red room, waiting for the pictures to develop, he knows. He has that feeling. Something is going to show up on the picture. And sure enough we see it. The mouth. The black, doll-like lifeless eye appears in the corner of the frame and Brody knows. He knows what it is. This is such a powerful scene in the film and it is directed with such skill that it looks like it could have been directed by Spielberg. I think Jaws 2 is a great film and it is just as scary if not a little scarier than the first, but what it lacks is that it's characters don't have time to develop. We don't care as much about these ones as we did about Hooper and Brody and Quint to some degree. But that is a small detail, because the film does it's job and that is to scare us. Look for one more scene where Tina and her boyfriend are boating by themselves. It will stay with you for quite some time.Maybe if this was Spielberg's film he would have done something different. But the one thing he couldn't do is to make it more of a frightening experience than it is. So that is a compliment to Szwarc, I just wonder what happened to him. Because he has a vision and a style that is very reminiscent to Spielberg's original. If you haven't seen this by now, treat yourself to the first one and then watch this one right after. Especially to all the young people that are on the IMDb, Jaws is a classic piece of film making and I have said that it is the best film ever made, and it is. But if you want to be scared, Jaws 2 will fulfill that need just as well as the first and better than any film that has come out in the 90's.And finally, has there ever been a better tagline in the history of motion pictures? Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...... Brilliant.",Jaws 2
83,mentalcritic,Ho hum,6,12 February 2005,"Even in the 1970s, when a film was successful enough to have made a profit, a sequel was something of an expectation. Sequels have long had a reputation for being a lesser copy of the original. Exceptions have sprung up over the years: Aliens and X-Men 2 come to mind, but Jaws 2 is definitely not one of them. If anything, Jaws 2 is a rather mediocre retread of the original. This is understandable, given that most of the talent that made the original such great shakes is conspicuously absent here. Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary, and Murray Hamilton return for this retread, but I am racking my brain trying to remember instances of the other cast members having acted in anything before or since.Since the surprise factor of the original is also gone, Jaws 2 goes straight for the throat, leaving behind any and all subtlety. As a result, every shark terror scene is stretched out further than it needs. As a result of that, scenes that should be terrifying become boring. The dramatic tension created by Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw is conspicuously absent here. Indeed, about the only link this film has with the original, cast members aside, is that the opening diving scene supposedly takes place around the wreckage of the Orca.Strangely enough, Jaws 2 is almost the same length as the original, and yet so much less happens during its running time. This leads me to believe the comment I read previously was right when the author stated the best of the Jaws sequels is still boring. Unlike the latter two sequels, which do not even reach the hundred minute mark, every scene in Jaws 2 seems to be distended. Whether this is sloppy writing or an attempt to pad out the running time is probably beside the point.In spite of missing a few actors from the original, and the fact that one is hard-pressed to remember a singular new character as the credits roll, Jaws 2 feels overcrowded. In fact, the ease with which one forgets members of the cast probably stems in part from the overcrowded status of said cast. The fact that the emphasis has shifted from the humans hunting the shark to the shark itself probably doesn't help matters. I think it should be entered into the laws of film-making that in creature features, the filmmaker should be kept aware at all times that the creature is not the main focus. The people are. If you need any better proof of this than the difference between Jaws and Jaws 2, try taking a look at Aliens and Alien: Resurrection.Another way of looking at Jaws 2 is that it is a more personal film than the original. This is fair enough, since Brody's family and livelihood are more threatened by the shark. Unfortunately, since the care with which Brody was made to seem like a three-dimensional character is absent from this sequel, it also runs the risk of ringing hollow. Those who have not seen the original, and I know there are a few of you out there, will simply forget that the Brody family or Mayor Vaughn have a second dimension. I know I certainly did from time to time.I am giving Jaws 2 a six out of ten. It has its moments, but it seems rushed in spite of having a three-year gap between it and its predecessor. It is too good to fit into the so-bad-its-funny level of the latter two sequels, and it is too bad to warrant repeat viewings. It might be worth renting once.",Jaws 2
84,vip_ebriega,We've got another shark problem.,6,7 February 2007,"My Take: A huge step-down from the first, but definitely not an awfully bad sequel as it might have. (This is an extended version of the review I wrote on February 2007)If there's one thing bad about JAWS is that it spawned a series of sequels that try so hard to duplicate the success the original, that they tarnish the goodness. The aptly-titled JAWS 2, the first among these follow-ups, is not nearly as bad compared to where the series has fallen, but where else could all this possibly start? This sequel to the blockbuster-hit classic ""Jaws"" lacks the right pacing unlike the first. Moves a bit slow and almost all the shark attacks take place in the second half. But still, this sequel is a distance from the oblivion JAWS: THE REVENGE has reached. Roy Scheider reprises his role from the first film, and manages to be a fine. His heroic battle in the last parts was especially exciting. The film also has another good scene where the shark sinks the rescue helicopter (who even knew he could do that?) . But still, some parts show great suspense like the first film. But all is occasionally worn down by some blah human dimension that only wears down the pacing. Not even some effective performances can save these slow scenes.

As Connor MacLeod said, 'There can only be one', which also applies to this movie. They should have caught on by the poor reviews at the time and buried 'Bruce', instead of copying, ""Planet of the Apes."" It is over and was over back in 1975. I wish the studios had taken their stinking paws off this epic, and had come up with more original thought. The original is, without question, one of Steven Spielberg's crowning achievements. The cast was perfect, the directing was perfect, the scenery was perfect, the musical score was perfect and even the boat, 'The Orca' was perfect (and yes, they did need a bigger boat). With that said, why in the world would anyone want to make a sequel (and then another, and then another, and then another.)? I know some may think these movies get scarier sequentiallyno that is wrong, they do not. They progressively sink to the lowest or low. Granted, as good as the first one is, the storyline, when dissected, is kind of lame. But come-on, this is Hollyweird, the job in Tinsel Town is to entertain and lame is the name of the game. I found ""Jaws 2"" not to be entertaining in the least. This fiasco ended up being a very irritating follow-up. Sadly, ""Jaws 2"" fostered several un-scary sequels. Nothing (excepting the surviving cast-members and theme song) is memorable about this poor copy. If you need a nap, watch this jokejust don't wake everyone up with your snoring.",Jaws 2

The first 30 mins is plodding, there's a decent shark attack, Roy Scheider gets paranoid (the films highlight) resulting in himself getting fired form the police force, then both his sons go boating against his wishes then guess what happens? There's a lack of ideas, lack of excitement/tension and it's about 20 mins too long, but on the plus side Scheider is good and it is quite well made, its just a little too redundant for its own good.",Jaws 2
87,TOMASBBloodhound,"Competent, yet totally unnecessary.",7,9 April 2006,"It only figured that multiple sequels would be spawned from (at the time) the most financially successful film in history. Jaws 2 was not the least bit necessary in terms of story and character development. It's merely an opportunity to put the lives of numerous young characters in jeopardy before our hero from part one (Scheider) can paddle to their rescue. The film is technically well-done, and the action somewhat compelling. This film also made a fortune, but it had nowhere near the commercial or critical success of the original.First of all, the acting talent of Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss is sorely missed. They tried to write the Matt Hooper character back in, but Dreyfuss was in the midst of shooting Close Encounters with Spielberg, rendering his physical participation out of the question. Roy Scheider is back, though. And once again he proves that he is in fact a hell of a good actor. He's the kind of guy whose character you always end up rooting for. This time we see a darker side of his Chief Brody. Convinced there is a new shark in the waters off Amitty, he presses the point so vigorously that he is fired from his job. Keep in mind, the same mayor (Hamilton) is still in office, and he's not the kind of guy who wants his beaches closed for any reason.Despite losing his job, Brody is once again forced to dispose of the killer great white before it devours his teenage son's friends and their sail boats. The film has some good stunt work, and some memorable shots of the killer fish. There is decidedly less blood shown in this one. The original barely escaped and R-rating, and they were obviously not going to chance that again. There are still plenty of frightening scenes, though. French director Jeannot Szwarc is no Spielberg, but he does a decent enough job with the material. John Williams' music still rings true.Speaking of the material, that's the film's weak spot. Sharks do not behave like killers in a slasher movie. They don't use strategy to hunt down their victims like the sharks in these movies. A great white shark is a powerful and dangerous predator, but humans are generally not on its menu. Jaws 2 is however, miles above the next two sequels in the series. Part 3 had only the 3D gimmick to fall back on. Part 4 is hardly worth mentioning unless you like to laugh at really, really bad films.7 of 10 stars for Jaws 2.The Hound.Added Feb 14, 2008: RIP Roy Scheider!",Jaws 2
88,gab-14712,Missing that Spielberg Magic!,7,18 October 2017,"Jaws. The movie that is often given the notion of starting the summer blockbuster season. It was a magnificent achievement that Steven Spielberg's film became a critical and monetary success. It was a tense thriller that relied upon hiding the shark until the end and its three main leads in Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw. So naturally a sequel would have to be made. Understandably so, I scratch my head at the thought of a sequel. But it doesn't matter because Jaws 2 does exist. I'll say this. It's the best sequel you could hope to makebut that is not saying much. The movie is sometimes enjoyable, but there are several critical mistakes in the movie.But let's start with the positives. The shark has returned, and it came back bigger and stronger than ever. The shark even has an evil-looking scar to it. I really liked the look of the shark. The performances weren't too bad, either. Out of the original cast, only Scheider, Lorraine Gary, and Murray Hamilton returned. Scheider had problems on set, but he tried his best to give a convincing performance as Chief Martin Brody. Once again, he succeeds. After all, he is now the human heart of the franchise. Next, I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the film. The buildup and tension to the reappearance of the shark is as good as ever. You really know that the shark is there to kill. John Williams returned with another amazing score. He used the original themes to great extent, and he added darker, more complex music to enhance those themes. I don't think this movie would work half as well without his powerful score.Now, the negatives. I mentioned that I liked the look of the shark. I do not like how and when the shark fully emerged, which was practically right away. The whole point of the first Jaws was to keep the shark in the shadows, to build tension. Now tension was effective here, but it could have been way better if they followed the formula of the first film. So the first film was mainly a psychological thriller. While that is retained for the first half, the second half becomes a dumbed down slasher film. Essentially, the second half was the kids (including Brody's son) versus the shark, and it played out like a worn-out teen horror flick. That is something I did not want to see. Finally, I missed the direction of Spielberg. He decided not to return, and Universal decided to attain the services of Jeannot Szwarc. He did an okay job, but he is no Steven Spielberg. You can tell there is a big difference in the directing style, and I'm not sure if I liked that change. I do miss what Shaw and Dreyfuss brought to the table, but Scheider managed to deliver a strong performance.Now let's talk some plot. This sequel takes place four years after the original horrors of Amity. One day, the town suddenly receives mysterious disappearances and boating accidents. Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) knows better than to call them accidents. He believes another killer shark has come to town. Just like before, he is ignored by the townsfolk and Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton). But once a group of teenagers, including Brody's son, sets out to sea, Brody goes after them. Will he reach them before its too late? So I had apprehensions for a long time watching this film because I fear it would not live up to the original classic. While it certainly does not, I won't deny it's a fun ride at times and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Let's put it this way. Jaws 2 is a decidedly inferior sequel to the original, but can be called a masterpiece compared to the two pile of dung sequels that followed (and I refuse to see). There are elements of the film I dislike, but this is good escapist cinema..if you don't compare it to Jaws.My Grade: C+/B-",Jaws 2
89,afonsobritofalves,It's not even that bad.,7,13 September 2018,"This movie is a very criticized film, but I even liked it. Of course it's not as good as the first movie, but it's even good.
He had good actors, a good story, good characters and special effects were better than the first film; Although many scenes are unnecessary, the shark does not appear very much, and the shark often does not act at the right time. I recommend (although ther are better movies).",Jaws 2
90,Atreyu_II,Fails to repeat the magic of the original,6,24 March 2011,"First of all, I have never seen 'Jaws 3' and 'Jaws 4', and frankly, I don't intend to. Nevertheless, I wanted to see at least 'Jaws 2'. Even though I already imagined that it wouldn't be as good as the legendary original, I gave it the benefit of doubt to see how it compared. Sure, the original is a legend and it would be very difficult to repeat the greatness of that one - that is the cross carried by most sequels to awesome movies. 'Jaws 2' is an okay movie, not great but also not bad. It's watchable but it won't exceed the boundaries of time.Nevertheless, for good and for bad, on one hand this is more of the same and on the other hand it is different enough. But admittedly it lacks the same charm.Here the shark is slightly bigger, more dangerous, more sudden on its attacks, stronger, more resistant and quicker than the original's. Also, the movie has more shark attacks and the shark is introduced from the start. And yet the original film feels strangely scarier. How to explain this? What is the secret of the original? This happens because on the original, the shark is slowly introduced, which accents the mystery towards the great beast. The unseen enemy is scarier and more unpredictable on when and how it will attack (and what will it do). Plus, the original movie has that creepy John Williams's score when the shark shows up. Yes, the same music is on this one either, but it was modified for 'Jaws 2'. The result of that musical metamorphose was cool but not as good as the original.The shark here still looks a bit like a rubber shark but it doesn't look as frightening and as intimidating as the previous. This film takes place 4 years after the horrifying events from the original. Roy Scheider reprises his role as Chief Brody and is great once again, however the actor had many conflicts with the director during filming, he was unhappy with it and reluctantly reprised his role. Also back are Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife and Murray Hamilton as Mayor Larry Vaughn but it wasn't directed by Spielberg this time. Brody's sons are already bigger. Sean is still a kid but Michael is a teenager. They aren't portrayed by the same actors. Why? I don't know, but I think they should have been played by the same kids from the original.I have to say that the Mayor Larry Vaughn continues to be the same prick as usual. He didn't learn anything from that tragedy. Even after the previous events, after seeing that Brody was right all the time and after Brody ends up being the one who saves the situation, he has the same attitude here. He won't close the beaches for anything in this world, all he cares about is his honey and this time Brody even loses his job thanks to the Mayor and his people. They simply refuse to listen to Brody and only see what they wanna see. Even the residents of Amity Island ignore Brody's wise advices.There are boring moments in this film. The best part is the ending because that's when it becomes intense and suspenseful. The end of the shark, while not as memorable as on the original, was also awesome: WOW, that is one heck of a shock the shark gets! It bites a power cable and gets electrocuted, catches fire, gets completely roasted and sinks like a ship. Creepy! On the original film, I don't have much to complain about the characters, including those with minor roles. But this one has too many obnoxious teen characters with awful haircuts and the screams of some of them really got on my nerves.Matt Hooper is greatly missed here. He never appears, they only make one or two references to his name. Also greatly missed is Quint but he couldn't be here because he dies on the first one. Even if Quint had survived, the actor Robert Shaw died in the same year 'Jaws 2' was released.",Jaws 2

Great filming and I loved how the shark is made out of mechanics, they did a great job in making it look real. The movie is a little slower then the first in the fact that it has less action. The shark attacks are less gory and showing compared to the first Jaws movie. One nice thing is that the movie changes it game by taking the shark attack to the open ocean instead of off the shore. Over all I found it another exciting Jaws film and was happy with how it was done.",Jaws 2
92,EijnarAmadeus,Cheesy summer-fun,6,19 July 2006,"Only three years after Spielberg's blockbuster-success Jaws 2 hit the cinemas. And everybody's back, the crew and the famous soundtrack, but the play-maker's gone; Steven Spielberg. He made the first one so thrilling and brilliantly simple and effecting, this second installment has lost it's genius touch and only achieves it's goals by playing it safe and following many basic rules of making a thriller entertaining. Picking up three years after the original it finds the Amity Island free of concerns and troubles, and it's not been a shark-problem since whatsoever. But out of the blue a killer-shark arrives the beaches and starts his summer-vacation, this forcing Martin Brody to again go mano-o-mano with the great white.Jaws 2 has got some simple qualities; some scenes are campy fun, for example in one particular scene where a woman's water-skiing and behind her the infamous fin comes up threw the surface, hunting her without her even noticing - and the cheesy fun is always in the right place in such a empty sequel as Jaws 2 is. There's obviously no depth to it, and that's totally okay as this is being a summer-movie; and Jaws 2 makes some fun, and though it's not really scary or chilling, it's the pure entertainment that keeps it some better than the two others to come.",Jaws 2
93,tonypeacock-1,Early franchise cinema is watchable average,6,11 August 2021,"Jaws sequels always seem to be frowned upon for two reasons:
a) The original 1975 Steven Spielberg directed Jaws was so damn good and b) the sequels on the whole (and I've only seen shark bait portions past 2 are so pap!)
However if this film is judged on its own merits and if it was more standalone and made a few years later it would be more lauded much like shark films I have seen more recently such as The Shallows which rips off some elements of this.Several cast members return in this sequel. Sequels weren't as commonplace in 1978 as today I suppose so that was good.However Spielberg doesn't direct. Directing duties fall to Jeannot Swarc who I have never heard of but does a respectable job.Again the film centres on the resort of Amity Island and the embattled police chief Brody (Roy Schieder).After several mystery deaths near Amity, Brody begins to smell a Great White may be on the loose again.The odious Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) again displays agitation at Brodys antics much as he did in the original (I've already broken my pledge not to compare to the original!).Brodys own children are the centrepiece I suppose this time. Just how will he react when he finds out they may be in danger from the killer beast?What follows is a deadly game of shark and annoying seventies kids floating on rafts and overturned boats near some cable junction.Cable junction is a small island that supplies power from the mainland to Amity via a series of high voltage underwater cables.It is via one of these cables that Brody entices the shark and it meets a nice death being zapped at several thousand volts to a John Williams score!A respectable film in its own right but not up to the heights of the original.

94,grahamsj3,"Without Spielberg, not as good",6,30 January 2003,"This sequel is, like most sequels, not quite up to the original. Of course, the original was directed by Steven Spielberg and this one was not. Don't get me wrong, this film is still pretty darn good, but it lacks the punch of the first one. Perhaps it's because the viewer already has an idea of what to expect, so this film doesn't have the shock factor that was present in Jaws. The cast is largely the same, at least the principal characters, and the story is nearly as strong as the original. I believe that the first one was so great because of the suspense of being in that scenario for the first time. The second time around, it becomes far less intense and the film suffers because of that. This film is far from ho-hum, though. I don't mean to imply that this is a boring story, because it certainly isn't! This one, judging by the rating number being considerably lower than the original, just didn't strike the same chord as the original. Few sequels do. This film is good, but not great.",Jaws 2

96,ofpsmith,"It's okay, but if you want a good movie, watch the first one.",7,12 July 2015,"Jaws 2. Often regarded as the best of the Jaws sequels. That of course isn't much of a brag. Okay, the film isn't that bad. But when you compare it to the original, this one just seems flat and lazy. The plot is that another shark is terrorizing the beaches of Amity Island, Massachusetts. So Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) has to go deal with him again. But Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) doesn't want Martin to make this public because it will hurt publicity. It sounds like the first movie but here Vaughn and Len Peterson (Joseph Mascolo) get so fed up with Martin that they fire him and replace him with Deputy Jeff Hendricks (Jeffrey Kramer). But Martin's fears of the shark are proved correct when the next day when his sons Mike Brody (Mark Gruner) and Sean Brody (Marc Gilpin) are sailing and they get attacked by the shark with Mike's teenage friends. Martin climbs up on Hendricks's boat to go save them. The problems with this movie lie mainly in the story. It's mainly a repeat of a lot of the elements in the first film. And what's different about it, is still nothing new. Just a bunch of teenagers in trouble. That we see enough of. Also because it's a sequel it's just not as scary or suspenseful as the first. I watched this movie knowing it was going to be like that and those standards are met. But overall it's an okay movie. If you're curious go see it.",Jaws 2

98,DarthVoorhees,Unsurprisingly lacking but has glimmers of goodness,7,3 February 2012,"'Jaws 2' is an unsatisfying sequel to a masterpiece, no surprises there. I mean how can you follow up a film like 'Jaws' without engaging in silliness? I'm not surprised in the least that Universal wanted to cash in on the popularity of 'Jaws' with a sequel. It's a hard act to follow. As far as unnecessary sequels go though 'Jaws 2' has some charm and is competently made with thrills that pack some punch to them. It's problem though deals with it's total lack of interesting characters besides Roy Scheider's reprisal as Brody.'Jaws' was a great film because of it's characters and how we cared for them. The dialogue, chemistry, and the acting between Shaw, Scheider, and Dreyfus elevated that picture. The fact is the rubber shark in 'Jaws 2' actually looks better in a lot of ways than the shark in the first one. I know a great deal of people credit Spielberg for saving the shark for the last act of the film but I think what adds to that is that the characters are stranded where they cannot get help and are at their most dangerous moment. 'Jaws 2' has that moment too. The Brody boys and their friends are trapped in the middle of the ocean with a shark circling in on them, it is a frightening scenario. What it is missing though is well developed and acted characters. Scheider isn't trapped on the water here and so we have to fear for these under developed characters. I didn't. A great deal of them play like something from a bad 'Friday the 13th' rip off. While horrible things happen to them we just aren't as pulled in to care for their survival. It's a miserable combination of bad dialogue and acting. The scenario is pretty frightening and I think had Spielberg been in the director's chair with a polished script it would have been quite memorable. The film just feels so anti-climatic in comparison to 'Jaws' and it no doubt has to do with the characters because the film tries newer and bigger things to do with its shark.Scheider makes this film work on a certain level. One of the high points of the film is that he is the only character who has changed from his experiences from the first film. Scheider doesn't play Brody in the same way, he's bolder and far more paranoid. I really like seeing this aspect of the character and the performance. Of course we know a great white is terrorizing Amity again but I like the fact that Scheider's Brody compounds the fears to new manic levels where we can see why Amity residents might think this guy is a little unhinged. I think this aspect of the character certainly should have been explored more. It would have added more psychological thrills to the story and it would really give Scheider a stronger role to explore. I would have loved to have seen them explore Hooper in this way as well. Universal should have tried much harder to get Dreyfus back. Besides Scheider everyone else's' character is a carbon copy of their role in one. The fact that Mayor Vaughn got elected to a second term is pretty astounding and of course his first response is boating accidents. Brody's wife Ellen is a bore and expanding her character didn't help the film at all. We'll be seeing more of her later on in the series...All in all 'Jaws 2' is a flawed film but it has some merit to it. I think it has merit and with a more competent director and script it could have been a truly great sequel. I think the film will definitely appeal to fans of Scheider's Brody because it does explore this great character a little more.",Jaws 2
99,virek213,A Very Tough Act To Follow,7,24 January 2002,"Given its extremely intense combination of terror, drama, suspense, and actin, it is not surprising that JAWS should be such a tough act to follow. Nor should it be surprising that the three sequels that followed were more and more like let-downs than real movies.  JAWS 2, however, manages to have at least a little bit of panache to it, even though Spielberg, who had been busy making CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND at the time, was too busy to helm this movie.  Instead, the director was Jeannot Szwarc, whose credits included the weird 1975 horror movie BUG.It is three years since Amity's police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) had an uncomfortably close encounter with a 25 foot-long Great White shark.  But now, a couple of divers investigating the wreck of the Orca have disappeared, and so it's not surprising that the chief senses trouble.  A woman is then killed in a boating accident within a few hundred yards from shore.  And when a whale gets beached with more than a few teeth marks in its skin, Scheider is very sure that there is another Great White shark in the water.Unfortunately, Scheider is once again unable to do his job in protecting public safety because the mayor (Murray Hamilton) is too interested in the lucrative real-estate developments taking place on the island.  Instead of caving in to the pressure from Hamilton and a greedy business tycoon (Joseph Mascolo), even after being fired, Scheider takes matters into his own hands. And when the shark starts to go after the island's teens, including his two sons, it becomes a personal matter.  An attempt to rescue a group of teens stranded on a boat close to a lighthouse ends in failure when the rescue chopper is consumed by the shark.  But Scheider comes in and leads the shark to chew into the underwater electrical cable, electrocuting the fish.Would JAWS 2 have been as good as the original if Spielberg had been the one in the director's chair, instead of Szwarc?  Almost certainly.  It is perhaps pointless, however, to compare the two directors because it is clearly a lop-sided comparison.  JAWS 2 has more improbable moments than the original, but it does have moments where the suspense is fairly palpable, including one of the teens (Ann Dusenberry) urging her boyfriend to get back in the boat when she spots the shark approaching him in the water.  John Williams returns with another very good score, and Scheider is, of course, at his very best in his second and final turn as Brody.One would have hoped the Carl Gottlieb/Howard Sackler screenplay would have given Scheider and the rest more to work with; but given the ludicrousness of this film's two successors, it does more than anticipated.  So, while it is certainly not at masterpiece status like the first one was, JAWS 2 still warrants a rating of '7'.",Jaws 2

The screenwriter made a huge mistake shoving them all into the script. Who in their right mind thought that a dozen obnoxious, and totally interchangeable kids whose names we can't even remember, would make for good protagonists? The original 'Jaws' had focus: three well developed characters with interesting dynamic between them. Here we have a dozen non-descript kids no one gives a damn about. This is the biggest problem with the script. There are other problems, but they pale in comparison. Screaming kids in tiny boats were never a good idea. The only good scenes are with Roy Scheider, but he has little to do this time around. We get to watch kids sail for an hour. And still remember only one or two names. The ending is predictable and not as exciting as the one in the first film. One glaring mistake that boggles the mind: Why would Scheider send his deputy back home and drive the boat alone, even though it was his deputy that knew how to operate it properly and was familiar with the geography of the area? Because it was convenient for the script. Why did the radio stop working on the boat? Same reason.",Jaws 2
106,baileycrawly,It was Good,6,17 July 2020,"Jaws 2 is, surprisingly, not as bad as you would think a sequel to a near-perfect film without the original director on board would be. In fact, despite its faults, it's not a horrible movie at all.
The issue with this movie lies in the first 2/3 of the thing. It's great in the sense that they managed to get some of the original cast together (although the exclusion of Richard Dreyfuss is a definite downer), but it spends a lot of time further developing the recurring characters in a story that is almost completely filler. Of course, it's redundant to just make a movie that's completely about the shark, but this particular project might've been more successful if they had gone with an entirely different cast and developed a story around them.
That being said, once you get past that character development,, you get a thrilling film that is on par with the original. It's a group of young adolescents facing up against the shark this time, and the suspense is exactly on point for what it needs to be. Of course, the iconic score makes a return, once again providing a warning of the oncoming danger.This movie wasn't a terrible movie. It wasn't even a bad movie. However, when you make a sequel to a movie as prestigious and perfect as Steven Spielberg's Jaws, you're ultimately setting yourself up for failure. There's no way anyone else could ever come close to topping the genius of Spielberg and to even try is redundant. It's a good film, but it's not a great sequel",Jaws 2

Jaws 2 is a mixed bag. It's not even in the same stratosphere in terms of quality to the original but it does have its moments.
These are down to the return of Roy Schieder as Chief Brody and a handful of other returning cast.
This movie has a similar look and feel to the original film due to being shot in the same location and not having too many years pass by before the sequel arrived.
John Williams returned to compose the score and this helps elevate the overall movie.
Still without Steven Spielberg at the helm Jaws 2 soon descends into silly B movie territory.
Director Jeanot Szwarc just doesn't have big enough feet to fill the shoes of Spielberg.
Due to this some of the set pieces come off as being ludicrously silly rather than edge of your seat thrilling.
I'll give him his dues though there are some moments in Jaws 2 to warrant it to be a fun nostalgic re-watch.
Your gonna need a bigger budget is the overall premise, but throwing money at something won't work if you don't hire the right craftsmen to do the job.For every nice touch there's an equally cringe worthy one.
One scene where the shark swims up the side of a boat to attack a group of young sailors is offensive on the eyes.
As Bruce opens his huge Jaws his entire mouth is deformed due to being made from rubber.
Okay this movie was made in 1978 so we must forgive the ropey effects but even back then during editing they could see that this shot looked terrible.
On the positive side Szwarc did introduce some rather clever visual elements.
One being when young Sean Brody ties a rope around the keel of his capsized boat. 
The keel looks like a giant dorsal fin.
When he gets back on the wrecked sail boats with the rest of the gang the capsized boat being towed resembles a shark
following them. This subconsciously implies to the audience that the great fish is always present.
Now that's clever. What isn't clever is having a shark sink a helicopter!
The ending is also unbelievably stupid when Brody entices the shark by banging on a power cable. I'm sure the residents of Amity where very happy not to have any electricity but hey Brody did save the kids so give him a break.
The chance of the shark actually biting the cable are slim. It would have more likely swam under it and gobbled up the Chief Dingy and all.
I'm being a bit unfair. Jaws 2 is a silly movie. If you were expecting a similar movie to the original then you will be immensely disappointed. If however you just go with it and except that this film is just a poorly made, rushed attempt to cash in on the original, then you may have a good time watching it.
Jaws 2 is average but compared to the two sequels that followed, like the original it could be considered to be a masterpiece.",Jaws 2
108,skybrick736,Jaws 2,6,28 June 2015,"What I look for in a sequel to a great horror movie is the continuity and bringing back past actors as their former characters. I give Jaws 2 respect for having those characteristics and with a big budget they could play around with some quality effects. The beginning of the movie was solid, starting out with a unique story and introducing a lot of new characters. It was fun seeing old tension between Mayor Vaughn and Chief Brody go at it again and also seeing the relationships between Brody and his two sons, Michael and Sean.When the story progressed, and focused on Michael, Sean and the other teenagers, the story didn't fall apart, but it kind of staled. There was a lot of fluff time, showing a lot of windsurfing scenes, which I found disinteresting. I thought the death toll would also have been a little bit higher in the movie too considering they had great shark effect scenes, similar to the original. The closing moments, also like the first Jaws, had a pretty far-fetched ending that anyone could see happening a mile away. Jaws 2 was a good follow up but it didn't quite meet my expectations considering everything it had going for it.",Jaws 2
109,Lebowskidoo,A Perfect Sequel,9,9 February 2017,"My first horror movie, and saw it on the big screen as well. Seared into my memory, strikes that primal cord every time I'm in or near the ocean. I saw this before I ever got the chance to see the original. It lacks some of the excellent characterizations of that movie, but the shark action is kicked up a notch. It's the only sequel that remotely comes close to, or is worthy of Jaws.Maybe it's the setting, the east coast and the Atlantic Ocean, also where I grew up, that makes it seem scarily too close to home. My dad even looks like Chief Brody, well, kinda.Roy Scheider is back and gives his all to the movie, even though it's been said he really, really didn't want to and only did so to fulfill a contract. The movie owes him a great deal, he's the lone Orca crew member to make it to the sequel, and every sequel needs some continuation to succeed. His character gets more focus without Quint or Hooper around. You really sense his dread that his worst nightmare is happening, again! Some of Scheider's finest acting ever, something no one would probably say about a sequel in certain circles.John Williams also returns, and he surpasses himself here. This score is expanded and scarier than the original, and also, simply beautiful in other places. He's a living legend.There was to be a completely different version originally, much darker. We will never get to see that but I don't think we want this kind of movie to be too graphic and depressing. I like the version we got...although a little more blood would have been okay.If you liked the feeling of terror you got from the first movie, you will experience it here again. The film makers really captured Amity perfectly and introduced some newer ideas such as the camera on the shark fin point of view.See this movie, but know, you will never fully relax at the beach again.",Jaws 2
110,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,7,8 April 2005,"Without Spielberg and certain members of the original cast, this sequel to the seventies smash was never going to come close to being as good as its daddy. It has its moments though, with a good amount of scares, humour and fair performances.Jaws 2 takes place in the same resort town Amity a few years after the original, with Sheriff Brody trying to lead a safe, peaceful life with his family. However, a few recent deaths cause suspicion in his mind, and he finds the half-devoured corpse of a killer-whale he believes another Great White is attacking in the area. Naturally no-one believes him, thinking he has grown paranoid over past incidents. The money grabbing mayor is trying to make the town popular again and will not listen. A sailing event is taking place soon, and although Brody warns his kids to stay out of the water, they disobey him and go with their friends in various tiny boats an catamarans. Brody is fired for scaring tourists, and he goes looking for his kids. Meanwhile the shark attacks the many boats, killing some, and soon each person is struggling for their life on pieces of driftwood.Jaws 2 is a film which takes a deeper look at Brody's family life, as well as the Mayor's, dealing with similar issues to the first. However, the action and death count is increased, but unlike most sequels this does not cause it to suffer. There is a good amount of tension created, and we never know whose boat is going to be attacked next. Once the sizes of the boats and shark are compared, we know the kids have little hope. The mix of kids is good, with certain characters giving funny moments. Mostly the performances are good, particularly from Scheider, while most of the annoying characters are happily eaten. Memorable moments include the finale, the water-skier scene, and of course the helicopter scene. Much better than the next two, though remember I have a habit of marking high.7.5 out of 10",Jaws 2
111,theshadow908,A real disappointment.,5,8 June 2006,"Jaws 2 picks up a few years after the first film left off. Police Chief Martin Brody finds proof of another shark living in the Amity Island region and goes to the mayor for help so he can close the beaches again. Everyone passes him off as paranoid due to previous events, even as the new shark begins to pick off swimmers in more unbelievable and violent ways. When Brody's two sons, now teenagers, go sailing with friends and are attacked by the shark, Brody must go out into the water once more to kill the creature. Jaws 2 attempts to stick close to the first film, but it fails because it's missing the smart dialogue, the good direction, the good acting, and the suspense.Stevn Spielberg brought his unique directing style to the original Jaws, but this film was directed by a TV show director who clearly wanted to imitate Spielberg but failed. The suspense is gone because we see the shark more often and the deaths are more gratuitously violent. When was the last time you heard of a shark causing a motor boat to explode? The plot of this film is really under developed compared to the first one. Pratically the whole movie sets up the end sailboat scene where the action starts. The filler is Martin Brody walking around like a scared puppy wondering what to do about the shark.The acting is another story. The acting in the first movie was so good, you'd think that getting three of the original actors (Sheider, Hamilton, Gray) back for the sequel would be a good thing. Well, it wasn't. Sheider seems lazy this time around, like he doesn't want to be in the movie.Overall, Jaws 2 is a major disappointment to fans of the original because everything that made the first film good is missing. However, it is the best of the sequels and provides a modest entertainment.5/10",Jaws 2
112,akshatmahajan,Was almost of same level as first part,8,10 September 2020,"For me, Jaws 2 was almost of same level as Jaws. The only problem this part had, was pacing. The pacing could have been better.
It becomes a challenge for a director to make a sequel of a film which is considered as masterpiece and I can say that the director of this part didn't disappoint. Yes, he was not able to give another masterpiece but he gave us best sequel of Jaws.
This story is almost same as first part. Overall, the film moves a little slowly in first half, but picks up dramatically in the second half. In fact, it turns out quite intense, just like the first film. The main mistake which I pointed earlier was that it was too slow for too long.
One of the plus point was that the shark looks more realistic and this part showed attacks much better than the first. And ofcourse, the second half of this part was better than the second half of first part.
Overall, if you want to watch Jaws franchise you can watch first two parts without any hesitation.",Jaws 2
113,buckikris,Just When You Thought It Was Safe To Go Back In The Water.,9,7 August 2016,"It's been four years since the Orca sank. When two divers come across it, they take pictures of themselves. The are unaware of the danger that is coming toward them until it is too late. On Amity Island Chief Brody ( Roy Scheider) is on his way for a grand opening of a brand new hotel. He is late getting there when he catches up with his wife Ellen( Lorraine Gary). It's a celebration and a huge deal for Ellen. The kids are all there and they are teenagers, except Sean( Mark Gilpin). Most of the city council is there including Mayor Vaughn( Murray Hamilton), Len Peterson(Joseph Mascolo), and Miss Amity Tina Wilcox( Ann Dusenberry), for the ribbon cutting ceremony.The next day when Brody reports for duty he is notified about the abandon cruiser with the divers flag still up. When Deputy Hendricks( Jeff Kramer) who loves the boat launch jumps at the chance to investigate it. When Hendricks returns all he finds is the dive camera. Meanwhile, the kids are out sailing having a great time including Mike( Mark Gruner), Brody's oldest son. Everyone is enjoying themselves especially a woman on a boat with a water skier. Neither the skier or the woman aboard the boat realize the danger coming toward them. All of a sudden the skier, Terry, goes down. There is no sign of her, and the woman aboard the boat notices the half eaten ski. When she picks up the ski, the shark crashes into the boat. This alerts an older woman( Susan French) who lives nearby, Eddie(Gary Durain) and Tina. Chief Brody later shows up and has questions. He alerts Hendricks along with Red( The Old Man Of The Sea), He along with Hendricks then have to drag the bottom. They are at this forever, looking for the victims; until the bring up a power line with the wench from the bottom.Still no sign so Brody goes to see Mayor Vaughn about what is going on. Brody thinks they may have another shark problem; but Vaughn brushes it off. Vaughn thinks Martin is crazy and jumping the gun. Later that day Brody finds one of the missing boaters; and the kids find a half eaten Orca beached. Brody calls Hopper, but he is unavailable, so they send Dr. Lureen Elkins to investigate. The measurements are taken, and she concludes it's either another killer whale or a Great White that has inflicted the damage. When Brody hears this he Beaches(grounds) his son no sailing. Instead he finds his son a job that will last until the beginning of the school year.One day it's sun and fun at the beach; and Brody is up in the shark tower. When Vaughn sees this he alerts Petersen, they freak because they do not want to alert the visitors looking to buy property. It's not long after that Brody notices a shadow approaching. He jumps from the tower orders everyone out of the water, waving his gun and shooting. When he realizes his mistake, the damage is done. Later that night though new hope emerges. The photos from the camera are developed, one showing a picture of a shark. Brody takes it over to town hall shows the council the picture; but they refuse to believe it. Eventually they fire him because of the scene at the beach. Brody returns home drunk and Ellen is there with Hendrick's. It's an awkward scene when Brody hands over his badge to Hendrick's. The next day the kids go sailing including Mike and Sean. When Brody along with Ellen go down to hand over the police truck both of them come to the scene of a diving accident. A diver came up to fast after a close call with a shark. After hearing more about the accident from Hendrick's he finds out the kids went day sailing. He, Ellen, and Hendrick's leave to find the kids before it's too late. When they arrive and find Tina's sailboat, nobody seems to be aboard. Brody discovers Tina hiding in the bow of the boat. When they find here she is white as a sheet, her first words were SHARK. She is in shock Ellen, Brody, and Hendrick's comfort her until more help can arrive. When a big cruiser is alerted to come their way Ellen and Hendrick's are told to return back after rescuing Tina. It is now up to Brody to find the kids and save them before more tragedy occurs.For a sequel I loved this movie, Hendrick's and Brody were my favorites in this gem. I believe sharks are fascinating creatures, but we need to be aware of the dangers they can pose to us. This DVD is full of extras including shark facts. Even though JAWS will be my favorite; this movie will still make you think twice before swimming in the ocean.",Jaws 2
114,DigitalRevenantX7,More of a comic-book film.,6,25 May 2009,"WARNING: Contains plot spoilers.The beaches of Amity are once again plagued by a killer shark, this time more ferocious than its predecessor. Martin Brody tries to warn the mayor but is fired from his job after causing panic on the beach. Brody then tries to rescue a group of teenagers stranded at sea before the shark can get to them.Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water, comes the sequel to the first true blockbuster. ""Jaws 2"" is helmed by French director Jeannot Szwarc, a television director, & is co-written by Carl Gottlieb, who wrote the original film.A lot of people treated ""Jaws 2"" as crap when it came out, which did not stop it from earning about $100 million at the box office. Unlike them, I tend to disagree – the film may not be as good or even in the same league as its predecessor, but it's a pretty good film.Szwarc keeps the film moving at a fast pace, pioneering the shark's POV shots as it races towards its victims, something that actually comes close to recreating the fear that JAWS had over its viewers. Roy Scheider delivers another fine performance as police chief Brody & Murray Hamilton is a hoot as the cowardly mayor.""Jaws 2"" may not be as scary as the first JAWS but is a damn sight more spectacular, with the shark taking on (& destroying) speedboats, sailing yachts & even a helicopter! There's even a rousing showdown where Scheider kills the shark by causing it to fry after biting an electrical cable. Cool as it may seem, these scenes propel the shark tale into some kind of comic-book film, as well as making it more hi-tech (it better be, at a budget of $22 million!).The only thing keeping the film from joining the revered heights of the original is the weak script, which copies the first film wholesale, & the shark attack scenes which may be quite spectacular but become very silly when you think about it afterwards – how can a shark blow up a speedboat or even sink a helicopter? It doesn't make any real sense, although this film is not for those who want to watch a realistic portrayal of a shark's life, just like the original, this film is pure escapism.",Jaws 2

Apart from the original cast reprising their roles (unfortunately, Dreyfuss did not return) the film is a dud, really, but watchable thanks to a solid performance from Scheider (he actually goes above and beyond here) and a strong support from Lorraine Gary. The shark attacks lack the intensity of the first film and the plot concerning the teenagers in peril on their boats being the main focus of the plot sees the film invariably descend into a typical teens-in-peril horror film. Again, watchable for Scheider in the lead, but that's it.",Jaws 2
117,flicklover,A solid sequel!,7,10 August 2001,"Sequels are almost an afterthought these days, if a movie has any kind of success, a series of sequels follow. Only a few times could it be said that a sequel deserves the classic status of its original. The Godfather 2 is an example, but it is really not a sequel, but a continuation, Aliens is a sequel that is even better than its predecessor. Most sequels that are entertaining but mostly forgettable.Now, on to Jaws 2! When this movie came out I was only 9 years old and even then, i had loved Jaws. So most people regard it as a disappointment, which is in a way, unfair, because it is a well crafted movie. It has a basic structure that is similar to the original, Chief Brody warning the town's head honchos that a shark is endangering Amity island. Roy Scheider again is terrific as Brody, he plays him as an intelligent but obsessed man, deeply affected by what he had gone thru 3 years earlier. The other star of the film obviously is the shark. The first film benefited from not seeing much of the shark until the last half of the film. Anyone familiar with Jaws lore will remember that Spielberg and Co. could not get the mechanical shark to work most of the time, they HAD to focus more on suspense and character. The first film is a classic.In Jaws 2 the filmmakers really could not get away with not showing the shark, they Had to show it more. And yes, it looks fake most of the time,but It looked fake in the first one too, the action scenes are done very well. Well directed by Jeanott Szwarc, the shark scenes move quickly and sustain the suspense well. These days they would have used CGI, but as an example, Deep Blue Sea had the nifty CGI effects, but no suspense, I'll take good suspense over SFX any day!. Jaws 2 is not a masterpiece like its predecessor, but it doesn't try to be, the filmmakers wanted to entertain the audience in more of a monster movie fashion, and they succeeded. Next to Jaws 3 and Jaws 4, Jaws 2 IS a Classic!!!Grade: B",Jaws 2

Most of the sequences featured character interaction photography and lines said by the performers. The first sequel, Jaws 2 three years later focuses on individual characters often one at a time on screen and if more than one not truly interacting.

124,happyendingrocks,Just when you thought it was safe to assume that every sequel to Jaws was awful...,8,18 August 2009,"If we can agree up front that making a sequel to a film as flawless and powerful as Jaws is a definite, if inevitable, mistake, the rest of this write-up will be a lot easier to swallow. Unquestionably it's probably safe to have low expectations for a film that, by all accounts, even the participants weren't interested in making. But, when we shrug aside the knowledge that this film is wholly unnecessary, Jaws 2 is actually a pretty damn enjoyable movie that certainly doesn't match the original (an impossibility, this), but adds to the story in a way that respectfully honors the spirit of the original. While the two cruddy chapters that follow this one are bottom-feeding tripe, no one involved with Jaws 2 has anything to be ashamed of.In fact, there are moments of intensity here that would nearly match what we saw in the classic original, if we hadn't already seen them in the classic original. The film-makers were savvy enough to utilize the same elements that crafted such sublime suspense the first time, and the sprawling ocean is once again used like a supplemental character. Once we establish that we have another shark on our hands, every panning shot of the murky depths or deceptively calm ocean surface generates genuine tension, and unlike the other films in this franchise, which relied more on close-ups of their clunky monsters than sustained build-up, the straight visual presence of the shark here is saved for moments of true impact, which the film has plenty of.If Roy Schieder wasn't too excited about revisiting Amity Island, you'd certainly never know it from his excellent performance, which is every bit as good as it was the first time out. The quaint island setting, now thriving once again and trying to put its terrible past to rest, is just as well-realized as we remember. And the returning presence of nearly the entire supporting ensemble certainly adds immeasurably. Even the young cast of newcomers deliver strong performances, and nearly everything about the film seems to indicate that just because the film-makers knew they couldn't outdo the original, it wasn't going to be because they didn't try.Scheider's trailer line ""I know what a shark looks like because I've seen one up close... and you better do something about this shark because I don't intend to go through that hell again"" supplements a plausible and rational follow-up to the events in the original film, and while he is clearly the protagonist once again, the film is smart enough to note that Chief Brody was never a hero in the first film, just a small town lawman thrown into supernatural and horrifying circumstance. It would have been far too easy, and typical, for Jaws 2 to up the action to compensate for its lack of originality, and while the second half certainly loads up on the shark attacks, we are spared the unrealistic idea of Chief Brody charging into the sea to save his town from terror once again. No, like any normal person who once stared into the black eyes a murderous great white, Brody wants nothing to do with this returning menace, and Schieder's nuanced performance never allows even his bravest deeds to overshadow the fear bubbling inside Brody's stomach.When he finally does step into action, it isn't because he's keen on facing down the beast that continues to haunt his sleepy little township, it's because his two sons (who have aged abnormally quickly in three years, but no matter) are trapped within the tour de force that is the film's second half. After a firmly suspenseful and understated build-up, the frenzied pace of the lengthy climax is a welcome shift, packing as many bits of shark mayhem into 40 minutes as possible. While many will shirk at the idea of our perhaps unreasonably intelligent shark pulling a helicopter down into the sea, even moments like these are handled with utmost care, and they are certainly not as silly as they would have come across in lesser hands.Again, only the familiarity of the carnage dilutes its impact, and seeing Eddie dragged in dreadful fashion across the surface while his girlfriend looks on in helpless horror, we still get the same charge of squeamish delight drawn forward by the ground-breaking effects of the original. By making teenagers the central items on the shark's menu this time out, it's obvious the film has demographics in mind, but Jaws 2 is far too slickly made, well-paced, and splendidly-plotted to be a mere slasher film at sea. As the dwindling survivors drift aimlessly on their decimated water-crafts, their myriad expressions of despair and fright are realistic and relatable, because as we saw with the disparate, quibbling personalities of Quint, Hooper, and Brody in the first film, fear does different things to different people.Perhaps that's the key here. The original Jaws wasn't really about a shark, it was about human beings facing terror beyond imagination. Jaws 2 keeps this point in mind, and while the titular teeth are certainly factored in more prominently this time out, the themes of the original are well-upheld.So, they couldn't top the original. But, in terms of continuing on after an impossible act to follow, this sequel succeeds more admirably than perhaps any other film in its predicament. The very fact that it's not insulting to its audience is a triumph in itself, and considering the abysmal franchise that followed it, Jaws 2 is almost genius in comparison.Give this one another look, and a fair chance, and you'll be pleasantly surprised at what you discover.",Jaws 2

There was yet no doubt that a sequel would happen and three years later, we got Jaws 2. Jaws 2 picks up a few years after the events of the first film and follows Chief Brody who believes that another shark, some relation to the first one, is out in the sea of Amity and ready to kill some locals. Jaws 2 came to mixed reviews when it came out and it was also a box office hit, being the second highest grossing sequel ever until Rocky II was released. There were people who hated it due to just how uneven it was to the first film and there were people who really liked it, I was one of the people who thought it was just ok. The film has nothing to be proud of and it is not a excellent sequel like The Godfather: Part II or Meet The Fockers, it's just ok!

It may not have the depth and is more stupid then the first one it does still hold up better then most Horror flicks story wise anyway.

I thought there was more action and there was a good balance of scenes between the kids and the adults on the film. I enjoyed Roy Scheider the most of all here. He made this film what it is. It's a shame that he apparently did not get along with the director and only did the movie to get out of his contract with Universal. He apparently was hard to work with. With that said, the movie is full of action and good acting and a lot more use of the main attraction, Jaws. The great music is back again with the help of John Williams. The entire film score easily beats the original. I do miss Robert Shaw from the first movie, but he died in the film, so there was no way to put him in the sequel. Richard Dreyfuss is not missed. Never been a fan of his at all. I did really enjoy the climatic ending as well. It is one of the most memorable endings to a movie that I have ever seen.

128,Sonatine97,Just when you thought sequels were safe to go and see again,2,20 June 2000,"Dear oh dear. Travesty comes to mind when I saw this film, (some unprintable words occurred after the second time).Jaws 2 has about as much bite as a canary on drugs! Why oh why did Scheider & Garry every agree to do this I will never know. The money perhaps, but surely their reputations must have sunk quicker than the original Orca, afterwards.Yet another GW shark hoves into Amity Island, probably bent on revenge after the first film no doubt! It starts eating people before it trains it hungry little black eyes on a bunch of bratty kids, including the police chief's son.Unfortunately, Brody saves the day (and most of the bratpack) with a most unconvincing method of binning the shark and all live happily ever after until the next pay cheque....ooops, I mean the next film offer turns up.Save for John Williams' score (and I'm surprised he got involved in this mess), Jaws 2 just doesn't do it. Admittedly it had to work very hard to even come close to it's older relation, but you can't help but feel the scriptwriters made a  bad choice using teenagers for a sharkbait storyline - obviously trying to appeal to that kind of audience as opposed to the more mature adult adventurer's in the last hour of the first film!But to be honest a sequel was to be expected, so I wasn't really surprised that it got ripped to pieces by the press when it was released in 78/9.However, what I couldn't get my head round was the audacity of Universal studios to go on an make even more sequels!!!Oh well, let them keep making sequel after sequel; as far as I'm concerned there's only one true Jaws. ...dah..dum....dah...dum....dah dum dah dum dah dum.....

It started out very slow. I had to enable close captioning because I could barely hear the actors. I had no real idea what was going on. It took a good hour before anything exciting occurred.Second, the lack of music. Almost half the movie was just people talking, or things happening. Whatever happened to the music that is put in almost every scene of movies these days? Finally, the general behavior of people. Didn't they just witness several shark attacks four years ago (in Jaws)? Didn't the whole problem with the shark cause them to be frightened? How come everyone is ignoring this, denying the possibility of a shark, etc? But on the other hand, some good things about the movie.First, more shark horror scenes. Which is probably the main idea with the whole story.And second, just in general it seemed to improve with the camera angles and the technical aspects.Unfortunately, there was a ton of unnecessary swearing and a few making out scenes that didn't need to be added in.So all in all, 7/10.",Jaws 2

Obviously, it wasn't going to match up to the original.  But so what? That doesn't mean it was bad.   In fact, I would've given this film an eight if it wasn't for the corny ending with the teens on sailboats being attacked by the shark (did like the scene where the helicopter was dragged under, though).   Roy Scheider is a trooper, and he did very well, as did Lorraine Gary.

132,kingofdanerds,"At least it is watchable and competent, unlike the next two films",5,19 June 2021,"1975's Jaws changed the movie industry forever. 1975's jaws also did not need a sequel. Well, one was made and released in 1978 and simply titled Jaws 2. Like the first film, this film had a troubled production which involved changing of directors which caused problems between the actors. While not as big of a success as the original 1975 classic, Jaws 2 still was a hit financially and since it's release in 1978, has made $208 million. The film did not film all too well with critics and audiences and got mostly mixed reception. The film was directed by Jeannot Szwarc. The film stars Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary, and Murray Hamilton, all of whom starred in the first film.Three years after the events of the first film, everything in the town of Amity seems to be all fine. Until two divers go missing. Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) believes another shark has come to attack but nobody believes him.......Jaws 2 had no chance in surpassing the original 1975 classic in any way shape or form. But Jaws 2 does end up proving that, while it does not need to exist, it still ends up being watchable and competently made. Honestly, it is hard to judge this film. Do you compare it to the original 1975 classic? Or does one compare it to the later sequels? By itself, Jaws 2 is a pretty standard shark movie. As a sequel, it is a big old rehash of the original 1975 classic. Despite this film's story being a rehash, I do think the idea of having a traumatic Chief Brody is interesting. But, the film does not do too much with it. In fact, the characterization is not very good. The film decides to have the shark terrorize a bunch of teenagers. Teenagers who we have to sit and deal with for most of the film. To me, they are a bunch of no names and I could care less but nobody likes seeing kids in danger. It seems dumb with this rehash that we have the mayor of Amity being really dumb. In fact, the whole town. Yes, I think the idea of traumatic Chief Brody is interesting. Yes, I would have liked it if there was some doubt cast on the whole situation (fully knowing that there was going to be a shark), but having everyone basically turn their back on a town hero just does not sit well with me. One problem that I have with this film is the shark but I can blame this (as well as the rest of this film's problems) on the director. The shark is shown way too early. Yeah, at this point we know there is a shark, but it would have been neat to have. Despite a vast majority of people calling the shark in the original film fake (and me saying it looked fine), this shark looks more fake. It just does. Now, does the shark have it's fair amount of decent scenes? There are a few that have some suspense and some sort of scare. But don't count on there being too many or at least being as effective as seen previously. So yes, the suspense and scares are somewhat still there but one thing that is absent is the blood. Yes, the original pushed the PG rating. But this film highly deserves it. This film lacks blood entirely. I have heard that there is some deleted and/or unfilmed scenes that would have had this film rated R, which wouldn't be done because this is Jaws 2, and they needed to make money (in hopes of surpassing the original). In fact, there are some deleted scenes that should not have been deleted because from what I know, there are some deleted scenes that fixed a few of the problems that this film had such as some characterization and such.The original Jaws was an experience and what Jaws 2 ends up being is just another shark movie. But, it is still watchable and not terrible in the least sense.",Jaws 2
133,smellthecult-com-1,Big fish sequel with teeth,7,28 January 2010,"After the phenomenal success of the first movie, it was all but inevitable that a sequel would follow and, as surely as wasps follow cola, 3 years after Chief Brody blew the arse out of the first shark, a new finned menace lurks in the waters off Amity Island.The set up is identical to the first, with the added spice of an extremely agitated Chief Brody spotting sharks everywhere he goes, appearing paranoid, right up to the point the chewed up bodies start piling up.Whilst lacking the sheer menace of the original, and with the unwelcome addition of an annoying bunch of teenagers titting about on catamarans, this is still an enjoyable enough water-borne romp.The shark scenes are reasonably effective, especially when we see nothing but a dorsal fin skimming through the surf, and the presence of the majority of the original cast at least adds an air of authenticity to proceedings.Whilst being as good as the original was a near impossibility, preventing the movie from being much, much worse was some achievement by the director.With plus points already mentioned, the only real lows are the aforementioned spotty oiks, the rather rubbery shark effects when it leaves the water, and the fact that you know it's all getting a little bit silly when the shark takes down a helicopter, so not a bad effort all round.As sequels go, this certainly delivers the goods.",Jaws 2
134,David_Frames,"""Sharks don't take things personally Mr.Brody"" Oh yeah?",7,21 October 2005,"There's definitely something in the water surrounding Amity Island. Three years after the Island's police chief improbably blew up a great white shark with a gun and a canister of liquid oxygen another sub-aquatic serial killer decides to do the copycat thing and help itself to the victims, sorry Islanders. If you think the serial killer conceit is a nothing, throw away kind of comment then its time you sat down and watched Jaws 2 again. The first and best sequel, not that that's saying much, in fact its like saying blood in the urine is better than a cleft face, is the one where the shark makes the transition from mere man eater to evil teen-stalking murderer. This one's got more in common with Halloween than the first film in that all the victims here tend to be attractive adolescent girls and their slightly awkward boyfriends plus in true, have I watched Scream recently or something - sequel style, the body count shoots up in addition to the ante. This is all backed up by a curious supernatural undercurrent - a sort of evil killer back from the dead kinda vibe. The crucial scene is the one in which the marine expert tries to put Brodys mind at rest by making the factual (and obvious) point that Sharks don't do revenge. Brody has other ideas though and as the hero is ALWAYS right in these situations, especially when up against any kind of institutional expert who holds the opposite view, we know there's something in his idea that ""If one shark were killed, you don't think another shark would..."" Would what Chief? Come back to kill you and your sons and all his friends? You better believe it. In fact as he looks ominously out to sea and up comes those foreboding strings, we know we're not dealing with any normal finned muncher - this one has an agenda. If the plan is to lure Brody out to sea for what it imagines will be a fairly one sided contest (this thing isn't afraid to eat a HELIPCOPTER!) then the execution is faultless. The first shark's twisted twin knows exactly how to push Brody's buttons. Kill a water-skier? Fine. Feed the police a few sinister pictures - not the face, just the eyes? Done. Build his on land based paranoia to threaten his career and sanity? Easy. And of course target the teens knowing that the great man will be duty bound to follow through and come looking? Holy human-steaks, its like a moth to the flame. In the end the Chiefs only hope against this Machivellian chew-machine is the pipe dream that the ocean will throw up a giant bolt of lighting from its mud strewn floor to fry the undersea equivalent of Peter Sutcliffe. If you were a betting man you certainly wouldn't be fielding a monkey on the local law enforcement.So thats Jaws 2, or to put it another way some text I've written about it. In a movie where Sharks survive explosions and what happened in the first film isn't enough to alert anyone to the potential dangers you just have to suspend your disbelief that little bit further. It's very watchable but more in a throw away fashion than the essential way in which you tend to regard the original. The guy who directed this when on to do Supergirl y'know.

135,TCurtis9192,JAWS 2,1,6 August 2020,"""JAWS 2"" (1978, Szwarc) isn't the worst sequel ever made as some 1 starrers have put it. It's actually a very competent sequel that succeeds in capturing the style of its predecessor. It is more of a horror film than ""JAWS"" (1975, Spielberg) and produces enough nonsense (and it really would be nonsense if it weren't for John Williams' excellent score) to sit at the family-friendly end of the slasher genre.What lets this film down is the focus on the wrong characters. Roy Scheider, whilst having a lot to do, often sinks into the background as we're forced to watch annoying teenagers sail themselves into serious man-eating trouble while Lorraine Gary finally sees a mere shadow of a glimpse of the infidelity she experienced in Benchley's original novel (although, as I say, it's a mere potential shadow of a glimpse that simply doesn't happen).It's got better visuals than the boringly filmed first film and the music is absolutely to die for.",Jaws 2
136,vailsy,Underrated sequel,7,10 April 2015,"Obviously Jaws 2 is not as good as the first.. it doesn't have Quint and Hooper. It's still a good movie though and feels very much like a continuation of the first in terms of it's look and feel, since it was made very shortly after Indeed some scenes in this movie are easily good enough to have been in the first one. The part with the water skier is really well shot and the second diving sequence when the diver gets the bends is very realistic. Also the orca section and the part where Brody fishes out the boat wreckage are interesting scenes, as is the ending Some people have said that it doesn't make sense that a second shark comes to the same place, but actually it does, this could easily have been the other sharks mate and the point is that it was in the same territory as the first shark and around the sunken boat just a few years after the events of the first film. It's not nearly as far fetched as the other two movies The music in Jaws 2 is also excellent with some really lovely atmospheric harp sections for some of the underwater sequences. The score is probably better than the first actually since the signature Jaws tune remains, but it doesn't include the sea faring style parts that were a bit corny from time to time in the first movie Brody is as good as ever too, and overall minus the silly helicopter sequence, this is an excellent sequel",Jaws 2
137,axlrhodes,A fun b-movie flick that lacks the cinematic touch of Spielberg but still holds good entertainment value,7,9 May 2008,"Jaws 2 may smell a little bit of cashing in but i believe the producers genuinely wanted to continue the story of the Brody family and make a good film.The signs are there at the start of the film.There is a lot of time spent around the Brody clan on Amity Island,the film doesn't seem to have any direction here though, ts almost as if the director saw what Spielberg did and thought to try and replicate it but Spielbergs family moments in his first film were tighter and more effective,here they are borderline boring.Once the film slams in to gear though,it does take on a life of its own and there is tension and drama in spades.John Williams' score is largely to thank for that.Williams once again delivers another outstanding soundtrack,it is almost impossible to not feel a slight touch of suspense when that dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum kicks in.In summary Jaws 2 gets nowhere near the dizzy heights of success created by Spielberg but has a life of its own as a fun B-movie outing. 7/10",Jaws 2

See Donna in 'Fyre' (1979). What a nice small set of boobs as she goes topless. Ann also shows her young rack in 'Basic Training' (1985).I bet Mom and Dad were real proud of these two little fame-n-fortune hunters who would both do ANYTHING to be a 'star'!

Also once again the local mayor would refuse to believe that their was any danger blah blah blah. Its the same thing done over again except without Richard Dreyfus and Robert Shaw's characters for Roy Scheider to interact with, instead he's out on his own trying to save some really annoying teenagers I for one was looking forward to seeing them turned into sharkfood. The director even tries to replicate the part from the film that made you jump out of your seat with fright and misses by miles. Actually thats a tad unfair because the director didn't to bad a job, and I suppose if you haven't seen the wonderful first film then you might get something out of this movie which was surely made for one reason only, the huge amount of money it would make at the box office.

140,torrascotia,Probably better than the first.,7,24 September 2018,"Alot has talked about the original Jaws movie, that its a classic and it was made by a genius etc. However the success of Jaws was partly a fluke. The shark in the first movie was so bad and looked so unrealistic that they ended up making a completely different movie than they intended. Instead of the shark being more prominent, it was hidden to avoid people laughing at how bad it looked. This meant that the presence of the shark was more malevolent than was originally intended as not being able to see what was attacking people built up more suspense. The original Jaws did get alot right but people can get carried away by what was mainly a fluke success. 
Jaws 2 may be a better movie. It is very similar in structure to the original but compared to the first, there are many more deaths which are affecting compared to the first. People who you really don't want to die do. 
The focus of the sharks attention this time are mainly teenagers, however these aren't the annoying teenagers which you find in many horror movies you enjoy watching being killed who are simply clueless. These teenagers are likeable, care for each other and look after one another. This is why there is more emotional depth to Jaws 2 compared to Jaws. This is also the only other Jaws movie which sticks closely to the setting and structure of the original. If you enjoyed the first one, you may enjoy this one more.

It's still scary, and while there may be a little more cheese in the film than the first, it's also fun levity to keep the audience ... relaxed. The extended sequence with the kids on the ocean is very tense, and the shark itself is just as menacing as it was in the first film—because you know what it's capable of doing. The subplot of the condominium thing is silly, but otherwise, this movie is a very entertaining adventure. Keith Gordon has a small role, long before he was in ""CHRISTINE"" and other films.

Robert Shaw and Richard DreyFuss are very much missed, but Roy Scheider manages to hold the narrative on his own in a satisfying way and is great as always, as is Lorraine Gary and the rest of the cast.Once again the shark is used sparingly and looks great whenever it's on screen - and the entire third act when the kids are on the sea and are attacked is very suspensful and well built up.Overall, it is a very god sequel - maybe not quite on par with the first movie, but not far behind.",Jaws 2

It tells a good story. It takes its time and doesn't rush into things. The way Brody gradually realizes there is another shark on the loose is very well done. Plus the shark laying siege to those kids made for some very tense moments. Also, this is a good lesson for kids. When your parents tell you to do something, by God do it. They know what's best for you. Many posters have already commented on the improbability that the town counselors would not have believed Brody the second time around. Folks, these people are politicians and bureaucrats. They couldn't see the obvious if it bit them right in the ass. That's their nature.THE BAD. The shark jumping out of the water and eating a helicopter was a little silly. So was the killing the shark with an electric cable routine. I would think that everyone else in the water would have been electrocuted as well.All in all, it's not as good as the original JAWS, but it isn't bad, either.

I watched this movie immediately after watching the original.I gave the original 7/10 meaning that it was a fine shark movie, but not amazing.This movie followed the same formula as the first - there is a shark in the water. However, in this movie the protagonists are adolescents, who I was very surprised actually had good performances. Those teens depicted correctly more or less how terrified you are supposed to feel and act when you know there is a huge great white shark near your broken boat, which is something the protagonist and director of the original failed to properly depict.The first 82 minutes of the film are sort of boring so I fast-forwarded here and there. The movie FINALLY starts to get good at the 83rd minute-mark all the way to the end (113th minute). It is because of these last 30 minutes that the movie gets a 7/10 from me. Up until the 82nd minute I'd give it a 2-3/10.Anyway, also, once again, the orchestra was just bad and mostly inappropriate.Conclusion: should you watch this shark movie?

147,mungflesh,Sets the template for the sub-par blockbuster sequel,7,17 January 2018,"Jaws 2 is a good movie but as a sequel it's very formulaic.Jeannot Szwarc has made a competent film though I suspect the reason for it being above average is down to the producers Zanuck/Brown and to the incredible score from John Williams. The water ski theatrical poster is actually worth a mention here too as it's a real work of art.The likeable Chief Brody is played well, once again, by Roy Scheider but there's a big gap without Hooper and Quint. The rest of the cast (Ellen, Deputy Hendricks, Mayor Vaughn) don't quite fill the space and we're left with everything of interest hanging on Brody. This is one major negative for the film and the other is the pacing. Scenes in the movie don't build towards the climax as they did in the original. This film is very much of two halves and the first half is really just a time-filler before the finale gets underway.As for positives, this movie has a look and feel very similar to the exceptional first - probably due the producers but who knows. There are quite a few scary moments and one in particular which always sends a shiver down my spine. In my opinion, the first movie is a much more tense and scary watch but the second has many frightening images which stick in the mind - and as a person who doesn't like deep water, it's more the scenes from this movie which I think about just before swimming in the sea.I mentioned it before but it is worth mentioning twice - Williams' score. It really is sublime. The movie's memorable main theme in the intro is played with atmospheric harps, which add to the underwater atmosphere and leads into a blasting fanfare against the ""Jaws 2"" title shot. If you're a Williams fan then honestly you'll want to watch this movie just for the score.No one will ever rate this movie close to, or above the first but as sequels go it's definitely one to check out.",Jaws 2
148,moviemattb,"Doesn't have the same magic as the first one, but it works as its own animal",8,15 September 2015,"After Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" came out as it open to critically acclaimed reviews, and making a sensational success at the box- office, a sequel was made and many people were split by this movie. So, the movie takes place after the first one as another great white shark attacks more people on Amity Island, while Martin Brody comes back as he has to go through the trouble again in order to kill the shark as he tries to save the people from being attacked. I understand that the movie doesn't have the same magic as the first one, but it works as its own animal. How can I be so sure? Because the movie isn't trying to be a carbon-copy of the first movie, and surely trying not copying its success. I know this movie did well at the box-office, but not as sensational as the first one and it did at least made enough a decent profit. I will admit that the movie does have some problems. I really do appreciate that movie is trying to be different, but it kind of slow some things down a bit as we kind of get so many scenes with the teenagers as they go parasailing, and wish they cut some scenes out for a bit. Also, the teenagers aren't really as interesting as the three main characters from the first one. I mean they're okay and so is there acting being okay, but they at least to their credit tried their best on how to survive, and try not to let the shark get to them as they are being stranded out by sea. While the one girl name Jackie that is being stranded with the group, doesn't help much as she keeps on screaming and getting hysterical at times; she is played by Donna Wilkes, but I'm not saying that her acting is bad nor against of being scared by a shark which its understandable, but can't she stop freaking out so much and learn how to be strong a bit like what the other teenagers were doing? That is just me, personally. With that said, the movie does have some good acting for Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton as they reprise their role from the first one, but the best one in the movie is Roy Scheider for reprising his role and given out the best performance that he is ever given. You root for him as he tries to deal with the shark, and doesn't intend to go through that problem again. Unfortunately, the people wouldn't trust him or help out which it now makes Brody to be the only one that handles with this kind of situation. The story itself is fine for what it is, and nothing more that I can say about. The direction by Jeannot Szwarc does a decent job on directing the movie. He may not be Spielberg, but he is at least a capable director on making this sequel decent. Of course, John Williams comes back from the first one and he really does a great job with the music as the music acts on its own, and not rehashing some of the same music that has already been done before. The shark itself is just as good as it was from the first one, and really do like the look of it where parts of its' face burns off like as if it were either Freddy Krueger or Two-Face. Also, still doing the same mixture of practical effects and real life shark footage by Ron and Valerie Taylor. The movie does deliver some good parts that are quite suspenseful like the scene, where the teenagers are trying to get Mike Brody out of the water as the shark tries to get him. So that is how much I can say about ""Jaws 2,"" and I really don't think it deserves a bad rep. At least, with that kind of rating it gets on IMDb. I'm not say make the rating higher than the first, but at least give it a decent rating. Also, its nowhere near as bad as the other ""Jaws"" sequels had. For my suggestion, I say give this one another look while compare to the other two sequels as how bad they are instead of this one. Again, it doesn't have the same magic as the first, but it at least works on its own. I enjoy ""Jaws 2"" for what it is, and I give an 8 out of 10.",Jaws 2

This is not a bad movie but it is a movie that suffers from being the sequel to a superb movie that still stands the test of time. Well let's start with the positive. Roy Schneider is as usual superb and so is Lorraine Grey as his wife. But unfortunately they alone can not carry the movie. The new cast are a bunch of interchangeable teens that are so stereotypical they could be from any teen horror flick. Then there is the shark. For one he look so less realistic than in the original which I think maybe be down to less being more in the amount of the shark we get to see compared to the first movie. Also he seems to have to much personality and intelligence rather than just being a stone cold killer.

Four years passed after the tragedy of the great white shark attack that hit the island of Amity Island, now the terror back haunted the island. One of the policemen named Martin Brody had to protect the townspeople and had to rescue his son and the teenagers floating in the sea and prevent them from eating the sharks. Jaws 2 is pretty good, becoming the sequel to the classic movie of the horror movie Jaws (1975)",Jaws 2

JAWS 2 had the potential for a good sequel, but it is more like a rehash than a sequel.  There are some young and good-looking actors including Keith Gordon in a small role.

153,drawlife,The only worthy sequel to the original Jaws.,6,5 August 2014,"The original Jaws is one of the greatest films ever made. Jaws 2 is more or less a mediocre sequel, but one that doesn't destroy and tarnish the appeal of the Jaws franchise(until Jaws 3-D and Jaws: The Revenge).Jaws 2 picks up about four years since the original events of the first film. Amity is barely recovering financially, Brody's kids are older, and they frequently go sailing with their friends, and oh by the way a new shark claims the territory of Amity Island once again. This movie is by all means not perfect, and it sorely misses the presence of Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw, but it is quite enjoyable. What makes this film work is Roy Scheider. His performance as Brody is arguably better than the first film mainly because of how the script develops his character. In the film he's very paranoid, scared, but he is certain that there is another shark out there and is upset that Mayor Vaughn(Murray Hamilton) and Len Peterson(Joseph Mascolo) or no one at Amity Island believes him. There are wonderful moments of doubt and fear Brody displays and a touching moment with him and his younger son Sean when Brody shoots down a school of blue fish, mistaking it for a shark. Roy Scheider is able to bring depth and complexity to his role, making him very believable and one can't help but feel sorry for him. His wife Ellen Brody played by Lorraine Gary is more fleshed out here too and she provides a great supporting role. She and Scheider have a nice banter among each other and you believe them as a couple. The teens are pretty much throw away characters that are in this film to be shark food, they're quite irritating and they scream a lot, especially by a female named Jackie played by Donna Wilkes, but for a movie like this it comes within the territory. A few including Mike Brody(Mark Gruner) have more to do than others. Jaws 2 also had a troubled production like the original Jaws. Give credit to direct Jeannot Szwarc for doing the best job he could, he even butt heads with actor Roy Scheider quite a bit. What Jeannot Szwarc smartly does was to show the shark a lot more than the first film did. He wisely knew repeating what Spielberg did was just a cheap repeat and rehash of the original. I liked the idea of seeing the shark's point of view in certain shots of the film, and he shoots all the action scenes with care and they are quite impressive. The score by John Williams is also excellent. It's very different from the original film, but still contains some elements of that original shark theme. The problem with this movie is that, while the script has decent moments, it ultimately is a slasher/murder horror film, mainly because there is much emphasis on the teenagers who we don't care for, but like I stated it comes within the territory, but it very much has that ""been there done that type feeling."" I was much more intrigued and entertained with all the character moments. As impressive some of the shark scenes were, they're could have been less, at times it gets overwhelming and sort of drags the movie quite a bit messing with the momentum of the film, and frankly quite boring. Overall this is a decent film, it's not as horrible as other's might say it is, it feel that way because this film, as I've stated before has that ""been there, done that,"" feel. Jaws should have been a one and done film, but this film does a commendable job of trying to be a good movie at the very least. 6.8/10",Jaws 2

Gone are the charm that the original did have, the story that was so interesting and addictive and the characters that were so fun to watch.Behind-the-scenes stuff was also Infamous, apparently both the director and the actor, Roy Scheider got into a physical fight during the filming, and the overall production suffered multiple other problems.I can't really say anything good about the sequel, except the return of Martin Brody and the music. Nothing really much else.",Jaws 2
155,jcaraway3,Cmparing it to the original-why bother?,6,16 August 2014,"This half baked sequel once again takes place on Amity Island, and, you guessed it, there's a giant killer shark on the loose to feast upon unsuspecting vacationers. I guess I have to compare it to the original, although it seems a bit pointless. While the film benefits from including several of the cast members from the original, the script is probably the weakest aspect of the whole production. Let's compare. The original had lots of humorous dialog from many of the quirky islanders and even added a bit of realism by often showing several conversations happening at once, whereas this one is flat and dull. Also, in the original, you can sense the strong bond Brody has with his family, with many little charming moments like the scene where he and his son make shark faces at each other. This one has nothing even close to that, except maybe when Brody hits his head on a low hanging lamp in their house. This movie also suffers from the inclusion of a bunch of annoying teen characters. Most of them have very little to add to the film, except to become ""damsels in distress"" of a sort for Brody to rescue at the end. Most of them have hardly any interesting character traits or even become shark bait, so there was really no reason to include so many of them. The original was the perfect ""Man vs. Nature"" film, but this one just feels like a bad slasher flick where barely anybody dies. To it's credit, this movie does try to have a real storyline involving Brody's dismissal from the police, not just the shark eating random people, but I would have liked to see more of that than scenes of the teens sailing. It's also nice that Hendricks (Jeffrey Kramer) has a more substantial role, and, to it's credit, it does have some nice shark attack scenes for undiscriminating movie monster fans. It's just nowhere near as good as the original. It may have been a bit better if Spielberg had stepped behind the camera again. Either way, while the original introduced us to the most terrifying killer shark in movie history, this one is little more than a cinematic plate of fish and chips.",Jaws 2

However, a series of deaths occur in the water, so now it's up to Brody to kill this shark and save the day once again.Now, don't get me wrong it's a good movie, but it doesn't quite live up to the awesomeness that is ""Jaws."" There are parts in it that are somewhat lacking in scares and depth at the same time, but it's not overpowering the film. There were some sequences were the shark effects weren't that great, but I'll let you be the judge on that.Overall, I recommend this to anybody who wants to have a good time watching sharks, but don't expect much.",Jaws 2
157,jrs-8,"No ""Jaws"" but not bad",6,2 August 2004,"Was there ever a doubt that ""Jaws 2"" wouldn't stand a chance of equaling the original film? One could only hope that on its own level it was a decent film. And that is exactly what we get. To try and view this film and compare it to the original is an impossible task. The original ""Jaws"" is one of the great films of all time. Viewers need to approach ""Jaws 2"" with the first film completely out of mind. The sequel picks up a few years after the first film. The setting is the same (Amity Island) and Roy Scheider is back as Chief Brody. Also returning are Murray Hamilton as the Mayor, Lorraine Gary as Mrs. Brody, and Jeffery Kramer as deputy Hendricks. Gary and Kramer have bigger parts this time around while Hamilton still mills about not doing much of anything as he did in the original.The story this time centers around the teenagers of Amity Island headed by the older Brody sons (who are amazingly quite older then just the few years passed), particularly older brother Mike and his friends. They all like parasailing and you know what that means right? Early on Brody starts getting indications of another shark problem and takes his concerns to the town board and mayor. One of the biggest flaws in the film is their attitude, which is the same as the mayor's in the first film. Wouldn't you think they might have a little concern considering what had happened a few years earlier? The movie moves at a snail's pace for the first hour but things pick up in the second half once the teenagers take the sailboats out and realize the trouble that awaits them.On the positive side the shark looks as good, if not better, then in the first film. It is completely convincing. Scheider gives his usual solid performance despite playing second fiddle to a mechanical fish. And the second half of the film is quite suspenseful at times. There is one shot that has to be seen to be believed. An unconscience Mike Brody is in the water with the shark fast approaching. His friends are trying to lift him into the boat. The shark comes out of the water and.... well I won't tell you what happens but I think it is the best shark shot in the entire series of ""Jaws"" films.On the negative side the characters of the teenagers are pretty one dimensional and we don't get to know many of them well enough to care if they end up as shark dinner or not. One of the teens played by Donna Wilkes spends the last half hour doing nothing but screaming. The screams are so annoying either you almost wish she would fall in the water and be done with it. A scene with a helicopter in the water is as ridiculous as things can get. The ending (not revealed here) is a touch silly but if you think about it the ending to the original was no more silly. In the end ""Jaws 2"" is a decent but not great followup. For those that truly dislike the film I invite them to watch ""Jaws 3"" or ""Jaws: The Revenge"". Those films make part 2 look like the classic the first one is.",Jaws 2
158,Phantasm01,I don't intend to go through that hell again!,8,10 May 2006,"No possible way to be better than the original. No way. Because the original was basically a creative and productive fluke that became a staple suspense classic due to primarily two things: Spielberg's amibitious direction and Verna Fields' FLAWLESS editing. (She won that Oscar for a damn good reason.) ""Jaws"" was nothing but mistakes, but Verna Fields' editing covered up every single one. It's basically a miracle of film-making, now how can you surpass a miracle? ""Jaws 2"" does one thing EXTREMELY right: it spends time analyzing the trauma resulting from shark attacks, or people that have witnessed them. One of my favorite parts of this sequel is when Brody and some men rescue that girl whose boyfriend got eaten the day before. She was cowering under the rim of the boat the entire night, muttering incoherently, and nearly catatonic from primal fear. I didn't think a sequel to ""Jaws"" could invoke something so relatable. That right there gets my props.A lot of reviews for this are too mean-spirited. They aren't necessarily wrong, but they just focuse on the superficial negatives. Watch the film, and a real story does emerge. Chief Brody, forever scarred by his aquatic showdown with Bruce, acts somewhat rash and a little obsessive, but can any one of us blame him? Spielberg put this guy through a wet Hell three years prior (see review title).I'll just say some things I enjoyed about it. It's the only sequel that comes closest to reflecting the visual cadence of the original. Contrary to the above, it does have a nice style, and the photography might be the prettiest you get in the entire franchise. Why does a ""Jaws"" movie look so pretty? It is directed by a Frenchman, after all. Apparently, Jeannot Szwarc knew Zanuck and Brown by directing episodes of ""Night Gallery"" like Spielberg did, too. He pulls off some gorgeous and difficult shots in this film. (Keep an eye on the shark's POV of the waterskier -- it ain't miniature, it's full-scale live.) Surprisingly, the gore is considerably less than the original, which is basically a bloody mess of a film if you think about it. There is some nasty violence in it though: the attack on the boyfriend I mentioned before, and the girl that gets swallowed whole near the end.Look, just have fun with the helicopter attack and the manic girl that won't stop screaming at the end. Love the shark the filmmakers nicknamed ""Scarface"" and the fact that he can survive an explosion being only inches away from it. But best of all, enjoy Roy Scheider giving his wife's boss some come-uppance with a parking ticket. ""Jane Eyre"" this film is not.Ironically, perhaps the best piece of the DVD is the Behind The Scenes Making Of Feature. It is thorough, comprehensive, informative, and engaging as hell. AT LEAST as good as the ""Jaws"" Behind The Scenes with Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss, which was exceptional. These ""Jaws"" crews know how to make something out of nothing, that's for sure.Not necessarily essential, but still recommended.",Jaws 2

A very tense and exciting moment enhanced by William's music. The climax is a little bit like the end of the original, instead of an exploding shark we get a sequence where Brody rams a power cable into its gaping mouth and it gets fried.

161,henrymadman,O.K. Jaws Sequel,7,4 July 2007,"Jaws 2 is a 1978 horrorthriller film directed by Jeannot Szwarc. It is the first sequel to Steven Spielberg's 1975 Oscar winning classic Jaws. Although there would be two further films in the series, Jaws 2 is generally regarded as the best of the sequels. Set four years after the events of the original film, another great white shark arrives on the shores of Amity Island. After a series of deaths and disappearances, police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) suspects that the culprit is another shark. However, he has trouble convincing the town's selectmen. He has to act alone to save the group of teenagers, including his two sons, who meet the shark during a sailing expedition.Like the first film, the production was troubled. The original director, John D. Hancock, proved to be unsuitable for an action film and was replaced by Szwarc. Scheider was also unhappy during production and had several heated exchanges with Szwarc.The film's tag line, ""Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water..."", became one of the most famous in movie history and has been parodied and homaged several times.",Jaws 2
162,the_mysteriousx,"Stop expecting the First Movie again, this one stands on its' own!",8,28 June 2001,"Now that the widescreen DVD's of Jaws and Jaws 2 have been released by Universal we can see that they are very similar in quality and entertainment. Jaws 2 maybe more than any sequel in the summer blockbuster era (that began with Jaws in 1975) seems to really badly suffer from peoples' need to have the same thrills that they did in the first film. We as human beings 'expect' things from everyone in life. Expectations lead to disappointment. Fans of the first Jaws always say Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw are sorely missed in this sequel, but consider this - Shaw's character is dead and Dreyfuss' character does not live anywhere close to Amity, not to mention why would he come back to hunt down a shark again when that is not even his job. It is much more realistic for the town of Amity to have to deal with the shark on its' own. And they don't even know for sure that it is a shark until the latter part of the film. Also, neither Jaws nor Jaws 2 is a realistic story. A shark would not continually terrorize a town so much as the sharks do in both films. However, if it happens once in nature, it can happen again - lightning does strike twice and therefore the premise for Jaws 2 is plausible.Jaws 2 is an excellent sequel, and it can proudly stand along side the original, unlike the other two horrible sequels. It has a verrrrry underrated John Williams score, many of the townspeople from the original film have better, larger roles, it has great shark scenes, solid direction, Roy Scheider, and the outstanding Producer team of Zanuck and Brown. Those guys were old pros and knew how to deliver a different story that also still builds on what the original created. Had they had a chance to produce another Jaws sequel, then maybe the series wouldn't be so malignly regarded as it is now. Even the Superman series with the horrible 3 and 4, just got a boxed set release on DVD. Back to the Future and Indiana Jones and Star Wars certainly will too. So out of the great blockbuster series of the late 70s thru the 80s, only Jaws has not been released as a set. It certainly is not because of Jaws 2, which is one of the great surprises of DVD this year. Universal was not stupid. They realized this was the last good Jaws film, and that they could still make money off of it. They treated the film with respect. The bonus materials are amazing!!!!Jaws 2 is a terrific movie for those of you who are willing to give up your expectations and let the film guide you to its' entertainment and satisfaction.",Jaws 2

And in 99% of cases, it is true.However, Jaws 2 breaks the mold. Not only is it a sequel, it is also a fantastic film in its own right.Like the first JAWS, this movie had its fair share of production troubles. From the original director being replaced, and an actor not getting along with the new director. And to top of it, just like the first film, the mechanical shark had issues as well.Put that all aside, and what you see on film is an exciting and suspenseful ride as you watch the shark stalk (and eat) a group of teenagers who are out sailing for the day. This time, you see the shark a lot more. Face it, there is no need to hide the shark anymore, the first film already did that. Now its time for some more shark action.And the movie delivers on the shark action all right. And to top it off, all of the actors in the movie do an amazing job. Roy Scheider does another brilliant performance as Chief Martin Brody, as does Murray Hamilton who plays Mayor Larry Vaughn. The teenagers were also well cast and they can all act. The score for the movie by John Williams is as beautiful as always.So forget some of the negative reviews from others. This is a worthy sequel to Jaws and it is the last really good one for the franchise. Jaws 3 was ok, and Jaws The Revenge is in a class all of its own lol",Jaws 2
165,~AleXa~,Fails to impress...or do anything for that matter...,4,7 June 2005,"PROLOGUE: For the record, I somehow managed to have not seen Jaws (1975) in my 21 years of life until yesterday, and let me say, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed. It was well- written, well-paced, and masterfully directed, somewhat sketchy in parts, but left open enough to remain believable. I was thoroughly engrossed in the movie from start to finish, and after viewing, could see how three sequels could stem from the lurking thriller, especially with Steven Spielberg in the chair. All I really knew about the movies was that the first was awesome, the 2nd was okay, the 3rd was lacking, and the 4th sucked. So from that, I'd somehow assumed that Steven did the first two and not the last two, and stupid me, I didn't check the listing before I watched the 2nd, so I went into it thinking that Steven could've made it reach newer heights with a better animatronic shark, better attack sequences, and a little more explanation. But I only proved that what they say about assumptions is right Now, you'd like to think that if you make a movie about a killer shark, no matter how lacking the plot is, no matter how inexperienced the director, it would encompass *some* modicum of suspense..you'd like to think.So we're back in Amity, four years later I believe, and yet another monstrous Great White shark has appeared, eating people.except this time, instead of a shark, it's a giant gray piece of rubber popping up and opening and closing its mouth. I mean, seriously, if you can't fork out the cash for a better animatronic shark, then why bother? The shark is so blatantly fake, you never even view the people as being in danger. And what's worse, they show the shark a lot more this time around, which gives you plenty of opportunities for good, long looks at the over-sized piece of rubber.And unlike the shark in the first which really seemed to possess some intelligence, this one seems to get his kicks by simply stalking people and biting boats. It actually kills like what two people? And when it finally did, there was no blood! Was this the director's vain attempt to keep the movie at a PG rating? Umm, newsflash SzwarcSpielberg had believable attacks with blood and still maintained a PG rating.And silly me, I actually thought there might be some attempt at an explanation for how and why the shark exists and why another equally large one has come to the shores of the same small town four years later What was I thinking??And to further aggravate matters, the mayor and townspeople are actually dumber in this one as they were in the first, refusing to believe Sheriff Brody (Roy Scheider) when he proclaims there's another killer shark in their midst, despite the fact that this actually did happen four years prior. But I guess we can chalk that one up to short-term memory loss. Oh waitthat would be LONG-term memory lossso much for that theory.The plot in general is very unstructured and choppy, following no clear direction. It's just a series of poorly put-together 'shark stalkings' as I'll call them, in the last half with the kids on their sailboats, always allowing them ample time to swim back to their boats so it can once again scare the girls into screaming for their lives before it once again brushes past the boat, knocking someone else into the water, and swimming around till they get almost back in the boat and then coming after them and just barely missing. Give me a break! By the end, I was so frustrated, I just wanted it to get *somebody*, even if it *was* Brody's son!!In my opinion, there was no reason to make this moviethis is exactly what Jaws (1975) would've been like with a different director (other than Spielberg).VERDICT: Jaws reincarnate, minus the suspense, the intelligence, and the masterful direction nothing more than a cheap remake of the first. See the first and quit while you're ahead.3.5 out of 10.0P.S. I would like to take this time to applaud Steven Spielberg for saying no to money and yes to cinematic integrityhe saw there was no story to be told and turned it down. Kudos to you Steven.",Jaws 2

I was about seven then, and now I can clearly see the original is far, far superior. But if Spielberg had directed this sequel it could have been, if not as good as that classic, far better than it is. The script is good, with another shark menacing some stranded teenagers, and the shark attacks, while never being 100% suspense as the original, are exiting and well-staged. The cast are okay, although nobody stands out, the shark effects are good and Brody destroys the shark in another inventive and climactic way.

The story is similar to the first in that a great white shark starts terrorizing the New England town of Amity once again. But after a few random folks get killed, it shifts gears to share more in common with movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th. No, the shark doesn't wear a hockey mask, but a group of teenagers take a few rafts and boats out on the water, and the shark slowly picks them off. The shark hides under the waves, attacking mercilessly, and without warning. Just like a summer camp style slasher flick, the killer is all around the teens, and has the advantage. The attack on the rescue helicopter by the shark, and the shark's clever demise (cool effect on this one...) are scenes to watch for in this worthy follow up to a true modern cinema legend.",Jaws 2

170,lumieretrain,Jaws 2 by Jeannot Szwarc,4,15 February 2019,"After the huge success of Jaws by Steven Spielberg, Universal Studios was interested to release a sequel of the movie. It is a risk but at the same time exciting to release the sequel, of a movie which is still one of the most important blockbusters of all time. Steven Spielberg was not involved to release the sequel of Jaws, as he was busy to direct other projects including Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Until the filmmaker Jeannot Szwarc, was involved to direct the project. Like in the first Jaws, there have been difficulties to make the movie, as Roy Scheider frequently clashed with Jeannot Szwarc on the set. In 1978 came out Jaws 2 by Jeannot Szwarc, with Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton. The movie's plot: the police chief Martin Brody must defend the Amity Island again, from the attack of another great white shark. Jaws 2 captured the attention of the fans and the critics by expecting of being surprised like in the first Jaws, of being terrified for the suspense to not see the shark until the end of the story. Then last but not least, of being thrilled to see how the main characters, would face the great beast in the middle of the ocean. Jaws 2 was a huge box office hit, but it disappointed the critics and the fans of the first Jaws. Most of the sequences of Jaws 2 were repetitive to be predictable as the movie focused, on how the great white shark would attack like the one from the previous movie without add anything new. The shark in Jaws 2 would rather be more present than absent like in the previous movie, to see how the shark would act in the course of the story. As some of the most suspenseful scenes would entertain, without necessary follow the whole story. John Williams who wrote the score of the first Jaws, was involved to write the score of Jaws 2 which works to be enjoyable. Jaws 2 is a movie which has flaws, to not satisfy like the first Jaws.

172,arturopanduro,It's not safe to go back in the water just yet.,7,11 May 2000,"Three years after a large great white shark wreaked havoc on a small resort town, the people of Amity Island are experiencing something again all-too familiar: A couple of divers inspecting the wreckage of the Orca on the bottom of the ocean encounter a great white, and in the process, happen to snap some photographs during the attack. In the search for the missing divers, the camera is retrieved, and the film exposes part of the shark. Chief Martin Brody takes the evidence to the City Council, who don't see the photographs for what they are. The beaches remain open, despite many tragedies, and when the chief's son, Michael, decides to go on a sailing excursion with friends against his father's orders, it's up to Martin to save the day (again).The film more or less runs in the same vein as the original Jaws did. There is some suspense, some good (and bad) special effects and a few laughs here and there (some intentional, some not). It's a fun and sometimes cheesy film, far superior than Jaws 3 or Jaws-The Revenge.The great score is by John Williams, and it really adds to the suspense. The acting is good; although Donna Wilkes goes a little overboard with her performance toward the end of the film, and Ann Dusenberry is a gem as the stressed-out Tina. Roy Scheider reprises his role as Chief Brody, as well does Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody, and Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity. My rating: 8",Jaws 2

Dreadfully and painfully boring. It is strange to me how a brilliant film such as ""Jaws"" could have such a bad sequel. But this movie shows how possible it is. Not only was it uninteresting, but it was incredibly predicable. In my mind (or sometimes out loud), I would say what would happen next and, by golly, I was right almost the entire time. And to make it even worse, the story line was unoriginal. Based on what you know from the first one, it is a given that there will be shark attacks. But all that consists of the story is a group of rebellious kids who decide to go sailing and...well I'm sure you can guess what happens next. Without the talents of Steven Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss, this movie suffers greatly.

I can't remember the last time I saw Jaws 2. Before viewing the movie, all I could remember was that the story centered around a bunch of kids out on their little boats being terrorized by a shark. As the minutes passed, I kept waiting for the story to take off. It never did. After half an hour I got bored. After an hour, I got annoyed.
The story fails to build any sort of tension. Just some random shark attacks and Brody trying to convince people another shark has returned. There are a handful of well-done scenes. But, overall, this movie is a major disappointment compared to the original.",Jaws 2

181,j_graves68,... really good when I was 7- really mediocre when I was 30...,5,29 June 2005,"I saw this film in the theatres in 1978 when it was released (this was one of the first films I saw, so of course it was trip since I was only 7). It captivated me, since I was subjected to a movie diet of Disney and ""Star Wars"", so this was cutting-edge SCARE--EEY !!! I saw this subsequent times in the theatre (I think 3) and then rented it umpteen amount of times when it was on videocassette. But then a year later I saw the re-release of ""Jaws"", and there was no comparison. That and the fact I had a few more movies under my belt by then, so ""Jaws 2"" was beginning to underwhelm me. Still, if you dissect the sequel, it's not good, but it is watchable to a degree. Roy Scheider does what he can with such a weak script (and God, the dialogue sounded like lines from the new ""Star Wars"" movies at times). There is hardly a climax, but they still managed to integrate a little suspense (even though they shot themselves in the foot by showing plenty of the shark from the beginning). Was hardly any blood in this movie, but it had a higher body count. The editors/producers had the contrived motion picture formula down to a science.Now in my thirties, I bought this film on DVD to cruise Memory Lane whenever I was sick or bored enough. The special features to me were better than the film IMO, and it wasn't until then I was picking this film apart and watching it objectively. And did I. The dialogue was water-logged, and I don't think even the magic of Steven Spielberg could of resuscitated this fish tail (remember ""1941""?). This was doomed from the beginning, and classic films like ""Jaws"" should never have sequels. Actually, this was one of the first films to template the ""teen-ager slasher films"" of the late '70s/early '80s. As I had mentioned above, this had it's moments, and I am still haunted from the images of watching Tina's boyfriend (Eddie) die along with the shark swallowing the teen-age chick whole (the one who rescues little Sean Brody). They weren't all that bloody, but the imagination turns on as you think about just how long did it take for that girl to die afterwards. Or just what did the shark devour before finishing off Eddie? I even thought the napalm woman who burned up died a pretty horrible death. And that was 1978 where special effects were by no means sophisticated like they are now, and the imagination was more in the front seat back then. But if they hired some better writers and maybe some better actors, we would of cared more for some of those bantering, loud, and unlikable teen-agers (who looked like they were really in their twenties). If Universal wasn't in such a hurry to get this made, we may have had a more elaborate story (not to mention a possible triumphant return of Steven Spielberg & Richard Dreyfus). ""I'm all alone out here!"" DUH !""GO AWAY !""""Sometimes some of the most beautiful girls are the loneliest..."" ""-That's a crock of sh*t !"" ""I know, I know...""?????????!!!!!!!!!""One good bite deserves another"". Well, if you take another bite sometimes you might taste a worm. They did in this case, and just when you thought it was safe to go back into the theatre along came two awfully asinine sequels and a possible 5th installment.",Jaws 2
182,killbill_28,"Great Film, But Its Got Its Flaws!",8,13 August 2006,"I recently just watched all the Jaws Movies on DVD. Jaws 2 starts four years after Jaws 1. Amity is still losing money because of the shark attacks 4 years ago. Roy Schieder returns as Chief Brody also Lorraine Gary and Murry Hamilton return from the first movie. The movie starts with two drivers exploring the bottom of the sea as they stubble along the bottom they find the ""Ocea"" as they are doing this they get attack and eaten by the shark. Its not as scary and thrilling like that start of the first movie because you see the shark and the thrill were's off. Jeannot Szwarc was the third director chosen to direct this film. Steven Spielberg was first choice but refused because he had already made his shark movie, second director John Hancock walked off the movie 2 weeks before filming started, he stated that this movie was too much for him, then French director Jeannot Szwarc took the director's chair and stayed. This movie is full of flaws and you can notice them in the film. First they show the shark too much in this film, the shark in this film worked better then the shark in Jaws 1 but it still couldn't move like a real shark that's why you hardly even saw the shark in the first movie. Second the story drags on and sometimes puts you asleep if you are really tired. The running time of 111 mins go's on and on and it feels like you watching ""Titanic"". Also I notice when I see this film it has some pretty weird camera angles and stuff like that. Jaws 2 made about 191 million at the box office and was the 5th highest grossing film of 1978, Producer David Brown said that it made about 40% world wide in the squeal business, and that's classify as great. My overall of Jaws 2 is a 8, it loses stars for showing the shark too much and for the slow story. But it still a good movie and it was the last good Jaws movie made. Jaws 3-D followed then Jaws the Revenge in 1987.",Jaws 2

OK, I admit there is one glaringly unbelievable part when the shark meets up with a helicopter, but other than that it packs solid thrills.  Ann Dusenberry, who plays Tina, gives a haunting performance after witnessing her boyfriend become shark chowder.  Donna Wilkes is perhaps one of the top three screen screamers of all time.

188,prudhoeboy,Menu Selection,9,29 August 2021,"Overall Jaws 2 was a pretty good sequel to Jaws. Roy Scheider seemed to finally realize that it was his movie and took a leadership role in advancing the action. There was also a lot better character development in this movie compared to the original. Also, this movie really brought the viewer to the town and you felt like you were actually at the beach in that time. So these were deficiencies in the original that were fixed in the sequel. Ok, now for the critique. A lot of the movie was about kids sailing and it began to drag a bit. That part should have been half as long so they could fit another victim sequence in. All they had to do is bring in another shark hunter and biologist like in the original movie and have them fail. Then you bring the kids in with their sail boats. Also, they could have fed the city manager to the shark or the real estate guy on the city council. The audience would have like that. On the positive side, the girls in the show did a good job of going into hysterics redeeming the movie as a true horror flick. This was NOT and ""adventure movie"" as some of the reviews here claim. Also really like the idea of electrocuting the shark and seeing it get cooked. That said, the biggest problem with the sequel is that it really didn't come up with any new false premise to set up the horror like a fisheries biologist educating the people about how sharks are only interested in seals etc. Finally, the show didn't have enough diversity, even by 1970s standards. The shark should have had a little more menu selection.",Jaws 2

Althuogh I don't think Jaws 2 is quite as exciting I do think that it is a exceptionally good film and if it wasn't a sequel would be much more highly rated.The story is similar in certain ways to the first whilst just being different enough to the first to make it interesting. It is much more a like a slasher film with the shark (even giving the shark a deformity). Even having the teenagers as victims. I think the acting is generally good Roy Scbieder is particularly good as a policeman at on the edge. The rest of the cast hold up well and I rarely found the teens in the film annoying.Jeannot Szwarc does a good job, keeping the style of the film similar to the first film. The cinematography is of a very high standard and editing again works very well. John Williams reworking of the original theme works extremely well coming in at just the right moments.

Indeed, there is, but nobody can believe him. Meanwhile, a group of teenagers (including Brody's two beloved sons) go out sailing and are attacked by the shark.The teenager sailing scenes during the day are actually quite haunting and, occasionally, even terrifying. Personally, if I had been given the honors to direct, I would've had those scenes takes place at night; the darkness is naturally scarier than daylight and the shark could seem more realistic because it wouldn't have to be so lighted.I suppose the reason this film wasn't to well-received was because it is so much of a horror film as opposed to a rip-roaring adventure that the first film in the series was.

Of course Jaws 3D and Jaws the Revenge are the ones you should definitely avoid at all costs but Jaws 2 is the one that gets under-looked and unfairly rated because of the bad rep the later sequels did. I assure you all, Jaws 2 is nothing like those said bad sequels films, in fact this film is actually as enjoyable as it's preceding film.Like a proper sequel should do it directly continues from where the first film left off with most of the same characters returning including main protagonist Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), he is just an excellent main character, it wouldn't be a Jaws film without him who has the unfortunate task of dealing with another man eating shark that is terrorising the sea of this island resort town of Amity. Although the film starts off slow but as more of the film gets going the better it becomes. I loved the moments when the shark kills the victims like a horror villain should.Now of course Jaws 2 may not match up to the original film but at least the people who made this film actually tried to make a good film with a decent story.

It almost rivals (or even tops) the original in a few fields, including shark attacks (tops #1, so many shark scenes), scares (Not quite there, more cool than scary, but the scariest of the sequels), characters (well not really but they are still very good), and (obviously) scenery, as the film is filled with colorful, beautiful, aerial shots. And despite practically the same basic plot description as #1 (killer shark, Police chief Brody attempting to kill it) Jaws 2 is nothing like the original. The plot, as you will see, takes a much different turn than in one, and it takes on such a different tone than Jaws also. Jaws has a dark, creepy feel too it, and Jaws 2 has this fun, action-horror thing going. So don't make the mistake I did and assume this is a ripoff of one. Another change to this film is the size and design of the shark. First off, the shark seem smaller ( much more like 13-16 feet, not 25) and much more agile. And second, he gets a bit of a makeover (you'll know what I mean). So with all these changes, Jaws 2 manages to be an epic, exiting film. I liked it.",Jaws 2

201,hypostylin,Fishtail economics,8,30 March 2008,"The Jaws franchise, more than any horror film series, exhibits studio executives at their most unscrupulous. Take a perusal through eBay's selection of original Jaws memorabilia and you'll get a sense of the cultural impact these films had and the extent to which they were pimped out back in the day. To argue back in 1975 -- when the original Jaws was scooping up awards and critical praise for its flawless intermingling of creature feature exploitation and Melvillian leitmotif, while laughing all the way to the bank -- that the notion of a second film was dishonorable would have been met with a hearty guffaw and a good swatting with a bushel of C-notes.Enter Jeannot Szwarc, the French director who brought American audiences what they wanted: a smash-bang sequel that delivered more of the same thrills. Szwarc takes the standard blockbuster sequel approach by substituting subtext with plain old fun, and thus avoids muddling the original film's potent message. Instead of the grizzled and multi- faceted Quint, we get carefree and one-dimensional teens. However, this is not to say that Jaws 2 doesn't bring its own intrigue to the table. The return of Roy Scheider is an essential component of this film, and the subplot where Chief Brody spectacularly loses his job is both interesting and well-executed (even though this storyline has been blamed for singlehandedly giving the film a sluggish pace).Szwarc's focus is graciously straightforward, and his handling of action sequences is so clean and taut that he nearly goes toe-to-toe with Spielberg. At times, the style of Jaws 2 matches the first film so well that I often confuse the two (which one has the waterskiing, again?) The production is filled out by highly competent actors. Along with Scheider, Lorraine Gary, Murray Hamilton, and Fritzi Jane Courney are three other players from the 1975 feeding frenzy who make welcome returns here. Newcomer Ann Dusenberry turns in a rather arresting performance as one of the distraught teens. Furthermore, it's all punctuated by another original score by John Williams that is even better than the music he created for the first film.Whatever its narratives, the Jaws series is a fundamental study of the economics of the film business. Whereas the original Jaws spurred a paradigm shift in marketing, the salary and personnel negotiations that must have occurred in preparation for the sequel must surely be enough to write a book about. If I am going to study financing, at least I have two good movies to use as case studies.",Jaws 2

205,full_meddle_jacket,Lacks Quality Of Its Immortal Predecessor,5,13 February 2002,"Though during its time, ""Jaws II"" was the highest-ranking sequel ever (possibly next to only ""The Godfather, Part II""), this installment in the shark series--the only decent one in terms of sequels--lacks the overall intensity and pure quality of the original. Many key elements are missing. No gripping, poignant dialogue; no strong characters (aside from Chief Martin Brody, reprised by Roy Scheider, who incidentally accepted the role only to end his contract with Universal); no intriguing plot; and the visual effects seen in the original ""Jaws"" have dimmed. One explanation for this may be the fact that the filmakers began shooting before there was a finished script--a bad move for a thriller, especially one that originally had a great sense of character and plot development. The director's attempts to make ""a people movie, not a shark movie"" failed. But, ""Jaws II"" does have its good points; a witty climax (with a signature remark to the Great White from Brody). And though the character development is limited to that of Brody, it really does manage to explore the character a bit further. But finally, for a performance that Scheider accepted to get out of a contract, he does some pretty impressive work...not equal to that of his performance in the original, or ""The French Connection"" or ""The Jazz Singer,"" but not too bad. The best in all three sequels. ""Jaws II"" is as good as the original compared to ""Jaws 3(-D)"" and ""Jaws: The Revenge."" --Bud Sturguess, Texas",Jaws 2
206,brtndr,The Shark Is Bigger This Time,2,23 August 2013,"Before there were Mega Cinemaplexes, we had to stand outside in the hot summer heat for hours just to get the chance to watch a disappointing sequel like JAWS 2. I think for this reason alone, I have been far too harsh in my criticism of JAWS 2 over the years. And, I'm happy to report today that the memories of the anger and disappointment that I experienced that day has diminished enough now that I can provide a unbiased and objective review of this movie for what it was, instead of what I thought the movie ought to be. I can finally put behind me, once and for all, my first summer movie blockbuster disappointment that left me permanently cynical of the movie industry, and temporarily sunburned at a very early age.(I was 9 years old at the time)First, allow me to demonstrate just how far I've come since then by admitting that JAWS 2 was probably the best of the JAWS sequels. Which admittedly is like saying that a kick in the rear is a lot better than a punch in the face. Or, as in the case of JAWS 4, a hammer to the head for that matter. Not much of a compliment to heal the pains of yesteryear, but it's a start anyways.Unlike the future sequels, JAWS 2 at least started out promisingly enough by continuing the storyline of Chief Brody and his family. And, even made a decent attempt (early in the film) of recapturing a sense of terror from the unseen ocean depths that the original movie magnificently accomplished.However, JAWS 2 started going horribly wrong when the audience first sees the shark far too early in the movie. Maybe it was impossible for the sequel to recreate that first big scream moment when we first see the shark? But, to show the shark so early, without much build up either, leaves the audience feeling that this isn't the movie they paid to watch.This idea to show the shark so early proves to be such a major failure for the movie, that it makes you grateful (truly grateful) that the shark in the original JAWS broke down, forcing Spielberg to use the eye of the camera, and by proxy the imagination of the audience as the substitute for the actual shark. Big difference.Eventually, Chief Brody becomes the lone person attempting to prove that the mystery of the sudden strange deaths and disappearances on the island is the result of another giant shark in the area. Strangely, no one believes Brody that another giant shark is terrorizing the islanders again, and the town counsel becomes convinced that Brody is suffering from some type of giant great white PTSD, or something. Despite the fact that the island was terrorized by a giant great white just three years ago.The final resolution to the story eventually develops into a teenagers-in-jeopardy movie. In a 70's exploitation flick kind of way. Strangely, the teenagers are being slowly terrorized at sea by a giant shark that has over the coarse of two movies (by my count) already taken down three boats, a Killer Whale and a helicopter. But, can't seem to figure out a way of dealing with these teenagers in tiny broken sail boats for some reason, who have no means of defending themselves.I mean c'mon! What is the shark waiting for? Is the shark just biding his time, cruelly toying with its intended victims until he makes his final move? What ever the case maybe, the sudden uncharacteristic behavior of the mass murdering giant shark towards the teenagers destroys any sense of suspense and intrigue for the audience. And, you actually end up rooting for the Shark to just attack the teenagers to get the whole thing over with, so we don't have to spend anymore time with these people.After the movie, I remember walking past a long line of people waiting outside in the hot summer heat in anxious anticipation of seeing the sequel to JAWS for the very first time. Just as I had done only a few hours ago. Somebody waiting in line asked me as I was passing them, ""How was the movie?"". I turned and replied, ""The shark is bigger this time!"". Admittedly, it's not exactly a ringing endorsement, but at least it was one good thing I could say about the movie at the time.",Jaws 2

209,robertandrews-44556,Call me crazy......but I prefer Jaws 2 over the Original Classic,10,3 July 2017,"I first discovered the JAWS movies when I was about 8-years-old. I saw the original JAWS and loved it. It gave me nightmares for weeks, and made me all the more afraid to go near a beach. Several weeks after watching JAWS, I was introduced to JAWS 2 by a friend of mine who had rented the film from a video store. At the time, I was not even aware that the original Steven Spielberg classic, JAWS, had a sequel let alone three. Anyway, my friend and I both watched JAWS 2 together and it was then when I discovered my favorite entry in the JAWS franchise.....JAWS 2.The story takes place four years after the original. Martin Brody (again played by the excellent late Roy Scheider) begins to suspect another Great White Shark is stalking the Amity waters after two divers and mother and daughter go missing. He tries again to warn the Mayor (again played by Murray Hamilton), but again, all the town's people seem ignorant of the threat.Meanwhile, a group of teenagers, including Martin's two sons, Mike (Mark Gruner) and Sean (Marc Gilpin), head out on a sailing trip where they are attacked by the shark. Also with them is Larry Vaughn Jr. (David Elliot), the Mayor's son. The last half hour of JAWS 2 is pure action as the teens are attacked again and again by the shark, as they try desperately to drift toward an island called Cable Junction. Not to spoil it scene by scene, the final confrontation again features Chief Martin Brody and the giant shark--this time including a power cable.JAWS 2 is usually considered the best of the sequels. I can agree, as I am not a fan of JAWS 3D or JAWS: THE REVENGE. However, I often find myself torn between JAWS 1 and JAWS 2. For a long time, I tried to make myself like the original JAWS, but it was then when I came to discover I always had more fun with JAWS 2. As many other reviewers have pointed out, JAWS 2 is more of an action movie than a horror like the original, and I find that this action is shot in such a thrilling pace that it leaves you on the edge of your seat right up until the end of the movie.When I was a kid, I also found myself feeling more for the teens of JAWS 2 rather than Martin Brody, Matt Hooper and Quint from the original. Probably because when I first saw it, I was about Sean's age from the film, and could understand what terror the kids must have been feeling during their confrontation with this menacing predator from the deep. I also think there is more of a sense of shock and terror in JAWS 2, as the kids in the film had no idea about the shark. In the original, the three men went out to sea to hunt the shark. Hooper was a marine expert on sharks and had come up against them before, and due to the fact that the three were hunting the shark made it less scary for me. In JAWS 2, the kids are simply sailing when the shark attacks, so I felt it was more of a shock.Some people may call me crazy, but I have always preferred JAWS 2 over the original. I find myself always wanting to watch the sequel over the original. However, I am still a HUGE fan of the original, and do consider myself a JAWS fan period. Not much a fan of JAWS 3D and REVENGE as stated, but then again, I never mind sitting down and watching any of them, but my favorite will always be JAWS 2.10/10",Jaws 2
210,GorgonHeep,"Despite Most Opinions, This Movie Is Well Done",8,19 June 2001,"Most would disagree with me, but I tend to like "" Jaws 2 "" more than the first "" Jaws "". Having Roy Scheider in it obviously helps it's cause, but I think "" Jaws 2 "" tends to hold more excitement than the first, though with less suspense. The most exciting part is when the kids' boats have capsized and they are forced to tie together and drift upon the wreck, hoping that they are not attacked by the shark and that they can make it to land. I think the strongest individual scene that this movie offers is when Cynthia Grover's character Lucy is sitting by herself upon the wrecked boats praying to God and Mary that she and her friends will be saved. Later in the movie, Lucy is almost killed as the shark rushes toward her, but God must have been looking out for her, as the shark grazes her and she survives. I'm quite impressed with Cynthia's acting ability, though I've only seen her in "" Jaws 2 "" and "" "" Network "" ( where she is credited as Cindy Grover ).",Jaws 2
211,lee_ross_1996,The legend continues...,5,9 December 2013,"Three year later in 1978 the legend of Jaws continues in this sequel, although, not as good as the original is still has it good points. The sequel focuses on Martin Brody's children – as we see in the first one Mike Brody likes to go out on his little boat, but in this one he goes sailing with a few of his friends, and before he knows it the shark is after them, and the dramatic score kicks in.One of my biggest criticisms of this film is that there is no resolute ending, they just seem to appear stranded on some desolate island, but who cares at least the shark is dead.Another thing what grinded my gears about this film is Donna Wilkes who stars Jackie Peters – watch this video before continuing and you'll get the picture – http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_MMTqI6Yxo Now that you have watched that I think you'll understand. Yes, I understand completely they could potentially get annihilated by some shark, but that scream is just hideous and it nearly made me turn the film off.Overall, as a sequel to Jaws the film does seem to have a relatively stable plot. 5/10.",Jaws 2

213,coneill97,Mediocre Sequel to One of Cinemas Finest Thrillers,3,30 October 2019,"Jaws 2 is a hugely disappointing film, primarily due to its lack of originality. Apart from the fact that it has a teen slasher vibe to it, the plot is almost identical to the original. This time, however, director Steven Spielberg is absent.Roy Scheider returns as Chief Brody and is by far the best aspect of the movie. He is the only character in the film that is given any character development, as we see the effects that the events of the original film have had on him. Unfortunately, almost every other aspect of the movie is lacking.While giving the movie a teen slasher feel was a wise move, it was executed very poorly. The teens in this movie are dull and lack character. There is absolutely no emotional investment in these individuals, especially compared to the trio from the original, who were fleshed out characters that you cared about. The acting by the youngsters is also quite poor.Murray Hamilton returns in this film as Mayor Vaughn. It is very frustrating to watch him oppose and doubt Brody once again, having learned nothing from the first movie. This character choice felt like lazy writing on behalf of the screenwriters.The shark sequences are poorly shot and edited and don't have the same nail-biting tension of Spielberg's classic. What made the original work so well was how little we see of the great white. In this movie, the shark is seen much more and is even present in the very opening scene.The filmmakers also attempt to turn the shark into a sinister villain, giving him a scarred face and having him destroying a helicopter. It felt as if they were trying to outdo the original with bigger and more outlandish sequences, including its death by electrocution.What I found so surprising about this film was how ineffective John Williams score was. His original score is one of the most iconic in cinema history, yet here it felt bland and didn't stand out or enhance the action sequences in any way.",Jaws 2
214,Peter-171,Mostly boring and unbelievable-,3,18 January 2001,"Most of the movie except for the shark attacks and maybe some other scenes was downright dull.

This especially goes for the shark attack on a coast guard helicopter which had landed on the water. This turned out to be a good movie to laugh at. Because I don't think that was the intention and because of the things I mentioned, this movie gets a 3/10.",Jaws 2

The shark is very good and has the right size to scare people (like usually). I liked the scar on his face. He looks like a devil and really is scary! Good thing to have added it for the film. But the real problem in the movie is that there are some long scenes without the shark. I know, perhaps it is normal (same in the first Jaws) but still, I don't like it! It bored me to death. The other boring thing is that the shark after he attacks the teenagers, every time the film comes back to silent while the shark is still wandering around them, every time it is the same. That is the real problem. It is just not right. The filmmaker should have added stronger scenes with more attacks and more actions. It is a real deception. Sorry to say it. By the way, the shark's death was a real success! The special effects were cool! The shark gives us a good fear feeling! Bravo! I don't recommend it strongly, anyway.

Weekend at Bernie's 2, and of the Ernest films(though I respect the man for his enthusiasm of the outdoors, may his soul rest in peace.), etc. There have been some bad sequels out there, but I don't count this in with them. There is an entirely original plot line, the reprisal of the characters in not too shabby, and the special effects are stunning, especially the electrocution of the shark at the end. Overall, this is not a bad sequel. Though, I must say I don't care for the similarity of the ending to the original, where he keeps telling the shark to do things with its mouth.

I know it wasn't as good as The Original Jaws, but I think it's still got the sufficient bite. Chief Martin Brody Returns Once Again, and I thought he was a little bit more entertaining as The OG Jaws Especially At The end where he just white washes that Shark Alive. The shark looked JAWSOME! It looked so badass with the scar and being more brutal Than OG Jaws. The music is still really good, and honestly this felt more safer to watch because unlike the original Jaws, they wanted to make this more of a friendly jaws film by not having much blood and gore as well as being more of a teen movie, which is fair. But other then that, if you guys are looking for a fun, Suspenseful film like the original, this ones for you.

221,eliasbelrhiti,Really dissapointing comapred to the original,4,20 August 2020,"I knew that the Jaws sequels are nowhere near as great as the original Jaws movie, but nevertheless I decide to give them a shot.Instead of giving it a full review, I will just list out the movie's flaws (in comparison to the original Jaws):Firstly, Jaws 2 does not contain the element of surprise that the original has and is also much more predictable as the shark is much more present on the screen and there is no surprise attacks by the shark unlike in the original. This also alleviates the amount the tension and suspense the movie has which therefore makes it less thrilling than the original film.Secondly, the musical score of Jaws 2 which is similar to the original is not appropriately used in the film, as it is not able to deliver as much tension and suspense as the first movie's score did.Thirdly, although there were quite a few things at stake at the final showdown, I found the shark's final death quite underwhelming especially compared to being blown up in the original Jaws and therefore did not give me the full satisfaction that the original gave me.Lastly, I felt that some of the characters pretended that the events of Jaws did not happen, which gives me the feeling that there was little character development or change in between the 2 movies, especially for the Mayor and other supporting characters.I will end it there by noting its positives, despite the movie being really disappointing, it was still entertaining to watch and had a few of its moments but not enough to redeem itself. I also wanted to note that Jaws 2, unlike other Jaws sequels, is a 50/50 (60% Rotten Tomatoes, 51% Metacritic), you might like it or not.",Jaws 2

Peter Benchley didn't write a sequel to the novel Jaws. So the movie was purely the studio's idea.Despite the doubts from the fans, Jaws 2 is actually a pretty good movie. The use of the score is dead on with the original, and makes many of the scenes with the shark intense. Especially when the shark attacks the sail boat titled ""Tina's Joy"". Some of the scenes are pretty cool too, like when the shark attacks the helicopter.Most of the actors do a good job especially Roy Scheider who returns as Chief Brody. He's still very good in the roll. However some of the acting is really exaggerated, especially the actress who plays Jackie. All I can say about that is, ""Overacting at its finest."" The biggest problem with this movie is that after the scene where the shark attacks the water skier, the movie starts moving slow and barely anything happens until 20-30 minutes later. The common movie goer will probably get bored by this, but trust me, if you're patient, it'll be worth it, because the movie really kicks in at that point and doesn't stop until the end.Jaws 2 is a really good sequel.

230,njt-63687,JAWS 2 is the best of the three sequels!,8,23 March 2019,"Sure, it can't top the original 1975 classic, but this film is definitely the best of the sequels. I won't diss JAWS III (1983) or JAWS: THE REVENGE (1987) because, in spite of what most people think, they are not terrible movies. Not as good as the first two films, obviously, but not terrible, either. Moving on.While most people seem to criticize the first hour or so of JAWS 2, that's the part of the film I like the most. I know the second part has more excitement with the shark attacking the teenagers on the sailboats and Brody needing to get them out of their situation and all that, but there's something about the first part that I find more likeable. It could be a number of reasons...(1) The shark only makes brief appearances and you hardly see much of it - similar to JAWS (1975) where you don't see much of the shark until later on in the film.
(2) It builds up the tension as you wonder when and where the shark will strike next after we've seen it attack the water skier and the boat driver.
(3) It gives Brody more time to realize there's another shark in the water while everyone else dismisses him.
(4) I can relate to the scenes on land more since I don't go swimming at all...and thus, can imagine what it must have been like to know a shark is in the ocean and not knowing where or when it's going to attack next, as was mentioned in #2.
(5) Some other unknown reason.Regardless, it's a great film and it doesn't deserve the negative criticism it's been receiving. Of course, JAWS 2 will never be as good as JAWS, but to consider it a bad movie is really low. I know there are those who praise this film and I appreciate that. But, to those who negatively criticize it, it's definitely uncalled for. I guess it's just a matter of tastes. Not everyone is going to like this film.One other thing: this is the only JAWS film in the franchise where I actually agree with the MPAA rating of PG. It has intense violence, but gore is very limited and not ONE of the victims is shown being eaten by the shark. It's implied, of course, but it's not actually shown, unlike what the other three films in this franchise have shown. Before I end this review, let me share what ratings I would give the four films in this franchise.JAWS - R

231,bigpapapumpct,This movie suuuuucks!,3,19 April 2020,"JAWS 2 is a wildly overrated borefest. I just pulled it out again last night for the first time in a number of years and boy was it bad. Just boring, boring, boring and extremely forgettable. After the credits rolled it felt like I hadn't even really watched a movie. There's just nothing to it. No meat on the bones. And boy does the shark look bad. Only The Revenge has a worse looking shark. And on top of that they show it WAY too much.It isn't without positives though. There are glimers of foreboding with Brody. There are spots where you can really feel his dread. However they don't last all that long. The movie could have really built on Brody's paranoia and playd to that. The scene where he walks out into the water to retrieve the piece of boat and the body was pops up was well done.Another thing I really appreciate about JAWS 2 is it has the exact same look of the first film. You can watch them back to back and they both look almost the same.The musical score is really good too. John Williams made some nice additions to the original music.I should mention I laugh every single time when the kid is pumping up his raft boat with the foot pump while spouting a monologue with an accent and the raft part pops. That is legitimately funny.I also watched the deleted scenes and I don't understand why any of them were cut honestly. They were all actually pretty good and would have added a bit more to the overall film had they been left in. I especially like the one where the Mayor votes to keep Brody as Sheriff while all the others vote to let him go. That to me was a redeeming moment for the Mayor. The parking ticket scene was funny. And the underwatch helicopter shark attack was a nice extenison too.Anyway, I don't feel the need to watch this movie again anytime soon. If I do, it's probably going to be quite a few number of years.

233,pbubny-1,Not bad for a rehash,3,24 January 2005,"The original ""Jaws"" was a summer blockbuster that time has proved to be an unexpected classic. (I mean, they teach that movie in film schools now.) When ""Jaws 2"" was conceived, the studio didn't think in terms of doing justice to a classic; they looked at the amount of money that ""Jaws"" was piling up very quickly and hoped to make lightning strike twice. So ""Jaws 2"" was, in the words of Steven Spielberg, ""an exercise in corporate business."" It jettisons the interaction among the mismatched trio of shark hunters from the first film in favor of putting a group of mostly whiny (and in one case, relentlessly shrieking) teens in jeopardy. It asks us to believe that ANOTHER jumbo-sized great white shark would happen upon the same little East Coast island resort. It is erratically paced and often poorly written (by a couple of the same team of writers who shaped the original ""Jaws"" script). It is marred by some special effects shots that should have either been re-shot or scrapped (at one point, the shark's lower jaw is CROOKED as it lunges out of the water).Even so, this ""Jaws"" fan has a soft spot for ""Jaws 2,"" because it's the only one of the three sequels that has enough elements of the original to make it watchable. (In fact, ""Jaws 3D"" and ""Jaws The Revenge"" are beneath contempt.) Reprising his ""Jaws"" role, Roy Scheider is as good as could be expected given the lack of a consistent script or any opportunity to work with costars on the level of Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. John Williams turns in one of his most underrated scores, building on the sound and style of the original without lamely repeating himself. Director Jeannot Szwarc does manage to create some pretty scary and suspenseful sequences, unlike either of the directors who followed him in this series. And even if the whole thing is nothing but reheated leftover fish cakes, it still tastes pretty good.",Jaws 2
234,Eels14,More enjoyable than the Original,9,5 September 2008,"No doubt the first Jaws movie is by far the best and no one can or should ever dispute that, but I have found the sequel to be more enjoyable for it's young cast and story line.Jeannot Szwarc did a great job by putting into effect a young cruising culture into the movie in the form of sailing, just like what we find with young people and cars today. The young and unknown cast back than who are still unknown today all played a great part in the movie, especially towards the end when they were all stranded out at sea with the shark terrorizing them.Originally the movie was headed in another direction, but the director decided to go back to the island of Amity with the original cast members from the first Jaws movie. A great decision which kept the interest from the first movie still going.Three scenes really stand out with the shark which gives the movie it's deserved terror, young Eddie being eaten alive while his girlfriend witnesses in terror, the shark eating the helicopter which may seem a bit unbelievable but a great moment added to the movie and the final scene with chief Brody and the shark. The earlier scene with the water skier was enjoyable which gave the audience a taste of things to come.I think if most people don't try and compare Jaws 2 to the original they will probably appreciate the second movie a lot more and give more credit which it definitely deserves.For me it's a 9 out of 10 and the last Jaws movie worth watching a number of times.",Jaws 2
235,KingFilmsCo,Jaws 2 ~ It Tries,6,5 March 2018,"Jaws 2 does not get an ""A"" for effort, but it definitely earns a ""B"" or ""B-"" for effort. To be fair to Gottlieb, Szwarc, et al., they attempt to build characters, flesh out ones we already knew (sorta), and try to still tell a story while ramping up the shark mayhem from the first movie. And to their credit, I was surprised by the movie's insistence to get to know a wider range of side characters on top of Roy Scheider's world-weary Brody, anchoring it all.That being said, just because the movie tries does not mean it particularly succeeds. Jaws, aside from the shark, really focused around the fine performances of three very talented character actors, playing believable, well-written, and likable characters. Brody, Quint, and Hooper were clearly-defined personalities that played well off one another, with their own motivations, backstories, and skills.While it's unfair to judge the sequel *solely* in relation to its predecessor, it is only to temper your expectations. Suffice to say: the characters introduced in Jaws 2 are not compelling, have believable reactions and motivations, and are not particularly interesting. You have a parade of one-notes: the sleazy real-estate developer, the incredulous doctor (""Sharks don't take things personally, Mr. Brody!""), and a gaggle of annoying teeny-boppers who were put in because the producers knew which audience to cash in on. In a cynical display of movie-making, you have every archetype of teen present - someone for every baby boomer to relate to!More effective are the returning cast. Cashing in on the nostalgia of the first was somewhat successful, as it is nice to see characters like the Deputy, the Brody's, and Mayor Vaughan again - as well as the town of Amity itself (counting it as a character). The best moments are between returning cast members/veteran actors - the world-weariness on display is either an appealing way of establishing the story, or an authentic reaction to being dragged on to do a sequel to a giant shark movie! I likewise saw myself enjoying the return and to ""see how things were going."" It is depressing to learn that more interesting ideas - such as Amity being ruined because of the shark attack and resorting to mob financing - were scuttled in favor of a rehash of the first story, complete with ""we can't close the beaches its tourism season!"" beats. I don't know how the producers/writers can be so dismissive of the billion Jaws rip-offs when they themselves are guilty of the same crime. Hypocrisy of the rich/famous I suppose!It seems as if half the movie is dedicated following around the lives of Amity's teens, as they try to go through the pangs of growing up: going to dances, asking each other out, sailing, and avoiding a gigantic rubber shark mounted on a motorized platform. I can understand, and on a conceptual level, appreciate the attempt to make the adolescents more than mere shark fodder. However, none of their stories or personalities are interesting, and their scenes slow the pacing down to a crawl - to the point where you start to think of them *as* mere shark fodder, hoping, hoping, hoping that that damn thing shows u p and eats one of them (particularly Donna Wilkes, who spends the back half of the movie screaming non-stop) to pick the movie up. If you have been wondering this whole review ""When is he gunna start talking about the shark?"" then I've given you a taste of what you will feel watching Jaws 2. Whereas Jaws saved its payoff for the end, and allowed strong writing to propel the movie, Jaws 2 lacks those strong moments and thus makes you yearn for the shark. Szwarc decided, against the opinions of his crew, to show off more of the shark. On the downside, it means more chances to see how fake the thing looks (you will see its rubber mouth crease and fold inwards in one bad shot). On the upside, it gives the movie a means of punctuating the doldrums with some shark action! In an inverse of its predecessor, the shark is the best thing about Jaws 2. It does more silly stunts, well shot by the talented crewmen. It rams many more boats, it generally acts like a dick, grabbing teens and launching them into the hulls of their own craft, and even gets involved in a incredibly stupefying scene in which a lady, attempting to kill the shark, pours gasoline on herself and lights herself (and the shark) on fire. From that point on it sports some cool, wicked scars. If Szwarc cannot be praised for his job at adapting a screenplay, he nonetheless made sure that the real breadwinner - the action scenes - were well done, and entertaining. It has the unfortunate side effect of making the movie incredibly stupid, though, especially as teens start behaving as slasher victims would and destroy their own attempts at survival (the boat version of tripping over one's self, ha ha). Oh, and helicopters too. Lots of fun to be had with these moments!You only wish there were more. Between the over-extended focus on unimportant side-characters, and the lack of interesting things for Scheider to do, the movie quickly starts to rub you the wrong way - with the exception of the shark sequences. As a movie, and a monster movie, it is still an above-average effort from a competent crew, but it is brought down by an overly commercial approach to its setup and payoff. Reading further into the making-of, it was said that Arthur C Clarke and Peter Benchley each had sequel scripts that were turned down. Otto Preminger at one point was even a choice for director. Weep for what could have been bold, weird, or idiosyncratic choices and direction - for what we were left with was Jaws 2: an ok, so-so movie that takes few chances and doesn't give us the goods nearly enough.",Jaws 2
236,marshalllancaster-95185,Good movie,7,11 June 2020,"There are unfair comparisons to the first movie. This movie actually holds up well. It is vastly better than the two 80's sequels, but nothing tops the first Jaws.",Jaws 2
237,Genevieve_Patrick,"""I don't intend to go through that hell again!""",8,16 September 2009,"No possible way to be better than the original. No way. Because the original was basically a creative and productive fluke that became a staple suspense classic due to primarily two things: Spielberg's amibitious direction and Verna Fields' FLAWLESS editing. (She won that Oscar for a damn good reason.) ""Jaws"" was nothing but mistakes, but Verna Fields' editing covered up every single one. It's basically a miracle of film-making, now how can you surpass a miracle? ""Jaws 2"" does one thing EXTREMELY right: it spends time analyzing the trauma resulting from shark attacks, or people that have witnessed them. One of my favorite parts of this sequel is when Brody and some men rescue that girl whose boyfriend got eaten the day before. She was cowering under the rim of the boat the entire night, muttering incoherently, and nearly catatonic from primal fear. I didn't think a sequel to ""Jaws"" could invoke something so relatable. That right there gets my props. The Editorial Review for this is too mean-spirited. It ain't necessarily wrong, but it just focuses on the superficial negatives. Watch the film, and a real story does emerge. Chief Brody, forever scarred by his aquatic showdown with Bruce, acts somewhat rash and a little obsessive, but can any one of us blame him? Spielberg put this guy through a wet Hell three years prior (see review title). I'll just say some things I enjoyed about it. It's the only sequel that comes closest to reflecting the visual cadence of the original. Contrary to the above, it does have a nice style, and the photography might be the prettiest you get in the entire franchise. Why does a ""Jaws"" movie look so pretty? It is directed by a Frenchman, after all. Apparently, Jeannot Szwarc knew Zanuck and Brown by directing episodes of ""Night Gallery"" like Spielberg did, too. He pulls off some gorgeous and difficult shots in this film. (Keep an eye on the shark's POV of the waterskier -- it ain't miniature, it's full-scale live.) Surprisingly, the gore is considerably less than the original, which is basically a bloody mess of a film if you think about it. There is some nasty violence in it though: the attack on the boyfriend I mentioned before, and the girl that gets swallowed whole near the end. Look, just have fun with the helicopter attack and the manic girl that won't stop screaming at the end. Love the shark the filmmakers nicknamed ""Scarface"" and the fact that he can survive an explosion being only inches away from it. But best of all, enjoy Roy Scheider giving his wife's boss some come-uppance with a parking ticket. ""Jane Eyre"" this film is not. Overall, check this out, it's not a waste at all. I watched this with my sister, a marine biologist, which is a novel way to view something like this. She can attest to some facts about the beached killer whale, but great whites just don't get as big as Shamu. It's fun to imagine if they did. Ironically, perhaps the best piece of the DVD is the Behind The Scenes Making Of Feature. It is thorough, comprehensive, informative, and engaging as hell. AT LEAST as good as the ""Jaws"" Behind The Scenes with Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss, which was exceptional. These ""Jaws"" crews know how to make something out of nothing, that's for sure. Not necessarily essential, but still recommended.",Jaws 2
238,syed-16295,Jaws has been demoted to a generic teen slasher flick,3,30 December 2019,"Jaws used to be a great example of suspense, build up, and pay off done right. A film that to this day keeps people out of the water. This cash grab on the other hand does the complete opposite.Remember how chilling it was when Chrissie got ragdolled by a hidden force under the waves? Remember how disturbing it was when little Alex got chomped on by a shadowy figure in the distance? The fact the shark was so obscure made these scenes all the more terrifying in the original. In this movie, they shove it right into your face from the get go. Instead of a force of nature, the shark is now just a generic movie monster. They even gave it a ridiculous facial scar to make it more ""villainous."" I'm surprised it wasn't petting a cat or twirling its mustache too.We had a great ensemble of characters from the original. The chief of police who's afraid of the water in Brody. The smart, nerdy shark expert in Matt Hooper. The grizzled, tough shark hunter with a traumatizing past in Quint. We trade those great characters for generic teenagers right out of a Friday the 13th film. They are simply unbearable and uninteresting shark chum. What's the point of putting characters like that in a dangerous situation if you don't care about them?The film ends with a finale that pales in comparison to the original. Brody holds up an underwater wire that the shark bites and slowly electrocutes it to death. Not only is this ending very anticlimactic compared to the explosion from the original, Brody's one-liner just doesn't work. He says ""say ahhh"" like a dentist to the shark. Brody's ""smile you son of a *****"" one-liner right before the shark explodes is a timeless, bad*** and above all, satisfying moment.Jaws was a film that never needed to become a franchise. It stands alone as a timeless classic. It was milked dry by a greedy studio that used its name for quick and easy cash grabs like this one.",Jaws 2

Only Roy Scheider returns from the memorable trio of actors that the first film gave, and he wasn't nearly as good as he was.This Jaws is, in two words, a teen movie. There's suspense, oh yeah, whop-de-doo. Not. (here's a few spoilers; don't read on if you don't want it spoiled) After a couple of really stupid scenes, a bunch of teenagers are trapped on a boat in the middle of nowhere with a killer shark lurking in the depths of the ocean, and only one person can rescue them all and save the day (guess who?)What else is new?What I'll say now is probably what you'll hear most often when you ask somebody about this film: It could have been a lot better.",Jaws 2

You actually care about the various characters and you don't question a ludicrous premise--a giant shark attacks the same exact community--this is GREAT directing. You don't question it. You believe it. The second film is harder than the first film to pull off. The director did a great job at changing the tone of the film, which is much more pop culture and bright, when it would have been very easy to imitate the darker more serious tones of the first film. In some strange way, Jaws 2 is really the father of the summer blockbuster, where Jaws was an artistic anomaly.

242,bigelowam,A good sequel lacking many qualities of the first,7,23 November 2005,"The first JAWS was a well done masterpiece. That is obvious. However, where JAWS is at its strongest, JAWS 2 lacks greatly. Sure, it's a good sequel, but it lacks so many qualities from the first. Let me list just a few:1. A bad supporting cast. Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw made JAWS riveting and funny. This movie has a lame supporting cast. Murray Hamilton looks pretty much evil and Lorraine Gary is OK. Everyone else are nobodies. 2. Not a lot of strong characters, so they have to make up for it with far too many characters 3. They took the direction from Jeannot Szwarc, who also did SUPERGIRL (not exactly a classic) and that was pretty much it. So the directing is not exactly top-notch. 4. Not enough suspenseful moments to be up there with JAWS. Sure, there are a couple of moments in this movie where I was on the edge of my seat, but it wasn't enoughThere are good qualities about this movie. Roy Scheider is excellent as the paranoid Brody, who is the only person that thinks there is a shark. John William's score is terrific and is better than the first. The story isn't too bad either. For people who haven't watched JAWS will probably find a dislike to this movie. For people who have watched JAWS or are die-hard fans, it's definitely worth a look.Overall: 7 out of 10",Jaws 2
243,maurovicmarin,"Not thrilling at all, unnecessary sequel",4,16 October 2016,"Jaws 2 (1987)"" is the sequel to the first Jaws"" directed by Steven Spielberg. This movie is directed by Jeannot Szwarc but the actors and place is the same as the previous one.A couple years have passed since the last shark attack on Amity Island, as we can see from Chief Brody' s elder son who is now 17. A couple of scuba divers visit the proximity of Amity Island and dive to take pictures of The Orca"" that sunk in the first movie. A shark surprises them and kills both of them but they dropped a camera which contains evidence of the attack. Another two attacks are needed to make the mayor aware of the situation. Chief Brody takes everything in his hand and hunts the shark down.This movie is completely different from the first one, i found it more focused on the family of the chief than on the shark attack. Who appeared only later in the movie. It's not as bad as it could have been but the plot is just not as good, the scenes are boring, and it doesn't provide enough tension.The attacks aren't thrilling at all, and nothing really happens that would switch the tension of the movie, it's just a plain and simple story of a normal shark attack. It's really just a poorly made sequel of a great movie, that tried to gain fame through the previous one.I wouldn't recommend watching this movie, in fact i would rather watch the first part twice than the second part.

During the period of 1975 to 1978, we would be able to say we saw a few great movies such as All the Presidents Men, Marathon Man, Rocky, and so on.Now imagine you see a movie in the summer of 1978, about a chief on a island trying to tell his superiors there is trouble in the surrounding waters. Would it really matter if he had previous experience with a terrifying monster in the same locality he now seeks to protect?Do you think you would enjoy a picture where promiscuous, adventurous teenagers are being stalked by one of the greatest predators to have ever lived, yet with less of the campiness and stupidity of 1980s horror films?These are the reasons in which I enjoyed this film. The score is derivative, yet excellent. There are scenes which display nostalgia, yet are completely realistic and intrical to the plot. Many scenes in the movie may not be understood by a virgin viewer of this franchise. Some of the acting is indulgent, such as tbose playing Chief Brodys sons. Ellen Brody once again gives the movie its human touch. One will no doubt compare the characters actions of the two films. However, the movie, when standing alone, will no doubt entertain even the most cynical of cinephiles.If I am at all entertained by a movie, I will give it at least a 7 on this site. I can then deconstruct the film after that and award points based on production qualities, acting, plot, script, and so on.

The movie is almost as political based as JAWS but it didn't have the magic. I think the writers' idea of keeping the shark's face burnt almost throughout the movie was quite bad. It would have been beautiful if the shark would have it's own face instead of a burnt out one. But certain parts of the movie i liked very much:- 1.The Chief's fight against the town authorities. 2.The destruction of the shark. 3.The time when the Chief shot st the bluefish with great urgency. 4.Mike Brody 5.All the friends of Mike. In fact like the original movie it's a both theater & family entertaining movie.

This film shouldn't have happened, this film should never have seen the light of cinema, it is repulsive and unattractive in every way, I mean, the rare occasion of an enormous great white, a misfired rogue attacking an idle beach community created the masterpiece of Jaws, repeating this is purely idiotic, I mean trying the same thing twice, thrice and ultimately four times is just plain lunacy, and I mean it, doing the same thing over and over and expecting the same results is the definition of insanity so I'm told. And this is what they did, they were quite insane, I would like to have stopped Jaws 2, and in effect stopped 3-D and The Revenge, I would like to have preserved Jaws as a stand- alone classic, and left it at that. But they couldn't leave it alone could they, they just couldn't help themselves. I suggest ignoring all these entirely unnecessary sequels because for pity's sake, the fourth film forgets the third, and the continuity becomes truly deranged, so its best to be ignorant, and just to only accept the original, to leave your world at that.

But by comparison to the sniveling kids who just sob and scream Brody is a hero. You'd think they'd have had people on hand to educate the cast on these fairly simple concepts.The real villains in this film are the kids and Brody.

Of course this second Jaws-movie was made without the 29 years young, fresh, imaginative, risk loving Steven Spielberg sitting in the director's chair. It was made by someone already in business. If you follow a path, a known pattern you risk less, you can avoid mistakes other people have done, you can use devices of story telling, filming etc. but you can never create a fresh movie. That is what happens to almost all sequels of great movies. Two divers find the ORCA under water somewhere out in the waters of Amity, then suddenly they are attacked by a great white that goes on eating tourists on the coast of Amity. Brody yells again to close the beaches, authorities don't listen, so he has to fight again the beast, all alone. Sounds like the first movie.Burn marks on the shark's face, a shark hunting down teenagers on boat trip, etc. JAWS 2 adds nothing new to the concept after all, except Brody and the audience learns that sharks are not only attracted by blood, but by noises, too.Calling JAWS 2 not a great movie would be right. Calling it a bad movie would be wrong. At least it gets the story going all the time. It's not that exciting like JAWS, because we already know from the first 5 minutes there is a shark again and we can imagine how the shark looks like - indeed it looks a bit different this time, some say better, I say less natural but still very much OK. Someone said he would also be afraid even if he knows the shark is only mechanical. True! There was always a difference in the look of Bruce.

259,ryanfellowsfitts2,Not a very good movie,3,14 September 2014,"I'm not saying Jaws 2 is a bad movie. I'm saying it has a hell of a lot of expectations to live up to. Jaws 2 is missing a lot of stuff the first one had. It is quite unrealistic too. A second shark comes to Amity and starts eating people. It chases a ski boat and ends up killing the skier and the ski boat driver. I don't think a great white shark could even swim that fast. It attacks a helicopter and brings it crashing down and eats the driver. Wouldn't the blades have sliced the shark? The second Jaws seems to have an interest in boats and planes because it attacks a lot of those. The teens screaming honestly gives me a headache. There were some good scenes. When the shark eats Eddie, it was entertaining but his lump of a girlfriend doesn't help him up. I think the very best scene was when the shark ate Marge from behind. This is the only scary scene in the film and still scares me. These two scenes are the only reason I gave the movie a 3. The ski boat chase wasn't too bad but it was highly unrealistic. So what I'm saying is Jaws 2 isn't a bad movie, it just wasn't that good and had a lack of fun and terror the first one had but it is very far much better than the next 2 sequels.",Jaws 2
260,sleepyhead_zzz27,Not as bad as everyone makes it out to be,7,25 February 2008,"While Jaws2 isn't an instant classic like the first film, it is not as bad as people make it out to be. As far as sequels go, it was actually pretty good.Sure, the shark looked slightly fake and unrealistic, but come on! It is still better than the other two sequels. Compared to the obviously fake sharks and the flat story lines in Jaws3 and Jaws: The Revenge, Jaws2 is a stellar movie.I thought there was nothing wrong with focusing on Chief Brody's family, or the rebellious teens. I felt it was a very realistic account of teens going against their dad's will, not knowing what was good for them.I didn't find that Brody acted like he was a shark expert. He had reason to believe their was another shark because of the missing divers, the boat accident, the dead whale, and the pictures. If you had fended off a shark, then found a dead killer whale with bite marks, as well as a picture that looks like a shark, wouldn't you suspect that another shark could have staked a claim in the water again?

Scheider's Brody still has the screen presence that you know he is about to kick some butt, the shark itself does still look a bit fake but then it was late 70's and it was not done by CGI, the shark still terrifies and quite frankly I was glad to see a lot more of it as it is basically the star of the film opposite Brody, all in all it is no way better than the original but then not many films are, but this is a worthy follow up..",Jaws 2

They kept the same style of suspense from the first film and honestly I think at times it's more suspenseful. The way the score accompanies the scenes even though I know what happens from watching this many times, I still find myself at the edge of my site many times throughout. The cast does a great job, in my opinion. Roy Scheider really steals the show for me and he definitely portrays a more evolved version of Brody. He really does a great job of showing what kind of effect the events of the first film had on his mind and the film does have some good moments that delve into his psyche. There are moments where, even though I know another shark is out there, I can still see the others' point of view when they think he's just lost it, and he does clearly seem to be losing it at points. It really is a shame that the rest of the sequels got as bad as they did. Although I always feel the fourth film kind of repaired some of the damage that Jaws 3D did, and it did have some strong moments (I thought killing off one of the brothers was brave until I remembered it was about some stupid ""shark revenge"" thing, and I still really like that moment that the other brother has with his daughter and how it parallels a similar scene from the first film between Brody and his youngest) it still wasn't that good.Jaws 2 is definitely the best of the sequels but, for me, it's more than that. I think it was well done and well executed. Did it have its problems? sure. I feel they could have done a better job with some of the side characters, namely the city council. It was very clear they were just there to disagree with Brody. And the climax, while pretty good, isn't as memorable as the first film. But overall I think it's a fantastic film and I almost always watch it if it pops up on TV.",Jaws 2

I own a book called the '50 worst albums of all time', and while it has it's share of obscure failures by people no one ever heard of, it makes the argument that the worst albums are ones made by people who should know better, saving the top 2 spots for Lou Reed and Elvis Presley (and makes a strong case against everything Billy Joel has ever done).

I had seen the film periodically over the years, always on VHS, always pan and scan, and always with the picture oddly compressed - the characters appearing taller, skinnier, etc.  I think that such things really detracted from what I now consider to be good film and worthy sequel to Jaws.Although Richard Dreyfuss's Hooper is missed, the time spent on character development in this film more than compensates. The relationship between the Chief and Ellen is finally developed - something that was lacking in Jaws. I also thought that Jeannot Szwarc did an excellent job directing. I still have trouble swallowing (pun intended) the ending, but in the end have concluded that Jaws 2 is every bit as enjoyable as Jaws.

The film couldn't be as good as the original Jaws, that was a given to everyone (ie. This included Paramount,the producers, writers,actors and fans) But somehow, everyone involved in creating Jaws 2 released a worthy succsser to the original Jaws. The storyline wasn't the best, but it was good enough. The script lacked character development and the floating wreckage with the teens was too drawn out. And the mechanical shark breaching the surface of the water was overdone. The original Jaws was highly successful, yet the shark was rarely seen breaching the waters surface. Jaws 2 had a group of talented young actors and the seasoned stars of the movie were great. Although the plot was weak as was character development, the movie was successful.

284,xalva_,"Spectacular reinterpretation of the first one, with more action and less horror",8,5 January 2005,"First, sorry for my English 'cause I'm Spaniard. Jaws 2 is a movie that always arouses different feelings. In one hand, it's a good (watchable) sequel with more action and less tension (because we already know what will happen due to the first movie) with good-designed characters (more credible than Hollywood's new hits) and well-showed Amity Island's life. In the other hand, and source of the bad reviews, is that Jaws 2 is basically a reinterpretation of Jaws, the first one (with the same virtues, with the same fails, but the same), the main characters are the same, the context... Nothing has changed, nothing new is contributed... is to tell the same story, few years later. J2's got the same fails and virtues of a 2nd part too: more characters (adopting the model of teen's horror movie). But, if the first one was good, this one can't be bad. I think that in a franchise like this is impossible to contribute new things (Jaws 3-D could have done it with a story in a new context ""Sea World building"", but it didn't well) so, the only reason to make a sequel was to amass a succulent box office and go on entertaining the audience. Furthermore, the Jaws franchise became the most reliable series to be a blockbuster, because other imitations (plagiarisms) were failures. Jaws 2 did well on the Box-Office: #1 in the opening week. Worldwide gross: $209,000,000 (one of the ten most successful movies of the 70's decade). It shows that the audience went on trusting in Jaws. So, Jaws 2 is also the only sequel that the most of people like, and the only one that did well on the Box-Office. I think if the Critics crushed it it's because it's like the first one, but the first one had got a surprise. Jaws 2 is a good movie, a very good sequel, but is also the loser when it's compared to the Jaws, because it was a Milestone, the birth of a new kind of cinema that moves the masses to the theaters and influenced the society. Jaws 2 only follows to tell the same but more spectacular, and less bloodthirsty too. Some scenes are very good like the shark's pursuit with the water skier, the ending, the attack to Mike... I think a sequel was necessary, but only one sequel. Jaws, a true scary movie. Jaws 2, an excellent adventure film.

286,Slade_Wilson24,"Terrible, overrated sequel that had no reason to be made",3,23 February 2017,"Jaws 2, a sequel to the classic Jaws, unfortunately it comes nowhere close to the original. The story lacks direction, the characters are nearly all the same and the acting is crappy, except for Roy Scheider's performance.The first half of the story is revolves around Police Chief Martin Brody investigating the deaths of 2 divers, 2 skiers and a Killer Whale. One of the skiers tries to defend herself, but it is so painful to watch. First, she picks up some canister and pours a liquid on her head, she drops the canister, and picks up a flare gun, instead of shooting the shark she shoots gas tanks on the boat, which just explode and kill her instead of the shark, how can one character be so stupid? Brody brings an oceanographer named Elkins in to identify what killed the Killer White. From the size of the wounds, Brody thinks a Great White killed it, Elkins says it is either that or another Killer Whale. The following day, at the beach, Brody sees a dark shadow that approaches the swimmers. Thinking it is a shark, he frantically orders everyone out of the water and causes a panic by firing his gun. However, the shadow is revealed to be a school of bluefish, causing Brody's bosses to get angry with him and for everyone else to think he is insane. Brody acquires a close-up picture of the shark from one of the missing diver's camera, he takes the picture to the Amity town council, but they deny the evidence and refuse to believe it, and fire Brody for causing a commotion on the beach the day before. There's no motivation or logic to this, they just deny the evidence and refuse to believe that it was a shark, I mean, a shark was already able to make its way into Amity Island in the first Jaws movie, so what's stopping another one coming in? This was probably one of the stupidest parts of the movie. After all this, Brody's teenage son Mike disobeys his father by sneaking out to go sailing with his friends after they goad him to, but his younger brother Sean catches him and persuades Mike to bring him along. After an argument at the dock, one of Mike's friends, lets Sean come in her boat with her, and after a couple other grouping arrangements, they head out, going past a team of divers. Moments after going underwater, one of the divers encounters the shark. Panicking, he rushes to the surface, causing an embolism. Soon after, the shark comes across teenagers Tina and Eddie, Eddie falls in the water and is killed by the shark. The story is now revolving around the rest of the teenagers trying to survive in the ocean, it completely went out of focus from Brody's arc and moved straight to the teenagers. Half of them are boring caricatures, and the other half are the same characters that have the same reactions. It just becomes a bore-fest from here watching some of them die, the shark attacks feel raw and real, but they have no emotion as you just don't care for any of these teenagers. In fact, I was sitting there hoping the shark would just destroy the boat and kill them all since they were so boring. Anyways, Brody eventually tracks them down, and the shark targets his boat, he loses control and smashes into a pile of large rocks, which pointlessly adds no tension whatsoever. So Brody then makes his way towards the shark and sets a raft in the water and pounds the power line with a boat paddle, creating a rhythmic vibration under the water that draws the shark under. When the shark resurfaces, Brody pounds the line some more, causing the shark to charge him, it gets close enough he forces the power line into its mouth which electrocutes the shark to deathSo remember how we rarely ever saw the shark in the first Jaws movie? Well this movie does the complete opposite thing and shows the shark in the widest shots possible, and the ominous themes of the first movie have been replaced with bombastic soundtracks which completely kill any tension or thrill during the shark attacks. This movie didn't really bring in anything the original Jaws didn't already have, and completely went away from character development and focused too much on visuals. The movie is so painfully stupid, the characters are stupid, the story is incoherent, the shark attacks have no emotional weight or tension to them and the most of the actors barely tried with their performances. It's an insult to the original, and it's a pointless sequel.",Jaws 2
