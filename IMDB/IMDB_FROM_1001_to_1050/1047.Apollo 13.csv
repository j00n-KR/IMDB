0,TheLittleSongbird,No problems here,10,22 June 2017,"'Apollo 13' had so much going for it, being based on an actual event that continues to move and inspire, Ron Howard showing evidence of some fine films and on paper a great cast. The great news is that with the promise that it had 'Apollo 13' delivers.For starters, it's a technical tour-De-force. It's beautifully photographed, the space setting is enough to leave one in awe and the special effects still hold up incredibly well today. The music score is provided by the now regrettably late (as of two years ago) James Horner. To me it contains some of his best work.It is a hauntingly beautiful score that gives a real sense of adventure, tension and mystery, ""All Systems Go-The Launch"" in particular, the opening trumpet theme and ""Lunar Dreams"" very close behind.There is a great script too, regardless of accuracy or lack of it 'Apollo 13' is up there with having one of the most quotable scripts for any film that decade. Ed Harris has the best lines, but the most unforgettable and oft-quoted line is ""Houston we have a problem"". The story is the kind that leaves one in awe, biting the nails with its high levels of suspense, wrenches the heart in a poignant way and also very inspired. 'Apollo 13' is lengthy and deliberately paced but neither are issues, like they could have been potentially, everything else is just too good.Howard's direction is some of the best he's ever done. A huge asset is the acting, which is nothing short of excellent and often more than that. Tom Hanks excels with an ordinary character that he plays with understated command. Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon are welcome contrasts, Gary Sinise is a reliably strong presence and Ed Harris' superb performance to me was the best performance of the cast.In conclusion, brilliant film, no problems here. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Apollo 13
1,Leofwine_draca,Works a treat,7,2 January 2019,"Probably THE space movie of the 1990s, APOLLO 13 is Ron Howard's magnum opus: a lengthy, detailed examination of the infamous real-life disaster which saw three crew members come close to death thanks to their malfunctioning craft. To say more would be to spoil the experience, but this is an example of old-fashioned filmmaking at its best. There are a few weak CGI effects but mainly this story is told by the dedicated team of actors, none of whom do wrong. It's a slow burner for sure, but the premise is so unusual and so interesting than it works a treat from beginning to end.",Apollo 13
2,SnoopyStyle,Old fashion epic,8,19 September 2014,"The space program is still haunted by Apollo-1 test accident on Jan 27, 1967. Man finally lands on the moon on July 20, 1969. Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) is the experienced leader. Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) is the brash eager young gun. Both Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) are aiming to be on Lovell's crew. Lovell is slated to be on Apollo 14 but gets bumped up to 13. Mattingly gets sidelined for not having had the measles and backup Swigert is put in his place. They are sent up on April 11, 1970. Having already achieved the landing, the world isn't paying attention to this mission. That is until things go wrong. Ed Harris plays the Flight Director Gene Kranz and Kathleen Quinlan plays Marilyn Lovell.This is a compelling story on its own. On the surface, this is the B-side of the epic man's mission to Mars. However director Ron Howard meticulously retains the details of the mission that makes it all come to life on the screen. That is the greatness of this movie. It is epic in all of its small details and its scope. All the actors are giving sincere performances in an old fashioned movie.",Apollo 13
3,kosmasp,Fly me to the moon,9,5 April 2021,"Maybe do not fly me there. I mean apart from the journey itself being quite strenuous, what would you do there? Of course if you are an astronaut - like fully blooded astronaut, you see things differently. Yes others made the journey before, but still why wouldn't you want to go there too for even more stuff to explore? Exactly ... and that is how we get to learn our crew.Very well casted and very well played. Now if you know the real life story of what occured, you may not be as much on the edge of your seat as others. But I do believe even those who know how this ends, will find themselves really rooting for the people involved and really being glued to the screen as they say.Very well made film that gives us as much tension and drama as we can take. With such an amazing cast, nothing could have gone wrong either ... well no pun intended.",Apollo 13
4,classicsoncall,"""We just lost the moon.""",9,29 May 2018,"Even knowing the outcome, the strength of the movie is in putting you right in the space capsule along side Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) in what was one of the best nail-biters in history. The world was transfixed at the time wondering how and if these brave astronauts would ever make it back to Earth. What one never thinks about are all the behind the scenes decisions that go with selecting who goes on a particular mission, how their families feel about it, and how important it is to the men themselves to be a part of history. The other element that amazes is how many integrated parts come together to enable such a space mission. One sees the booster rockets fall away shortly after launch and figure that's it, the men are on their way to the moon. But then they have to dock with the lunar module and carry it along for the voyage. When the astronauts suffered their cascading set of problems, the ingenuity required by both the men on the ground and the pilots in the space craft demonstrated just how much teamwork was necessary to bring them back home safely.What's baffling to me is how Ron Howard was overlooked for a best Director nod for this picture. Though the film itself got an Oscar nomination, Howard was eked out by the guy who directed ""Babe""??? That's just a travesty, even if one doesn't care much for Howard as an actor or director. I'm not saying he should have won it, but gee, what were they thinking?",Apollo 13
5,gavin6942,A Great Space Tragedy / Victory,8,24 April 2015,"NASA must devise a strategy to return Apollo 13 to Earth safely after the spacecraft undergoes massive internal damage putting the lives of the three astronauts on board in jeopardy.First of all, a nice shout-out to the great Roger Corman, who appears here in a cameo, and Clint Howard, who has a cameo himself. Corman had a similar small role in ""Silence of the Lambs"", and it is great to see directors he helped raise giving him a nod of appreciation.Today (2015), those who think of a stranded in space movie may think ""Gravity"", but ""Apollo 13"" did it first and did it better. Maybe they did not have the impressive visuals that ""Gravity"" has, but they knew how to tell a good story and build suspense -- and, best of all, it was completely grounded in reality.",Apollo 13
6,lee_eisenberg,13 and every mission since.,7,17 March 2006,"Some critics treated ""Apollo 13"" like it was the best movie of 1995. I didn't regard it as such, but it is worth seeing as a part of our country's history. As it was, I didn't even know about the Apollo 13 mission until this movie got advertised. Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Kathleen Quinlan, Ed Harris, and Gary Sinise all do very well with their roles.Looking back on the history of space exploration, one notices that every mission since Apollo 11 seems to have gone wrong. Apollo 13 had its snafu, the Challenger exploded, the mission in 2003 exploded, and a mission last year had a screw-up. Maybe ""I Dream of Jeannie"" convinced the astronauts that they would get to have hot genies, and they could only think about that and not concentrate on their missions (no offense to ""IDOJ""; I love that show). OK, so maybe it didn't work quite like that, but something seems to have gone wrong.All in all, a very well done movie.",Apollo 13
7,jboothmillard,Apollo 13,7,17 June 2005,"Most people will recognise this based film because of its iconic catchphrase, and to be honest, that is all I could remember from it, so I'm glad I got to watch it again to get a proper perspective, directed by Golden Globe nominated Ron Howard (Splash, Ransom, A Beautiful Mind, The Da Vinci Code, Rush). Based on the true story, in July 1969, astronaut Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) hosts a house party, where the guests watch the first successful landing on the Moon, where Neil Armstrong stepped onto the surface. Lovell, who previously orbited the Moon on Apollo 8 in December 1968, tells his wife Marilyn (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Kathleen Quinlan) that he intends to return to the Moon to walk on its surface. Three months later, his boss, Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton (Chris Ellis), informs him that due to problems with Alan Shepard's crew, his crew will fly Apollo 13 instead of 14. Lovell, Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise), and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) train for their new mission. However, days before the launch, Mattingly is exposed to German Measles, and he is replaced by backup pilot Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon). Lovell is not happy with this mission, but Slayton threatens to bump crew to a later mission if they do not go ahead. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband getting killed in space but goes to the Kennedy Space Center the night before launch to see him off. On April 11, 1970, Flight Director Gene Kranz (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ed Harris) gives the go-ahead from Houston's Mission Control Center for the Apollo 13 launch. As the Saturn V rocket climbs through the atmosphere, one of the engines cuts out prematurely, but the craft reaches orbit and continues towards the Moon. Now in space, Swigert performs the manoeuvre to connect the command module Odyssey to the Lunar Module Aquarius and pull it away from the spent rocket. Three days into the mission, the crew makes a television transmission, which the networks decline to broadcast live. After Swigert turns on the liquid oxygen tank stirring fans as requested by Mission Control, one of the tanks explodes, emptying its contents into space, and the other tank is soon found to be leaking. They attempt to stop the leak by shutting off two fuel cells, but this fails. With the fuel cells closed, the Moon landing must be aborted, and Lovell and Haise must hurry to power up the Aquarius to use as a ""lifeboat"" to return home, and Swigert shuts down Odyssey before its battery power runs out. In Houston, Kranz rallies his team to come up with a plan to bring the astronauts home safely, declaring ""failure is not an option"". Controller John Aaron (Loren Dean) recruits Mattingly to help him with the rescue mission, to find a solution to the problem. Swigert and Haise watch the Moon pass beneath them, as they are using the lunar gravity to slingshot them around it, Lovell laments his lost opportunity to walk on the lunar surface. With Aquarius running on minimal electrical power, the crew suffer through freezing conditions, and Haise becomes ill and moderately feverish. As Swigert suspects Mission Control of withholding information from them; Haise angrily blames Swigert's inexperience for the accident; and Lovell quickly calms the argument. When carbon dioxide approaches dangerous levels, ground control must quickly invent a way for the astronauts to have enough breathable air to make it home. With the guidance systems on Aquarius shut down, the crew must make a difficult but vital course correction by manually igniting the Lunar Module's engine. Mattingly and Aaron struggle to find a way to turn on the command module systems without drawing too much power, and finally transmit the procedure to Swigert, who restarts Odyssey by transferring extra power from Aquarius. When the crew jettisons the service module, they are surprised to see the extent of the damage. Aquarius is released and they re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, but no one is sure if the Odyssey's heat shield is intact and will hold. The tense period of radio silence due to a blackout is longer than normal, but the astronauts eventually communicate and splash down in the Pacific Ocean. Helicopters bring the three men aboard the recovery ship USS Iwo Jima, where they are greeted with a hero's welcome. Lovell's voice-over describes the subsequent investigation into the explosion, and the careers of Haise, Swigert, Mattingly, and Kranz. He wonders if and when mankind will return to the Moon. Also starring Mary Kate Schellhardt as Barbara Lovell, Emily Ann Lloyd as Susan Lovell, Miko Hughes as Jeffrey Lovell, Max Elliott Slade as Jay Lovell, Jean Speegle Howard (Ron's mother) as Blanch Lovell, Xander Berkeley as Henry Hurt, Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as Sy Liebergot - EECOM White, Ray McKinnon as Jerry Bostick - FIDO White, and Rance Howard (Ron's father) as Reverend. Hanks does well as the ordinary astronaut trying himself and his crew calm through the dangerous situation, Paxton and Bacon are equally good as his co-pilots, Quinlan is memorable as the worried wife, Harris is likeable as the chain-smoking mission controller, and Sinise is fine. You can tell Howard was going for a completely factual account of the events of Apollo 13, from the actors being in weightlessness to all facts and figures behind the mission, it does get your attention at the crucial moments, a well-made and interesting drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Visual Effects, Best Music for James Horner, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Special Effects, and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama. It was number 50 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Houston, we have a problem.""), and it was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!",Apollo 13
8,ccthemovieman-1,Made Me Want To Study The Real Apollo 13 Astronauts,9,17 February 2008,"This was a very well-done true story of a space mission that came extremely close to being a disaster, but the astronauts miraculously made it home safely. Except for some language problems, it's good storytelling and so interesting that it made me want to study the real Apollo 13 astronauts.The movie is fairly long at 140 minutes and there is not much ""action"" but there is a lot of suspense and first-rating acting, both of which should keep anyone's interest. Knowing this was a true story makes one all the more involved with it. You can usually count of Director Ron Howard putting out an interesting and well-photographed film.What also was interesting to me, too, was to see these actors, most of whom usually play volatile characters- or did prior to this film - act in such low-key roles. I refer to Ed Harris, Gary Sinise, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon.By the way, one of the young Lovell children was played by Miko Hughes, who became a co- star in a film - ""Mercury Rising"" - several years later.For such a tense story, with these astronauts lives on the line, none of the astronauts or people at NASA or anyone's family members are ever seeing praying throughout this ordeal! You can bet, in real life, a lot of prayers were answered on this mission.Overall, this is good movie-making and recommended.",Apollo 13
9,rmax304823,Nice execution of uplifting family movie.,5,3 November 2006,"Sometimes I find myself getting them mixed up -- Ron Howard, Rob Reiner, Penny Marshall. Even Spielberg's heartwarming kiddie movies. They're often enjoyable viewing and they're suitable for children of all ages. Early conflicts between two people of honor are resolved. There's often a patriotic theme. Very few cuss words. The musical score tells us emphatically that this is a moving experience. Maybe not the Second Coming exactly but a dangerous trip to the moon or a damned good baseball game. And don't worry. Our side wins.This one is about a failed trip to the moon. The ""failed"" part of it is gotten past pretty quickly and the emphasis shifts immediately to a different challenge -- can we get the crippled craft and its stressed-out crew back to the earth in one piece? The answer of course is yes, so it turns the movie into a story of triumph instead of tragedy.I don't mean to apply too energetic a hammer to the real events or the real characters. It's pretty spooky stuff, being up there, looking at the earth when it's no bigger than a street lamp. The rest of us who tremble when we have to climb a ladder higher than the first-floor windows can only marvel.And the story itself, no matter well or poorly told, has enough suspense and awe intrinsic to it that we can't help being drawn into it.What's bothersome is the slick commercialism that seems to provide the craft and its story with its real source of power. You know ahead of time that we'll spend time with the anguished wife at home, that we'll see one endangered astronaut sharing pictures of his lovely family with the others. The reporters will becoming a nagging, intrusive nuisance. The wife will be given a line like, ""If this moon landing wasn't good enough for the press, why has it become news now that it won't land?"" There are a multitude of technical problem that arise when the side of the craft pops and deconstructs, and they're rushed through as if the audience doesn't really care about the challenges or how they're met. Or -- maybe not that the viewers don't care. Maybe they're too dumb to understand. The technical glitches and maneuvers seem to present challenges to the film makers as well -- how quickly can we get rid of the uninteresting metallic junk and get back to the suffering of the crew, the ground support, and the families? It succeeds extremely well in doing what it intends to do, but what it intends to do makes few demands on the maturity of viewers. It's like a very complicated jigsaw puzzle and after you put it all together you have a picture of three dogs in vests playing cards.You know what could be gripping? The real story of the Challenger disaster of 1986. With an emphasis on the groupspeak of Raytheon, Mission Control, and NASA. Maybe the hero could be Richard Feynman. You should have seen him cut through the blizzard of technocrap thrown up by the engineers and bureaucrats playing CYA at the hearings. Here they are, explaining what happened by evoking ""ambient temperature values"" and ""minimalizing coefficients."" And Feynman asks politely, ""You mean when it gets cold the rubber shrinks?"" And he demonstrates by dunking a piece of rubber in a glass of ice water. Doesn't that have more cinematic potential than this movie's Ed Harris shouting, ""Failure is not an option""?However, the kids should enjoy this, and it's worth watching for everyone, if only because it is based on a true story. Its heartwarming qualities aside, everyone involved in an enterprise like this -- successful or not -- should be applauded. And whatever they're being paid, it's not enough.",Apollo 13
10,Tweekums,A gripping real-life story of a near disaster in space,9,21 July 2017,"On the 21st of July 1969 man first walked on the moon; that was the Apollo 11 mission, a few months later NASA is preparing for the third mission to the moon; Apollo 13. That mission is to be flown by Apollo 8 veteran Jim Lovell, Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise, who were originally due to fly the Apollo 14 mission. They train for the flight then, a matter of days before the launch, Mattingly is grounded because he may have the measles. He is replaced by standby astronaut Jack Swigert. This isn't the last of their problems by a long way. There is a problem with a rocket shortly after launch but that doesn't threaten the mission. Three days later when all appears to be going well Mission Control orders Swigert to stir the oxygen tanks; something goes wrong and there is an explosion. It soon becomes clear that they will not be landing on the moon; success will just be getting back to Earth. Everything from now on is far from routine as the crew, and those on the ground must solve problems that had never been envisaged.Given that this film is based on real events and I knew how it ultimately ended it is surprisingly gripping. The depiction of the events in space are particularly good; we get a real feel of what the crew are going through as conditions in their cramped living quarters deteriorates. Even those who know how the story ends are likely to learn new details such as the way everybody on the ground worked to find solutions to the various unforeseen problems and Mattingly tries out various ideas on a simulator. The biggest revelation for me was the fact that until things went wrong the American public seemed so indifferent to the mission so much so that the crew's broadcast from space wasn't aired by the TV networks. The cast does a fine job; Tom Hanks is great as Lovell and is ably supported by Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon as crewmates Haise and Swigert. Those 'on the ground' impress to; most notably Ed Harris as mission controller Gene Kranz and Gary Sinise as Mattingly. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody interested in the Apollo 13 story or gripping tales of men struggling to overcome adversity in general.",Apollo 13
11,ma-cortes,Overlong and big budgeted re-enactment based on the real event and known outcome,6,8 September 2020,"Exciting and thilling film about three astronauts whose aircraft leaking fuel tank has made a moon landing impossible , plus the power drops so low and the toxic gas levels rise so high , as several technical problems threaten both the astronauts' survival and their safe return at Home. It had been less than a year since man first walked on the Moon , but as far as the American public was concerned , Apollo 13 was just another routine space flight mission until these words pierced the immense void of space . In the deep outer space takes place the explosion in one of two oxygen tanks helping power and leaving three astronauts tumbling throughout the beyond . With the electrical system kaput and oxygen running low , the men seek refuge in the Lunar Excursion Module . Stranded 205,000 miles from home in a crippled spacecraft , astronauts Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) , Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and led by Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), fight a desperate battle to survive . Meanwhile, at Mission Control, astronaut Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinese) , flight director Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) and a heroic ground crew race against time and the odds to bring them Earth .Failure is not an option. Houston, we have a problem.A realistic adaptation in almost-documentary style being based on true events, it turns to be a correct reenacment of the 1970 Apollo lunar mission that ran into a problem , as the famous : ""Houston, we have a problem"" . This is a tale of how a group of astronauts and technicians face off a risked situation and the process delivering the dramatic payload , describing faithfully the averted tragedy, bravery , heroism and showing a testament to the creativity and intelligence of the scientists who ran the early space missions . The tension comes from communication breakdown , the confrontation on the ground between the boffins and the official services and the falling-out among the crew . However, being low in dramatic scenes , makes some claustrophobic , and resulting to be a little bit boring . Interesting but heavy and dull script , in fact the suspense is missing ; being writen by uncredited and prestigious John Sayles , while Apolo 15 commander David Scott served as a consultant . There is an enjoyable reunion of notorious actors giving nice performances that subtly restating traditional notions of male heroism . It joined director Ron Howard and Tom Hanks from ¨Splash¨ and Hanks and Gary Sinese from ¨Forrest Gump¨ . Tom Hanks is perfect , as always , giving a highly effective acting , while Bill Paxton is acceptable and Kevin Bacon great fun . Main actors Hanks , Bill Paxton , Ed Harris , Kevin Bacon , Gary Sinese are well accompanied by a plethora of familiar secondaries , such as : Kathleen Quinlan , Miko Hughes , Xander Berkeley , Brett Cullen , Loren Dean ,David Andrews, Ray McKinnon , Clint Howard , Michele Little , Chris Ellis, Joe Spano . Great special effects from James Cameron's Digital Domain , impressive production design , adequate cinematography by Dean Cundey , rousing musical score by James Horner , and adding TV footage is to a dramatic effect.Ron Howard directed efficiently this mega-hit but with no much originality , concerning the 1970 moon-shot sticks so faithfully to the version related in Jim Lowell's book ¨Lost Moon¨ that this can qualify as the most lavish documentary/drama ever made. The film is decent and acceptable but Ron Howard has made better films than this some tiring rendition. As Howard has a long career , both actor and director , shooting a lot of success , such as : Willow , The Missing , Cocoon , In the Heart of the Sea , A beautiful mind , Ed TV , Frost vs Nixon , Ransom , Backdraft , Code Da Vinci , Angels & Demons , Cinderella man , and several others . Rating : 6/10. Acceptable and passable .",Apollo 13
12,moonspinner55,Yet another Ron Howard movie that doesn't dig very deep...,6,7 August 2005,"True story adapted from the book ""First Moon"" by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kruger about a trio of astronauts (headed by Lovell, played here by Tom Hanks) who encounter disaster in space while on 1970 lunar mission. The public's indifference and the finger-pointing at NASA get the short shrift in favor of the hand-wringing wives--an excruciating subplot--and the outer space camaraderie (leave it to director Ron Howard to turn even the most harrowing circumstance into a warm fuzzy). Good performances and an undeniably emotional climax make ""Apollo 13"" worth-watching, but the film is fairly humorless, and technical without being particularly enlightening. **1/2 from ****",Apollo 13

But as such, then this wasn't fully a very necessary movie, except for boosting American ego.What made ""Apollo 13"" watchable was the impressive cast list and their individual performances. And I will say that the ensemble of actors and actresses here really was phenomenal.For a space movie then ""Apollo 13"" isn't really amongst the most interesting, perhaps because this was science fact and not science fiction. That, at least, was the breaking point for me. Being familiar with the actual story then I found this 1995 movie, well, unnecessary, to be honest.""Apollo 13"" is worth watching for the star quality acting performances, or if you are not already familiar with the actual historical events.A good enough movie for what it turned out to be; a mediocre visualization of real events.",Apollo 13

16,hitchcockthelegend,Exhilarating recreation.,8,27 February 2009,"This is a recreation of America's third NASA mission to land on the moon in 1970, and the subsequent disaster that almost befell the mission........Director Ron Howard and his producer Brian Grazer, made a top draw picture about an incident that everyone knew the outcome too. That it engrosses and thrills to make the inevitable denouement a mere component of a whole, is quite a fabulous achievement. Sure it can be said that it lacks a certain political appendage {RE:The Right Stuff}, but for the duration of this picture we are wowed by the design and construction on offer. It would have been easy for Howard to use stock footage of real NASA missions, but all sequences are recreated by the makers with astonishingly impacting results, thus adding authenticity to the palpable tension when things go belly up.Howard was wise in his choice of leading man, who better than Tom Hanks {Jim Lovell, who's memoirs the script worked from} to portray a bastion of Americana?, nobody, because Hanks is perfect, as are Bill Paxton {Fred Haise} and Kevin Bacon {John Swigart} sitting either side of Hanks, a couple of bona fide solid and respected actors you could not have wished to have. Down on the ground the acting is also exemplary, Kathleen Quinlan as the fraught Marylyn Lovell is fantastic, with Ed Harris {Gene Kranz} and Gary Sinise {Ken Mattingly} adding emotional weight to the unfolding drama. With Howard reining in his trade mark sentimental flourishes, Apollo 13 relies on its story and its craft to steer it safely home, and safely home it gets, just like the men of Apolo 13. To give us a punch the air joy that comes as much out of tension relief as it does because of raw human emotion, quite a picture indeed. 8/10",Apollo 13
17,Theo Robertson,The Dangers Of Space Flight Hollywood Style,6,28 July 2003,"I actually wanted to become an astronaut as a child but soon went off the idea when I realised going to the moon would have involved sitting in a capsule that`s basically a tin can with thousands of tons of rocket fuel strapped to my ass . In short the dangers of space flight surpassed my courage and my feelings of endeavour . It takes guts to travel through space and if you get into serious trouble aboard a space craft you`re in danger of suffering a quick spectacular death or a slow lingering one
APOLLO 13 is the Hollywood blockbuster treatment of the ill fated mission to the moon and is a testament to the courage of astronauts everywhere . The film starts with the tragic accident of an earlier Apollo mission that left three astronauts dead and then goes on to tell the tale of the Apollo 13 where an oxygen tank explodes on the module close to the moon meaning the three man crew are almost certain to suffer a slow lingering death 250,000 miles out in space . It`s a true life drama fairly well told even if it does have a few flaws . For example director Ron Howard`s camera work moves around a bit too much while having a big name star like Tom Hanks detracts slightly from the drama . It would have been totally compelling if we`d had a slightly flat directing style with unknown actors , but like I said this is the Hollywood blockbuster treatment which needs to make money at the box office , so I guess we can forgive that . Astronauts are very brave people and APOLLO 13 makes light of that fact , so it`s a success .",Apollo 13
18,Boba_Fett1138,Good drama but could have been less technical.,8,20 September 2003,"The movie has some very good drama but it gets sometimes a bit to technical which makes the movie sometimes hard and difficult to fully follow.Maybe the best thing about ""Apollo 13"" is the wonderful cast. Especially Gary Sinise and Ed Harris are more then great. Ed Harris actually really looks very much alike the real Gene Kranz. But of course the rest of the cast is also excellent. A very well cast movie.Another great thing about the movie are the special effects. They are really superb and seem ahead of their time. Better then some of the effects that are used in science-fiction movies that are made these days.I also liked the at some times quite unusual cinematography from Dean Cundey and the musical score from James Horner.I don't know how much is true about the story but it seems that sometimes the movie is a bit over dramatized. But that's not such a bad thing since it only does good to the movie and the characters. The movie is not only just dramatic, it also is tense and exciting. Especially the ending is done great, even though you already know how it's going to end you're still on the edge of your seat. Well done Ron Howard! There also are more wonderful scene's such as the launch which is done truly beautiful, mainly because of the music and cinematography the scene it is one of the best moments in cinema history of the last decade.But like I said before, it could have done without the many technical elements, or there at least should had been lesser moments with it. Also, there is a bit too much patriotism for my taste.All in all, very well worth watching.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Apollo 13
19,view_and_review,Take Me to the Moon,9,29 August 2020,"In the 90's Tom Hanks was cranking out hits. I don't think there was a more successful actor during the 90's. If I were to rank ""Apollo 13"" among his successes in just the 90's--as great as this movie is--I think it would still come after ""Forrest Gump,"" ""The Green Mile,"" and ""Toy Story.""
Of course, others may rank this movie differently. But in any case, how many actors can tout four iconic movies in their entire career, let alone one decade.""Apollo 13"" is a drama about a ""successful failure."" A crew of astronauts failed to land on the moon, but faced with catastrophic damage to their vessel they were able to successfully get back home.This movie is a real tribute to all of the people who contribute to a space mission. Though the astronauts are the face of each space mission, there are tens, if not hundreds of people behind the scenes making sure that mission goes smoothly. In ""Apollo 13"" we got to see those people go to work.Director, Ron Howard, did a great job with the movie. Though it was replete with technical jargon it never once bogged down the script or made me feel lost like I would feel some years later listening to the Architect in ""Matrix Revolutions.""""Apollo 13"" is a spectacular movie that is gripping and intense without huge explosions or widespread wreckage. It's fantastic to watch a movie be so engaging without having to be full of mindless razzle dazzle.",Apollo 13

This puts them in jeopardy of dying deep in space. They communicate with Houston in hopes of guidance home. Their loved ones watch with uncertain hope as the media broadcasts their progress. Emotional film experience by director Ron Howard who previously made such insightful films as Parenthood and The Paper. Tom Hanks leads the mission and imagines himself stepping onto the moon. Kathleen Quinlan plays his wife who awaits news. After that her role is pretty much limited to waiting and hoping. Ed Harris is commanding as the mission control communicator whose role is straight forward but quite insightful. Gary Sinise was originally assigned to the flight but rejected due to an illness. Next to Hanks he is the second most interesting performance in the film as he is now positioned to lend an important hand in bringing the crew home. Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton play the other two astronauts stranded within the ominous wonders of space. With exquisite production and visual scenery of space and the moon, it becomes a superb portrayal of the events that hits home in more ways than one. Score: 10 / 10",Apollo 13

Nothing against this movie or Ron Howard, but that was a vastly superior movie to this film. Of course, I do not particularly like this one all that much either as I gave it a six, it has some good stuff in it, but it is also rather long and you feel the length of it. Not in the bathroom way of say a ""Lord of the Rings"" movie where it is just super long so you are bound to feel the urge to go, but long in the ""man it is taking forever for this film to end"". The story chronicles a true event where a space mission had problems and the astronauts had to scrape their moon landing and just figure a way to get back home and it has some interesting moments. It also has way to much Tom Hanks for my tastes. He is not the only one in space yet he is the headline name so the other two astronauts are just not the focus which kind of sucks as I love both Bacon and Paxton, two underrated actors who usually do not get the bigger movies and when they do they are regulated to backup duties. For some reason Ed Harris got an Oscar nod for this film and his performance in this one is not as good as the one he had in the Sean Connery thriller ""Just Cause"" which got him nominated for nothing. His performance here is oddly like another performance he would have three years later in ""The Truman Show"" another film he mysteriously got an Oscar nod for. There is some nice space scenes though and at times you really worry about the guys in the dire situation they are in. So it is a watchable film, there is just to many times in this one that I was more worried about when it would end.",Apollo 13

The three astronauts and Mission Control must now focus on merely surviving and getting back alive, if possible.Directed by Ron Howard, ""Apollo 13"" (1995) is a solid account of the real-life events and obviously influenced ""The Martian"" twenty years later, which is even better, albeit not based on historical events.I suppose this zeroes-in on the weakness of this movie: If you're familiar with the account you know how the story ends, which diminishes suspense. Nevertheless, I found it interesting to observe the living conditions and challenges of real-life astronauts, as well as the resolve and ingenuity of the people at Mission Control to work with what's available and to figure out how to get the astronauts home.The film runs 2 hours, 20 minutes.

25,Mr-Fusion,"""With all due respect, sir, I believe this is gonna be our finest hour.""",9,8 September 2016,"I was a teenager when ""Apollo 13"" was released and had never known of this story. Neil Armstrong, The Challenger, sure, but not this particular doomed mission. But Hollywood's version of the events is probably the most American movie I've ever seen - not just those willing to hurl themselves out into the black, but those on the ground forced to bring them home (that's right, it's an engineering movie; the nerds are behind the wheel).And as a movie, it's a pretty great ride, going from adventurous space travel to unity in the face of disaster. Ron Howard knows how to maximize emotional impact, and it comes when you least expect it. There's genuine melancholy when the astronauts are denied their landing on the moon - and as dangerous as their predicament is, the real drama happens in the control room. That's saying something with a big effects movie like this. And as much as I like Tom Hanks (and this is a fine cast, right down the line), this really belongs to Gary Sinise and Ed Harris in supporting roles. And Harris has one of my very favorite lines in cinema: ""We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option."" I dunno how accurate it is, but this film - on its own terms - is a tribute to American know-how. I know how clichéd that sounds, but . . . that about sums it up.9/10",Apollo 13

He doesn't let you down, his command over his thoughts are untraceable.'Apollo 13' is one of The Greatest True Stories, which translates into becoming one of The Greatest Films! You're gripped, dazzled and in awe of the film from start to end. It's one brave story, and bravo to these Heroes! Such stories are worth talking forever, and so are, such films!Ron Howard rules. He is amongst THE legendary personalities in filmdom today. William Broyles, Jr. & Al Reinert's adapted screenplay is simply awesome! Daniel P. Hanley & Mike Hill's editing is lovely. Music by James Horner, like always, is perfect.Performance wise, Ed Harris is spectacular in a supporting role. Some actors are blessed, and Harris is amongst those rare people. Tom Hanks is superb. Kevin Bacon is excellent, one of his neatest performances to date! Bill Paxton sinks his teeth into the part. Gary Sinise is hugely effective. Kathleen Quinlan is a complete natural.

It is funny how Tom Hanks so perfectly fits another diverse role the way he fits this one. The entire cast seems to be perfectly fit in like with a shoehorn.The way the story is presented is important here. After several successful missions to the moon, things had become so successful that even the astronauts & their wives did not realize the real risk involved in going to the moon. The 1 small step of Neil Armstrong was really a giant leap.When this drama happened, television brought it home to a public that was deeply surprised by what was going on. After all, success breeds success. This story perfectly illustrates why success can never be taken for granted.It illustrates the teamwork in space & on the ground that made this rescue possible. It is a story of failure of a mission that evolves into the success of a second mission- survival. That is the importance of this story.If you have not seen this, it is worth viewing.

30,sddavis63,It's Just A Number,7,21 April 2008,"Having said that, the bizarre series of events associated with Apollo 13's ill-fated attempt to reach the moon might be enough to cause anyone to become superstitious. The flight was Apollo 13; it took off on April 11, 1970 (4/11/70 - the individual numbers add up to 13) at 13:13 hours; the explosion that crippled the ship occurred on April 13 at 19:13 hours CST. It goes on and on. But it's just a number! For about a 5 year period, Tom Hanks put out a series of absolute blockbuster movies (headlined, of course, by his Oscar-winning performances in ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Philadelphia."") ""Apollo 13"" has to be included in that list of great movies, although I don't think it quite reaches the height of those two. Hanks is not quite as central to this movie as he was to those Oscar-winners, although he certainly plays the lead as astronaut Jim Lovell, Commander of the mission. This really is an ensemble cast, though, featuring good performances all around, especially from Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon as Lovell's crewmates Fred Haise and Jack Swigert respectively, and from Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, who was originally scheduled to be Apollo 13's pilot, but was replaced by Swigert due to a health concern.The performances have to carry the movie, because this is such a well-known event that there's not all that much suspense involved, and the performances are all very good. The chain of bizarre events afflicting Apollo 13 seems to have been pretty faithfully recreated (right down to a typhoon warning for the splash-down area), and even given the fact that I know, obviously, how this turns out, the end is still emotional. This is a good movie - not Hanks' best, but definitely one of his really good ones from that 5 year period of real super-stardom, when no one else in Hollywood could hold a candle to him. 7/10",Apollo 13
31,FeastMode,my notes,3,24 June 2019,Stupid. intriguing at times but overall too old in style and made me lose interest (1 viewing),Apollo 13
32,ElMaruecan82,One of the 90's Finest Hours...,9,17 February 2017,"""Houston, we have a problem"".This simple and yet ominous announcement, ranking fiftieth in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Movie Quotes, became a staple of pop-culture, referencing to any acquaintance with an inconvenience... of as yet undetermined seriousness. Well, problem is the word to underline.They say in journalism jargon that a train arriving on time is no news but it becomes news when it doesn't. There's a moment in ""Apollo 13"" where the three men en route to the moon: Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) are clowning around in front of the camera, ignoring that they're not even aired on TV. When Jim Lovell's wife Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) asks why, the answer says it all: the audience finds moon missions as exciting as a trip to Pittsburgh. But the fact is that Apollo 13 never made it to ""Pittsburgh"". And that was news, at least, news enough so Ron Howard would make a film of it, a film with actors and screenplay, but with the realism and the accuracy of a docudrama, and quite a good one.There's some talk now about a Neil Armstrong biopic to be directed by Damien Chazelle but so far, it says a lot that Apollo 11, the one with the small step and giant leap, one of the greatest adventures men ever embarked in (also the most hazardous, according to JFK) never made into a film, not even ""The Right Stuff"" which ended with Gordo Cooper's flight and mentioned the deaths of astronauts Grissom, Chaffee and White in the infamous 1967 Apollo 1 fire. ""Apollo 13"" actually starts with that tragic incident as it established its kinship with the other all American space-themed classic. Indeed, ""Apollo 13"" can be seen as a continuation of ""The Right Stuff"" with Ed Harris as a common link, Harris playing the Oscar-nominated part of Nasa Flight Director Gene Kranz. And what an irony that it's Apollo 13, the third mission to the moon that made Kranz famous, not the first.And apart from Armstrong, Aldrin (and to some degree, Collins), I don't think anyone remembers the name of the other astronauts that went to the moon, but I'm sure everyone remembers the story of Apollo 13 and the name of Jim Lovell. Not that posterity matters, but it says something about memory's selectivity: as much as we need heroes to admire, we need danger to emphasize their heroism. I trust Chazelle to inject a sense of danger in the epic odyssey, but will it be as intense and palpable as when the lives of Apollo 13 men were at serious stakes when an explosion deprived the spacecraft from oxygen supply and fuel? One can say the film will have the merit to show the magnificent outcome of human intelligence and a rigorous combination of skills and talents, but isn't it through the miraculous way the NASA crew got their men back home that we could appreciate them the most?Indeed, we never realize how difficult it is to make these flights possible, especially in a time where IBM computers were the sizes of pool tables, where men could control a spacecraft hundreds of thousands miles away but when remote controls didn't exist. This is how craft and rudimentary the material was and this unique capability of mankind to improvise, to be resourceful, is illustrated to the fullest in the extraordinary adventure of Apollo 13, highlighting each step that made the miracle possible. And there is an extreme attention to procedures: how to stop the oxygen leaking, how to keep enough power to maneuver the spacecraft and make the transmissions possible, even to make the Command Module's square filters work in the Lunar Module's round receptacles with a bunch of space bags and duct tapes the NASA crew worked on it. It's not just about intelligence, but practicality and sheer astuteness.And there's always the human factor, Lovell recalls a botched mission's that wouldn't have succeeded if his cockpit lights hadn't shorted out. Similarly, when Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) is replaced at the last minute, that makes him available and a much valuable asset during the crisis as he's assigned to find a way to turn on the Command Module systems without drawing too much power, by using the simulator, no one knows the spacecraft better than him. In the 1989 documentary ""For All Mind"", Mattingly says he doesn't know what the others do, but he knows his part perfectly and it won't crash because of him. With that mindset, it's obvious that ""failure isn't an option"". They still called the mission a successful failure, but I wouldn't count it as a failure as it succeeded to say more about courage and resourcefulness than any other mission.And it's a credit to Ron Howard's precision and talent to have recreated everything for his film, not one single footage shot, from the equipment to the weightlessness, this is a remarkable achievement that even didn't get him an Oscar nod, while the fact that he made such a film without CGI is as remarkable as sending men to moon with an equipment that would belong to a museum today. It is also remarkable that Howard didn't inject any artificial subplot but stuck to the core of the story, only allowing to show the ""problem"" from the emotional perspective of Oscar-nominated Kathleen Quinlan, as the wife who accepts her man's job but would rather see him on the safer side, another element that is handled in the film's bigger brother ""The Right Stuff"".Driven by an intelligent and to-the-point screenplay, ""Apollo 13"" is one of these movies that can be screened in professional environments to show the merits of team work, processes and intelligence for crisis resolutions. And it much deserves its twelfth spot in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Inspiring Movies.",Apollo 13
33,ThomasDrufke,"Houston, We Have a Classic",8,24 August 2014,"This movie came out almost 20 years ago, so going in I was a bit worried the movie wouldn't hold up effects wise. And that I had been spoiled by the recent space movies such as Gravity, Star Trek, or even Man of Steel. While technology has come a long way since 1995, I think Apollo 13 does hold up. And that is thanks to director Ron Howard and the entire cast of the film.When I say entire cast, I mean it. There are a number of great actors who were involved with the overall greatness that this movie was. Ed Harris is once again the bright spot of the film. He can do no wrong in any role, and Gene Kranz is one of his most iconic roles. This role even helped him get the speaking only part in Gravity. Hanks, Paxton, and Bacon formed a good trio inside the spaceship, though I would preferred Sinise. Sadly it does take awhile to get into space, a near 40 minutes before lift off. I understand you need to set up the emotional side with the family before capturing our heart strings in the final 15 minutes. But to do that you also need to have capable cast members as the family. Which in my opinion were the major weak spot. You don't really get to know the children at all, and Hank's wife doesn't do anything that we haven't seen out of worried family member. It just wasn't what ill remember this film for. I will remember it for showing the amount of hard work that hundreds and probably thousands of people had to do to save 3 people. It just shows you what a little teamwork can do.I thought the pacing was nice, especially for a 2hr 20 minute film. I also found it fascinating how many steps go into just one particular task while aboard a spaceship. Comparing it to one of my favorite films Gravity, there's a lot more going on. But Gravity's story is probably more remarkable because it was just one person. It isn't a true story like this one so when a miracle happens in the film, you know you're watching something that has actually happen. Where would I put this amongst the all-time space films? Not sure, but it would have to crack the top 10. At least until Interstellar comes along.So in all, with a tremendous cast with a truly unbelievable story, this film can be enjoyable and thrilling at the same time. Just remember that this happened and that human beings were able to pull through that day and save human lives.+Great ensemble cast +Thousands save three +Pacing +Score -Family members didn't care about8.4/10",Apollo 13
34,Cineanalyst,Everything Goes Right,8,22 July 2019,"This is probably Ron Howard's best film, which although that isn't saying much coming from me (not a fan), ""Apollo 13"" is exceptional in its mission focus and sustaining the tension through the slew of problems with the historical voyage to the Moon. In celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, I've been viewing a bunch of lunar and space-related pictures lately, and it's become quite apparent that making the most awe-inspiring and challenging feats people have ever accomplished into sustained movie thrills is not an easy task for many filmmakers. ""Marooned"" (1969) is an obvious precedent in this case. In fact, there's a nightmare scene here that is said to be based on Marilyn Lovell's real nightmare after having seen ""Marooned."" While the real disaster is that film itself, it's understandable that the disturbance of it would linger for an astronaut's wife. ""Marooned"" is a thoroughly inhumane and mechanical exercise where a NASA chief played by an unsympathetic Gregory Peck hardly cares for the lives of helpless astronauts stranded in space. To him and the picture in general, those men floating in a tin can are nothing more than a math problem that he's forced to try to solve because the President of the United States ordered him to; otherwise, his first instinct is that it's not worth it and to give up.""Apollo 13"" is still a series of mathematical and mechanical problems to be solved, but the astronauts are active participants in it, and most of the people at NASA actually care about getting them home. More than the famous line, ""Houston, we have a problem,"" much of the runtime involves continual communication and teamwork between the men in the sky and those on the ground. Whereas ""Marooned"" divorced the spectator from caring about the astronauts, either, by spending the first part of the film treating them as test subjects for seemingly how nuts they could make them with a long stay in space; ""Apollo 13"" invests in making their pilots likable. Part of this is just casting proven, well-liked stars: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon and Gary Sinise. At Mission Control, they put in charge Ed Harris, the guy who played John Glenn in the most-respected prior NASA-related film to that date, ""The Right Stuff"" (1983). So good so far, but Howard also spends the early part developing the domestic relationships of the Lovell family, which pays off when the film repeatedly returns to the family at home watching the drama in space unfold on TV. Compare that to the lack of dramatic connection of the conversations between the astronauts and their wives in ""Marooned."" The audience hadn't invested in those relationships or characters, so they didn't care. Here, anyone who knows a bit about recent history knows exactly how the story ends, but it matters because those characters and relationships have been built in the film.It also helps that the visual effects here hold up well nearly 25 years later, while the blatant matte work of ""Marooned"" only compound its problems of a picture divorced from its characters. Many shots in ""Apollo 13"" were even shot in actual zero gravity. Thus, it's simultaneously a more dramatic and more realistic film. Unfortunately, when Howard was entirely untethered from the real world and offered a space picture based on a mythical cosmos with ""Star Wars,"" it bombed. ""Marooned,"" ""Solo"" (2018) and a host of other movies: those are disasters. ""Apollo 13"" is a triumph.",Apollo 13

37,CuriosityKilledShawn,"(Not quite) to the moon, Alice!",8,27 April 2020,"Launching on the 13th of April 1970 (just over 50 years ago as I write this review) Apollo 13 was NASA's near-miss, finest hour, successful failure, almost disaster that had the whole world holding its breath, waiting to see if the three unlucky astronauts within would splash back to Earth in one piece. I grew up not knowing anything about it until this movie came out in the summer of 1995, releasing the same weekend as Under Siege 2, which is the weekend I started getting very sick, an illness that came to define my teens. I finally saw Apollo 13 when it released in the UK, in screen 2 of the Edinburgh Odeon on September 23rd 1995, the day before my 15th birthday (my actual birthday movie was Speed on widescreen VHS), with a sold-out audience.In the US a lot of tall buildings miss floor 13, skipping from 12 to 14, fearing bad luck. They fail to realize that floor 14 will still be the 13th floor. For some reason this logic always reminds me of Nigel Tufnel. Pilots, sea captains, and astronauts are a very superstitious lot, so I don't get why NASA let two number 13s slip in there. Not that it would ANY difference at all, but they could have maybe launched on the 12th and called the mission Apollo 12.5. Maybe?There's a lot of effort made to keep this movie as accurate as possible to real life, from analysing NASA transcripts right down to the fashions and style within the Lovell household. There's no exaggeration or dramatic licence here. We're very far from Michael Bay's Armageddon. A routine mission to the moon, ignored by the media, is thrown into chaos when an oxygene tank blows, ripping open the side of the spacecraft. With the extremely limited technology of the time (the average iPhone has million times more computing power) the astronauts on board, the increasingly exhausted team at mission control, and the rejected third crew member struggle to keep things hanging together as they slingshot around the moon (so close, yet so far, in a bittersweet scene), and head back to Earth running on empty.Ron Howard details the long, torturous journey full of clammy, claustrophobic impatience on both the spacecraft and at control as everyone tears out their hair thinking of various last-minute solutions to every new problem, but it's not a film assembled by nervous, chaotic editing (I already said that this is not Armageddon). The pace and succession of events is laid-back and measured, a style of editing that is not too common now. James Horner provides one of his better scores, with some haunting touches, that lend the movie a timeless dignity.Apollo 13 shoots for the moon and back again and does so with more unpretentious dignity than virtually all of the similar blockbusters that followed. It's a Sunday afternoon movie, not a Saturday night special, and none the worse for it.",Apollo 13

Directed by Ron Howard, this out of this world movie was very successful on bringing the exciting and the entertainment value. One small step for a man, is indeed one giant leap for mankind. Adapted from the book, 'Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13', by astronaut Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger. The movie follows astronauts, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) aboard Apollo 13 spacecraft, attempting for a Moon landing mission. En-route to the moon, they suffer from an on-board explosion that deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power. This force NASA's flight controllers to abort the Moon landing, and turn the mission into a rescue operation to get the three men home safely. Can they get the men back to Earth or will the astronauts, perish in space? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much; since the movie is based on true events, the movie does have a predictable outcome. Anybody, who readt the history books, or saw any NASA program, knows how the events ended. Still, there are some really dangerous moments that might surprise some viewers, and make you jump, out of their seat, wondering if the crew was going to live or die. Even if you were the biggest NASA fan; the movie showcase a lot of things that you might not, know about the mission. You don't know the gravity of the dangerous situation until you watch Apollo 13! Indeed, failure wasn't an option. This movie was intense! Honestly, in my opinion, the best way to watch this movie, is to go into it, having no clue, what's the story is about. It will leave you more of an impact. While, Apollo 13 shot for the moon and it kinda miss, at least, it's among the stars. Every actor in this movie shine. Tom Hanks was great as the leading man. The supporting cast was equality as good. My favorites had to be Ed Harris as Gene Kranz, Head of Mission Control and Gary Sinise as astronaut, Ken Mattingly. I even love the cameo from the real life, Jim Lovell as a captain of the recovery ship USS Iwo Jima. One thing, that I didn't like, about the film, is how negatively, the portrayal of Jack Swigert was. They portrayal him, as a weaker astronaut, compare to the others, because of his lack of training, and bachelor status. In real life, Swigert was a well-trained Command Module pilot and highly respected. He was no black sheep. No one was really too worried about whether he was up to the job, but the real-life, Lovell admitted, he were really worried about was the rendezvous with Swigert as they left the Moon, but that never got to happen. Another thing, when did being a bachelor; became a bad thing? Didn't every man in the life, start out, as a bachelor, at one time? I have to say, despite that. Kevin Bacon did surprising, pretty well. Bill Paxton as Fred Haise, was alright for the role, but he's by far, the weakest in the film. I love how accurate the film is. The dialogue between ground control and the astronauts was taken nearly verbatim from transcripts and recordings, with the exception of one of the taglines of the film, ""Houston, we have a problem."" This quote alone, was voted one of the best movie lists in movie history. Ron Howard went to great lengths to create a technically accurate movie, employing NASA's technical assistance in astronaut and flight controller training for his cast, and even obtaining permission to film scenes aboard a reduced gravity aircraft, KC-135 for realistic depiction of the ""weightlessness"" experienced by the astronauts in space. The actors went aboard multiple KC-135 flights so much, that they outdone, even real astronauts in the amount of training, they got. I have to say, all the training, pull off in a realistic portrayal. Not only that, the movie went the extra mile in special effects. In an era where CGI was primitive, this movie was able to make it look like a rocket was blasting off into space, while, using little CGI. All the space shots were original made, and not taken from previous NASA space stock footage. There was no moment in the film that I didn't believe, they weren't in space. Even, real life astronauts like Buzz Aldrin got fooled, in believing they were in space. While, the movie is pretty accurate to historical events, Apollo 13 did take some artistic licenses for dramatic effects. In real life, the three astronauts remained surprisingly cool under pressure in real life, but the movie ramped up emotional tensions between them to make it, more thrilling. One thing that I didn't like, about the film is how much, foreshadowing, they used in the film. We get it! Did we really need, the scene where Jim's car was having problems or Jim's wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) losing her wedding ring? Come on! Another problem is the abundance of technical babble and bureaucratic jargon. Some scenes were really hard to understand, what was going on. Still, the movie does a good job, trying to explain, all the science. One thing that I love about the film; is composter James Horner's score. It really captures the wonder of flight. Overall: From lift-off to splashdown, Apollo 13 gives one hell of a ride. It was a very compelling, smart and suspenseful movie. A must-watch.",Apollo 13
41,The-Sarkologist,A typical Ron Howard warm fuzzy,6,2 October 2011,"This movie is similar to Deep Impact. It packs a lot of emotion into an okay film. The film is a little long and a little boring. There is little in the way of character development and the action is at a minimum. In essence, Apollo 13 is a disaster movie and these types of movies generally don't come out as much. Apollo 13 is based on a true story where a luna expedition experienced an explosion in space and had to be brought manually back to Earth. It is about the fear and the hope and the obstacles that are overcome to bring the astronauts back. Apollo 13 is a movie about hope. It tells us that no matter what the obstacles are we can over come it. No matter what the problem is, there is always a way out, all we have to do is trust ourselves. That is all well and good except that God is left out of the picture. Basically we believe that we are so great that we don't need God. There is a scene in the movie where everybody is praying, and a priest is present in the house, but they are only for comfort. When the astronauts are saved they forget God and praise themselves. This move reveals our instinctive superstitious nature. 13 is the unlucky number and thus when this spaceship breaks down we see it is because of the number and nothing else. When everybody prays, it is not because they want a relationship with God but because they are superstitious and believe that by doing so will help the astronauts. People don't understand prayer because it is not an answer to problems but rather it is talking with God. Yes we do ask God for help but that is because we know that he wants to help us. Prayer is more like talking to God and God is always wanting to hear from us. But prayer without belief is nothing more than superstition. Apollo 13 I found okay. It is not a movie that I would raise to the heights of brilliance, nor is it one that I will attack. I probably won't want it again because it was dull.",Apollo 13
42,Dr_Coulardeau,Human resilience is a miracle,10,25 January 2018,"Strangely enough, this film is a real story and the story of a phenomenal US defeat in their conquest of the Moon that they turned, in the very heart of a disaster, into a victory, not as for landing on the Moon but as for bringing the three astronauts back home alive. Apart from that, there is little to say or add. The disaster came when a small industrial defect caused a catastrophe with an explosion that destroyed a great part of the oxygen reserve and impaired then the feasibility of the mission. The second lesson is that NASA was totally unprepared to such a situation and they had to improvise with the skills and knowledge they had or were able to mobilize, but especially with the resilience of the three men on board whose lives were at the extreme point of immediate danger.The film insisted on the atmosphere in the two technical teams in Houston and at Kennedy Space Center. It showed how unprepared they were and yet they managed to mobilize all their energies beyond the differences that were theirs, mostly technical differences since some engineers brought up their particular calculations on oxygen on carbon dioxide, on fuel and electricity and some of these figures were dramatic since the spacecraft could not come back home. They had to invent economies, ways to save electricity, oxygen, eliminate carbon dioxide, etc. Engineers generally can only see their own domain of competence and they only consider the proper route to make it work and succeed. So they find it very difficult to imagine defeat, failure, and how to cope with such a perspective. Strangely enough, they can only find their footing in such a situation if they are several people with different skills and if they confront their skills, compete with one another for the common goal of getting it right. The film shows that very well.The families are of course taken care of and the film does not emphasize this side of the story and avoids all the dramatic scenes there must have been and there should have been in real life. But after all, the main point of the film was not the reactions of wives, children, parents, and relatives but clearly enough the human technical exploit.It makes an easy entertainment, especially if you can feel some empathy for the three astronauts, and also for the bureaucrats of science, technology, and politics in such a situation. Nixon was nevertheless sidelined, sidetracked and simply pushed out of the way.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",Apollo 13
43,filipemanuelneto,A great cast with little to work with.,6,28 March 2017,"This movie tells the story of the Apollo 13 mission, one of the most famous missions to the Moon, not because of it's success but because it almost became a disaster.The script is based on actual facts and could be somewhat boring for those who don't know the theme but, since everything was barbarously simplified, anyone understands it quickly. Unfortunately, this effort to synthesize and simplify has made the plot unrealistic, predictable and forced, especially if we take into account the jokes around number 13 and other minor situations like that. The plot gives great attention to how the astronauts was prepared and chosen, as well as how NASA sweated to bring them back. In this field, the film is engaging and leaves the audience stuck to the screen. Another issue that it tackles, in obvious criticism, is the initial lack of interest from the media in that mission, but this is ancillary. The film has some special effects but they're not attractive or stunning except for scenes in zero gravity. Personally, I didn't have any problem with that, I think it leaves more room for drama.As for actors we need to consider the following: the cast is full of stars (Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris...) but the film definitely doesn't know what to do with them. Hanks is the protagonist but is misused and spends more than half the film's length wishing for the Moon and trying to control his flight colleagues. Ed Harris, in a supporting character, shines almost as much as him and holds the final half of the movie in an excellent performance, but within the standards the actor has accustomed us to. The rest of the cast does not shine and there are several supporting actors who end up being demoted to extras with lines.In conclusion: it's a satisfactory movie but its far from being really good. The blend of a strong cast, a script reduced to the basic and an uninspired direction is as inefficient as a Ferrari engine in a Beetle.",Apollo 13
44,TheMovieDiorama,"Apollo 13 is smart, captivating and a classic from the 90's.",8,2 March 2018,"Y'know, it never ceases to amaze me how well films age. Whether it's a flashy blockbuster or a low budget drama, ageing is a curse that thousands of films succumb to. Apollo 13 though, still feels fresh when watching it today. Not because it's the depiction of a true event or the talented cast on screen (but that does help!), it's the direction. This was made to showcase the technical prowess and finesse that Ron Howard has in making, what I call, a Hollywood movie. James Horner for musical score, Tom Hanks as lead actor...it has all the ingredients for a 90's classic that Hollywood love to serve up. It works, so no complaints here. Let's talk about Ron Howard, he was superb directing this. His style, ever so consistent, yet always changing. Still shots, tracking shots, POV shots...you name it, he's probably included it. Tom Hanks was charming as always, Kevin Bacon's smile just steals every scene and Bill Paxton's nervous outbursts were relatable. Bringing in Ed Harris as the flight director was a smart move, he oozes confidence and brings in the acting experience to keep us hooked. It's a bittersweet true story, our astronauts venture towards the moon where an unforeseen event occurs that prevents them from landing on the surface. A landmark event, and yet they couldn't achieve it. I honestly had sympathy for our characters, seeing their dreams being crushed within hours. I also appreciated the friction between Jack and the crew, being a newcomer is always difficult and I thought that was presented well. The effects for the most part hold up decently, the rocket launch though...not so well. The background looked like Google Earth or Flight Simulator, could've been handled better even in 1995. It is a safe and familiar structure with not many thrills in store, a disadvantage for any well documented true event with a happy ending. In saying that, I was captivated and enthralled by the science and entranced by the performances. Ron Howard did a damn good job who deserves more recognition.",Apollo 13

47,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"An engaging, realistic and emotional ride into outer space",9,5 March 2008,"Houston might have had a problem, but Hollywood has a gem. ""Apollo 13"" out-rivals any space film in its believability and quality. Nothing about space in this film seems like science-fiction and for all the technical jargon, it's really easy to follow, resulting an a deeply moving film.It might be like ""Titanic,"" where you know that the ship is going to sink in the end, but still, ""Apollo 13"" moves you through its characters and the way the story is told. It might also be a near 2.5 hour drama, but it keeps things rolling as well and you don't ever get bored. The premise surrounds the historic ""successful failure"" of the Apollo 13 shuttle's attempt to land on the moon, a mission lead by Jim Lovell, played by Tom Hanks, whose patience and poise make him a fascinating character. The bulk of the film is Houston and the crew working together to do whatever they can to get these men back home alive.Simply put, the acting here conveys the danger of the return mission and just how serious it all is. Ed Harris, for example, as NASA flight director Gene Kranz is other-worldly commanding on the screen. These actors suck you in to the last detail of what's going on, the great screenplay pads that with actual media coverage of the event to convey a sense of how the world is feeling, and then Ron Howard steps in to make the transitions flawless (with the help his Oscar-winning editors) There are times where a scene will show in the shuttle, in Houston, inside Lovell's family's home, at the nursing home where his mother lives, etc. all within minutes of each other and it's not confusing at all. No single thread seems overdone, they all work cohesively.Since the focus is on the characters and problem-solving, space does not become an integral part of the storytelling. It is contextual and is used to help convey the astronauts drive and motivation. For example, at first when things on the shuttle go wrong, it's not ""oh, I hope we survive"" but ""damnit, we can't go to the moon now."" Especially for Lovell, the missed opportunity for space is something that nags at him despite just being glad he survived. That is what makes this film a great space film: space is simply a new place for disaster drama to play out and make us wonder about the implications of being in danger so far from home.""Apollo 13"" doesn't have all the suspense that a film with a lesser publicly known outcome has, but it certainly gets you riding its emotional train to triumph. It's not glitzy, it doesn't over-glorify space and while it might have taken a hit on the entertainment value one might expect from a space movie, it more than makes up for with great, engaging storytelling.",Apollo 13
48,Anonymous_Maxine,Forget Armageddon and the laughable Pitch Black. Never mind Lost In Space and Mission to Mars. Even the great Men In Black is dismissable here. THIS is a space movie.,10,30 January 2001,"Probably one of the most significant things about Apollo 13 is the fact that it managed to be such a strikingly realistic film despite the abundance of well-known Hollywood actors. Tom Hanks, of course, can convincingly act any part in the world, and his role in Apollo 13 is no exception. All of the actors involved seemed to have been given parts that they were born to play, because they were so successful in the roles. The true events of the historic Apollo 13 mission are amazingly re-created here, and the results are spectacular. Not only is this film wonderfully acted, it also presents a nearly flawless portrayal of the time period, even down to the slide rulers that were used to do calculations. The audience is literally taken back in time to the 1960's, and all of these universally exciting events are brought back to life, and this is one of the things that makes this movie so special. So many films try to do this, and the vast majority of them fail miserably, so it just feels so good to occasionally see it done right.
Another thing that was used in the perfect amount in Apollo 13 was the special effects. I am entirely against excessive special effects, because if they aren't justified in being in the film, they can sometimes ruin the film by themselves (remember The Perfect Storm?). The special effects in Apollo 13, however, served the film very well. Of course, the most significant special effect in the film, aside from the space scenes, was the zero gravity, which was done flawlessly. I'm just glad that they decided to go up in one of those Zero-G planes for these scenes, rather than have the actors drift lazily around and act as if they are in zero gravity, because that would have taken a lot away from the film. Apollo 13 has an excellent story made even better by the fact that it is true, it has great acting, skillful direction, and plenty of tasteful humor. It is not only a highly entertaining film, but is also educational, which should please parents (as if they need any more pleasing than seeing their younger years brought back to life on the silver screen). Definite must-see, Apollo 13 is a contemporary classic.",Apollo 13

Everything is smooth and safe.
It's tedious and slow at the beginning. There is more wrong: the first 45 minutes could have been cut out easily, although I get what director Ron Howard was trying to do, by endlessly showing us superficial family scenes. He wanted us to care about the characters, but the constant intermingled shots about the family at home really got on my nerves, because there were too many of them and they looked like Christmas commercials.

But considering that it is a true story, it did quite well. I think I was only twelve when I first saw this movie. And it was actually quite easy to follow. I think Tom Hanks does great in his role. I found out that John Travolta was offered the role, and I just thought to myself, that ""this movie could have been way worse"". I just couldn't see Travolta in that role. I think it is a great watch. It's not something that you can watch over and over and over again, but two or three times in a few years, definitely. It's amazing on Bluray.

And this film does go a long way towards showing subsequent generations what happened aboard the Apollo 13 in 1970. But while it does chronicle the events, it fails to show the political upheaval which took NASA by storm as a result of this failed mission and instead, chooses to focus on the heart-wrenching and sometimes played-to-death angst of the NASA wives.The arguments and disagreements which occur within that capsule are documented in the book written by Jim (Hanks's character), and are downplayed something fierce in order to allow Ron Howard his warm and fuzzy feeling; something he seems to need. While I haven't a problem with Ron's warm fuzzies, I do if they interfere with the story, and this time (Sorry Ron), they do.Other than these oversights (intentional or not), the film adequately depicts the actual events of the Apollo 13 mission. I know, because I was one of the millions who was alive, and remembers it.

The cast is great and Howard takes the time to develop them, to make it clear they are all different people with different personalities. That is something you hardly ever see in today's films where almost everyone seems interchangeable.The lines one character delivers is true to that character and won't exactly fit coming out of the mouth of any other character.

They train and become an effective team, but Ken is removed when his blood test shows he is inflected with measles. Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) has to replace the man 2 days before the flight.

I have been very critical of the films that were nominated for Oscars in 1995, the awful Braveheart winning undeserved awards, whilst The Usual Suspects, Heat, Casino, Se7en, Nixon and Twelve Monkeys were all over looked for a nomination. Apollo 13 was at least the most deserving for a nod in that year. Ron Howard direct's a fine film, having some wise directional choices. He uses some excellent special effects, has some wonderful camera, shots in real locations and uses low gravity, a good use of real news footage and after a slow build up makes a interesting and exciting film about how NASA got the astronauts back against the odds. Ron Howard also shot the film as PG, which in modern cinema normally seen as weaken a film because it doesn't make it seem adult: but this was a wise move by Howard. This story didn't require swearing or violence, giving the film a wider audience and a older-fashion feel like Casablanca or Spartacus. But despite these good aspects, the film does have a very overwhelming score which wasn't needed.There is also a good cast to the film, Tom Hanks, who is very good in the film, Kathleen Quinlan was also very good, Ed Harris, an actor I like, Gary Sinise in one of his better performances, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon.

The problem with this movie, however, is that we know what happened. Apollo 13 was not an obscure historical event nor did the participants disappear into the pages of history. Hence the movie does not offer any surprises. After the several disasters associated with space exploration, it is obvious that space travel is extremely risky, still experimental and not to be taken for granted.

But its unlikely Ron Howard's dramatic re-enactment will have the same effect on moviegoers, however well crafted and exciting it can be. The trio of marooned astronauts is shown responding to their predicament with not unexpected fortitude, but the film correctly identifies the true heroes as the aerospace engineers who improvised a series of life-saving maneuvers using slide rules, string, and sealing wax. The best moments, as a result, are those at Mission Control in Houston, and the near documentary flavor of these scenes generates surprising tension for such a familiar scenario (facts aside, the outcome is never in doubt: high caliber stars like Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon would never be allowed the indignity of a slow death in outer space). Too bad the suspense is then diluted by constant cross-cutting to flight commander Jim Lovell's anxious family: Kathleen Quinlan may in fact be the real hero of the film for enduring such a thankless token role (Mrs. Lovell's lonely vigil was certainly every bit as brave as her husband's ordeal, but it belongs in another movie altogether). The screenplay, credited to three writers (including 11th hour script doctor John Sayles) leans hard on space cowboy techno-jargon, but at least it's convincing. Someone obviously did his homework, and co-writer Al Reinert's experience making the 1990 documentary 'For All Mankind' (for which he watched five million feet of NASA Apollo footage) was obviously a boon.",Apollo 13

Tom Hanks and Ed Harris are especially convincing as commander of the crippled spacecraft and the flight director in charge of his safe return, respectively.

In fact, they form a symbiotic relationship that propels it through what feels like a breezy 2hrs. and 20 minutes.

60,jimbo-53-186511,"""We just put Sir Isaac Newton in the driving seat""",6,28 June 2017,"Apollo 13 follows the ill-fated mission back in 1970 of three astronauts attempting to land on the moon. When an explosion on the space shuttle forces the astronauts to abort their mission (which initially causes disappointment, but ultimately sets off a chain reaction of problems for the astronauts) flight director Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) and his team of NASA boffins must try to navigate the pilots back to Earth using several risky and untried methods....My summary above does give a basic foundation for this film, but unfortunately a lot of what I describe above occurs in the second half of the film (which I'm prepared to admit was pretty engrossing). It's a shame really that the first half of the film isn't anywhere near as strong as the second half as it could have been a truly great film rather than being merely a good film. The build-up to the space mission was dull and padded; Howard feels the need to show some syrupy family dynamics and topical references such as Lovell's daughters being upset about the Beatles breaking up (which seemed to have just been thrown in there to remind folks that it was set in 1970 and to give the film some soapy slush). The training aspect before the space mission was dull and I've got to be honest that I did find the film a bit tough going in the first hour.... but then....Howard must have had a big kick up the backside because the second half of the film was great. It has drama, tension and I really liked the way that everyone all chipped in together to try and get 3 of their best astronauts safely back to Earth. There is so much intricate planning in the second half that it becomes hard to keep up (and all of the geeky space talk will go over most people's heads), but the second half does contain everything that makes a good action/drama film and therefore for this portion of the film it gets two thumbs up. However....This is a narrative problem so I'm unsure who to blame here, but throughout the space mission we're led to believe that Swigert is the one who is responsible for the explosion on the shuttle and he is generally deemed as the 'bad guy' - also due to the fact that he took Mattingley's place on the shuttle. Swigert is never really painted in a positive light and I was fully ready to hate him at the end, but then I found that the rug was pulled from under me when I learned that the explosion was caused due to a defect with the shuttle rather than being caused by human error. Huh?? So Swigert did nothing wrong?? Then why make him out to be the villain all along? I've not read Lovell's book so maybe this is explained there - was there beef between Lovell and Swigert or was this Ron Howard putting in a curveball twist? Either way it didn't sit well with me and I would have preferred to have been behind all 3 of the astronauts rather than 2 of them. The energy that the film offers in the second half and the impressive cast and photography make this worth a look, but in my book this is far from being a perfect film.",Apollo 13

The movie is has some emotional scenes and the same is very beautifully written and enacted.In a scene where Gene Kranz played by Ed Harris who displays a strong character has his eyes moist when the astronauts successfully arrives depicts the intensity of the situation beautifully.All the characters mention a big applause for the strong acting.A must watch movie which is very close to the reality.",Apollo 13
62,barnabyrudge,Excellent recreation of a factual drama-in-space.,9,17 August 2006,"As if to prove that the number 13 is truly unlucky - as superstitious people have been telling us for years - the 13th Apollo space mission was a catalogue of disastrous mishaps from start to finish. Ron Howard directs this film version of the events surrounding the ill-fated mission with great attention to the technical detail, making it almost documentary-like in approach. But while some documentaries are rather cold and distant, Howard remembers to keep the emotional drama in his film tense and involving, just as it must have been as the events unfolded for real back in the spring of 1970.Astronaut Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) has long dreamed of setting foot on the moon, and gets his chance when chosen to be a member of the Apollo 13 moon landing mission in 1970. The three man team also includes Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton). During their flight to the moon, the three astronauts make regular live transmissions that they believe will be televised down on Earth. However, their TV slot has been axed without them knowing it, as no-one seems particularly interested any more in the rather dull and technical terminology associated with space travel. The mission is destined to become the centre of everyone's attention, however, when a routine oxygen tank procedure goes awry and leads to an explosion. The Apollo shuttle is suddenly marooned in space, with little power, little control and little air. The objective of landing on the moon is replaced with the sole aim of getting the astronauts back home alive. In Houston, scientists struggle against the odds to plan a way to bring the astronauts back to safety, working around the clock to solve various logistical problems facing them. Meanwhile, Lovell's wife Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) must hold together her family as they face the terrifying possibility of losing their beloved Jim. And aboard the shuttle itself, the three astronauts endure several days of unrelenting doubts and fears as their very lives hang by a thread.Apollo 13 is a superb recreation of the true story. Its most impressive achievement is that it manages to generate genuine gnawing tension in spite of the fact that most viewers already know the outcome. The performances are first-rate throughout, with Hanks, Bacon and Paxton exceptional as the endangered space travellers, Quinlan totally convincing as Lovell's distraught wife, and Ed Harris in commanding form as the mission controller sweating it out down in Houston. William Broyles Jr and Al Reinert provide an excellent script, which makes absolute sense of the potentially confusing technical dialogue, and also explores the emotional toll of the ordeal realistically and effectively. The final scene especially, in which communication is lost as the astronaut's re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, is so taut that you can feel your heart thumping inside your chest. The film is a celebration of human determination  some have criticised it for its unapologetic flag-waving and patriotism but such criticisms seem, to me, to be missing the point. This is not so much about America conquering the odds, more a film about the human spirit in general conquering the odds. And that's a message that we should all take from the film with open arms. Apollo 13 is an outstanding film indeed.",Apollo 13

64,slokes,Astrophysics Meets John Ford,8,31 December 2003,"I've seen ""Apollo 13"" a few times now, and even with two sets of DVD commentary and a fine documentary under my belt, I can't exactly say what took place. They call it a ""Main Bus B Undervolt,"" but whatever the case, it cripples the spacecraft Apollo 13 just as it is about to reach the moon, forcing the crew to abandon their mission and undergo some hasty improvisations in order to make it back to Earth alive.There's a lot of technical jargon spewed in this film, not as much as was actually uttered on the spacecraft and at Mission Control in Houston, but enough to befuddle those of us who dozed off in science class back in high school. Still, I enjoyed this film, even when I didn't quite understand it.Tom Hanks stars as steady-in-zero-G Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell, successfully underplaying the heroics without losing the dramatic urgency of the moment. Early in the movie, we see him joke with his wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) with the sort of easy banter those of us who have followed him since ""Bosom Buddies"" are accustomed to. There's a funny scene early on, as he watches the Apollo 11 landing with a roomful of simultaneously proud and jealous fellow astronauts, all yelling at the television to abort seconds before Neil Armstrong takes his one small step for man. It's funny because they all wanted to be first on the moon, and also, in a ghoulish kind of prefiguring way, because aborting the mission is exactly what is going to happen to poor Jim.There's also an early scene between Lovell and his youngest son, when the father is asked if he knew the crew of Apollo 1, who perished in a capsule fire scene in an opening sequence. Hanks answers matter-of-factly, with a mesmerizing combination of steely control and compassion for what his child is experiencing. There's a lot going on under the surface, and while it's my favorite scene, it's easy to miss. Many good moments like that are sprinkled like stardust throughout the picture.The movie is a fine, solid piece of entertainment, a little loose with the facts but essentially true to what Apollo 13 was about, but what makes this especially recommendable is the DVD, particularly the commentary track by the real Jim and Marilyn Lovell (SPOILER ALERT: He did survive.) At one point, when the film has Hanks imagining himself landing on the moon, the real Marilyn Lovoll audibly breaks down as she describes her sadness that her husband would never have this moment in reality (though what he got instead, however harrowing, turned out to be far more memorable than merely being Moon Man #5.) Jim himself is laconic as he fills in gaps in the storyline and explains where the film took liberties, meanwhile giving us a sense of where Hanks got his character from. For that, and many other reasons, this is a prize DVD for anyone's collection.A good feeling for the period abounds. We see smoking in the control room, miniskirts, floral upholstery, and ugly shagwall sideburns. The Lovells' oldest daughter has a conniption the day of the launch because the Beatles have just broken up, one of the things the Lovells address as a liberty in their commentary (she wasn't that much of a Beatles fan) but does make sense, because April 1970 was the month Paul McCartney announced the end of the band.Director Ron Howard piles on the technical detail. He wants us to understand just how tough it was to get Apollo 13 back, on enough power to barely run a coffee machine. He doesn't shirk from showing us a control room that is stacked to the rafters with what Howard himself calls ""techno-nerds with pocket protectors"" who emerge as real heroes in one of NASA's darkest hours. You have Todd Louiso from ""High Fidelity,"" Val Kilmer's buddy from ""Real Genius"" (Gabe Jarrett), even Clint Howard, Ron's brother, perhaps filmdom's uber-nerd.Nepotism is a good thing here. Not only does Clint have a good scene explaining to flight director Ed Harris that the moonshot is kaput and they will have their hands full just bringing the crew home, but their late mother Jean Speegle Howard shines as Jim Lovell's stroke-addled matriarch, delivering two of the film's best lines.I'm not crazy about ""Apollo 13,"" but I like it a lot, and I find myself liking it more the more I watch it. Ron Howard movies tend to push for maximum uplift, and the manipulation can be annoying, but here he seems to pull back on that while focusing on the human equation at the heart of the story. Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinese and especially Harris and Quinlan give excellent support for one of Hanks' best star vehicles, all the more a vehicle because Hanks serves the story rather than tries to make the story serve him.Hanks was inspired enough by this experience to do a series of critically-acclaimed mini-films documenting the Apollo program. You might be inspired enough to visit your local library, or do some Googling online. It's not `Gone With The Wind,' but as a history/science lesson, `Apollo 13' is a damn fine piece of work.",Apollo 13
65,gcd70,An exciting time,7,27 February 2008,"Boys own adventure about the ill fated ""Apollo 13"" mission which was to follow the successful journey that saw Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the surface of the moon.Ron Howard deftly recreates the tension, ambition, hope and disappointment which accompanied the crew who dreamed of writing yet another page in 'space race' history. Ronnie helms with a purpose, never allowing any sidelines or subplots to undermine the story which he skilfully builds to not one, but several nail biting climaxes. Many of us know the story, yet writers John Sayles, William Broyles Jnr. and Al Reinart still manage to entertain us with an involving screenplay which recreates the excitement of the time.All the technical teams have masterfully brought to life the NASA Space Centre at Cape Kennedy, along with the amazing hardware that goes with it. The take-off sequence is especially well produced thanks to some stunning special effects and clever cinematography (Dean Cundey - who wields with effect throughout the pic).Tom Hanks convincingly personifies the ambitious dreamer Jim Lovell, sharing with us his trials and his triumphs. In support of him is Bill Paxton (in perhaps his biggest role to date), finally playing a character who is not paranoid, and doing so very well. Kevin Bacon also joins the crew, playing a late replacement for the devastated Gary Sinise, who is ousted due to concerns he may contract the measles. Back at Cape Kennedy, an impressive Ed Harris calls the shots in an Academy nominated role, keeping his feet firmly on the ground, unlike his turn in ""The Right Stuff"".James Horner provides a familiar sounding theme.Friday, October 27, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema",Apollo 13

70,Spleen,Don't worry about the capsule - Tom Hanks is aboard,7,23 September 1999,"Every other February an old debate is revived: how, people ask, can a movie POSSIBLY be nominated for Best Picture without its director being nominated for Best Director?`Apollo 13' shows how this can be so and rightly so.  It's good, to be sure, but what MAKES it good?  The story (amazingly, a true one) and the subject matter.  Neither of these were Ron Howard's doing.  He transferred the story and subject matter to the screen and created a good film which, given the potential, falls a bit flat.  Considering the grandeur of space and the unspeakable emotions of astronauts trapped in a flying sardine can, in constant contact with the human race but thousands of miles from the nearest atmosphere, it ought to have been a knockout.But the problem is that there's the usual Howard mannerisms: formula, graceless direction, no taste whatever in music, and, worst of all, an inane trust in brawn, leadership and the power of positive thinking.  This is a film in which engineers and scientists are made to look like ineffectual fools, where people can be made to do the impossible if - and only if - someone shouts at them loudly enough.  I don't want to press this point. `Apollo 13' is far from being the worst offender of its kind.  Most of the film's energy is concentrated where it should be: on the space capsule and the difficulties it faces.A more serious drawback is Tom Hanks.  Somehow it's always Tom Hanks who talks sense, Tom Hanks who settles disputes, Tom Hanks who manifests initiative, nobility, perfect health and good cheer.  The other two astronauts might as well be made of wood.  For a film about three people who share exactly the same fate and have exactly the same claim upon our sympathy, this looks suspiciously like a star vehicle.  I personally find this particularly hard to take, since the star in question gives a typically leathery performance.  More than anyone else he looks as if he never left Earth.Still, he hasn't given a better performance and Ron Howard certainly hasn't made a better film.  It COULD have been much better - but superb though the subject matter is, the film wasn't GUARANTEED to be engrossing - and yet it is.",Apollo 13

The movie really has done a good job on showing how inventive people can be in times of need, and on recreating the emotions that the crew, their families and the people in the flight command center had to go through.If you ask me, the film really was at its best as soon as the crew was actually taking off in their rocket. Before that the movie was a little bit too slow to my taste and it didn't have that much to say. However, from the moment the problems with Apollo 13 started I was sitting on the edge of my seat. It all felt very real and you just have to empathize with the crew and their family.Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris, Bill Paxton,... all did a great job showing us the astronauts, their families and the flight crew on this doomed mission.

It's a movie that seizes us from the beginning till the end because we feel in the skins of those men and their families that witness powerlessly down here to their drama. We can in fact discuss whether the conquest of a dead planet like the moon is worth the risk run. But that's another aspect of the question which exceeds the aim of this movie and there no room here to deal with it. Here we are in presence of the story of a human 20th century epic which is what interests and suffices us in what concerns this movie. Space is the last frontier of Man. His destiny is to search it.

75,DeeNine-2,Gripping story professionally rendered,8,28 January 2005,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)I don't think it matters whether you remember the story of the Apollo 13 space mission or not. Whether you know the ending or whether you were otherwise occupied at the time in 1970, the tension created and maintained by the fine script (by William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert with uncredited help from John Sayles) and the direction of Ron Howard will compel your interest. And when the resolution comes it will command your emotions.Part of the success of this movie goes to the fine acting by Tom Hanks, who is, in a professional and psychological sense, very much like those fly boys with the Right Stuff who fearlessly left our comfort cocoon here on earth and ventured into the cold, dark airlessness of space for glory and honor and maybe for proof of their manhood. Like the astronauts depicted, Tom Hanks is always on task and always delivers an arresting and believable performance.Ed Harris, who played the flight director in Houston was also excellent as was Kevin Bacon as the replacement astronaut who had to fly the ship. In fact the entire cast, especially a whole lot of people with small roles as part of the nearly anonymous support techno nerds at NASA, gave believable and compelling performances. A lot of the credit for that has to go to Ron Howard, who made sure that they all looked the way they were suppose to look. After all, they were engaged in the success or failure of the mission in the most immediate sense.I also was very much moved by the musical score by James Horner. When you have an extraterrestrial epic, you need the music of the spheres, and Horner provided that. The music was so triumphantly married to the events and to the cosmic adventure, that it inspired without drawing undue attention to itself. It is one of the most beautiful film scores I have ever heard.Although this was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it won only two, for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Perhaps the movie was considered too much of a purely commercial venture at the time (and because of the budget it was largely that of course), and perhaps Howard's direction and intention seemed very much by the book. However I think the final result turned out to be more than some thought when it was released in 1995. It is a heroic epic, with a worthy theme, professionally done. Everybody worked hard for veracity and they certainly convinced me. Nonetheless there is perhaps something missing here. Although the sheer horror of dying in the cold vacuum of space or being burned up by a too rapid descent into the atmosphere is kept very much on our minds, there is a level of psychological reality that lives within the heart and soul of the astronaut and within the astronaut's family that was attempted here but not entirely achieved.See this for Ron Howard who did a great job as director and for Tom Hanks, one of the most charismatic actors of our time, and especially for astronaut Jim Lovell who lived it and (with help from Jeffrey Kluger) wrote the book Lost Moon (1994) upon which the film was based.",Apollo 13
76,sme_no_densetsu,"""Houston, we have a problem.""",8,6 October 2010,"Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13"" tells the true story of the ill-fated lunar mission of the same name from 1970. En route to the moon on a 'routine' mission the vessel is practically crippled by a mechanical malfunction. In short order the objective changes from landing on the moon to simply making it home safely.Based on astronaut Jim Lovell's book ""Lost Moon"", the screenplay sticks pretty close to the facts. Certain tweaks were made for dramatic effect, of course, but the filmmakers strove for authenticity. I, for one, was surprised at how successfully the film built tension considering the fact that the outcome is known to any who are already familiar with the incident.As for the cast, it's a good one. The lead, Tom Hanks, was fresh off of back-to-back Oscar-winning performances in ""Philadelphia"" & ""Forrest Gump"". Joining him as fellow astronauts were Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon & Gary Sinise. Quite an enviable line-up, in my estimation. While none of these individuals garnered Oscar nominations, Ed Harris & Kathleen Quinlan both received nominations in supporting roles. Overall, the cast was well-picked and without any weak links.Ron Howard's underrated direction keeps the action flowing despite being anchored to only a few sets for the vast majority of the picture. Meanwhile, the Oscar-winning editing seamlessly integrates footage shot in simulated zero gravity with footage shot conventionally. The Oscar-nominated special effects are also both believable and attractive. Finally, James Horner's score effectively contributes to the mood of the piece.Overall, ""Apollo 13"" is a captivating period piece that is constructed with technical know-how and skillful performances. While ""The Right Stuff"" is generally regarded as the top film based on the space program I'd take ""Apollo 13"" any day.",Apollo 13
77,Howlin Wolf,Another Hanks attempt to monopolise the Oscar...,9,9 March 2001,"""Apollo 13"" is yet another movie where Hanks is cast as the 'everyman' overcoming some difficulty.  He IS a fine actor, and ""Apollo 13"" IS a great film, but does anyone else get the urge to see Tom Hanks playing a real scumbag for once?  His characters always seem so WORTHY, making them a cert for Academy nomination at least.  Sometimes I wish he'd be a little more brave in his career choices.  Academy recognition aint the be all and end all.  There are plenty of fine actors never to be recognised in such a way. I think I'm right in suggesting Johnny Depp? Still, onto the film.   Director Howard has assembled a superb ensemble cast, and has a decent script to work from.  Everybody should know the basic story by now but this fact is impressively never allowed to destroy dramatic tension.  No-one with any sense would label Howard an auteur, and this works well for A13 because it allows us to concentrate on the individuals IN FRONT of the camera rather than the guy behind it (take note Scorsese.)  The moods in this picture are impressively judged, the historic build up (which admittedly does drag slightly), the perilous middle and the triumphant end.  The effects are superb, but they aren't the only thing here, making this a true blockbuster with soul.  The crew on the ground, led by Ed Harris, are almost as impressive as those in space, if not more so.  The whole production has obviously been polished until it gleamed...   Definitely Ron Howard's best film, and one of the best pictures of '95. As I mentioned before, I just wish the Academy weren't so obvious in their Oscar choices...   Incidentally, I didn't like this film when I first saw it.  Never has it been more apparent that your taste and attention span increase as you get older!",Apollo 13

79,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,A historical film that is still just as powerful and intense as it was in 1995.,10,6 November 2018,"Apollo 13, in my opinion, is one of the finest films of the 20th Century thanks to its incredible cast, emotionally tender direction from Ron Howard and James Horner's incredibly patriotic score to top it all off. It's 90s filmmaking at its very best; it balances practical effects with CGI perfectly in a way that just feels... right for Apollo 13 in particular because it's one of those movies that was at the 80s-90s Hollywood aesthetic crossroad.The zero-gravity scenes in the Apollo 13 are still remarkable today thanks to the little 'trick' the filmmakers used to make it seem like the actors were really in space: controlling the trajectory of a plane by having it fly up and down in a way that they emulated the 'weightlessness' the astronauts experienced during the near-disaster that was Apollo 13. Gravity could almost be interpreted as a plot-point in the story: it shows that the Apollo 13's situation nearly spun right out of control and that without the help of NASA they wouldn't have been able to focus on their rescue effort; this essentially makes Apollo 13 a disaster movie that has three astronauts trying their damnedest to come back home: dear old planet Earth.Apollo 13 is a classic for good reason: its sensual direction, the characters, the music and the space sequences are the stuff of cinematic dreams. And it all really happened. This is a story of human will, progress and fighting against the odds. It's remarkable stuff.This is one of my all-time favorite movies. 5/5 stars.",Apollo 13
80,dunmore_ego,The Greatest Successful Failure of All Time,9,6 September 2005,"""O, swear not by the moon, the fickle moon, the inconstant moon""  Shakespeare, ""Romeo and Juliet"".I smell that familiar kerosene funk in the air: solid rocket boosters firing, RP-1 propellant and liquid hydrogen surging, flux capacitor giga-watting - yes, it's the Tom Hanks Oscar-Machine chugging rugged in red-carpet mode. Trying to film a story with so many integral characters is impossible with a camera-magnet like Hanks tooling around on set. Our media-driven lifestyle denotes that ""star-power"" dictates character importance in a movie, so though Hanks may be playing a prominent role as one of three astronauts imperiled by the Apollo 13 malfunction, Every Single Member of NASA is equally worthy of the limelight blindingly focused on Mr. Fantastic. Though not a Hanks-Hater, I feel credit is squandered on his character of Jim Lovell, simply because said character is played by Statuette Boy. In the real world, credit for the rescue of the seemingly-doomed Apollo 13 spacecraft is dispersed throughout hundreds of personnel, each of them a Hero, with a capital 'H': not least, the Flight Directors, Gene Kranz, Glynn Lunney and John Aaron (Kranz played by Ed Harris, the most notable actor of the FD's, thereby implying he was the most ""important""  once again, sigh). Lunney, Kranz's relief FD, was played excellently by a stoic Marc McClure and Aaron - the FD who identified ""power"" as key factor in the life-saving stakes, thereby engineering the decision to ""turn off everything but the essentials""  was fleshed out by the clinical-tastic Loren Dean. Astronaut Ken Mattingly, dropped from the original Apollo 13 crew and earthbound for medical reasons, was personified by the suave intensity of Gary Sinise. Lovell's crew were Fred Haise (played by Bill Paxton, in his patented ""Game over, man!"" swoon) and John Swigert (the ever-dependable Kevin Bacon, whose presence in this movie with so many other A-Listers puts him at least ""two degrees"" closer to about 436 other actors)Unlike the DeLorean DMC-12, or the LZ 129 Hindenburg, or the RMS Titanic - all failures on a grand scale, all seemingly trespassing on virgin technology and future advancement, with each failure marking the end of an era for their respective milieux  the ""failure"" of the Apollo 13 lunar mission aided in advancing space-faring dialect and paved the future with skyward momentum for the International Space Station, the Space Transportation System (Shuttles), Mars Soft Landers and beyondDisabled by a wiring malfunction explosion, Apollo 13's prime directive shifted from ""frolic on moon at taxpayers' expense"" to ""stay alive, no matter what occurs"". As a result of the explosion, technical problems compound, each adversity overlapping the previous one, with the spacecraft crew and Mission Control united against the exigencies of the failing mission itself.Director Ron Howard intelligently chose to have nothing more than true-to-life events provide the drama of ""Apollo 13""; as obvious as this may sound, very few ""true"" or ""inspired by"" films refrain from inserting Hollywood subplot and cliché to ramp up the stakes  with this tale, Howard did not need to. The phrase, ""You can't make this sh*t up!"" springs to mind, as all the ""formulae"" were present: ""ticking clocks"", ""family stakes"", ""technological adversity as villain"", all encapsulated in the real life tale of three astronauts who missed the moon but unwittingly hit a jackpotHad the Apollo 13 crewmen died during their rescue attempt, American fortitude would have suffered a blow infinitely worse than the beating it took when either of the lightning-quick Shuttle disasters stunned the nation. With the Shuttles, it was over before anyone had time to realize problems had even arisen. With Apollo 13, manifest effort was expended over the course of four days; a public vigil during an avalanche of adversity that would have broken the back of America if the crew had not survived. And in the surviving, gradually attaining a ""success"" (read as ""fame"") far greater than any of the men who actually trod the Moon's surface (barring Armstrong and Aldrin). Proof? Tell me: who were the three astronauts of Apollo 14? (Not even Apollo 11 had the honor of having a PINBALL MACHINE created after them.) In the movie, responding to the notion that it could be ""the worst disaster NASA's ever experienced"", Ed Harris retorts, ""I believe this is going to be our finest hour."" He was right. An exemplary aspect of this film is the unobtrusiveness of its computer-generated visuals. Though Georgie Lucas believes he has the monopoly on CGI-film-making (simply because he owns the company that icings a large percentage of A-List blockbuster), Ron Howard illustrates  via Digital Domain's finesse - how to incorporate CGI into one's movie with class and taste. Quite simply - this is as good as it gets! Every star-field, exterior shot and moon view is seamless subtlety; without even realizing it, we see *all-new* footage of Apollo 13 rising on the Saturn V pillar of fire; Hanks' fantasy of descending to the Moon's surface (made ever more poignant by the fact that he has lost the opportunity) captures the sheer, crazy joy of raking one's fingers through regolith and gazing skywards at a gibbous earth-rise No need for dandy villains, exotic beasts or killer droids, Howard's judicious use of CGI captures everything that Lucas' imprudent abuse lost  true magnificence and awe.Lucas directed Howard in ""American Graffiti"". In sooth, the Padawan has become the Master.It is a testament to the talent of this Master that he could fashion such an involving movie from three guys stranded in a refrigerator for a week and a pack of Reservoir Dogs jargonizing at outdated computers.If not for those Apollo 13 ""failures"" (Lovell, Haise and Swigert), Alan Shepard, Stuart Roosa and Edgar Mitchell of Apollo 14 might have had a more glorious day in the sun  or the Moon, as it were(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",Apollo 13
81,RNMorton,Awesome,10,19 February 2004,"Tom Hanks and Ed Harris lead their respective crews in riveting story of Apollo 13's life and death struggle in outer space. Considering the commanding astronaut gets the lead writing credit we have to assume the details are pretty accurate, they sure seem that way. Film never lets up, with brilliant acting, writing and direction. 10/10 That's what I wrote over ten years ago, and this movie has more than stood up since then. There are few movies that have consistently excellent writing, directing, pacing, score, cinematography and acting throughout a feature length film. If I listed the fine performances I would run out of space, but Harris and Sinise are a good start. As of 2016 James Lovell still does well-deserved speaking engagements (that's him congratulating Hanks at the end of the film). This has to be in the top twenty movies made in my lifetime.",Apollo 13
82,miguelneto-74936,a middle film of a great director and a great cast,6,8 August 2016,"Apollo 13 is another film that has a partnership Ron Howard and Tom Hanks would work in three films later, Ron Howard makes an interesting direction, he shoots very well the scenes on the ship Apollo 13, Tom Hanks is fine as always, rarely it disappoints in a matter of acting, the cast also includes Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kevin Bacon and etc, the special effects are good, especially for 1995, the script is has many errors, and the film is a bit long, and the pace is not as good, Ron Howard in my opinion piece in the dramatic moments in suspense he hits more in drama he failed captivates me, the soundtrack of James Horner (Braveheart, Titanic) is very good, and I in my opinion Apollo 13 did not deserve nomination Oscar 1995, Seven for example deserved more (more that's just my opinion, Apollo 13 is regular, have a good time, plus the film is longer than it should, the same good cast, the acting they are not so great, and the direction of Ron Howard is only good (which is very little for a director of its level).

83,hall895,A most thrilling ride,9,14 October 2005,"If you have even the remotest knowledge of history you know how Apollo 13, based as it is on a true story, will turn out. And yet the film is filled with a tremendous sense of drama, placing you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Being able to wring that much drama out a of a film which you might expect to have a sense of inevitability about it is a tremendous achievement. Full credit to director Ron Howard and his brilliant ensemble cast of wonderfully talented performers.Apollo 13 tells the story of a 1970 American space mission gone terribly wrong. The crew of Apollo 13 was headed to the moon which sounds exciting but at the time nobody in America seemed to really care. The general public now saw space travel as routine and the sense of wonder had been lost. A successful mission would have been barely noted by the American people. It took a potential disaster to capture their interest and the story as it is told here will certainly grab hold of you as well.When their spaceship is crippled by a potentially catastrophic failure the crew of Apollo 13 is facing seemingly insurmountable odds in its quest to safely return home to Earth. This film brilliantly captures the hardships the crew had to endure and the bravery and grace under pressure they exhibited. The film also shows the heroic efforts of the men on the ground who attempted to devise a way to bring the crippled ship home. All of the key roles are performed wonderfully. As the central figure in the drama, spaceship commander Jim Lovell, Tom Hanks is reliably brilliant. Lovell had to be a real leader and it's a role which fits Hanks perfectly. Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton portray the other two astronauts aboard the ship and each has his moments of brilliance as well. Gary Sinise has a key role as Ken Mattingly, an astronaut originally scheduled to be on the fateful mission who now does all he can from his spot on the ground to help bring his comrades home. Aside from Hanks probably the best performance is by Ed Harris as the man in charge on the ground, the resolute, confident, unwavering Flight Director Gene Kranz. Harris does a great job of bringing this character to life, inspiring you to believe that the seemingly impossible is possible after all.While the film, quite literally, takes a little while to get off the ground, once the spacecraft takes off Apollo 13 is an absolutely thrilling journey. It is wonderfully acted, beautifully photographed and packed with drama. Even if you know what's coming you can't help but be swept up by an immense wave of emotion. Given the benefit of a great story to work with Ron Howard delivers a masterpiece. Brilliantly done.",Apollo 13
84,Beta_Gallinger,"Not always great throughout its 140 minute run, but very often an exciting blockbuster about a major historical event",8,5 August 2010,"In 2000, I saw no less than the first approximate hour of this 1995 Ron Howard film based on a true story, but never got to see the entire film that year. Before that, I had seen the movie mentioned in a magazine, so I was aware of its existence, but didn't know much about it. I never watched ""Apollo 13"" all the way from beginning to end until ten years and a few months later after just seeing some of it. I don't think I had much of an opinion on what I saw of the film just over a decade ago, but by the time I sat down to watch it all, I knew it had a good reputation, so I was expecting a decent film. After watching it, I don't think it's as great as many others who have seen at some point it in the past fifteen years do, but it's still a good drama.In 1969, astronaut Jim Lovell is mesmerized by Neil Armstrong becoming the first person to set foot on the surface of the moon during the successful Apollo 11 mission, and hopes to go there himself someday. It seems he will have a chance to make that dream come true, as he is expecting to take part in one of these Apollo missions, originally Apollo 14, but then he is switched to Apollo 13. He will be going into space with Fred Haise and Ken Mattingly, so the three of them begin their training for the mission. Shortly before the day of the launch, Mattingly is pulled out of the mission due to exposure to the measles, and is replaced by Jack Swigert. On April 11, 1970, the spacecraft is finally launched, and leaves Earth's atmosphere with the three astronauts inside. At first, the mission doesn't get much attention, but that completely changes when things go terribly wrong, and Lovell, Haise, and Swigert find themselves in serious danger, and there's a good chance they won't survive their journey! The beginning of this historical drama features archive footage narrated by journalist Walter Cronkite, and this is an intriguing sequence. I did not care for the flirt scene right after this, but that fortunately didn't last, and most of the film can certainly hold the viewer's attention with the events leading up to the Apollo 13 launch, as the crew trains for the mission and Jim Lovell talks to his family members about going into space. There is one awkward scene with Jim's oldest daughter freaking out over the break-up of the Beatles, but fortunately, most of the movie isn't like this at all. The launch scene is intense, with a fitting musical score to go along with it, and after this, it's hard to stop watching ""Apollo 13"", as we see the three astronauts in peril far from the earth's surface as Mission Control tries to help them, the news reports on the spaceflight, the reactions of Jim's wife and offspring, etc. This 1995 blockbuster also has great visuals, showing the space shuttle in orbit, and also well designed sets. The performances from the lead actors (Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, and Ed Harris) are strong, while some of the supporting performances are a little weaker, but that's not the case with most of the supporting cast. The cast as a whole is very impressive.I've watched a lot of movies in the past few years, and am not sure exactly why it took me so long to get around to this one, since I had seen a lot of it years before and knew for a while that it was a popular film based on a true story. However, now that I've finally seen the whole movie, I can understand its appeal and why it was nominated for nine Academy Awards, two of which it won. This 1995 blockbuster shows that an adventure movie like this doesn't necessarily need a lot of action to be exciting, since ""Apollo 13"" doesn't have a lot of that, yet still manages to be effective. At 140 minutes, it's certainly not a short movie, but despite occasional stumbles in quality, it remains intriguing for the vast majority of that time. As an historical film, there are obviously inaccuracies, but it seems many have praised it for its accuracies, unlike some movies based on true stories, and this drama can remind us of how risky space travel is!",Apollo 13
85,vip_ebriega,A Successful Failure.,10,2 August 2008,"My Take: Desite a few sizable flaws, APOLLO 13 is a great romp. Ron Howard's riveting and dramatic APOLLO 13, a terrific recreation of the famous events NASA near-failure, should be the answer to all those questions thrown in by those too young or too old to remember that fateful day when NASA's ""routine"" flight to the moon turns into the most memorably tragic one in their careers. Adapting from the novel ""Lost Moon"" by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger, screenwriter William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert has written a riveting and gripping screenplay toying with the techno-jargon and human drama of the fateful days of the monumental disaster, while Howard stuck to the facts. From using the real newsreel footage covering the entire event to realistic images of space, Howard has created a perfect realization that captures the tension and especially the drama.As for the casting, nothing could be more flawless with the casting of Tom Hanks as astronaut Jim Lovell (by the way, the real Jim Lovell actually makes a cameo somewhere in the film) who dreams of the stars and sees the chance to reach it when he is tasked to be one of the astronauts manning the Apollo 13 mission. Bill Paxton plays Fred Haise while Kevin Bacon plays Jack Swigert, the last minute replacement of Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise), believed to have drug complications. Kathleen Quinlan, however, provides what may be the film's more challenging performance as Lovell's wife Barbara, who experiences the dread, fear and drama back on earth as his husband and two of his companions are trapped inside the bowels of the crippled ship Odyssey, slowly running out of fuel and oxygen, aiding the help of Mission Control, led by Gene Kranz (Ed Harris), back at NASA.The pacing is a little slow during the first hour, but everything picks up real quickly as Howard jump-starts the tragic events. While we are already familiar about the splashdown ending, Howard and screenplay keeps audiences' palms sweaty with suspense and tension. This is because the characters are so involving, we let ourselves carried away by them, and what happens to them. From the endless commotion going on inside The Odyssey to the drama back on earth with Lovell's wife and family, APOLLO 13 keeps us right up there with them, from lift-off to splashdown.Excellent cinematography by Dean Cundey and an excellent score by James Horner are just among the final touches that make APOLLO 13 the best in pure ""you were there"" entertainment.Rating: ***** out of 5.",Apollo 13
86,KnightsofNi11,Incredibly entertaining,8,13 December 2011,"When I was little I always dreamed of being an astronaut so a film like Apollo 13 was a dream come true. I vaguely remember watching this film as a kid, only being able to recollect small details. Now, I've revisited this film and realized how much better it is from an older and more knowledgeable perspective. I no longer have desires to be an astronaut, but Apollo 13 is still a great movie. It's the true story of Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert and their disastrous Apollo 13 mission where everything went wrong, yet through courage and determination the men made it back to Earth safely. It's emotional, it's daunting, and it's powerful. Apollo 13 is a truly thrilling film from start to finish as we watch the wonders as well as the risks of outer space come alive.Apollo 13 is a prime example of the Hollywood machine at work, but this time it produces fantastic results. Ron Howard directs this picture with the utmost care, as well as an obvious passion for the subject matter. Sure the events are probably glorified, but that's what this kind of melodramatic big budget Hollywood production is all about. Meanwhile, the film rounds up an all star cast with Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinse, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, and many more. This fine collection of actors come together in such a brilliant way as they all pull off fantastic performances that make Apollo 13 a melodramatic, yet still believable film. Then you throw in an almighty score from James Horner and you've got yourself a surefire win. Everyone involved with this film deserves credit because it really and truly comes together to be a wildly engaging film.You don't even have to necessarily have an interest in space or astronautics to enjoy this film. You can enjoy it as an engaging dramatic piece full of tension, suspense, and emotion. However, if you come into this film not caring at all about space you will likely leave with some sort of newfound interest in the wonders it beholds. There's something incredibly fun and fascinating about the way these characters speak. Their space jargon rolls off the tongue and allows the dialogue to flow so graciously and poignantly as mission control quickly streamlines commands to the men in the ship. The whole film has a great flow that keeps you engaged and thrilled, never losing focus on the film, always wanting to know what will happen next.It's actually incredibly ironic that a film like this can keep you so hooked and so boiled with emotion and suspense because we already know what happens. We know the story behind Apollo 13 and it's general knowledge that it was a disastrous mission to the moon yet the crew made it back safe and sound. Yet, amazingly enough, the suspense is so vigorous and the tension that builds is so captivating it's as if you had no idea what would happen. It takes true skill in acting and directing to pull this off, and it's the major challenge to overcome when making a film out of true events. But this is the task that Apollo 13 overcomes, and it helps it to become a really great film.",Apollo 13
87,tbills2,"The Astronauts of Apollo 13 - 'Houston, We Have A Problem.'",10,30 June 2013,"The true story of the astronauts of the Apollo 13 mission back from 1971 captured the world and its people at the time gripping them with death-defying suspense. The film Apollo 13 does more than a magnificent job of imitating this space navigation near-tragedy. The real life details from this NASA lunar mission may be a little technically shaky but Apollo 13 depicts the event in a cleaned presentable way. It's just a tad too pretty though it's painted in a polite light so it's perfectly fine. I particularly enjoy, even possibly prefer the lighter lens it's filtered through. It certainly does not devalue the movie in even the slightest degree. Apollo 13 is one of the most incredible family dramas. The minor flaws of it, the direction is a bit rigid, the on screen story needs a broader scope, it could have used a vaster array of supporting characters, are noticeable, but forgivable. It doesn't fully diminish the overall greatness of this amazing cinematic achievement. The daunting and heartfelt nature of this storied event overwhelms and awes the viewer. What a spectacular feat for humanity. These astronauts endured an unbelievable journey to the moon and back. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are all American heroes. Apollo 13's filled with stars, having a great mixture of genuine talent and chiseled acting. Ed Harris is a damn powerful actor in amongst the very best and extraordinarily mister Tom Hanks is even better. Hanks and Harris are astounding in their roles as Jim Lovell and Gene Kranz as the two men hold most the mass in this heroic space adventure. Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon and Kathleen Quinlan are all strong in their supporting roles and they're all tremendously impassioned. Gary Sinise shines bright, giving us one of his best lovable performances. Ron Howard did a great job with what he had to work with; this is obviously one of Howard's best films. I greatly adore Apollo 13, it's a wonderful and an amazing movie, a 9.5 out of 10! I already have and will certainly continue to watch over and over again this touching and marvelous family adventure.",Apollo 13

You also get the feeling that Gene Kranz statement that this was Nasa's finest hour is also true. Obviously 	  everyone knows how the film ends, but the journey there is pretty extraordinary.

90,rebeljenn,"Houston, we have a problem. Over-rated.",3,13 October 2005,"Apollo 13 suffers from the fact that it was regarded highly as a film and is, in my opinion, very much over-rated. Apollo 13 is based on a true story about the space mission. I do believe that it was successful in getting the mainstream interested about the history of space missions and space exploration in general. In that sense, it did not fail. It also did not fail in the sense that it did capture an audience and bring about the timeless quotation: ""Houston, we have a problem."" Yes, they *did* have a problem, and I am speaking about the film here and not the mission.The problem with Apollo 13 is the slow pace of the film and the length of it. Yes, it is based on a true story, but that does not mean that it has to be so boring a dry. (A lot of the technical speak went over my head as a 16-year-old.) In terms of overall art direction or cinematography, the film was average. In short, it was just a very dry film and a long film to sit through.

The stars are such that one can only expect great things from them. There's Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon. There's also Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan. This, folks, is an all-star cast and the acting definitely reflects that. A good touch was letting us get to know the Lovell family, which added to the drama and poignancy of the story.

93,RonellSowes,Well Exectued Incredible True Story,8,9 February 2021,"America had put a man on the moon twice by the time of the Apollo 13 mission. The film starts off with that same level of casual wontedness.Of course there's ordinary about it for Jim Lovell(Hanks),Fred Haise(Paxton) or Ken Mattingly(Sinise)-the astronauts slated for the mission. And they're more than excited by the oppurtunity. This is a dream come true for them and due to the success of Apollo 11 &12 why should this one go wrong? However, the first sign of trouble appears when Mattingly is believed to have the measles and instead of being replaced by another team Lovell fills his seat with Jack Swigert(Bacon). They blast off at the schedule date and set off on their way to the moon. But just when their getting close BOOM,something blows and sends the ship into turmoil. What happens or why doesn't really matter and Hanks quickly brings the audience up to date as he says ""We just lost the moon"". From now on it's a new mission, getting back home. The ship's crew do what they can while Mission Control with the help of the measles free Mattingly and headed by Gene Kranz(Ed Harris) works to bring the astronauts back safely. Kranz played by Harris,in possibly the performance of his career, is a man whose attitude is summed up with the line,""Failure is not an option"".
As the film progresses more problems arise: power shortages,rising levels of carbon dioxide,Haise developing a fever and more. But it's really not the problems that matter, it's the solutions and process that make the film. Apollo 13 is a film about complications with deadly stakes and how two teams of men work to solve them. You don't even have to understand what's going on because Ron Howard,James Horner and the all star cast are always there to let you know when something bad(or good) has happened. The picture knows this and doesn't bother getting into the minute details to explain everything. There's a lot to tell the audience in this film but it never overloads you with exposition. Instead it keeps you informed through sharp exchanges and many memorable quotes.The film is an inspiring tale of great minds being faced with great challenges and how they go about solving them. What makes it even more incredible, is that this a true story about what really happened with Apollo 13.",Apollo 13

This film DOESN'T.",10,18 July 2001,"One of the most successful film of the 90s was this stunning recreation of the near-tragic flight of Apollo 13 to the Moon in April 1970.Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert were 200,000 miles from Earth at 9:15 PM on April 13, 1970 when an oxygen tank in their service module suffered an electrical short, ruptured, and exploded.  Two of their ship's three fuel cells were gone, their entire navigational system was thrown into a tailspin, and their life support was rapidly fading.  It was bad enough that their planned moon landing was scrubbed, but it was even worse to consider the strong possibility that they might not get home alive.  But with the help of all the brave people at Mission Control, this most perilous flight in the history of manned space travel ended happily with a successful splashdown in the South Pacific on April 17.Director Ron Howard (BACKDRAFT) recreates this true story with such technical and dramatic precision that APOLLO 13 is nothing short of a masterpiece, ranking it right up there with other such films as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, THE RIGHT STUFF and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.  Tom Hanks (as always), Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon give great performances as Apollo 13's crew.  Gary Sinise also scores as Ken Mattingly, who was to be the ship's command module pilot before a feared measles infection (which never materialized) beached him.  Kathleen Quinlan is good as Hanks' wife, and Ed Harris gives a very steely performance as Gene Kranz, the chief of Mission Control who urges his men on to find solutions to the complex problems that eventually came to surround this mission.Featuring an excellent score by James Horner, in the Copland tradition, APOLLO 13 won justly-deserved Oscars for sound and film editing.

And here is the final problem: we know they made it safely back, so there is no suspense. The only way they could have made it work was to make us really like the characters. But they never even tried. Zero for effort. Oh, and Bill Paxton was so wrong for this film. He belongs in B movie trash. As for Tom Hanks... Have you ever seen a more pathetic and emasculated figure trying to be a hero in every movie?",Apollo 13

While these guys are heading to where everyone dreams to be, after just a few minutes we see that this movie isn't supposed to serve reality but to be a box office hit. There are so many emotional scenes which I guess never happened in the real mission. I liked the lingo that's everywhere in the picture, at least they had a good space travel advisor (well that's before you read the goofs section:-).

This movie didn't win Best Picture",8,31 July 2000,"Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, and Kevin Bacon round out the cast of the best movie of 1995. Apollo 13 was the spacecraft that found itself, with Jim Lovell (Hanks), Fred Haise (Paxton), and Jack Swigert (Bacon) inside stranded 205,000 miles away from earth with little power, and their air supply running dangerously low.  All throughout this picture there are challenges that are met, while anything and everything that can go wrong, do go wrong.Apollo 13 is full of great acting and the costumes, sets, and appropriatly dated technology make this film easier to watch.  There's nothing worse than watching a period film with a late 90's Mustang in the shot. Cudos to Gary Sinise for his brilliant acting as the cool headed Gene Kranz, a late scratch from the mission due to the possibility of a measles break out.  With Apollo 13 all but counted out, Kranz heads a round-the-clock effort to bring the boys home. Apollo 13 is 2 hours and 20 minutes of nail-biting adventure complete with some awesome space scenes.",Apollo 13
107,DavidSim240183,"Houston, we have a problem",9,27 May 2005,"The American space program really was something to be proud of. Men putting their lives on the line just for a chance to get out into space, and reach for the stars. It's so unfortunate that nowadays we have far greater resources and sophisticated computers at our disposal, but the idea of space exploration has waned and petered out.Of course, back in the 60s and 70s nobody could forget the days of the space race. The days when America was in fierce competition with the Russians to put a man on the Moon. And did it in 1969 when Neil Armstrong took those first steps. In the opening scenes of Apollo 13, we get to see that happen, and the reactions of the astronauts on Earth is priceless. Their amazement and envy is clear.After the success of the Apollo 11 mission, NASA continued to send men to the Moon, but by the time the mission for Apollo 13 dawned, the public's enthusiasm for the space program was all but gone.That all changed when one of the oxygen tanks aboard the command module exploded, putting our three astronauts Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) in mortal danger. Then the public took a very real interest. People can be so hypocritical can't they?! Anyway, with a Moon landing now completely out of the question, our heroes had to put every resource they had into finding different ways to get home safely.Ron Howard doesn't always succeed with his more serious motion pictures. Sometimes they're downright dull and plodding, but he gets Apollo 13 very right. You can tell he's put a lot of work and effort into trying to recreate the mission right down to the finest detail. In fact, if you watch the 1989 documentary ""For All Mankind"" which is an account of this mission, there are almost uncanny similarities between the two. It's as if Ron Howard was present during those events, and captured the whole thing on camera.In fact, Ron Howard's film almost has the look of a documentary. What with the tight camera angles to heighten the sense of claustrophobia and tension, as well as panning around quickly to capture the different conversations at Mission Control. I always notice minute details every time I watch Apollo 13.The film can never quite shake the ""all-American"" feel to it's characters and events. In fact, if it weren't based on a true story, it might seem so ridiculous it could be attributed to American propaganda. But what really holds the film together is the film's solid storytelling, and some fine performances from the cast.Tom Hanks makes for a very effective choice as Jim Lovell. The way he tries to keep up the spirits of his crew while trying to mastermind the success of getting back to Earth is tremendously entertaining. His best scene is when they are going past the Moon, and can't land on it. Haise and Swigert are by the windows craning to get a good look, but Jim prefers to use his imagination. His sadness is profound and moving.Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon also put in some stellar support, especially the scene where they start arguing with each other about whose fault it is why the oxygen tank exploded. You could sometimes cut the tension of those scenes with a knife.Back on Earth, we have Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, Ed Harris as Gene Kranz, and Kathleen Quinlan as Marilyn Lovell. Ken has to work around the clock putting together a procedure that will enable the space shuttle to reenter the Earth's atmosphere. Of course he does in the end, but it's still gratifying to see him put it together.Ed Harris is almost pitch perfect as Gene Kranz. He is like him in so many ways. They even look similar. Although some of his lines of dialogue are very ""all American"", he is still very rousing as the head of Mission Control.Kathleen Quinlan is a talented actress to be sure, but she doesn't get a great deal to do in this film. All she can do is watch and wait for her husband's shuttle to return home. She still gives it all she's got, and it would be hard to imagine the film without her.Some of the methods the astronauts improvise to get home are truly remarkable at times. Putting together a new filter is very nerve-wracking, making course corrections, restoring systems are all edgily worked into the narrative, and with the tight camera angles we really feel like we're right in the thick of it with them.Although we can't inevitably escape the fact that we already know the outcome, it is still a very rousing experience. When I saw the capsule parachute to safety in the cinemas, I almost cheered along with the people in the film.Definitely my favourite film from Ron Howard, and Tom Hank's epilogue really helps put things into perspective. Although people have been to the Moon and back, that doesn't mean we should interpret that as ""been there, done that.""",Apollo 13

109,moviemanMA,Survival Story turned Cinema Gold,10,4 July 2005,"In April of 1970, three men were sent into space to walk on the moon. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are true survivalists of what could have been a complete disaster. They would be the infamous crew of the Apollo 13 space mission.In Ron Howard's 1995 release of Apollo 13, Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon play the crew that would be launched from Cape Canaveral and into history. The flight that went wrong and had Lovell (Hanks) utter those famous words, ""Houston, we have a problem"". When a routine task aboard their ship goes horribly wrong, these three men are thrown into a life or death situation.In the shadow of the 1969 lunar landing, the first ever, these men were nobodies to the general public, until ""it"" happened. With media flocking the Lovell's home, wife Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) must muster up all the courage she has and make sure her family keeps it together. She and the whole world waits for the three men to return home safely.Flight director Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) also has the difficult job of finding a way for these boys to come home. He and his team of experts work around the clock for nearly a week to ensure the safe return of the crew. Every time something seems to be going right, there is another problem. CO2 levels run high, exhaustion, power, and the troubled heat shield are all problems the crew at Houston the crew thousands of miles above Houston confront.With so much stress and a problem arising every other minute, tension grows on board with the crew. The fact that Jack (Bacon) is replacing what would have been Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) makes the other crew members a little cautious of his skills and his performance levels. They trusted Ken, but Jack is new and since he performed the task the caused the problem, they are very suspicious of him. The men must keep it together if they went to get home in one piece.This movie shows true courage in one of the worst space accidents the world has ever seen. Howard does a great job of preserving this unbelievable story of bravery and survival. So many times movies about something that actually happened get caught up in computer graphics or try to hard to appeal to everyone when this movie uses better acting, directing, and does have good computer effects as a bonus. This movie lifts off the ground and clears the tower.",Apollo 13
110,Cinemaniac1984,"Brilliant cast, masterful direction, and an excellent movie.",9,8 August 2016,"When I first rented Apollo 13 on VHS 20 years ago I found myself to be easily distracted and my interest seemed to waver throughout the movie. I don't know why but that's just the way it happened. Fast forward to 20 years later and I made the right decision to hire out Apollo 13 on Blu-ray. Apollo 13 was a fantastic experience from start to finish and I gained a greater appreciation of the movie. Apart from the fact it was based on true events, you couldn't go wrong with a brilliant cast with the likes of Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise and Ed Harris. On top of that, the masterful Ron Howard has added another excellent movie to his stellar career.Following the success of Apollo 11 in which in a landmark event in history Neil Armstrong became the first man in history to step foot on the moon on 20 July, 1969, the titular Apollo 13 is destined to be the third lunar landing mission on the moon. The following year astronauts Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon), and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) are picked to be the crew members of Apollo 13 for a seemingly routine mission to the moon. Things go awry when an on-board explosion deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power. Lovell's message to ground control changes everything when he announces the immortal words, ""Houston, we have a problem"". NASA's ground crew led by the no-nonsense Gene Krantz (Ed Harris) orders Apollo 13 to abort the Moon landing and along with original crew member Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) who was sidelined on medical grounds, spearheads the operation for the safe return of the three men back to Earth.Everything about Apollo 13 was excellent. Tom Hanks, riding high from the success of Forrest Gump (1994), is faultless as Jim Lovell. Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Bill Paxton and Ed Harris (who received a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor) are also perfectly cast in their respective roles.The late James Horner's score was beautifully done throughout the movie and fit in neatly. I found myself getting goosebumps from the opening score.Ron Howard who has come a long way from his days as Ritchie Cunningham from the TV series Happy Days has carved himself a brilliant career as a director. His attention to detail throughout his movies as well as his love of depicting historical events is a perfect fit for Apollo 13 and Ron Howard has done a superb job as a director.Apollo 13 was met with widespread critical acclaim as well as becoming one of the biggest box office hits of 1995. It is still deserving of its praise and I have grown very fond of Apollo 13. With a brilliant cast led by Tom Hanks, the masterful direction of Ron Howard, and a gripping story based on true events, Apollo 13 is still an excellent movie.9/10.",Apollo 13
111,roghache,Unforgettable real life drama of astronaut heroes,8,28 March 2006,"My whole family really enjoyed this film and especially, in contrast to some viewers, its more technical aspects. This entire flight was a topic I knew very little about (though I was probably a teenager at the time), so found it both an informative and gripping drama.It chronicles the ill adventures of Apollo 13, NASA's third planned lunar landing, which at the time had become routine and failed to capture the public's attention. The flight runs into potentially fatal problems when an oxygen tank explodes, precluding the planned moon landing, and the intelligent, highly stressed astronauts (as well as the Houston control team) must use all their skill, creativity, and ingenuity to avert disaster and ensure a safe return to earth.The cast does a magnificent job in recreating the three astronauts, their camaraderie and determined efforts... flight commander, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton), and replacement astronaut, Jack Swiger (Kevin Bacon), and also the Houston mission control director (Ed Harris). The film captures the disappointment of crew members (especially Lovell) in being denied their exciting moon landing, so long anticipated and trained for, and also portrays the effects of this potential tragedy on their families, particularly Lovell's devoted wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan).I have little knowledge of the historical accuracy or personal lives of the astronauts aboard this Apollo flight. Some have claimed that the personalities of some of the crew have been altered; if so, I would not approve. Although based on fact with a lot of attention to technical detail, it should, nevertheless, probably be regarded as a Hollywood production, and not necessarily a documentary.Even though we know in advance the outcome, it still has a riveting plot to keep viewers glued to their seats. The movie is especially a testament to the dangers inherent in space flight even to this very day, the training and courage of astronauts, and the anxiety that must be experienced by their families, especially when something goes amiss during the flight. Personally, I found The Right Stuff just a wee bit dull, but rate very highly this movie that put the phrase 'Houston, we have a problem' into our everyday vocabulary.",Apollo 13

We're reminded of the lost trait of American ingenuity as inspirationally seen through the determined NASA team where failure was not an option. Just like the mission, this was not about individual performances and energized American pride.

Heck, even Lovell's wife dropping the wedding ring in the shower the day of the launch is true!Just the fact that this film is true makes it even more enjoyable. It's hard to understand how in the hell one can make it back to Earth and survive with a fatally crippled space-craft. It's even harder to appreciate just how close they actually got to dying out there.The performances are astounding. Ed Harris is just stupendous as Gene Krantz, and Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Garty Sinise and Bill Paxton (who seems to always get the role as the whiner...) are also great.As Hanks put it: this story is one of the greatest ever.

116,tankace,Houston we have a great film!,9,27 January 2017,"It has been almost half a century after we have stepped on to an other celestial body apart from Earth and in Honor of this achievement I am going to review the best movie about these missions Apollo 13 ,which dispute that it is more than two decades old still pack a powerful punch of emotions, characters and a tribute to the resourcefulness, ingenuity and traveling spirit of our species as a whole.So the film follows the NASA team of the mission 13, who after a disastrous malfunction ,the crew on the spacecraft is in a dire situation and so the man on the ground and on the space-capsule must find out a way to return the crew safely back home. If you know basic space-race history then you already know that the team return alive to Earth and they even gave advice to the actors and production ,like the rest of NASA in order to help the directing team to make the film as authentic as possible and over all they did it.Now granted many of the sense are dramatized and some arguments are put it to mix to create tension in the story and show the how hazardous was the position of our team. But in reality both the crew and the NASA team on the ground were as calm as it gets, no joke I saw the original recordings and the tone of the voice was CASUAL. That is a testament to the professionalism of the NASA personnel, even in the worst case scenario they kept calm and gave the 100%. Now that doesn't diminish the quality of the film, on the contrary it strengthens it for shows how the artistic liberty should be done, with elegance and showing the humanity behind an event, which is exactly what happened with that film. Wow and the astronauts ,I am 200% sure, that posses balls of steel!Also many dialogues are a bit simple, which they would never be in that way, but let'd be honest 99 out 100 people aren't trained to be in NASA so that was also a logical move from the director and writers part.As for the acting, the visuals ex-ordinary and for the later to get the best possible sense of weightlessness of space they used an airplane known as ""the vomit-comet' to make them pitch perfect and they got it. To return to the crew Tom Hanks rocks, Kevin Bacon rocks and Ed Harris surprised me because he usually took part in action films not in serious biographies, but still he rocked as the rest of the team, a truly dream team, out of this world! ;)All in all I love that flick and makes me sad the fact that when those events happened there were so many ideas for the future and despite the fact that technologically we have made a lot of progress, the real deal, space odysseys to encounter strange new world and perhaps there wonderful inhabitants, it hasn't become a reality yet.",Apollo 13
117,Eternality,Apollo 13 is a rare Hollywood film that gets onto our nerves and lifts our spirits with equal aplomb.,9,11 March 2011,"Starring a superb cast including Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, and Ed Harris, Apollo 13 is a dramatic account of the 1970 NASA space mission to the Moon that met with a critical problem midflight, putting the lives of the astronauts in very grave danger. But they managed to return back to Earth out of sheer determination, bravery, and luck, with coordinated help from a much focused ground team. Capturing the attention of the world at that time, the survival of these astronauts was one of the great moments of the 20th century.This is unmistakably a film about the triumph of the human spirit, of Man's innate determination to survive no matter how bleak the circumstances are. Directed by Ron Howard, Apollo 13 stands tall among other exemplary examples of inspirational cinema, and despite many of the sequences being rendered with CG visual effects, it remains to be an affecting human story of substantial worth. Deservedly nominated for nine Oscars including Best Picture, Apollo 13 also features a splendid score by James Horner, who also scored for Braveheart (1995) in the same year.Ron Howard is a fine director, albeit without a unique style to call his own. Although he is quite inconsistent with his output, Apollo 13 ranks as one of his top films alongside considerable efforts such as A Beautiful Mind (2001), and Frost/Nixon (2008). His lucid switching among sequences in space with Jim Lovell (Hanks) and his men, sequences in the chaotic ground control station with Gene Kranz (Ed Harris), and sequences shot from the perspective of the astronauts' worried loved ones gives the film a kind of understated wave of human drama that rises and falls complementarily.The most exhilarating sequence from Apollo 13 is without doubt the launch of the rocket. The visual effects are respectable for a mid- nineties film though it seems more dated with each viewing. It is the sound mixing, however, that truly transforms the film into an extraordinary experience, as if the viewer is brought to the site of the launch. Despite viewers knowing how the story ends, Howard manages to create one of the most nail-biting climaxes in American nineties cinema – the anticipation of the astronauts' pod emerging in the sky after more than three minutes of transmission silence as it cuts and burns through the Earth's atmosphere.The joy and sheer relief of everyone matched by the soaring main theme of Horner's score after the emergence of the pod will make even the most emotionally-hardened viewer pump his or her fist into the air. Apollo 13 is a rare Hollywood film that gets onto our nerves and lifts our spirits with equal aplomb.

122,Sonatine97,A Science Fiction film that is all Science Fact,9,5 July 2000,"An excellent space movie based on the true events of the aborted Apollo 13 mission to the Moon. Of course for those of us who are old to remember the moon missions we already know the ending. However, Ron Howard does an excellent of making this ""remake"" even more breathtaking & astounding than the real event!There was always the risk of Hollywood taking ""dramatic"" liberties with this movie, but fortunately they resisted temptation for major chances and kept faith with the whole traumatic tale.Never being a keen fan of Tom Hanks (Jim Lovell) I was really surprised & delighted with his performance here. In real life Hanks had taken a close interest with the Apollo story and so in the movie he really plays his character with great enthusiasm & intelligence.He is also ably supported by one of Kevin Bacon's best performances and particularly from Bill Paxton.The only troublesome acting came from Kathleen Quinlann, playing Lovell's wife. She isn't given much to do throughout the film other than to cry a bit and offer moral support to her family and friends. Quinlann is a very capable actress but I felt she wasn't given enough to do here other than play the helpless-woman role, which is a great pity.However, top honours has to go to Ed Harris as the MC chief. I've always like under-rated Harris, especially in the earlier GlennGarry Glenn Ross movie. In both films he seems to excel as the man struggling to stay in control and walk the fine line. Although in this movie he goes that little bit further with an added intensity that gives a lot more human impact to the movie than perhaps Hanks offered, who's dialogue at times seemed to drone on in a robotic-like monotone.Top marks to the special effects too, which unlike getting in the way of a good story, simply adds to the real-life drama.Possibly Howard's best movie to date and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to check on their space history.****/*****",Apollo 13
123,HelloTexas11,Hollywood re-telling at its best,9,4 January 2009,"The great thing about 'Apollo 13' is that it tells a true story essentially as it happened, one that most people over a certain age are at least somewhat familiar, a story of which everyone knows the ending, and yet makes it as fresh and exciting and even tear-jerking as if the idea had just popped out of some talented screenwriter's head. It is no small achievement that the movie takes stiff real-life dialogue and even some lame 'true' jokes and by sheer screen presence and charisma of its stars again makes all of it sparkle, not to mention the traumatic scenes in space of the crippled spacecraft as it wobbles its way back to Earth. It is fair to say 'Apollo 13' makes its story much more exciting than it seemed in real life, which somehow just doesn't seem right, but which feels like an unimportant thing to worry about while you're watching it. Part of this success I think is due to the fact that most of us really DON'T (or didn't) know the whole story of what happened on this space flight. I know I was shocked to realize just how badly the spacecraft was damaged in the initial explosion; one whole side was ripped away. Given what the astronauts and NASA had to work with at the time in terms of technology, and witnessing as we have even greater tragedies since with the space shuttle, it really is nothing less than a miracle the three men made it back to Earth safely. Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon are all fine as the astronauts; each gets to be heroic at various points in the film though there is subtle stereotyping: Hanks as Commander Jim Lovell is level-headed, compassionate, almost too good to be true (the film is based on Lovell's book); Paxton's Fred Haise is quite ill during much of the flight and puts up a brave front but, well, he's no Lovell; and Bacon portrays Jack Swigert, who garners nearly everyone's resentment as a hotshot young pilot, a last-minute replacement for the more respected Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise). Back on the ground in Mission Control, Ed Harris is wonderful to watch as Flight Director Gene Kranz, and 'director' is a good description of his role- he orchestrates the rescue effort, cool, determined, confident. The scenes in space are quite convincing, many of them shot in weightlessness, and convey believably the crisis which faced the crew and their counterparts on Earth. I didn't realize how good a film 'Apollo 13' was until I watched it the other night for the first time in about five years. It is an uncommon example of Hollywood telling a 'true story' and getting it right.",Apollo 13

126,johnny-08,Howard's glorification of America,6,24 February 2008,"Watched ""Apollo 13"" again last night and I have totally different points of view now, then I had back then (maybe 8 or more years ago). I set to watch ""Apollo 13"" with only a memory that that was a good movie. Now after all this years, I must say that I'm little disappointed. Looking at the whole picture, this is solid movie, with very good cast and some interesting moments. But nothing more. What bothered me the most is the length of this movie. It just goes on and on (it's because the movie goes on very slow). And another thing; Ron Howard's presentation of how America is great and special country. Back then people weren't send to space primarily to explore; it was a race between America and Russia. So after America's success, other mission were send in space, like Apollo 13 (to explore;in this case Moon). Apollo 13 crew will be remembered as the lucky ones. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert (he replaced Ken Mattingly) were on board and they managed to stay alive because of great help they had back on Earth. From constellation of great actors in this movie (Hanks, Bacon, Sinise,...), my vote goes to Ed Harris. He's great as Gene Kranz, chief of the operation. This is definitely not Howard's best movie or a movie that should be watched by all means, but if you love any of these actors and you can separate 140 minutes of your life; go ahead and watch it. Oh, and of course if you are American, you will feel good.",Apollo 13

Apollo 13 overcomes this problem to become a terrific, suspenseful space opera staring American astronauts that we know came back to Earth. But during the most trying times of the aborted 1970 mission to the Moon, the audience is questioning themselves if they really make it or not. The appeal of Apollo 13 also comes from the benefit of actually being shot in zero-gravity conditions. No special effects here, the no gravity you see was the no gravity the actors and the crew experienced, thanks to help from the NASA airplane known as the ""Comet Vomet."" But I believe the real lure of Apollo 13 is how Director Ron Howard made these heroes, these spacemen, real men who had to deal with a real problem. Everyone, from the men just a couple of miles above the lunar surface to the guys who put the carbon monoxide filters together, had to come together to bring home ""NASA's most successful failure."" From the musical score to the claustrophobic feel of the space capsule suggest suspense, and will these men really make it. They do, we know that. But there is always that doubt...",Apollo 13

Examples: having NASA dudes talking politics two feet away from the tonnage-heavy 'wheel tracks' of the 'crawler' (the vehicle which transports the rocket to the launch pad at 1 mile an hour); making astronauts Haise and Swigert argue and point fingers at one another concerning the accident in the spacecraft; mission commander Lovell (Tom Hanks with his squirrelly voice in tow) losing his temper and yelling in a NASA space center meeting; flight director Kranz finding a little corner to sit in so he can sulk; the predictable changing of original verbal transmissions; much more fictional silliness.Like most contemporary Hollywood movies, every actor looks like he's 'acting', including veteran Ed Harris who should know better, though Kathleen Quinlan is adequate as Lovell's wife, Marilyn.Film plays like a TV-movie or a cheap direct-to-video flick.

134,hoernkeem,"Apollo 13 (1995, Ron Howard) Brilliant true story is a crowning technical achievement that is practically flawless",10,12 February 2021,"Apollo 13 (1995, Ron Howard)
This may well be Ron Howard's crowning achievement as a film maker. I remember this film being good. It was nominated for awards, and even in my college age young adulthood I recognized that this film was good. At the time I didn't know the story of the Apollo 13 astronauts and thus the tension in the film was very real for me as it became a survival mission with incredibly long odds. This film triumphs in just about every conceivable way. It contains a powerhouse set of iconic actors in their prime including Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton and Ed Harris among others. The writing is brilliant balancing technical jargon with a very humanistic story. In the early 70's man has achieved the moon and now it has become an afterthought; something that is seen as almost pedestrian. It is not an afterthought for the astronaut's who trained a lifetime for this and fear funding for the program may be cut before they get their opportunity. It is not an afterthought for the men and women in mission control working as best they can to keep the astronauts safe. It is not an afterthought for the families left behind who feel unending fear and anxiety until those men return safely home. As we all know Apollo 13 misses the moon and the astronaut's lives are put in great peril and this is the story of those who worked tirelessly to save them as they also worked tirelessly to save themselves. The film is also a stunning technical achievement and has been lauded as one of the most technically accurate movies ever made. That is probably why, even 23 years later, the film still is visually stunning. I remember seeing the Apollo 13 launch scene in the theater and being blown away by it. And if you somehow don't know the outcome of this event if functions incredibly well as an edge of your seat nail biter. At the time I thought it was good. Now I have come to realize it is an American classic, one of the best films of the 1990's and the crowning achievement in the very prolific film career of Ron Howard.

135,C22Man,Aim for the Stars,8,15 May 2016,"There is something innately fascinating about films that are based upon real historical events. To know that what we're on screen actually happened in some capacity, or at least most of it did, makes what you're seeing so much more potent than fiction. When you think about it the aborted Apollo 13 lunar mission is prefect for the big screen. Three astronauts on a mission to get home against all odds with the intelligence of those back on Earth as their only hope. It almost writes itself. The story of Apollo 13 mainly succeeds as a film because it is told with a great deal of clarity and a clear understanding of its aims. From a technical viewpoint to a directing and an acting one, the film is pretty much faultless which only adds to its entertainment value. Ron Howard is frequently accused of being far too sentimental in his directing, which I do at times agree with, yet he is pretty much perfect for this film. He views this time period as one of wonder and discovery. I think that his more emotional style suits the film down to the ground. Every shot of the black of space inspires awe and every conversation between the astronauts and their families comes across as genuine. There are a number of scenes between Lovell and his wife (brilliantly acted by Hanks and Quinlan) that completely avoid falling into the schmaltzy category in part because of how real they are. I'm not sure that many other directors would have been able to get across such emotions as successfully as Howard does here. Hanks, Paxton, Bacon, Sinise and Harris are all superb actors and provide the material with extra weight. Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon all fit perfectly as the astronauts given their charismatic styles. Gary Sinise is always a gripping screen presence and you really get to sense the disappointment he feels at missing out on the voyage. Ed Harris (in an Oscar-nominated performance) is at his most convincing as tough guys, but here he manages to balance that out with deep compassion for his men in what is a powerful performance. Quinlan (who was also Oscar-nominated) probably has the most difficult part as Lovell's wife, but she injects the role with plenty of heart and every expression is believable. The NASA control room is packed full of people, frantically working on various methods to get the astronauts home. Despite some many being involved, almost all of them are fleshed out just enough that we get an idea of their personalities. The ever increasing wave of tension that takes place each time something appears to go wrong is executed magnificently. By the time the craft is attempting re-entry you are truly exhausted, in the best way possible, by all that has taken place. It's a testament to the high quality of the directing and acting that we are so concerned for those that are a piece in something so spectacularly eventful. I like how despite the humanised approach, the film doesn't forget that there needs to be thrills for the story to really hit home and there is tension in all the right places. These instances were aided by stunning visual effects, which still convince to this day, and a beautifully stirring score from James Horner.By the time the film draws to its conclusion you are left emotionally drained. It thrills you in all the ways you'd want it to, and pulls on the heartstrings in the exact same way. For me it doesn't matter that the film can delve into the sentimental a little too often because it fits the style it is going for almost perfectly. It made me care about these individuals, even when we know so little about them. The cast is full of actors who are a joy to watch and they help bring this film to life as much as Howard's deft direction does. Even if you know the outcome of the story you still get drawn into the struggle and constantly questioning whether or not those on board will survive. That is possibly the highest praise that a film of this kind can receive.",Apollo 13
136,Pratik112,One of the most remembered incidents,8,20 August 2007,"I remember listening to the news on the radio that the lives of the astronauts aboard Apollo 13 was in danger as there had been an explosion and that they were losing oxygen. Not understanding what this meant as I was ten year old child, I immediately put the question to my father and he explained it to me. I ran to the nearest window in the room and looked up to see if I could see it. Because I couldn't I presumed that something had happened and prayed that they returned safely. After that I never heard of Apollo 13 until the movie was released.In the days during the Aplllo missions, it was something exciting to hear about men being put on the moon.

That it is a largely factual retelling of an historic event makes it even more remarkable.  I was riveted from beginning to end.  Tom Hanks, as Jim Lovell, and Gary Sinese, as Ken Mattingly, were perfectly cast.  Nobody puts images on film that tell a story dramatically and well better than Ron Howard.  In this connection, the reason that the sequences showing the astronauts floating were so effective is that the actors really were weightless.  Howard arranged to have airlines fly parabolar orbits so that a little more than twenty seconds of weightlessness could be achieved, during which time he filmed the weightlessness sequences.  10 out of 10.  Highly recommended.",Apollo 13
138,movieman-200,Two Versions of Howard's flick a bonus too good to pass up!,8,15 June 2005,"Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13"" (1995) is a compelling account of the bravery and commitment that men of character faced during the initial and dangerous days of the space race. The film stars Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell, devoted family man and adventurer who's dream of outer space turns into a nightmare when a serious malfunction jeopardizes the safety of his crew orbiting the earth. Along for the ride are Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon). Grounded after a bout of measles, but ever the committed optimist, is Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise)  aiding in the morale boosting efforts of NASA specialist, Gene Krantz (Ed Harris). The talented Kathleen Quinlan is wasted in the role of Jim's devoted wife, Marilyn Lovell  an insult to her formidable talents made all the more obvious when one views the new IMAX edition of ""Apollo 13"" presented on Universal's new 2-disc edition. Her performance has all but been distilled into a cameo.About the transfers: both the original 1995 2hr and 20 min. Panavision 2:40:1 aspect ratio feature and its new 1hr. 57 min. 1:85:1 IMAX aspect ratio incarnation have been digitally remastered by Universal for DVD. In both cases image quality is quite superb. Colors are bold, rich and vibrant. Whites are white. Blacks are deep, solid and rich. Contrast and shadow delineation is stunning with fine details appearing throughout both versions, even during the darkest scenes. The audio on both editions is 5.1 and will give your speakers a healthy workout, particularly during the blast off and re-entry scenes.What is particularly irksome for the film purist, is the way director Ron Howard's original pacing has been butchered on the new IMAX edition. Nearly 35 min. of footage has been excised  presumably because anything more than two hours of a really big image is just too much for audiences to endure. As a result, the IMAX edition loses some of the film's most poignant scenes to the cutting room floor. Also, the original scope and depth of the Panavision aspect ratio is compromised greatly during several space scenes. The bone of contention here is in today's ever increasing ability to make disposable art that is more user friendly to the masses. The IMAX version fills all of one's widescreen television with the film's image. The original presentation results in thin black bars filling the top and bottom of the screen. And yet, that is the way the film was originally intended to be seen, with more width and a longer running time. Purists will undoubtedly agree with this assessment. The average consumer will easily overlook the both absences.Extras include some very nicely packaged and quite comprehensive documentaries on both the real space mission and the making of the film, as well as an audio commentary and theatrical trailer. Since Universal has given us both versions to experience in pristine image quality, this edition of ""Apollo 13"" comes highly recommended.",Apollo 13

141,mbhgkmsgg,One of the best space movies,9,24 November 2020,"I'm honestly a little blown away by how much I liked this film. I have heard nothing but good things, and I went in expecting it to be good, but I never would've expected to be so captivated by it. Apollo 13 is probably the best space movie I have ever seen, at least as far as ones based on actual events go.While movies like First Man, Interstellar, or even Gravity, have certain moments that are extremely tense, this film keeps that tension going throughout. Apart from the very beginning, I was on the edge of my seat for the entire 140-minute runtime. Especially once the, now infamous line, 'Houston we have a problem' is said, the tension just keeps on ramping up and never eases until the final credits start rolling.
Tension, and especially high tension, is what's crucial for these types of movies to be successful. Space is, after all, uncharted territory for most of us watching and having that tension present, adds to the anxiety of the unknown. Another thing that is very much explored in this film is the idea that once you are in space, no one will come to the rescue. Add all these things together, and you will have a tense environment. Something that this movie captures incredibly well.Something else that I found fascinating, was the way that the situation in this film was solved. The whole mission was done with basically less computing power than we now have in our pockets. To not only be able to undertake such a mission, but to solve the biggest problem that NASA had ever faced with nothing but human ingenuity, is quite astonishing, especially for someone like me who has lived most of his life used to having computers everywhere. In many ways, this movie celebrates how capable we humans are and how far we can stretch ourselves when needed.What Apollo 13 is, is an incredible story told very well. It captured me and my attention from the very get-go and held onto it until the very end. It's emotional when it needs to be, and the ending can only be described as spectacularly triumphant.
As mentioned, I was surprised by how much I ended up liking this film. It had been on my watchlist for forever, and now I'm wondering why it took me so long to watch it.",Apollo 13
142,Dello_,Where are the characters?,6,6 January 2021,"I had difficulties liking ""Apollo 13"" because in my opinion there are no characters. Indeed all of them have not an internal struggle, nor a characterization that is something more the mono dimensional they have. They have not a inner struggle, something to overcame emotionally and in same cases they feel like some lines of dialogues played by an actor and it's not good because the viewer is brought out of the atmosphere. Sincerely I would've preferred a documentary given how the movie is. This is because when you want to tell a story like this one, a true story, you have two ways: the documentary (with an high historical fidelity) or the movie (where you have to alter a bit reality in order to make the story more cinematic). In ""Apollo 13"" I saw the intention to make both at the same time and it felt flat for me. As an example I saw a lot of documentaries about the Apollo 11 and I saw ""First Man"" by Chazelle. This is a perfect example of what I said because in the documentaries I've learned the real story, in the movie instead I was captured by the story of a man that has an enormous pain inside and that sees the Moon as a goal but also as something that can help him overcome the pain. It's not super historical accurate but I don't care because the character feels real and the viewer can empathize with him. In ""Apollo 13"" instead they are flat, starting with the main protagonist who wants to go to the Moon, he fails and that's ok. And if this is the characterization of the protagonist, good luck for the others.
But in the end ""Apollo 13"" is worth watching because it has a very very strong technical department and though the characters are not explored as much the story works. In addition I know that other people didn't have my problem so take a watch and find out by yourself if you like it!",Apollo 13

Howard has accomplished something truly remarkable with APOLLO 13--- he's skillfully wrought out the personalities of (mostly still) living people and makes care about the dire peril they faced. While not diminishing Cameron's accomplishments with TITANIC (I had to be dragged into it, but found it affective), APOLLO 13 is the standard for all fact-based films in the future. Side note: Tom Hanks has worked on two continuation projects where you get the feeling he didn't want to let go of the subject matter: after APOLLO 13 (RACE TO THE MOON) and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (BAND OF BROTHERS), which is some kind of testimonial to the impact he felt in being involved with these projects.

How this didn't win a a best movie or best director for Ron Howard and only pulls a 7.6 on IMDb is beyond me, but once again I sat absolutely mesmerized for 2:20 to watch this tale of the near disaster and rescue of this manned space mission to the moon. Howard captures the drama and tension of the event and the teamwork and dedication of all involved with the space program.Excellent performances by Hanks, Paxton and Bacon as the crew of A13, Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, who was scrubbed from mission at the last minute but selflessly did so much to help the crew make it back. Ed Harris was stellar as Gene Kranz, the Mission Control flight director as was Kathleen Quinlan, playing Marilyn Lovell, wife of A13 commander Jim Lovell.And after viewing this again I realized that we have had a couple generations of Americans (those under 50)grow without having experienced and seen the excitement and pride virtually all of us shared in the manned space programs, that climaxed with the moon landings in 69 and the early 70's.

Out of all the ships number thirteen had to have problems with it.

But in watching the movie, realizing that these men went to the moon using technology less sophisticated than what is in my smart phone and that there was only 1 mission where something went wrong was miraculous. Plus the bravery history shines on them as we now can compare how little we knew to the achievement, and that it was will to beat the soviets that drove the nation to willingly pay to risk these lives to make a trip to the moon that made the movie have an impact on my life as an adult. It was the drive of a nation to prove that we where technologically superior to our enemies that drove this to be such a high priority. The fact that it resulted in tremendous growth in high technology as the tax payers willingly backed this effort which drove technological innovation and breakthroughs for years as we went from WWII technology to the information age. To bad our government doesn't invest in our economy that way now instead of taxing the middle class to strip them of medical benefits to fund benefits for the poor. This movie and the comparison of where our nation was vs. is makes this an incredibly emotional movie for me. I wish those who were younger (and not foolish enough to believe these accomplishments were not real; tainting a great period of investing in our technological future) would look at it and learn from it and what this nation is capable of when its population is working and leadership strong with some true vision can accomplish.I think this was a well made movie and Ron Howard did a great job of capturing the important aspects of the events around this mission. Living through the real event and ""holding our collective breath"" for all those days until we saw the parachutes open upon re-entry (an event we watched in the gym at school) and the celebration that nobody died helped to make even more real the true level of danger those men faced and not the version communicated through the press until after it was over.

149,Marx_Bros_Fan86,Ron Howard's best movie to date,9,13 April 2009,"Ron Howard recreates the Apollo 13 mission on the screen and transports the viewer back in time. The music, sets, hairstyles, clothing, etc. all contribute to the recreation of the early 1970's, but it never overwhelms the viewer. A less skillful director might have had a few scenes that just screamed ""YOU""RE IN THE 70's! GET IT?"" An explosion on the Apollo 13 rocks the ship off course and causes an oxygen leak. They have to get the leak under control, turn around, and get back to Earth, in the midst of solving a seemingly endless number of problems that crop up. Apollo 13 is a drama that takes place in space, and winds up being more suspenseful than many of the science fiction/action movies today. Just the sound of the alarms and the sight of Oxygen levels dropping are enough to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. It keeps you rooting for the good guys to come home safely even though we know how the film will end. I must compliment how educational the film really is. By all accounts the film is pretty accurate, and one can learn a lot about space travel in the 70's from Apollo 13. This film proves historical films can be accurate and entertaining at the same time. The film's greatest strength however is a stellar cast. Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris are all likable and easy to relate to. We sympathize with Hanks, who plays Jim Lovell, because he will never realize his dream of walking on the moon. Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) falls ill and has kids on the way. We feel sorry for Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) because we can't help but feel there is an unnecessary antagonism toward him because he was not originally assigned to the mission. Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) is kicked off the mission because he is exposed to the measles. He never gets the measles, and he has a great ""I told you so"" moment. We all sympathize with Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) and the rest of mission control, who work day and night to get Apollo 13 home. Finally, there is Marilyn Lovell (Kathleen Quinlan), who can only wait helplessly and pray her husband will come back. The scene where her wedding ring falls down the drain gives a strong sense of foreboding.Apollo 13 was a much better film than Braveheart and should have won the Oscar, if not Babe.",Apollo 13
150,A-Ron-2,A moving and epic tale of American heroism,8,19 July 2000,"Here it is, one of the best films of the 90s.  A truly moving and beautiful film that deserves every bit of praise that has been heaped on it by critics and audiences alike.  This movie is more of an experience than a narrative, as most of us are quite familiar with the events surrounding the doomed Apollo 13 mission to the moon.I was simply impressed with the utter and stark realism of the film, and the fact that the near tragedy did not manage to sour the audience on space exploration.  The men on the Apollo missions were heroes, and the men on this 13th mission were no less heroes than those who actually made it to the moon.  I can't imagine the feelings that these three men must have experienced being trapped in space, so very far from home, but this film really manages to capture the essence of the trip.Howard made an excellent decision when he chose to simply re-tell the story rather than adding lots of peripheral dramatic storylines (as a lesser director surely would have), he allows the story to speak for itself.  The acting is so understated and controlled that it is often hard to notice that we are dealing with actors and not the actual event itself. 
The special effects are also unnoticeable, which means great.  There was never a moment in the film when I felt as though I was watching a movie, but instead I always felt like I was experiencing something.

152,danjakubik,An exceptional true life drama comes to cinematic life,10,25 February 2010,"Simply put, ""Apollo 13"", 1995, get's it all right: the look, details and emotions. Based on the true story of the the failed Apollo 13 mission. The film really brings back the drama and excitement, of this historical time in NASA's history. Nominated for 9 and won 2 Academy Awards. I'm surprised by the omission of a particular award nomination. Director Ron Howard deserved an Academy Award nomination for his directing. Clearly, this is a director's film. The inspiration shows. Ron Howard did receive a Director's Guild of America Award for Best Director.To me, ""Apollo 13"" is just about a perfectly made film. The sense of time and emotion is very true to life. The story is told between three perspectives: the crew of Apollo 13, their families and the mission control center in Houston. Everything from direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, film editing, visual effects and sound, all come together remarkably well in this exceptional film. The film manages to be educational, inspiring and entertaining. That's a rare and special achievement.I was 7 when the mission of Apollo 13 occurred. The look and feel of the film is very accurate. I felt very much like I was back in 1970 again. The attention to technical, personal and environmental details, is what makes this film outstanding. I'm a science/technical minded person. I noticed most of the technical details are accurate, and what was lost in the historical archives (personal and technical), is recreated intelligently and dramatically.The makers of the film definitely did their homework and put some admirable passion, creativity and inspiration into the film, and it shows very much.",Apollo 13
153,tml_pohlak_13,"Houston, we have no problem...",10,20 June 2009,"Many would argue that, because it is based on true events, history ruins the ending of Apollo 13, and thus, its thriller aspect is worthless. I will confess to ignorance here: I knew next to nothing about the real-life mission, and thus, I was able to really enjoy the movie's thriller aspect.The first half hour of Apollo 13 basically introduces the main characters. Its slow pace actually helps it in the long run; it plods along and finds its own, comfortable pace. Some mightn't like this, but I did. As soon as a little complication is introduced involving Gary Sinise's character, the movie skyrockets forward and doesn't stop. Characters that we've gotten to know and care for are then involved in one scary series of events, making the film that much more thrilling.Ron Howard really knows how to direct. The suspense sequences of Apollo 13 work out fantastically. He doesn't add unnecessary material to the film to make it more popular to the masses. There is no ""asteroid field"" sequence that a superficial teen audience would go crazy over. As a result, the film really feels like it is taking place in outer space. This adds a layer of realism to the (fantastic) special effects, and the film is that much better.An added bonus is Tom Hanks in the lead role as Jim Lovell. He is one of the few popular actors who really deserve all the praise. Hanks adds a touch of humanity to his role; he doesn't feel like an unerring, invincible protagonist, and he doesn't feel like a ""Gary Sue"" who will mess up at all the appropriate times. As the ship's crew begins to argue, Hanks joins in the shouting, trying to ""break it up"". But it isn't his voice that stops the arguing. Hanks makes his character and the danger he is in feel real. That takes real talent.But Hanks is not the only one who deserves praise. Every single actor in the film, from Gary Sinise to Ed Harris, does a fantastic job. Their characters are not imitations of real-life personages; they are their own. Everyone seems to fit their character perfectly, even Jim Lovell's elderly mother (who is introduced lamenting that her son's broadcast is not on TV).Arguably, Apollo 13's most pleasant surprise is found in its gentle inclusion of comic relief. It doesn't seem intrusive or inappropriate. The best way to describe it is ""gentle"". For instance, two world-famous astronauts are introduced to Jim's mother as regular, ordinary young men. It's funny and doesn't seem forced into the plot.The Verdict: Apollo 13 is a splendid little film, thrilling when it has to be, comic at times, and carried all the way by splendid performances from all the actors. Solid direction and superb visual effects just add to make it the great film it is.Overall Rating: 10/10",Apollo 13

155,charlessmith702210,The Apollo 13 explosion creates inspiring lessons on the risks of space travel,8,13 February 2011,"It was 1970. Apollo 13's mission was to repeat what the astronauts at Apollo 11 did---go to the moon and go back successfully.The blast-off was normal and the series of separations just before they reached space were also good. As they reached about 80,000 miles or so into space, one of the astronauts tries to stir the fuel tanks with just a press of one button. Little did they realize that this action would mean a precarious event is going to hit not only the spacecraft of Apollo 11--but also threaten the lives of the astronauts inside it.It started with a main explosion of a fuel tank, and then, subsequent shakes and booms. There are reports of fuel tanks having undervoltage, and not until about 10 minutes later, does astronaut Jim Lowell (played by Tom Hanks) visually realize that at least one oxygen tank is spewing out oxygen. He is the first to realize that there was a major leak in one of the fuel tanks of the command module.They now realize that they have to follow Mission Control commands in Houston, because Lowell is telling the two other astronauts that they have to shut down the power to the command module, or the ""Odyssey"", as they call in the movie. And Lowell is the first to tell those other Apollo 11 astronauts probably one of the most famous quotes...""We've just lost the moon."" Not just the other famous quote, ""Houston, we have a problem!"" Later on, Mission Control specialists tell the astronauts that they need to shut down the command module's power, which they do, and they had to move the LEM--or the lunar extraction module (or ""lunar module"" for short), which is nicknamed ""Aquarius."" Then, now that the landing of the moon had been scraped, the astronauts had to make a controlled burn around the moon in a slingshot action almost similar to that burn-around you may have seen in the movie ""Armeggeddon."" Yes, using lunar gravity to speed-up the trip back to Earth.The burn is successful, but they need to save much needed power, so they shut down power to the LEM, which includes shutting down heat to it, so that means they have to freeze a little bit in order to have a safe trip for a good geodesic entry towards Earth.Then more problems. Readings on the LEM indicate that the carbon dioxide levels are rising to toxic levels...meaning that the astronauts could suffocate in minutes. Mission Control finally finds a bizarre procedure to knock those high levels of C02 back to the non-danger zone. It was tense as the astronauts started to cough. But eventually, the astronauts finally fix the problem...they can breathe again.Now, the geodesic re-entry is in 2 steps--very difficult. First, they do the retro-burn about 70,000 miles towards earth and their trajectory towards earth eventually goes quite good. Now, because the command module only has the heat shield, and power to the module can only have several amps, they had to separate first the Odyssey (the LEM) and the Aquarius (the service module). After Aquarius goes away from the command module, Lowell realized the big damage in the Aquarius' fuel tank.Now, the second step for the good geodesic re-entry to earth depends on the command module's heat shield as they head towards splashdown. A failure of the heat shield would mean incinerating death for the 3 astronauts. Temperatures on re-entry outside can be as high as 2000 to 3000F. The whole world was on pins and needles as the command module heated up as the craft went through the earth's atmosphere...but then, as the craft splashed down with already-opened parachutes in the ocean and word spread that the craft survived re-entry, Lowell was the real hero.As well as the two other astronauts! And even more--Lowell's mother was overjoyed about the near-disaster now coming to an end for Apollo 11 for good!!",Apollo 13
156,pcampionz,Great Movie!,10,16 January 2021,"I remember when this happened. I was like 8 at the time, but as with the landing on the moon, both of these events were memorable. We were all glued to the television for both of these events.There is a new novel out called Astronaut Men. It was all about the time of getting to the moon. The author's, Robert Kurson, attention to detail is so great that it provides the reader of what the astronauts had to endure, especially with the limited time that was put on the program by NASA to get to the moon. Kurson was able to interview a lot of the astronauts and NASA personnel and it was clear that NASA assembled some of the greatest engineers and Air Force and Navy pilots for the space program. The kahonas the astronauts had at that time to not only go into space but to actually circle the moon, and then land on the moon in such a short time period, it was incredible!!!!And after reading Kurson's novel, it's very hard for me to imagine what they were able to accomplish with such archaic technology.If you have an interest in the space program, Apollo 13 is a great film,",Apollo 13

Apollo 13 was supposed to be the third shuttle to land on the moon but an oxygen tank exploded and the astronauts found themselves in a real situation. Going through hell to get back to Earth, the guys finally made it and the world was happy. An interesting story but very simple. Thanks to writers William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert, the story became a complex challenge of life or death situation.

Instead of the profound experience I expected of man going to the moon I got some jokes about the constellation Urine, some lines like, ""Mommy, you're squishing me"", and mission control cheering like football fans. We see Hank's disappointment about not making a touchdown, as well as an argument between astronauts that never happened in real life.The clichés of ""Houston, we have a problem"" and ""failure is not an option"" ring empty. To me the Apollo missions are mankind's greatest achievement and this film cheapens the experience. I hope man one day returns to the moon and onto Mars instead of spending trillions of dollars on war.

161,stefanhoeffllin,"Houston, I have no problem!",8,8 October 2000,"Why? Because it´s an excellent movie. It´s a big surprise to me, that Ron Howard did this one, after he has become famous for more entertaining than pretentious stuff (Cocoon, Parenthood, etc.). I guess this film was an important turning point to him. It brings the nearly- catastrophe of April 13th, 1970 close to you. When I´ve watched ""Apollo 13"" the first time, I was amazed about the weightless in the spaceship, and I asked myself ""How did they do that?!"", because it looked so real! They simulated the weightless in the NASA KC-135 jet. A big praise to all the actors for their hard work to let this film look 100 % realistic. Breathtaking in every moment, altough you know the ending. It´s an intimitate play in space, so don´t expect an action packed movie like ""Armageddon"". ""Apollo 13"" is a thousand times more thrilling than a lesson in history.(and I liked history lessons!)",Apollo 13
162,DJ_Shilo,Deep Space,10,9 May 2016,"August 19, 2015This is one of the best films of the year. Ron Howard knows how to make a great movie, visually and creatively. Tom Hanks is a great actor and this creative team of actor/director takes me all the way back to 1984 when Howard directed Hanks in ""Splash,"" one of my favorite pictures of love, magic, and beauty. ""Apollo 13"" is a visual masterpiece that is based on the real-life ill-fated mission to the moon that happened 25 years ago.It begins on July 20, 1969, with an astronaut, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) who has orbited the moon on ""Apollo 8."" Jim tells his wife he wants to walk on the moon's surface and he gets his chance when he is selected to take flight in ""Apollo 13,"" instead of ""Apollo 14."" Jim, along with his flight crew, blast off into space with minor difficulties. En route to the moon, one of the crew members performs a routine housekeeping procedure that causes one of the ship's liquid oxygen tanks to spill out into space while the other explodes and sends the ship tumbling. The mission to land is canceled and the crew becomes trapped in space. With time running out, Lovell and his crew must now work together to figure out a way home before it's too late.The ""Apollo 13"" mission was launched on April 11th, 1970 from Cape Kennedy, Florida. It was the seventh manned mission in the Apollo space program. Two days later, an oxygen tank exploded and crippled the service module for which the command module depended on. The three astronauts became trapped with the loss of power, loss of cabin heat and loss of oxygen while mission control worked desperately to try and find a way to get them home safely. They faced almost impossible odds and the fact that they might just end up marooned in space, frozen to death.I can just imagine what the cast went through for this movie because their performances are stellar and you can see they were well prepared. It opens with a surprise party for Jim. We meet his wife, Marilyn Lovell (Kathleen Quinlan) who is always worried about her husband going into space and not coming back. She follows him through his training and eventually she shows up to the launch party to see her husband take off into space. Kevin Bacon is fantastic as Jack Swigert who feels responsible because he, unknowingly, flipped the switch that caused the explosion and Bill Pullman is Fred Haise, the man who hangs on to every last minute he may have. Ed Harris plays Gene Kranz, the chain-smoking mastermind at Houston Mission Control who tries to figure out if the Apollo 13 crew can safely make it home. He doesn't take ""no"" for an answer and commands his team to work effortlessly to keep them from dying in space.Originally, Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) was supposed to fly the ""Apollo 13"" mission but was grounded due to possibly being exposed to the measles. Early in the picture, Ken is diagnosed and we see that Gary Sinise might be limited in his screen time but he's not. He becomes some of the brains to figure how to get the ship home. He works tirelessly in a simulator to figure out a way to power the weakened batteries on the Lunar module exploration device (a lifeboat) so they can swing around the moon and flame burst the ship home.What Ron Howard manages to create is a technically accurate film with a crew that floats around ""weightless"" in the spaceship and we see some visual shots of earth from a space-eye view. He takes all the technical work and makes it shine. At one point, the crew is freezing out in space and suffering from carbon dioxide poison. Back on earth, a group of engineers is put together to creatively build something that will clean the air. The come up with a jerry rig that the crew can make materials out of on board the shuttle to give them more times. These are the intense sequences that really make you pace and wonder what will happen next and wonder if the crew will make it home alive.",Apollo 13

But it's great to see how a movie can show with so much respect and keeping the rhythm what happened during those very long seven and something days into that tight space ship while down to earth and in the middle of the empty ocean outside our planet the technicians and astronauts tried to keep them alive. Howard's casting is almost like the casting of The Aviator. Tom Hanks doesn't look like Jim Lovell. Bill Paxton doesn't look like Fred Haise. Neither Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris or Gary Siniese. But, despite the casting, the rest of the movie is pretty accurate. Is very exact to what happened in real life. The sense of disaster movie is always there, never leaves the screen during it's almost 2 and a half hours, but is basically a human drama with realistic touch. Ron Howard uses his great heart to make us tremble and sob with the agonize tragedy of this three astronauts, and when you reach to the end and see the resolution, you just have to clap!

I personally liked how the movie was based on true events. I feel like what makes this movie different from other space movies is the fact that this movie is not science fiction based. I feel like another element that separated it from others like it is the classic touch of Hollywood heart that was apparent in the film. It was classic Hollywood goes to space, whereas the typical space film is more about ""science"" or exploration, this film followed our heroes into space instead of epitomizing their journey. The writing for this piece is one of its most masterful elements. It takes a lot of skill to research a historical event and bring it to life. Directed by Ron Howard it beared his signature marks of creativity and professional artistry. The one attribute I did struggle with was it's striking similarity to Titanic (1997).

Historical events are difficult to portray on the big screen, but I believe this film has truly captured the essence of what truly happened. Unfortunately, I am personally not a fan of long films that, especially without side stories that add to the overall storyline. I think this film is good, but I would have taken some of the slower, less interesting events out and possibly added more of Ken Mattingly, played by Gary Sinise, after he was denied the flight.Other than the length, this film looked and felt great. Ron Howard did an outstanding job getting the best performances out of his star-studded cast. There were not a lot of films that successfully portrayed realistic CGI in this era, especially compared to the movie magic we see today, but I think it was spot on in this film.

173,longcooljolie,A perfect movie,10,25 December 2009,"This review is designed for people like me who have seen Apollo 13 dozens of times. Apollo 13 is one of my favorite movies for several reasons and here is a short rant: the movie was robbed at the 1995 Oscars. It could have been Best Picture and either Ed Harris or Karen Quinlan could have won best supporting actor/actress. At the time the movie was released, people wondered whether it would be Tom Hank's third Oscar in a row. The role of James Lovell was too ""normal"" and the movie too much of an ensemble film for him to have had a chance. Of course that doesn't take anything away from his brilliant, understated performance.The movie premiered around Memorial Day 1995, and I saw it that first weekend in an old-fashioned multi-plex (before stadium seating). Seen in a theater, this movie wraps you in and rockets you back to 1970. It also puts you in a fourth chair in the Command and Lunar modules. I was around for the original Apollo 13 incident: I was the same age as the younger Lovell daughter. Yet, even knowing the whole outcome, I was still enthralled with the intricacy of the whole plot and all of the characters. The ""corridor control burn,"" where the astronauts have to floor the engines and get the LEM back on course was especially exciting in the theater. I think all of the air got sucked out of it by people gasping! Last year I was lucky enough to meet Tracy Reiner, who played Mary Heise. She told me some neat insider information about the movie, such as how they filmed the Lift off scenes at Long Beach, CA and not Florida. Tracy also said that in the arresting scene where she and Marilyn (Karen Quinlan) gaze upward at the ascending rocket, with tears in their eyes, they are actually watching a hanky being hoisted up a flagpole. She also said she filmed most of her scenes with a broken toe.One of the movie's best scenes was the docking sequence. In the hands of a lesser director, it would have been a ho-hum, forgettable scene. Yet Ron Howard rachets up the drama by cross-cutting between Ed Harris and the actor playing Deke Slayton as they worry about Jack Swigert, a last minute replacement performing a critical command module maneuver (""C'mon rookie, park that thing."") As many other reviewers have said, the producers did a perfect job re-creating 1970. I laughed at the part where the one Lovell daughter says about the other ""She's still moaning about the stupid Beatles breaking up!"" The older daughter swishes the door open and shoots back ""They're not stupid, you're stupid!"" This brings up another point: whoever did the costuming for the movie absolutely nailed the look of 1970 clothing and hair fashions. Yet, the movie was not nominated for a costume Oscar. I guess you have to be an 1800s or earlier period drama to be considered for that category.At the time the incident originally occurred, we followed along in social studies class. I always knew that they would get the astronauts back safe and sound, but of course, I was an innocent kid. Still, the way the producers handled the re-entry was absolutely breathtaking. I can still see the condensation from the instrument panels dripping down on Lovell, Heise, and Swigert. There was such a dramatic build-up of the broadcast delay from re-entry, it had me and everyone else in the theatre going ""Wait a minute..."" until the static crackled and James Lovell's voice triumphantly booms over the speakers. Everyone in the theater cheered just like the people in mission control.Apollo 13 didn't get the credit it deserved in the year it was released but it is still one of the best movies ever made, period.",Apollo 13

He works alongside 2 of the best men to be ready for the mission, but a medical emergency causes a team change at the last minute, which replaces a member of Lovell's crew with a man without much training just 2 days before the flight. Together, these three men travel into space, where everything seems to be going OK. That is, until a major explosion causes massive damage to the Oxygen tanks, and overall ship. To survive, the men must preserve what little oxygen remains, what little fuel remains, and what little power remains to slingshot around the moon and reenter the Earth. This movie is accurate in its portrayal of the time period as well as its source material: the real Apollo mission. The actors all played their parts beautifully, with special credit given to Tom Hanks, who, in my opinion, is incapable of doing a bad job in a role.

Falconetti, for almost the entire film. If any one of them doubted for one second what he was doing, the movie would fail. The 1930s (Rest In Peace) were the Golden Age of screen writing. But right now, right under your nose, is the Golden Age of screen acting, and no one will realize it until it's gone.",Apollo 13
176,jon-c-ison,Superb in every way,9,22 September 2019,"A brilliant illustration of the fated Apollo 13 space mission and the near miraculous turn of events in the crews struggle for survival. Everything technically is perfect; the sets, cinematography and effects. The acting is spot on, very realistic, and the movie, once it gets to the spaceship launch, is absolutely thrilling to the finish. There is an incredible attention to detail to all aspects, everything from mission control, the spaceship, to the 1960's backdrop. A story which is unbelievable, yet true. The movie is almost documentary in tone at times, which speaks of it's integrity, but might not suit everyone. Superb.",Apollo 13

178,jjgooner,The way to make a film based on true story,10,17 July 2013,"Apollo 13**** (out of 4)136 mins / PGCast: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Emily Ann Lloyd, Miko Hughes, Max Elliot Slade, Jean Speegle Howard, Chris Ellis, David Andrews, Joe SpanoDirector: Ron HowardPlot: Three astronauts on Apollo 13 must survive and return to Earth after the spacecraft begins to malfunction. JJ's Verdict: What makes Apollo 13 greater than the majority of the 'based on a true story' is that the film is a true story. It takes very few liberties (only a few lines of dialogue) and in doing so, creates a genuine and realistic tone, which is certain to entertain anyone because each event depicted on screen actually happened. Apollo 13 is the telling of the true story of three astronauts flying to the moon who are forced to abandon their mission and return to Earth after their spacecraft starts to play up and get rid of the majority of their oxygen supply. The three are forced to go to the most extreme survival techniques as Mission Control desperately attempt to find a way to get the trio back home before it is too late. When watching Apollo 13, the film manages to wipe your mind of any previous opinions you had on whether you believe the story of the moon landings or not. When you are there in that moment watching it, you believe everything the film presents to you. You believe the 1969 moon landings and you believe that the failed Apollo 12 and 13 missions happened by accident; not intentionally sabotaged by the U.S government. It makes you want to find out about the mission itself and the people involved. It is only strong filmmaking that can do both of these to the viewer. From the moment Tom Hanks utters those now immortal lines ""Houston, we have a problem"", Apollo 13 is no longer about a space mission. It is about the strength of humans and their will to survive when all seems lost and the worst might still be to come. It is about reflection on what could have been. If they had actually reached the moon. The special effects are so subtle and real that you rarely notice them and you become engrossed in the crew's epic survival; not a special effects frenzy. If modern blockbusters did this then I am sure we would realise how shockingly horrendous they actually are as the wooden acting and poor dialogue and story would have nothing to hide behind. Today special effects are just there to disguise the film's weak points but in Apollo 13, Ron Howard doesn't even want or expects us to look at the special effects. Just the engrossing drama on centre-screen. This isn't to say special effects are bad. The Star Wars and Terminator are films are among my favourite. I just wish we could have more character dramas like Apollo 13 appealing to a mainstream audience and smashing box-offices records, not just effect driven sequels and spin-offs. Not only does it have brilliant filmmakers but also, Apollo 13 is blessed with five of the best actors of their generation taking lead roles. Tom Hanks is Jim Lovell, all-American hero who ultimate goal is to reach the moon, Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert, womanising charmer who is pulled in to Apollo 13 late, Bill Paxton is Fred Haise, arrogant on the outside but weak in the inside, Gary Sinise is ken Mattingly, lonely and insecure who is forced to abandon space program after getting the 'measles' and Ed Harris is Flight Director Gene Kranz, demanding of his co- workers and calmingly confident. Hanks, Bacon and Paxton all bring their own acting style to the equation and are all equally charming at the start but scared and worried at the end. Gary Sinise is perfectly cast a Mattingly who ended up having to give up his place on the mission. Sinise captures his characters loneliness and reluctance to accept his fate. Ed Harris' Gene Kranz is strong-minded and full-on and in doing so gives us an endlessly quotable character with lines like 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option' and I don't care about what anything was designed to do, I care about what it can do.' Harris was in fact nominated for an Oscar for his role and would have won had it not been for Kevin Spacey's haunting performance in Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects.Apollo 13 is masterpiece of acting, design and storytelling. Almost all the dialogue is unaltered from actual events as are each and every scene. Ron Howard's masterpiece will leave you sweating in hope, despair and expectation. You'll question how they actually survived, but Apollo 13 happened and what better way to remember it than make a truly magnificent film about it. In fact, Apollo 13 isn't about the events but is the events. A magnificent achievement from everyone involved.",Apollo 13

But that is beside the point. I loved it. As we all know it is based on the actual mission of Apollo 13. The story is very well told and greatly acted by the actors portraying the characters. Im a huge Tom Hanks fan and this is one of his best. You get to see what goes on a little bit behind NASA and and lives of the families and friends. It's a movie worth watching. And you never get bored of it. You can watch it again and again. You always find something new with each time you watch it too. If you haven't seen it yet. Go see it today.,Apollo 13

182,HK_Key-Si_HK,A true classic!,9,21 March 2018,"Always great to watch, no matter how many times you already have seen it. Apollo 13 is one of those movies for sure. First class directing, a cast that is simply mind blowing, character interactions you actually believe and a good soundtrack on top. This is Hollywood at its best. Needless to point out that Tom Hanks scores in this movie big time, for he is one of the greatest actors of all time in my opinion. What I do want to shine a light on is the amount of heart he transports in his role as Jim Lovell. In one word: impressive! Also Kevin Bacon and Ed Harris deliver an outstanding performance. The film may build a little slow at first, but when things are about to get serious you can't take your eyes off the screen anymore. Apollo 13 is one hell of a movie and this was definetely not the last time I watched it. And I probably have seen it about ten times before already. A true classic!",Apollo 13
183,sedativchunk,this is quite possibly my #1 movie,10,11 September 2018,"I write this as Apollo 13 is on TV right now for about the third time this week. I've been a fan of Apollo 13 since this movie came out. This movie came out when I was five years old and was my first exposure to the world of the amazing Tom Hanks. I absolutely adore this movie. I dressed up as one of the astronauts as a kid in elementary school. Ron Howard's Apollo 13, to me, is simply a masterpiece. This is truly captivating film from beginning to end that tells the real-life tale of the Apollo 13 disaster. Everything about it just feels so authentic. Not just the amazing attention to detail with the spacecraft's and mission control. But to the acting and characters. The late Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris, and even Clint Howard, everyone was so perfectly cast in this movie. True, grade-A acting from the whole cast. You really feel connected to all the characters on an emotional level. Ron Howard did his best work here. Everything about this movie and the directing and editing is perfectly executed. At no time to things ever feel like they drag on. Scenes are always appropriately cut between the drama of the spacecraft and the drama of Jim Lovell's family. We get a true sense of teamwork between the astronauts and mission control as they desperately work to solve each problem the dying spacecraft is having. I also commend the unforgettable soundtrack. From the uplifting main theme song to the dramatic moments of watching the CO2 meter go down, the soundtrack just perfectly compliments this film. Not just that, but the mix, appropriately hearing the sirens and alarms going off when things go haywire on the spacecraft. I just... I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this movie. I've watched this movie a thousand times in the past 20~ years and every time I watch it it feels like I'm watching it for the first time. My eyes are just constantly glued to the TV when it's on. I think I can say that this is quite possibly my favorite movie of all time. I own it on blu-ray. I've never not liked it. It's stood the test of time to me. It still looks great today. It's a good run time. It's not bloated with CGI like the films of the 2000's. It's just a telling tale about this real-life scenario of three astronauts nearly losing their lives on a mission to the moon. Whether you are a fan of space films or not, this is a must-watch if you have not seen it.",Apollo 13
184,sue-06239,Acting is out of this world,10,12 August 2019,"I've seen this film about 5 times and never fail to enjoy it. The suspense builds to an almost unbearable level as the astronauts and the fantastic team at Mission Control work together to get the spaceship home safely.The period detail, music and fashions are great - I was 13 at the time and when Bill plays Spirit in the Sky during their TV broadcast it's a great moment.All the performances are excellent - but for me, apart from the 4 astronauts (including Gary Sinise as the one who had to drop out), the stand-out excellent acting by Kathleen Quinlan and Ed Harris. I cannot be the only woman who fell in love with Ed during this film because of his brilliance and vulnerability as he directs the mission to save the crew, while under enormous stress. I just wanted to give him a massive hug at the end!Highly recommended.",Apollo 13

We were SO IMPRESSED that we left the movie saying 'vote for Opie'.As many other people have said, we know the end (safety for the crew). But even when I get a copy of the film, I am still glued to the screen.Many actors were SO good in this film, particularly Gary Senise, working so hard like the astronaut that he is, until he finally gets the 'right' sequence for the return of the guys in space.Again, so many good performances by all of the actors. Loved when Ed Harris was so touched when the ship was in the ocean and his effort to keep his face straight and brush away any tears when he faces the rest of his crew.Also, the funny part when Jim Lovell's Mom is glued to the television and Marilyn Lovell brings in some people do distract her. When she introduces them as Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong, and the mother turns to them and asks them if they hope to be in the space program.

190,mig28lx,Do you really need ME to tell YOU this?,9,21 September 2000,"Well...um...where to start?Tom Hanks, looking like he was shooting for a three-peat, three years in a row being nominated for the Best Actor Oscar, didn't get it.  Did he deserve it?  If Mel Gibson had only waited a year before releasing ""Braveheart"", he would have been a lock.  Also, this is, above all, an ensemble picture.  But you don't need me to tell YOU that, you already KNOW that.  Right? So...next.The special effects.  If you don't already know, many of the zero-gravity shots in this flick were accomplished by constructing a set of the space capsule inside what's known as the ""Vomit Comet"", a modified jet aircraft designed to simulate weightlessness for astronaut training.  What it does is simple: it flies up to a high altitude very fast, then gradually turns earthward at just enough speed to make whatever is inside of the jet ""float"" off the ground, thus creating a weightless effect.  Not too impressive, right?  Except the actors, directors and other crew members made between 500 and 600 individual flights on the ""Vomit Comet"" to get all the required shots.  But you already know THAT.  Don't you?The story.  It's kinda like watching ""Titanic.""  You KNOW the boat sinks, you just wanna see how it's DONE.  Same here.  Ron Howard, director extraordinaire, tightens the story and ratchets up the tension so we are prepared to either bawl our eyes out or stand up and cheer at the end...and either way would be equally as satisfying.But you don't need ME to tell YOU this...do you?",Apollo 13
191,Weredegu,Stay home with the family,6,28 January 2007,"Firstly, you know that space research can produce benefits in terms of the spill-over effects of technological breakthroughs. But then probably even a most senseless but challenging task humanity may set itself might bring about such results. Secondly, less appealing is the idea that its motive in a conflict like the Cold War may be the quest for prestige (not that bad a prospect) and/or for a better shooting position (no 'prospect'). Thirdly, while it doesn't sound bad, a mortal being with the limitations of a lifetime's perspective understandably is just not so moved by the idea that one day our proverbial grandchildren might be able to speed off to another planet and thus make it till the grand finale of the universe in the End, thanks to space research.So, what I found interesting about this space movie is that it shows the importance of coming back more than that of going out, and that so it puts the whole debate above into a funny perspective, rather unintentionally of course. Let's just stay here, get everyone into safety on Earth, all of humanity. What a warm and pleasing thought indeed. Otherwise, the film is rather mediocre, I thought. And the schematic film score made me shake my head in disapproval every now and again.",Apollo 13
192,jturnbull-398-395794,An underrated movie about a real event,9,14 July 2012,"I am at a loss as to why some people criticise this movie unless they are far to young to understand the period and the importance of the space program at the time.Anyone who has been to the Smithsonian in Washington DC will appreciate that these were pretty crude instruments to travel to the moon and back. I would'nt cross town in one of these but men of determination, dedication, vision and belief set off for what has been until now the greatest adventure of all time.Inevitably something was always going to go wrong and this was Apollo 13. That through ingenuity, analysis, and bravery under fire (so to speak) the crew returned to Earth is every bit as remarkable as what the story suggests.The settings are realistic, down to clothes, hairstyles and the like. The fusion of the event with the more mundane aspects of family life add to the realism. The acting is strong and believable, and I particularly liked the interpretation of Lovell's wife, who manages to blend support of her husband, with fear and concern, while trying to run a relatively normal household.The parts of the three astronauts are well portrayed. Hanks, who I wax and wane on does a good job and Kevin Bacon is plausible as Swigert, even if his bachelor status is a bit overcooked. Gary Sinese, as always, is terrific and his role in the rescue of the mission is a little overstated, but he is just as good here as he was as Capt. Dan in Forest Gump. Ed Harris, also as is usual, is very good (and I particularly liked his waistcoat).This makes a great companion piece to The Right Stuff, another of my favourite movies, and anyone interested in the space program, and where it came from, should have both in their DVD collection, along with the documentary piece, In the Shadow of the Moon and the TV series From the Earth to the Moon.",Apollo 13

The production, direction, acting and dialog are nothing short of brilliant.

195,jre-5,A Good Remake of an amazing true story,9,10 June 2005,"It's a great portrayal of an amazing true event. It's amazing some of the lengths they went through to film it, perhaps most notably filming scenes in falling planes to simulate weightlessness. When I was a kid I always used to study space travel a lot, most notably the Apollo program. When the movie first came out I was very skeptical, and didn't think they could ever make it look like the true story, especially the launch. But when I saw it I was totally amazed at just how realistic it was. There's a few things about it that are a little bit inaccurate, like some of the patterns on the Saturn 5 rocket, and the course correction in space which in real life was much smoother. But overall it's very accurate and very dramatic. Every time I watch it, it's still an incredible story, and always an amazing reminder of the true story.",Apollo 13

Three guys as far from home as one can be, their craft failing, and a team working as hard as hell to get them home.Humanity faces innumerable challenges in the future. I only hope that we can look to this example to get through those challenges.And then there is the film. I think it is impeccably written, acted, and scored. The technical details are fantastic. It does dramatize a few things, but that's ok because it improves the humanity.I was inspired to write this review on a recent rewatch.

This movie was filled with Hollywood's superstars and they played their parts well- even the children of Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks).  Ron Howard caught the interactions between the performers in the important scenes so you could feel the situations.  You get caught up in the efforts the space shuttle crew and Mission Control make to get the Apollo 13 back to earth.A hearty high five to not only the actors and actresses that portrayed the real-life characters, but a hearty high five to the real spoken and unspoken heros of the Apollo 13 mission as well.",Apollo 13

The acting was all pretty good but Tom Hanks really carries the film as well as Ed Harris and Clint Howard. The script was very solid in the dialogue but had the usual quips and cool guy phrases. Basically if you take out EVERYTHING with the wife and especially the grandma this would be a much better film. Now don't get me wrong I am all for schmaltz but it just didn't work for this movie especially because we know exactly what happens. Also I was bummed they spent the whole time in the space ship having purposely avoided knowing what happened in the mission (as it was 37 years before I was born) either way it was a good watch and pretty suspenseful overall. The set design and special effects were out of this world (pun intended) check it out you might like it more than me but for now it gets a big giant ""EH""",Apollo 13
200,DomiMMHS,Some refreshing aspects make it really worth watching!,7,28 December 1998,"I don't find ""Apollo 13"" a very entertaining movie, but it's still what I would call very good entertainment. Sometimes there is this kind of annoying emotionalism, which is quite clear, as it's about both technical achievement and American history. There is that one scene I dislike most: When the pope and the people at the Wailing Wall are praying for the astronauts. I have no idea whether this really happened or not - but honestly I do not believe it.But the good thing is that I don't mind this emotionalism because of some very refreshing aspects. First what we see here are altogether very nice performances. Especially Ed Harris makes the movie enjoyable with his very fine acting. Kathleen Quinlan, who was nominated for an Oscar as well, is also very good - but you don't really notice her. Gary Sinise is almost as good as Harris and Tom Hanks also tries his best to give his character a special personality and some soul - he doesn't really succeed.Also very refreshing is the small deal of irony in this. There are many little scenes before the launch which indicate in a slightly funny way that Apollo  t h i r t e e n  means disaster like Quinlan losing her wedding ring. All these aspects make a not really entertaining movie extremely worth watching. I voted 7, for good.By the way...I noticed that Emily Ann Lloyd (whom you might know from ""Home For the Holiday"") who plays little Susan Lovell, is overacting. She's got no major importance for the story, but her overacting attracts of course attention.",Apollo 13

Yes there was a love story, but this love story actually existed and it didn't interfere with the whole meaning of what actually happened like what Pearl Harbor mistakingly did (though I did like Pearl Harbor. But still this movie's title didn't trick you into really what the movie was about. So really if you think about it, if you want to see a movie that's accurate and well done about the Apollo 13 mission, I suggest seeing Apollo 13. The script was very well written, the acting was incredible, by Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, Gary Sinice, and the woman who portrayed Jim Lovell's wife. The movie was perfectly paced. They give you time to get what they're going to do on the Apollo 13 mission. They tell you everything that was important that was prior to the launch, happy and sad events. Tom Hanks truely desereved to be the winner for 1995's best actor, though I don't know who were the other contenders. But anyways, if you want to see a great historically accurate movie, Apollo 13 is definitely worth seeing, because it is truly about Apollo 13.

The film follows the real-life events of three astronauts shot into space on the title craft, its destination the moon, but trouble with the craft gives them other plans. Although the chemistry of Paxton, Hanks, and Bacon is useful, the main problem is that the viewer becomes lost within a dialogue full of space craft-NASA mumbo jumbo.

The movie is about the 3rd attempt of America to land on the moon and how it failed to reach its original destination and still became a phenomenon. As the movie goes on it reveals a lot more than just the journey. It shows the human kind can overcome any odd if they truly want to. It also shows how determination is superior than the problem.

The representation of the spacecraft and the technical settings is incredibly accurate (I believe that the mission control sequences were actually filmed in the genuine mission control room at Houston space center.) The film would still be fascinating, entertaining, dramatic, humorous and emotional if it were merely fiction. Knowing that this superb movie retains all those qualities while being the true story of an event - that I still remember with powerful emotion - lifts it from the realm of good movies to the ranks of all-time classic masterpieces of cinema.",Apollo 13

There is tension from the very real story of what happened to the astronauts of Apollo 13, but it falls flat to me because of the absolutely horrible writing. The screenwriters apparently decided the best way to maintain accuracy was to write as much as they could in technical detail that would go over the audience's head. Then they decide to give continuous exposition dumps through the news in the most mind numbingly boring ways. It's lucky that Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, and Gary Sinise complement each other so well or else this whole film would be a total flop for me. I give Apollo 13 a 6/10.",Apollo 13

Gravity, you suck!",9,17 July 2014,"A great movie of history which sheds a lot of light on the extremely awesome technical accomplishment it was to send people to the moon (and with computers that could ""fit into a single room"" that are less powerful than and old Nokia brickphone). There's a bit of drama added, but overall the movie does extremely well at also going deep into the technical struggle with a well executed fortitude far beyond what most Hollywood would dare (i.e. Gravity).This movie teaches, entertains, and inspires the audience toward scientific endeavor like no other. Special effects are amazing, especially for its time, but they are not the sole source of meaning (as with mofoing#! Gravity). Apollo 13 respects its audience, and though filmicly it's rather standard storytelling, it's great to see a film made that tells such a story.",Apollo 13
209,The_Hateful_Citizen,"""Houston, we've had a problem"" was essential",7,27 June 2017,"A good historical film that traces the Apollo 13 mission, we have three visions of action, the rocket where are the three astronauts, the NASA command post where the best scientists of the world try to help these three men stuck in the space and the families, mostly Jim Lovell's, played by Tom Hanks, these three points of view are quite interesting. I think that the fact that I already know the story, and therefore the end, disturbed me a bit, at no time did I think ""they may not be able to survive"", it's a disadvantage, we do with. All in all the movie is good or very good but I think, even if it seems harmless, I would have liked that the sentence ""Houston, we've had a problem"" has more importance and is said in a tone perhaps more solemn than just said like that, it is certainly why I rate 7 and not 8. ""Houston, we've had a problem"" was essential.",Apollo 13
210,Crystal_Hansen,"""Houston, We've had a problem.""",10,14 March 2019,"Based on the NASA mission, this movie follows the flight of the space shuttle Apollo 13. The movie is really heavy in way of emotional moments. It is rated PG because of the emotional intensity. One of the astronauts goes into space while he has a baby on the way and coming soon. His poor wife has to worry about what'll happen to her husband in space, but she can't worry too much because of the baby. One of those movies you have to watch again and again.Although not recommended for children under 12, it's a spectacular recreation of actual events. There is a considerable amount of language and a couple questionable scenes that are easily fast forwarded through, but isn't really that bad. Parents of younger children may want to watch the movie first before letting their children watch it. For all the young kids watching the movie, there is no need to be fearful for the lives of the astronauts. Spoilers: they make it back to earth safely, just not quite in the way mission control would have liked them to. They are unable to land on the moon because of the oxygen tank explosion among other problems.The screenplay is phenomenal. Every scene that the astronauts are weightless is real weightlessness. The director used the Vomit Comet to get the effect of being weightless. The shuttle that is used in the movie is inside the belly of the Vomit Comet, an airplane that NASA uses to train astronauts how to handle being weightless while in space. The weightless feeling only last 25 seconds out of a 65 second flight. The crew of the movie had to take multiple shots of the same scene to get enough for the movie. For the time period, these were high tech special effects and knowing that the actors are really weightless makes the movie even better. Most space movies in which the actors are in space, the weightless effect is made by using strings attached to the actors to move them in a weightless manner. It's rather interesting to watch a movie after seeing it once and knowing the second time that the astronauts are really weightless.",Apollo 13

Pretty close to a perfect film, from casting, to cutting, to special effects. Watching Titanic I knew that I was watching CGI, in this film at times it seemed more like a well crafted documentary. As real as the experience can get, through a camera's eye. So many perfect moments, the little boy asking about the fire, and the lost ring.

214,aaronclawrence,"Solid, gripping and realistic",8,19 August 2002,"It's difficult to find a flaw with this film, because it is very realistic and the only ""weaknesses"" are due directly to this realism: a lack of big moral points to make, sometimes slow plot development. Having said that, I found it quite gripping and involving on both of two viewings.
Good or great performances from all involved, with a pleasing lack of showboating even from the usually loud Kevin Bacon. A real sense of team effort developed, which is very rare in Hollywood, where 90% of films feature one or two main characters saving the world (boring).This film is a fine example of how to bring a real story to life without butchering it or just using it as a set piece - in stark contrast to Pearl Harbor. I can't say it's an insanely great film, but it's pretty damn good. 8 out 10.",Apollo 13
215,mike683,Not a Bad Vehicle...Unlike the Service Module,8,15 December 2019,"I have watched this movie over one hundred times, and I find it to be one of Ron Howard's best. From start to finish the viewer is taken on an ill-fated trip that conveys 'contingency' at its utmost. Survival is the name of the game and the film portrays the resilience of the entire space program to bring three astronauts' home. Howard sets the dramatic tone early with a front-loaded revisit to the tragic deaths of the Apollo 1 crew. It is a reminder and signifies the fragility of life as an astronaut.Howard effortlessly incorporates family and the behind the scenes skepticism of very engaged spouse played perfectly by Kathleen Quinlan. Her onscreen chemistry with Tom Hanks, though limited, is infectious. Along with Hanks, Howard has an excellent ensemble of characters all of who offer insight into the multifaceted background of a space mission. Ed Harris delivers a gem of a performance and absolutely takes command of the film, as he steers the audience through the launch, the casualty and motivates the ground team to get the men home.Overall, my liking this movie centers on the vicarious nature and the ""what would I do"" feel of the story. Howard's film keeps you firmly in space and presents the environmental conditions aptly, so the viewer indeed understands the harsh reality the Apollo 13 crew endures. In contrast, he reveals the circumstances with the families, where the stress, strain, and feelings of helplessness are poignantly unveiled.Alas, it is that emotional aspect that I also feel is lacking at the film's end. We see that the crew returns safely, we see the families react from afar, but after being subjected throughout the film to the intimate emotional swings of the families, one would love to have seen the inevitable and conceivably incredible reunions with loved ones. It is my impression that Ron Howard missed the boat on that omission. Thus, the movie gets 8 out 10 stars from me, but do not let that be an indication I feel it is not truly a 10.",Apollo 13
216,Snowgoat,A great story - but not a great movie,7,22 April 2020,A decent-enough telling of the incredible events of the Apollo 13 mission - but fairly by-the-numbers 90s movie-making (with some added cheese). Having seen it numerous times over the years I've never felt like it really sucks you in and makes you feel part of the events unfolding - just leaves you conscious that you're watching a (competent) Hollywood re-enactment (much like most of the accompanying HBO From the Earth to the Moon show).

But I thought he was good in this, even better was his character, and how he played the character. I didn't realize this was based on a true story until I came on this and now that I found out, it somehow seems better. The acting was good from all involved, although I thought it should have been a lot better considering how big the film was. However, I have no real complaints except that the last hour kind of dragged on. I was getting bored at a few parts in the last hour, although the last 10 minutes or so are quite good. However, the first hour is very good though, although I think they should have spent less time in the space shuttle and more building the characters because you don't get a sense of danger and there comes a point when you don't care whether they make it back alive or not.

When I was watching this movie all I could think about was how people were really devoted to get onto the moon. They ran simulations after simulations. This movie has a great story and really focuses on the idea that they had to do this. Apollo 13 is about 3 men from nasa trying to get to the moon. I had already known what had happened on apollo 13 from my history classes but it was good to actually get to watch it. The history part of this movie will always be interesting to me because you can truly see how much we have developed. The director to this movie is Ron Howard. He does a great job on the video shots and everything else. The main actor to this movie is Tom Hanks he plays the lead role in this film and I think he did a great job.

""Houston we have a problem"", only that one problem turns into a million problems for those three astronauts who were expecting to walk on the moon that day. A fail mission then becomes a rescue mission for Houston. They must put their dorky-headed minds together and devise various tragedies to insure that the two family men and the bachelor return home. A lot of emotion excels in this desperate time both from the astronauts and the people in Houston killing themselves trying to come up with ways to conserve their power, food and oxygen. And of course we can't forget those friends and family biting their nails hoping that they can still have one last barbecue together before saying their goodbyes. Ron Howard really made me feel like this was real, and I know it was, it's just that he retells it in such a believable and suspenseful way. The terminology is solid, the visual effects are amazing but not over done, and the huge line of American actors was assembled perfectly. There's a saddening sense of loss for those astronauts not being able to walk on the moon that later becomes a beautiful sense of relief to a safe return home, which all in all adds to a very satisfying ending.

224,wmullerswm,A dull film that feels real,5,1 August 2017,"Apollo 13 is a very well-executed, well-directed, and well-funded movie. It has great acting, good story, and a solid theme. However, the film is so enervated and the theme so obvious, that one would naturally wonder if it would be much better if cut shorter. Honestly speaking, I came for Tom Hanks. He is good in this movie, playing a character he is much familiar with by now. Ed Harris as Gene Kranz impressed me a lot. The other characters have all contributed convincing performances, and if rated individually, I would give the acting 8/10. The pacing of the film is horrible. The third act, or the forth act, which I cannot distinguish because the film gets messier as it comes to the end, is the most interesting and compact part in the film. The first and the second act is so overlong and dull. I just do not understand why Ken, as a character, is so important. He does not really help develop the thematic message, and this is not a documentary. If he has to be there, he should only have shown up in the first half of the film, illustrating that in front of the greater good, individuality has to be eliminated. Also in making Ken a character, the film somehow makes the medical team the villain! That is just stupid and confusing, especially when Tom Hanks takes off his medical things and the other two crew members follow. That is just so unprofessional and out-of-character. Now I understand it may have been used to say something about the comradeship, but that is just so cliché and outdated, even to a film made in say 1950s. Oh the special effects are good. They are very realistic, matching the real ones. So in conclusion, if you are a spaceship fanboy or something like that, this is a great film for you because it is quite realistic; if you are looking for something more impactful or energetic, go to Gravity or The Martian; if you want something more abstract and has a deeper thematic message, 2001: the Space Odyssey is always there for you.",Apollo 13

Despite all of the little technical errors, Ron Howard and his crew have put together a superb film, one that deserved the 9 Academy Award nominations which it received.

235,fanny92,Good to Know the Story,8,20 March 2019,"I've always heard the name Apollo 13 and have always known that it was a space mission, but I have never actually heard the story. Until I watched this movie, I had no idea what had happened or what their mission was for. I never knew that they were trying to get to the moon again on that mission. Because I never knew the story, I was in suspense the whole movie, which I like while watching movies. Unlike in other history movies where I know what is going on, this one was interesting to watch because it was almost like history unfolding right in front of me which was cool.
This movie is about NASA's Apollo 13 mission to try to get to the moon after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had gotten there the first time. Three astronauts are sent on this mission: Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert. Some things on their mission go wrong and they and their team back on earth do all they can to get the three astronauts safely home.
Before I watched this movie, I did not know this part of history. I had no idea that there had been another mission to try and get to the moon after the Apollo 11 mission. This part of history is really interesting to me because we put men into space which is really awesome. Even though the technology back then is not near to what it is now, it still amazes me that they were able to put people and even just things into space. It blows my mind.
The director of this movie is Ron Howard. I have seen a couple of the movies that he has directed. I really liked them. There was only one I watched that he directed that I didn't like. The main actors in this movie are Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton who play the three astronauts. I have seen Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon in a few movies, and I think they are great actors. They are always entertaining to watch and I like the type of movies they have been in (at least the ones I have seen). My favorite scene in this movie was when the astronauts were trying to stay on target with the earth, but had to keep the earth in view from their window, instead of using technology because most of the technology in their shuttle was down.
I really liked all the scenes with the astronauts in space, especially after everything went wrong. It was interesting to see how they acted and reacted in their desperate situation. It was also interesting to see how their team on earth worked together to get the astronauts safely home. This was a great movie and the space scenes were really realistic.

The line is just so catchy and universally everyone knows where it came from. It was smart of the director to use this line in the movie. The plot of the movie was that three guys are launched into outer space on Apollo 13 and something goes wrong when they're up in space. On earth, the people at NASA are trying to figure out how to get them back to earth ground safely with little time and oxygen left for them. Apollo 13 was the first ever rocket launch i remember hearing about in elementary school. I knew it was launched in 1970, but in the years 2007- 2009 I remember being talked to about it. I know there's been tons of other rocket launches, but for some reason, that one seemed to be the only one ever talked about in my atmosphere. I've seen other movies of this genre, and they're all really good movies, they just all have the same plot, more or less, and it makes them predictable. Ron Howard is the name of the director for apollo 13. He's also the director for countless other movies. The only other movies i've watched that've been directed by him are: Jay-Z-made in america, The Dilemma,The grinch, The heart of the sea, Inferno, and a beautiful mind. All of which are great movies. The main actors are Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, and Gary Sinise. All have been great actors in other movies they've appeared in. I personally think Tom Hanks was the best actor of all. I'm not sure that i would have watched this movie outside of school only because i'm more into dramatic, sappy, romance movies. I really enjoyed this movie though, it was thrilling and had you on the edge of your seat waiting to see if they'd make it home or not. I would recommend this to my friends. 10/10 amazing movie.",Apollo 13
243,martinruiz-35369,Apollo 13 Review,5,22 April 2019,This movie was okay. It is not a movie to keep teenagers entertained in a class. The reason is because there is not a lot to relate to. People in general like to relate to things. The movie dragged on a lot to me. It is not a movie i would watch out of school. What i can say is that the characters were all so realistically portrayed and the film was well directed. But the movie is really slow and is not my type of movie.,Apollo 13
244,Donners,"Excellent, but with a few low points.",8,19 February 2000,"Firstly, I'll point out that I did really like this movie. Great special effects, the lead cast was quite good, and many scenes were very well done. Even in moments of utter silence, with nothing happening, the tension was still obvious. The music as a whole is quite good, but the main title theme is repeated a little too much - after all, it hardly has the impact of something like Alexander Courage's Star Trek theme. Overall, an excellent movie. But there are still many bad points. The movie is rather slow to begin with, and there are plenty of the family scenes that should have been cut. They add nothing to the movie - and in many cases they detract from it. This isn't helped by the acting from the female cast members, which is simply appalling. Surely they could afford at least one person besides a few of the top listed men who could act. Also, there are many cliches in the dialogue, and the heroic nature of these people is hammered into us far too many times. Still, I did enjoy it, but more as escapism than anything meaningful. 7/10",Apollo 13
245,davidn-2,Brilliant docu-drama,9,29 March 2000,"Note my one-line summary. This is a docu-drama, ie a fictionalized (slightly) account based on true events. If you want a documentary, watch the old video footage. This is a movie, and a technically brilliant one.I'm a complete cynic when it comes to realism in space and science fiction movies, but this movie had me believing Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon were in space.Kudos to the producers. By sticking close to a true story, they have a believable script. To entertain the audience, they used excellent actors and added some drama to the mix. The effects cap it off nicely.",Apollo 13
246,dom-taylor,Good movie,7,19 July 2004,"First off  I have to confess I am an avowed space junkie and this tends to raise the bar in terms of my expectations of this movie, being familiar with the true life events that form the background of this movie. 	 In summary, the movie surrounds the near-disaster which surrounded NASA's Ill-fated 3rd  Mission to the moon. After two landings on the moon the missions had become almost commonplace and public interest in the space program was beginning to wane. This changed at 03:06 UT on 14 April 1970 when a malfunction in a heating coil caused an oxygen tank to explode, severely damaging the service module. The damage was so extensive that it forced the abandonment of the moon-landing and the severely compromised the ability of Astronauts Cpt James Lovell, John L Swigert and Fred Haise jnr to return home, a task they were able to accomplish only by jury-rigging their available equipment under the direction of Houston and suffering cold temperatures before they were able to successfully renter the Earths atmosphere in their spacecraft.Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon are eerily convincing as the astronauts and excellently manage to convey the tension of being in mortal danger in a malfunctioning tin can a quarter of a million miles from home, facing not only the bitter disappointment at not completing the mission of landing on the moon but the prospect of losing their lives in such an inhospitable and lonely environment. Of course nobody except the original astronauts knows what was going through their minds but Hanks et al allow the audience to appreciate the state of disciplined tension and terror that the voyagers were subjected to.Other performances worthy of note include a determined and gritty portrayal of Charismatic and forceful Nasa Flight Director Gene Kranz by Ed Harris.The film is well directed and the pace does not lack, despite the difficulty of portraying events in a tense fashion in a space not much larger than a large caravan, and the long periods of inactivity that form a large part of manned space flight.Summary : An excellent `true life' movie, successful  in portraying events both in space and the reaction of those left on the ground.Rating : 90%",Apollo 13
247,torijohn33,Apollo 13,8,14 March 2019,This movie was a pretty good one. I don't know what the real events were like but I can say that this movie showed the fear that the families of the crew. They were all terrified because of past fatalities and failures of the launches. My favorite scene is when they take off and have a successful take off. This movie truly shows the history part of time and how this was a huge event that the US was proud of. They weren't the first people in space but this was a good and successful flight. I have seen this movie outside of school and it was a pretty good movie but if some people aren't into this part of time then I wouldn't recommend but this did show the victory and the emotions that spread through the film of how they did this mission. Another good scene was when they showed us the cabin and how they did things with zero gravity.,Apollo 13
248,j-70761,Intense stuff,7,3 May 2019,This movie does a good job of making you feel the danger and terror that these three astronauts went through. This movie made me look at space exploring and NASA differently. Not only were the astronauts stressed out but the people on Earth were sleep deprived and working non stop to get these guys home.,Apollo 13
249,bodine-1,For Tom Hanks fans only,2,13 February 2003,"Technically well made film is atrocious in just about every other department. The script is hobbled by the sheer volume of clichés and since the outcome of the astronauts fate is already known to history, there isn't an ounce of suspense. Director Howard's bland direction deadens an already overlong movie, which tries to liven things up with a bombastic score and the casting of ""stars"" in the pivotal roles. It doesn't work. Tom Hanks addicts will probably want to see it, but this one is as bad as Howard's other thudding disappointment, Far and Away.If you want to see a good movie on the U.S. space program, see Phil Kaufman's 1983 pic The Right Stuff. Avoid this one unless you need some snooze time and wasting nearly 2½ hours is your prime directive.",Apollo 13
250,Titleist18,The Ultimate Physics Movie,8,1 October 2003,"This is the movie that is basically the quintessential physics movie. From when the tanks explode to when it splashes down, the whole film is based upon fundamental physics and Newton's laws. The astronauts keep from firing the rockets in fear of igniting the fuel and blowing themselves up, so they let the module coast towards the moon to 1) let the force of gravity swing them back. The second physics point is that by letting the module coast, they know it will get to the moon as an object in motion stays in motion until acted upon by a force, in which case the settings of space don't allow there to be any. They then fear about burning up upon re-entry, which brings up the force of friction and air resistance that cause the heat to take place. If you are struggling in physics, specifically with Newton's laws, just watch Apollo 13 and all your problems will fade away.",Apollo 13
251,marchal-2,Even Armageddon is less boring,1,7 March 2003,"I'm just amazed at the ratings this movie gets. Is it too hard to admit that a Tom Hanks movie can suck ? (i'm personally not a fan - more like the contrary - but that's not the point). How many more of these dull patriotic pieces of crap will we have to stand ? Where's the suspense, the fun ? Everyone can guess how it's going to end anyway: everyone applauding in the nasa control room (reminds me of the ending in Britney Spears' Crossroads !). The jokes and the characters are always the same, the music an abomination, etc. Is it because it's based on a real story that it should get better ratings than, say, Armageddon (which is exactly the same movie, just even more dumb)? What did these real-life astronauts do to deserve this ? Boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring (got me so tired I couldn't find the strength to reach the remote control).

Though the film was based on the book ""Lost Moon"", we must give credit to the director Ron Howard and his entire team, who in the best possible way, made the film very easy to understand even for the type of people who like me had no interest in the space theme. I highlight the performances of Ed Harris and Gary Sinise, which, especially in the last 10/15 minutes, allowed to accentuate the feeling of anguish and distress that made Jim Lovell's mythical phrase ""Hey Houston, this is Odissey. It's great to see you again! "" throw us off the chair! I highly recommend this film, fantastic!

First of all I believe James Horner has put out one of the best musical scores ever. And the mix of actors in Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton etc.. is perfect, they were great together in this film. This movie also has some great effects, and some good action, this movie could appeal to anyone it has everything you could ask for in a movie. Ron Howard has done a great job and Ed Harris has put out his best performance ever. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. RUN to the video stort if you haven't seen it.",Apollo 13
256,chimpanzee_boyuk,Excellent film (even with goofs),10,1 January 2007,"""Houston, we have a problem""; the biggest misquote in cinematic history no less, but for all the right reasons. Apollo 13 has to be one of my favourite films of all time.It is amazing how things always seem to be much longer you are young. I first saw the movie when I was about 6 or 7 and it seemed to go on for much longer than, but I was still gripped. The acting is very good, with Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon in the centre of it all, giving life to the situation that they are in. The visual effects were awesome, and even to this day they still look good, and the fact that for the zero gravity scenes, they really went up in a ""vommit comet"" (the same aircraft training scheme that the real astronauts used, and still use for the astronaut training program!) However, the film is brimming with factual errors and anachronisms, which most people find intolerable; TV programs that appear on screens throughout the movie that don't actually appear until after or before April 1970; Lunar errors (give me a viewing of E.T. any day!) and props that didn't appear until after the incident e.g. coffee mugs, beetles albums and other items. However, it is only a Ron Howard film, what can you do?However, this is made up for with the good acting, brilliant visual effects and brilliant score (composed by James Horner, who I think, next to John Williams and the late Jerry Goldsmith, is the one of the best movie composers). A brilliant ""historical"" adaptation (in terms of drama and acting). 8/10",Apollo 13
257,justimarie,Great movie even though we know the ending,10,28 December 2003,"I was about 8 years old when Apollo 13 happened, so I can't remember not knowing the story. I've read the book 'Lost moon' 2 or 3 times, and seen the film several times too. But I watched it again the other night and once more was completely lost in the tension and drama of the events, portrayed in such a convincing way. How can it still make me so involved and worried even though I know the ending? Terrific movie. Tom Hanks was superb in this as ever. Kevin Bacon is also always convincing and a great character actor.",Apollo 13
258,ke4roh,A fabulous movie that relates a true story,10,8 March 1999,"Apollo 13 is exciting each time I watch it.  Each piece of the movie contributes to make a riveting story even with the known ending.  Effects are breathtaking (all of the launch scenes, for example, are computer-generated since the stock footage was all unacceptable).Best of all, the movie is historically accurate.  Granted, Howard took some license, but not much.  The biggest difference is that the astronauts on the historical mission fired the engine several short times manually while the movie version packed all the excitement into one firing.  Other differences amount to minutia.  For example, the historical record shows that they played ""Blue Danube"", as opposed to the movie's ""Spirit in the Sky"", at the beginning of the real TV broadcast.  At other times, the details are real. Marion Lovell actually did loose her wedding ring in the shower!Acting in the movie is superb.  You feel the frustration when Mattingly has to stay home with measles.  You feel the excitement when Swigert gets to go in his place.  You feel Marian Lovell's stress when she doesn't know what's going to happen to her husband.  You feel the cold, uncertainty, and dependence on ground support on the return trip.  You feel a part of the team called NASA that ultimately brought the astronauts home.Overall, Apollo 13 is a magnificent movie - well worth watching time and again.",Apollo 13
259,Adz-4,Emotional Intensity? You bet!,8,8 April 2000,"This is an incredible movie of intense emotion, suspense and warmth that brings unity and appreciation for life. Absolutely brilliant acting from Tom Hanks who plays his role with an admirable coolness, and as always, completely natural. Ed Harris was magnificent in his role, and his tears at the end were modest and moving. The rest of the cast were great in support. The moments when the ship was returning to Earth (having not known the real story myself) were incredibly suspenseful due to the quietness and faces of the actors. I have rarely been on the edge of my seat in a movie like this one. Great scenes in space, gives you a view most won't experience. Good special effects, spectacular sound in the launch scene. This is a classic tale that has been very well directed. It would not be easy recreating this story but this movie has achieved that. I would have liked to have seen a reunion with family at the end for that extra ""oomph"" but thats just a personal opinion that doesn't need to be taken as a criticism. I recommend this to everyone at all ages, even if you know the story. This movie is hard to falter and can be watched many times without losing the emotional impact. Its a ride and you'll want to go on again.",Apollo 13
260,mrbeankc,Great movie making but misses the big picture,7,25 July 2000,"This movie in 50 years will be viewed as a semi documentary of the Apollo 13 mission. Pity, because as a piece that claims to be accurate from a historic point of view it misses the mark by a wide margin. My main problem with the film is how the story and characters were changed for dramatic effect. The best example of this is Jack Swigert. In the film he was shown as an inexperienced rookie who had to constantly prove his worth. Meanwhile Ken Mattingly is shown to be the great hero and the only one who knows the command module well enough to save it. The truth is Jack Swigert wrote the emergency procedures for the command module, the very ones the crew used when the emergency happened. It was said they were lucky Swagert was on the flight as he was one of the best to handle the situation. Mattingly meanwhile was also a rookie astronaut and it was in fact Gene Cernan and other veteran astronauts who worked out the problems in the simulators. A good film that tries to be very accurate in the look and feel but fails to be accurate in it's script as it goes for old Hollywood dramatics instead.",Apollo 13

The sets are loving recreations of mission control - or maybe the used the real one, I wouldn't be surprised.The Apollo program had grandeur and daring like the early square-rigged ships, or the first Antarctic explorers, or Hillary on Everest. And the movie manages to portray that with some emotion, but not over the top sentimentality. The men involved were heroes no doubt about it.

It's another film about the great America and one of the thousand times that did things that shook the world. If you are ok with that then you will have a great time watching this movie. First of all it's really well crafted. Really for this film to be made in 1995 is really impressive. Sure there are some old effects and a naive screenplay but this movie was made in the mid 90's! That alone is so impressive. I don't know if the events are portrayed with a lot of reality but this is not a documentary so I was alright with that. It's a fun movie with some really good performances (seems like Tom Hanks is playing the good guy since forever) with my favorite being probably Ed Harris's role. As I said the story is really naive. All characters are portrayed like they are the best persons in the world and any conflict or obstacles are gone after a while for the shake of the good ending. But that was the case abput blockbuster films back then. And at least fromsame films of this century ""Apollo 13"" has a soul. It takes itself as seriously as it must for the story to proceed without being tiresome. The movie gets into the mission right away and our heroes are sent to the moon in the first 30 minutes. It's a fast paced and hard boiled movie that you will enjoy if you shut off your brain and let it tell you its story without expecting much.

Hundreds of determined men refused to lose thier comrades in the last frontier, and they brought them home. Meanwhile, the Russians lost quite a few in space.

Two days after launch, the Apollo spacecraft was crippled by an explosion, causing the Service Module portion of the Apollo Command/Service Module to lose its oxygen and electrical power. The crew used the Lunar Module as a ""lifeboat"" in space. The command module systems remained functional, but were deactivated to preserve its capability to reenter Earth's atmosphere upon return to the earth. The crew endured difficult conditions due to severe constraints on power, cabin heat, and potable water, but successfully returned to Earth.Watch it!!Worth it!!",Apollo 13
271,vsg31,"The crisis of Apollo 13 mission is shown from all points of view, including ground controllers and the families.",10,10 April 2014,"""Apollo 13"" is a docudrama that has you on the edge of your seat even if you may know what's going to happen. It's the true story of the 1970 mission to the moon where the famous ""Houston, we have a problem,"" quote originated. Other documentaries tell the same story, but this 1995 version, directed by Ron Howard, is a must-see masterpiece.The lead character of mission commander Jim Lovell is played by Tom Hanks. (My 10th-grade students watched it and recognized Hanks' voice as Woody from ""Toy Story"".) Lovell refuses to be superstitious about the number 13. When his crew is moved up from Apollo 14 to 13, his wife asks, ""Why does it have to be 13?"" ""Because it follows 12,"" he replies. Lovell is funny, smart and a good leader. He was a step ahead of mission control and always had his crew working ahead of mission director's requests. Before this mission Lovell had flown three missions for NASA, but now he wanted to walk on the moon in the worst way.Unfortunately, the crew winds up facing a catastrophe that threatens their mission to the moon and their lives. Instead of using the lunar module to land on the moon, they have to first live in it to survive their flight. The amazing thing is how director Ron Howard lets us experience everyone's journey, not just the astronauts. We also see the mission controllers arguing and problem solving. Lovell's wife, Marilyn, is shown each step of the way constantly adding depth and emotion to balance the technical NASA speak.Emotional balance and master pacing is a hallmark of Ron Howard's films. All of his movies, which include ""Cacoon,"" ""Splash,"" ""Backdraft,"" ""A Beautiful Mind,"" etc., have emotional cores that anchor them. You come away feeling like you've had a truly human experience.I am addicted to this movie: once I see a scene of it while flipping through channels, it's impossible to turn it off. I have to watch it to the end. I have almost studied it frame by frame for the unusual camera angles and another time for the pacing of humor to make the tension bearable.I'm not sure I'll ever grasp all the magnificence of this movie, but I think if I keep trying, all my storytelling will improve.Ultimately, there's something for everyone in this film, so watch if you haven't seen it.

272,socialnetworkman,Iconic...But Not Much Else,6,3 June 2016,"From beginning to end, I wasn't particularly invested. While I do appreciate the technical accuracy (which makes up the majority of the dialogue), it certainly got redundant after an hour or so. From start to finish, ""Apollo 13"" is essentially a collection of set-up and pay-off; (1) we start in the capsule with the Apollo 13 crew and they run into a technical problem (2) we cut to Mission Control working on a procedure (3) meanwhile in the Lovell home (4) back to the capsule and how the astronauts are coping (5) Mission Control solves the problem (6) Apollo 13 works it out. And so it's essentially this repetitive chain of events, capturing the exhausting 5-day redundancy of the historical incident. Tom Hanks steals the show in one of his most iconic performances. The score by James Horner (R.I.P.) is terribly dated and at times too sentimental, but one of my favorite tracks captures the vastness and mystique of space.

While I recognize the enormous achievement in even sending people to the vicinity of the moon-- much less landing on the moon and returning home several times-- I was too young to remember the feelings of awe and excitement that must have accompanied the moon landings.In a way it is sad that the one unsuccessful Apollo mission would be the one made into a hit movie-- but the movie brought out such a range of emotions (like most good movies do, in my opinion): a child's curiosity, the overwhelming excitement mixed with apprehension and fear of the adults, and the way public apathy suddenly gave way to intense interest. For those of us who were too young to remember, the movie gives a good brief introduction into the culture and politics of the day. But the thing that struck me the most was the primitive state of technology that brought men to within inches of the moon in that day: I have to say the shots of calculations being done by slide rule and pencil and paper nearly brought me to tears.10/10",Apollo 13
278,cljohnston108,Breaks my heart...,10,5 August 2003,"Just purchased the Collector's Edition DVD, and I'm somewhat ashamed of myself for a) waiting this long and b) buying it used.This was my first time viewing the film digitally (after seeing it once in the theater and countless times on VHS) and I must say that, with the DVD format's perfect picture & sound quality, I felt like I was seeing this perfect film for the very first time!As someone who has followed the Space Program closely all his life, I consider this to be the most accurate depiction of manned spaceflight ever committed to film, and feel it should be considered an historical document, rather than ""just a movie"".It breaks my heart when I see comments from uninformed & uninspired individuals, who come out of the woodwork for the sole purpose of spitting bile on this masterpiece, inventing flaws where none exist.I know how NASA personnel behave and communicate, and these performances were absolutely flawless. The recreation of all the hardware and locations was perfect in every detail, which had never been attempted before, nor had the concept of generating ACTUAL weightlessness inside a KC-135 flying a parabolic trajectory!People complain that... ...the dialog was too technical, when in fact it was ""dumbed down"" quite a bit! If you're having trouble understanding what's being said... READ A BOOK! ...the ending was known! Ah, but the tale was not! It was a true Odyssey: ""a long journey marked by many changes in fortune.""The sheer magnitude of effort pumped into this film, and the obvious love and care displayed by each and every member of the cast and crew for the subject at hand, deserves much better than the merciless apathy it's been getting here.",Apollo 13
279,agategecko,Totally engrossing,10,30 October 2004,I could not remember the original event. Probably due to where I was living at the time and the fact we had no live TV. It took a week to get the news.I was watching this film in the cinema and HAD to ask my friends if they made it back. The reason being that if they didn't I was going to have to walk out of the cinema or burst into tears.Never before had I been so engrossed in the people in the movie. I sat and watched hunched forward. BTW I still burst into tears when they made it back. Guess I am just a bit of a softie at heart.,Apollo 13
280,FrontAlleyBoys,"It's good, but WWWWWAAAAAAYYYYYYY over done",5,29 March 2012,"Thus movie has unusual problems that I've never seen in a film outside of this as well as many major problems.First and foremost, there is no tension or suspense. Anyone who goes to elementary school knows that all three astronauts survive, so for all the scenes in space I kept saying ""Yeah, I know! they're going to live!"" This brings the film down many levelsThe plot doesn't start until 30 minutes in, it doesn't feel long but the scenes in the first half hour feel like filler. I don't need to know that Jim's wife dropped her ring in the shower!Also, it has the same problem as Super 8, the unsubtle period detail. I didn't need to know that Jim's daughter was upset that the Beatles broke up, or that she dresses as a hippie. It rarely happens and isn't as bad as in Super 8, but why can't any one in Hollywood make subtle period detail! Then again this film does have the director of the Grinch.Many scenes are done well like the scenes of just the astronauts in the ship. The moon scene would've been very good, but they had to ruin it with Jim's fantasy of being on the moon. The scenes of they're family's got irritating after a while. It doesn't help when you keep cutting from the main story of the movie to people watching TV and listening to the radio. Also what was with the son in military camp? He has no lines of dialogue and does exactly what everyone else who isn't the main character does. He didn't need to be in this movie, or at least have something to do!The box that creates the oxygen in the ship has no explanation. It would in real life, but I would like to know how a box made of tape and plastic bags can seamlessly make air out of nothing!Then there is the end narration, which sounds like it came out of a bad teen film. I'll watch this movie again maybe in a few months but until then, I'll stick with Armageddon",Apollo 13
281,WillisRohrback,"Great on Technical Stuff, OK on Characters",8,8 July 2013,"I'll start out by saying I'm a fan of old, classic films and don't watch new movies at all. As a matter of fact, this is the most recent movie I've ever seen. I watched it because I am interested in the history of the space program, was a space junkie when I was a kid, and am old enough to vividly recall the entire event of Apollo 13. I am not familiar with the actors in the film, who, from reading other reviews, are big names to movie fans. So I come to the film uninfluenced by my like or dislike of the actors, which often distorts one's view of a film, and I watched it mainly to see how ""right"" they ""got it"".I think they mostly got it right. Visually, the film is beautiful. Having lived through the time myself, I think they got the look of the period perfectly. This isn't always easy to do, and the filmmakers should be credited with their dedication to accuracy. Hollywood hasn't always been so vigilant, even on such relatively recent events. One need only watch a 1940's film depicting the 1920's, to see how the filmmakers feel the need to ""modernize"" styles, not trusting the audience to ""get it"", that it's a period piece. Cars, furniture, houses, clothes, hair styles, everything looks right in this picture. If you have a disposition towards accuracy, the research needn't be that deep—just dig up a 1970 Sears Catalog; but even this effort often seems too much for Hollywood.Same with all the rocket stuff. I'm not an engineer or scientist, but I have a fair layman's knowledge of the Apollo gear, from 40+ years of interest in the subject, and I didn't notice any glaring mistakes. I'm sure there were some, but you'd have to be annoyingly obsessive to be offended by, or to even notice, them.A couple of things bugged me, striking me as hokey. First, was the argument between Haise & Swigert in the LEM. I guess this was added to create dramatic tension. I suppose you need this to make it a ""story"" instead of a documentary, but it is simply not credible. Second was the part at the end when TK Mattingly takes over as CapCom during the reentry. This scene smacked of old time Hollywood bathos, and I wasn't buying it. Third, making Grumman the goat in a couple of scenes where an unnamed Grumman executive is depicted as being hesitant, obstructive and noncommittal. I guess every movie needs a villain and it's easy to pick a now non-existent corporate entity to be the villain in a film where everybody else bonds together in a spirit of cooperation, but it's a libel on the company that, after all, built the spacecraft that saved the crew's lives.The acting was good, but the writing was often clichéd. A lot of it reminded me of things like ""Back To Bataan"" or the ""Sands of Iwo Jima"", only moving the scene from the beachheads of World War II to the vacuum of outer space. Watching the film, I got the feeling the actors looked a little too young for the parts they were playing, especially the guy who played Jack Swigert. Swigert was a tough, hard looking guy, while the actor portraying him looked almost adolescent. The actor playing Lovell did a good job in playing ""A"" part, but he didn't come across to me as Jim Lovell, whose public persona I've been familiar with since I was in the first grade. Lovell always came across as one of the more glib and well spoken of the astronauts, with a strong sense of humor, and we don't sense this in the film. I think ii's more a product of the writing than the acting, but the Lovell character in the film seems more like a generic movie action hero than the real life Jim Lovell. This, I think, is the main shortcoming of the film, that the crew members, Lovell, Swigert, Haise & Mattingly, seem like 4 interchangeable guys, rather than distinct personalities. Again, I feel the fault is in the writing, not the acting.A couple of the characters are never really named in the film (that I noticed) but it's obvious who they were supposed to be—mainly Sy Liebergot and John Aaron. I don't necessarily think an actor in a film needs to look exactly like the historical figure he's portraying, but the actor playing Liebergot looked nothing like the real Liebergot. I did find it interesting that the actor playing the unnamed CapCom through most of the film looked a whole lot like John Young. I wondered if this was done on purpose, because in the photos and films of the actual event, Young is often seen around the CapCom desk, though he never was CapCom on this flight. This didn't bug me, but it was interesting. (Also, the other CapCom in the film strongly resembled Stuart Roosa, Apollo 14 Command Module pilot, and I wondered if this, too, was intentional. Like Young, Roosa was never a CapCom on this flight.)But for all the complaints, I did like the film. You have to expect a certain level of hokeyness when Hollywood tackles a serious subject. There's a happy ending when the astronauts return safely, and an even happier ending for Mattingly (in real life, not the film) when he was assigned to Apollo 16, a much longer, more interesting, mission, in which he got to do his own EVA, a deep flight space walk, which he would not have done had he not been booted from 13. Hopefully some of the folks seeing this film will be interested enough to read up on the subject, and then look at other missions of the Apollo (and Mercury and Gemini) programs, because it's all fascinating stuff. US space history doesn't begin with Apollo 11 and end with Apollo 13.",Apollo 13
282,rob-rainthorpe,An all-time favourite for me,10,7 February 2021,"Right Stuff, or this? It's close, but personally I don't think there's a better real space movie for a Saturday afternoon than this. The effects hold up well after 25 years, the script holds close enough to the book (and its perspective of reality) that it's never jarring, unlike many ""based on true story"" pictures. The scenes filmed in the vomit comet still delight. Tension is built and diffused, then rebuilt with precision, leaning heavily on the excellent score. The astronauts' family scenes still evoke tears of shared pain or relief on repeated viewings. In short, the movie is close to perfect for me. The only slight bum note is the endless use of the journalists to provide explication. They could have cut 15-30% of these and the audience would still have got it. It's like those exposition gags in the Austin Powers movies. But in no way does it spoil the movie, you just feel a bit as though your intelligence has been insulted.",Apollo 13

284,iron_mike,"Accurate, but not very gripping.",5,6 October 2002,"I really wanted to love this movie. Unfortunately, perhaps because it is such a well known incident, there is just no tension in this movie - unless you're one of the apparently vast number of young people with no knowledge of the past.The movie seems to be an accurate account of the events, if somewhat sanitised, but quite frankly you'd be more enlightened by watching a documentary.Pales in comparison to the excellent 'The Right Stuff'.",Apollo 13
285,t-turnquest1,Now this is a space movie.,9,7 May 2015,"Apollo 13 is one of the films that got me into watching movies in the first place. I love it. There are three things that I love about the movie: the direction, the acting, and the premise of it. Ron Howard is a great director. He knew what he was doing in this film and kept it going all the way. His direction towards the story is brilliantly executed and well thought-out. With his collaboration with Brian Grazer, they made the impossible possible. The acting was amazing through out the film. Tom Hanks delivers his character very well. Kathleen Quinlan carries her supporting role very good. The rest of the cast fits in with roles that they were given and they were great. The premise of the movie is based off of a true story. Apollo 13 has suffered a major malfunction in space putting the lives of the three astronauts in jeopardy and NASA must find a way to back them back home. That is the premise of the movie: story. In the end Apollo 13 won two Oscar awards for Best Sound and Best Film Editing. It was also nominated for seven Oscar awards including Best Picture making this the first space movie to have ever received an Oscar nomination for Best Piecture. But overall I love this movie. Great script, awesome direction, amazing acting, and couple of special effects that don't feel overused but necessary. I would recommend to you to watch this movie because it will keep you on the edge of your seat.",Apollo 13
286,Vazul267,"Liked the first part, but later on it becomes predictable and slow",7,26 November 2020,"While the beginning is really good until they launch and the bad thing happen. Then the movie becomes really slow and hard to watch, lot of filler scenes that could have been cut out making the movie shorter and a much more intense experience.
Also the CGI parts aged pretty badly (worst part is when they show the rocket at launch.)
Other than that it's still an enjoyable and great movie to this day. It's just nothing new or exciting if you are used to modern sci-fi and spacecraft movies.",Apollo 13
287,pete_doyle7,Nice when a film has a sad ending,8,6 March 2006,"It is a Hollywood rarity when films end with the objective of the main characters is met without meting it. Like in Cool Runnings, the guys gained respect of the other competitors even though they did not win. In Apollo 13 the guys did not make it to the moon and Tom Hanks did not step foot out of his craft onto the lunar bedrock but he did win the attention so craved from the US people and those around the world. I think this movie contains a message to all of us, we do not need to reach the goals set for us by others to be happy. All in all a decent flick and a rock steady performance from Tom Hanks as Usual... This was not great for the geeks who like to find out about facts and figures but I like the fact that it really makes you feel for the guys and want them to get home safe. The little old lady is my fave character she clearly has no clue about whats going on... a solid 8/10 from me.",Apollo 13

The fact that it is all true makes it that much better. I know my infatuation with the space program provides bias for it being my favorite movie and hardly anyone agrees with me that it is the greatest movie ever made. Most hard core movie critics believe that a movie's story line and plot are secondary to it's theme and they point out that Apollo 13 has a weak theme. To me, a movie's greatness is not measured by it's original theme or its outstanding plot or imaginative ending but a combination of all these to create an emotion.

Tom Hank said he was a fan of the space program, and I believe it, his acting on this one rival's his on Saving Private Ryan. He really made a great job on it, and no other Hollywood actor is the real Jim Lovell. Ed Harris for Eugene Kranz? Perfect choice. Kevin Bacon looks almost exactly like Swigert, and Bill Paxton looks a lot like Fred Haise. In short, well done!

294,andrewp-7,One Of The Greatest American Films Of All Time,10,23 March 2005,"'Apollo 13' is one of those rare movies that strives for and succeeds in showing America as the greatest nation on earth. Themes such as loyalty, honour, love, and failure are explored in the film in a very mature and moving way, without ever resorting to sentimentality.Even though we know how the events unfold and how it ends, I was still completely immersed in this great experience. One of the many strengths Ron Howard has as a film maker is in casting. With Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan, Howard has assembled a cast of truly great actors, who reflect what America is and what it stands for. I have never been so moved by an ensemble cast in this film due to their passion and love for this event.The other plaudits should go to the makers of the film. Ron Howard has succeeded in bringing out the tension on a moment by moment basis. I really felt as if I was living this event with those in the film.Digital Domain also deserves credit for the breathtaking visual effects on display. They are perhaps the biggest achievement of the company so far. James Horner is one of the top composers in the business and his score is moving, breathtaking, and spiritual. The scene where Apollo 13 goes around the moon and loses temporary contact with Houston is one of the most memorable and spiritual scenes I have ever seen. It is completely unforgettable and shows space in the most eerily beautiful way.If I was to go on about what I liked about 'Apollo 13' this review would go on and on. This film shows a hope and optimism that seems to be lacking not just in films, but also in the world today. Being from England and having lived in the USA, I have a great love and respect for that nation and 'Apollo 13' reminds me the ideals America stands for.

Hanks, Bacon and Paxton are superb in their roles as Astronauts doing their jobs and systematically meeting the incredible challenge that confronts them head on. Ed Harris is no less perfectly cast as the stoic but steady hand at the helm to guide the efforts to bring the ship safely to shore. Ron Howard's direction, although heavy handed at times, stays the course by intertwining and humanizing the lives of all those involved in this historic event in US space exploration.

It's one of those rare movies that you know the ending and yet, are still enthralled, enchanted and pulls you in each time. Each viewing is great. I think there's a gaffe at the end of the movie where mission control is awaiting the splash down. I think there is a space shuttle patch on the wall behind them at one angle and if that's the case well... the shuttle was 10 plus years after Apollo 13. But that's minor.

It's clearly more a documentary then a movie and because of that it couldn't captivate me or grab my attention. The acting performance and script where good. For people who like space-history it can be recommended but for all the others....It's a cultural artifact but too boring too see it until the end.,Apollo 13
316,calliebartlett,Apollo 13,8,3 April 2017,"Apollo 13 captured the absolute courage and strength of not just the families involving the men, the mission control room and America but also the unbelievable bravery of the three on board to try and recover from the explosion and return home from the dark side of the moon alive. Tom Hanks, once again, playing astronaut Jim Lovell, once again took a character and filled the shoes perfectly to make a jaw-dropping and powerfully intense film. He appears to be the clear and commander of not just the capsule but also the movie. The mission was intended to hold Lovell, Mattingly and Haise but the crew hits their first roadblock to walk on the moon when Mattingly was sadly forced off the mission. He was said to have contracted the measles (who, in the end, never ended up getting it). Mattingly was then replaced by Swigert. The excitement in Lovell to walk on the moon was apparent throughout the movie before the launch. So when the oxygen tank in their capsule exploded and the men were forced to end their mission and return home, the heartbreak was felt through the screen and into the audience. The harrowing mission around the dark side of the moon and back home left everyone on the edge of their seats, fearing for the lives of Lovell, Swigert and Haise. The emotion trying to get the three back safely was felt throughout the film and it was as if the audience was in that control room, trying to figure out a way to safely land the men. At the end of the movie, when the three land the capsule in the ocean and are rescued, it was hard not to sigh with relief along with the rest of America. Apollo 13 was told with clear detail that informed but also kept the attention of its audience through adventure and dramatics.",Apollo 13
317,zucatemm,Acting and realism were superb.,9,15 May 2017,"This movie might have been about space, but it was the human story that made it. The movie skillfully shifted from space to the control center to the families at home without being melodramatic or glib. Every face had deliberate emotion and Tom Hanks clearly led the way. He stole the show without stealing scenes from other actors which moves him out of the group of good actors to great ones. Kevin Bacon also did well with his character's struggle with being a last minute replacement that wasn't necessarily enthusiastically welcomed. The technical talk was at times pushed into weird conversations as it was necessary but not made interesting enough to pay attention to for long periods which they made up for with the three astronauts struggling with their physical movements in the cramped area trying to save themselves. The audience didn't always understand the specifics of the problems but they were still able to feel the tensions of the moments. Something that really kept me going with the movie was how mission control really embraced only being able to use the materials the astronauts had in solving all the problems. The back and forth between mission control and the astronauts as a result livened up the end that is usually just a bunch of men yelling at computers. As a result of the movie being based on a true story, there were very few opportunities for falsities to exist in the movie. The realism added to everything really allowed the drama of the movie to be fully embraced by the audience. Regardless of having the knowledge of how the movie ends, the audience is still able to ride every emotional wave with the character in the story. My main complaint would have to be that the ending was a bit anticlimactic just because after the climax of the story, there was a drop in emotion that never came back up. My heart stopped beating so fast and there was never a moment that tugged at my heart-strings to cap it all off. Overall, it was truly an incredible movie I would easily recommend to anyone. This is a great introduction into the space genre, especially considering how it was based on a true story.",Apollo 13

320,Oktober,A brief synopsis of a great film.,10,20 December 1998,"It's difficult to say what makes Apollo 13 such a great film - perhaps it is the idea that it ""really happened"", and that someone can look at a history book, then at the film, and see an overall reality. Some might say they love it just for the effects; but I believe that it has a great story, and a perfect selection of actors, perfectly cast. Ed Harris excels, as does Tom Hanks - and Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon are each superb in their roles.The most wonderful thing about this movie is that it encompasses so many parts and peoples, and appeals to so many, that by the last reel you feel that if they don't make it through, you have lost some of your closest friends.In short: a minor masterpiece.",Apollo 13
321,Zandra,A great movie that portrays how great NASA used to be,10,22 January 1999,"Apollo 13 shows how well structured NASA was during the Apollo program of the '60s and '70s. The administrators, flight directors, and mission control crew were capable of making quick decisions and therefore were able save the lives of the crew 200,000 miles from the earth.  I believe the most important moment is when Lovell wonders when we will go back to the moon. After the Apollo program NASA started to lose public interest while overlooking major design flaws in its spacecraft (which led to the Challenger disaster).  Only recently has the public started to take interest again with the Mars Pathfinder and John Glenn's return to space. Apollo 13 shows us how NASA worked then, and insight on how it can work in the future.The acting was great particularly by Hanks who in real life has a deep interest in the space program.  The character of Deke Slayton (my favorite astronaut!) was well played, except for the fact that he should have had a Wisconsin accent.  Deke is portrayed as someone who knew how to lay down the law, but at the same time he truly cared about the astronauts who worked for him.",Apollo 13

This is not a typical Hollywood movie, with lines like ""Rocketship FIRE !!"" or ""Retrobuster GO"". The movie is very true to the real men and women of apollo 13.

Second, the realism - you honestly feel like you're watching three men in zero-gravity.But most of all, they did their best to adhere to the storyline, without taking too much dramatic or artistic license.  Having seen a documentary made using the actual radio transmissions and testimonials from the actual crew of Apollo 13, I was absolutely amazed when I watched this movie.  I own it on DVD, and with my kids will watch it over and over again.  Do yourself a favor and share this depiction of one of the biggest triumphs of mankind with your loved ones.",Apollo 13

This movie brings it all back to me, including the PRIDE all Americans felt when those three astronauts returned safely home.  That fourth minute during re-entry was a long one!  Anyone who was too young to remember the actual event, or not yet born, will never know the thrill those moon shots gave us.  But this movie will, in my opinion, give you a reasonably good idea.",Apollo 13
327,Berlitza,Stunning and unforgettable,10,2 May 2000,"Those who were not born when the Apollo space program was running, like myself, may often wonder what it was like.  How did the astronauts train? What did the inside of the lunar module or command module look like?  How big was a Saturn V rocket?  ""Apollo 13"" answers all these questions and more.Using computer graphics, the infamous ""Vomit Comet"", and realistic sets, this movie conveys what it was like aboard an Apollo spacecraft.  The liftoff is breathtaking, with multiple views of the size and grandeur of the Saturn V rocket.  Inside the spacecraft one sees the benefits (and drawbacks) of weightlessness.  There's even a simulator in which the astronauts train for maneuvers they must perform during the mission.  The movie is a ""behind-the-scenes"" look at the NASA space program in the 1960's and 1970's, giving all those not present at the time an idea of what it must have been like.The cast was worthy of such a project.  Tom Hanks is Commander Jim Lovell, an experienced space voyager who wishes to land on the moon.  Fred Haise (played by Bill Paxton) will accompany Lovell down to the surface as the lunar pilot.  Ken Mattingly (played by Gary Sinise) is slated to be the command module pilot, who will orbit the moon as Lovell and Haise land and explore the surface.  Other notable cast members are Ed Harris, who plays the military-like Gene Kranz; Kathleen Quinlan (playing Marilyn Lovell, Jim Lovell's wife); and Kevin Bacon (playing Jack Swigert), the backup command module pilot for Ken Mattingly.The movie is quick, with a lot of technical terms.  I highly recommend reading a few books about the Apollo-era beforehand, including ""Apollo 13"" (previously titled ""Lost Moon""), on which the movie was based.  The books will give you a better appreciation of what goes on in the movie.Just a warning: you won't watch this movie unaffected.  It will make you wish you could be one of the space voyagers (despite the risks involved) or even just a spectator, watching as the mission events unfold.  You may need to see the movie more than once to get everything; for me, it's been about a dozen times and I still see something new each time I watch.So run, don't walk to your nearest video store, pick up a VHS or DVD copy of ""Apollo 13"", and watch it as soon as possible!  You won't regret it.",Apollo 13

329,nasanerds,The Best and Most Accurate Movie of All-Time,10,24 November 2000,"As a space buff the one thing I am most turned off by in space related movies is technical inaccuracy.  Apollo 13 was completely accurate and the few things that were not were very minor.  I have read numerous books by authors who were involved with this mission and I do not find many contradicting details of Ron Howard's extraordinary film with their recounts of the ""successful failure.""  Apollo 13 is so accurate that the dialogues of certain scenes (i.e. Flight Director Gene Krantz in mission control) matches verbatim with NASA recordings.  In addition to the accuracy, the acting is superb while the pictures and sound are astounding.  Howard had full cooperation of NASA and to reconstruct weightlessness he used the method NASA trains its astronauts with-the KC-135.  The scenes of mission control were shot at Johnson Space Center in the actual mission control and astronauts Jim Lovell and David Scott trained Hanks, Paxton, Bacon, Sinise, and Howard at Space Camp.  Ron Howard should be commended for what I consider the greatest film ever and for not ""selling out"" to crowds that just want to see big, shiny exploding things, such as the Titanium Shuttle in Armageddon.  This is a must see for anyone with an interest in the space program and an appreciation for an accurate documentary.",Apollo 13

I thought the acting was quite good but more praise should go to Tom Hanks as he plays a role that I personally never thought he could, a more serious and smart role(but I shouldn't be surprised as he always seems to amaze). As well as considerable emotions that is not typically seen in most movies now and days as it doesn't have a message besides the story. This is why I say its a solid 8.5/10 movie as it truly shows the dangers and quite how unforgiving space travel is, however, it felt that the child actors and some of the side characters ruined some of the more touching and emotion-filled scenes.

According to the movie, Jack did not have a loving parent, a close sibling, or a dear friend who cared whether he lived or died. As a single women, I find this portrayal of the life of a single, childless person unfortunate. In addition, Mr. Swigert was portrayed as a somewhat incompetent playboy, when in reality he was a well educated man with an impressive resume.

This is why I love this movie and watched more than one time.In the geographic field, there is definitely not more land can be found. However, about space, we still do not know much more about it. Furthermore, even in many new scientific field, they are strangers to us. We have to research and learn more and more about them.There are still frontier culture in the world, but why I love it. Somebody may tell you, because frontier life is extremely exciting and excellent. Anybody have the same opportunity to be a winner. However, there is not everyone can be a winner because of many different reason. For personally, in the three days before the launching, Ken Mattingly was removed from the mission due to exposure to German measles, which he never contracted. For the whole mission, 13 could not land on the moon, and they have to come back to the earth. Nevertheless, All of them are still frontier heroes, because they have to fight with every dangerous cases which they met.In summary, there are still frontier heroes in today.

During his talk someone asked why the movie didn't follow the book more - Lovell said that they thought audience would have trouble with all the crises in the movie to add the other things that happened, we did think the public would believe any of it. Rather than overplay it, they down played it. This is not a work of fiction. Timeless. True. He lived it. He did the interviews with others.Maybe that is what captures us?

Alongside him are his fellow spacemen and trusty pals Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton). A smooth beginning is foiled when the oxygen supply suddenly drops and their new flight path around the moon becomes a battle of survival.This amazing rendition of the crisis that is the Apollo 13 mission is overflowing with leaders within the film. Imagine you're the mission control leader on one of the biggest missions ever, one to the moon. All is great until an oxygen tank explodes and the other one leaks quickly. Now, enter the mind of Gene Kranz. He has several moments during the movie where he has to control the room and the million dollar metal rocket flying through space.The first is when the oxygen tank explodes. Everyone seems to be rushing to him asking him what they should do and he calmly says ""one at a time"". As a leader, you must be able to face hard situations with confidence because if you are scared, then everyone else is going to be even more scared. ""Failure is not an option."" The next display of leadership is when the men at mission control are discussing how long they will last and that they won't make it back to Earth. Gene tells them that they will and his resilience empowers all of the men. Once he is able to set a course of action, Gene displays an act of delegation. Delegation is a very important characteristic for a leader and his use of telling them they need to find the solution without him, allows him to be more aware of the other problems and to address the additional problems that are bound to arise. He also inspired them to think outside of the box by saying ""I don't care what anything was designed to do. I care about what it can do."" Because of this, they were able to break down the problems into sub-units and build a solution from the ground up. When the astronauts are just on the cusp of reentry, we see the NASA director talking about how this could be the worst disaster in the history of NASA. So then, just when everyone needed to be reassured the most, we see Gene swoop in and say, ""With all due respect sir, I think that this is going to be our finest hour."" Gene wasn't pessimistic, but optimistic about the outcome of the landing. How leaders deal with adversity and doubt is very important. Gene is a perfect example of a leader in this regard and all others. He is optimistic, calm against stress, and a leader that people want to follow.",Apollo 13

Directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks, the movie follows the three astronauts of Apollo 13 trying to get home safely with the help of their ground crew, including a subplot with one of the astronaut's wives waiting for him to get home. The cinematography was gorgeous and the effects hyper-realistic, impressive considering no footage from the actual mission was used. The plot was slow and unengaging at times, especially the beginning and the wife at home subplot, which I felt was bland, but it definitely picked up around the middle, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat from there. The humor from the ground crew was appreciated considering the heavy atmosphere, and nothing felt oddly timed, as comedy sometimes does in serious movies.

As a person who missed out on the actual Apollo 13 mission, this film was an excellent way to gain insight into the time, effort, and life-threatening situations that went into this mission. This film is constantly using cinematic elements to help support the story of this risky mission. Three of NASA's best astronauts, Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert, begin the mission with everything going as planned, a surprise after the many failed attempts shown in training. It is not until an oxygen tank fails to work and later explodes that send the audience's heart rate sky high.  This movie helped the viewers greatly to gain understanding of the risks involved with being an astronaut at this time in history. A certain scene really grabbed my attention. Jim is in his son's room playing with his children and talking about the mission. The mood becomes much more serious when Jim's son mentions the possibility that he might die. With instances like this being hidden from public attention when the mission first took flight, this scene helped the audience to understand what the astronauts and their families were going through.  In short, this movie is an excellent insight into the dangerous space exploration of the 1960's and 1970's. Every camera shot, beat of music, and speaking line was perfectly executed to engage the audience and tell an interesting story. It is no wonder this film won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing and Best Sound Mixing. This film is entirely worthwhile to watch.",Apollo 13

Really shows the best of what America can be, when we put ego aside and focus on helping one another. My favorite Ron Howard film, and the casting is absolutely perfect (RIP Bill Paxton). Gripping drama but suitable for all ages. I love this movie.",Apollo 13
