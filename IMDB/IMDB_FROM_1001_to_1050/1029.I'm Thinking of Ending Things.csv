0,kosmasp,Thinking being the operative word here,9,5 November 2020,"Although is it the mind or is it something else playing tricks on us? Or the main actress. We are literally inside her head - by hearing her thoughts throughout. And her thoughts alone that is. She really has some things she probably should get off her chest ... and she knows it. But does that all play a role? I rewatched portions of this movie,, because it is weird as ... well choose your own word you want there.I don't think it's possible to totally get the movie with one viewing. Visually but even more so, in the context it is in and what happens. Great make up effects, great effects to disorient you - and the main character. What is real? If you are not aware of Charlie Kaufman ... well you are in for a treat, that much I can say/reveal.Although could I even say anything that could be considered a spoiler? It is really tough to grip this and place it anywhere. It is about relationships and growing old (together) ... and alternate routes one may have liked to take. It is about grieve, loss and sorrow - also guilt or rather questioning ones own choices ... what could have been? And what you have. We never are fully satisfied, no matter what we achieved. Neither with ourselves nor with anyone around us. Though the latter is multiplied if you don't have inner peace ... well you may be able to see where this is going. But even so ... there's more to unpack here than simple things. Structure is almost a non existent thing ... I say almost because there is, but not the traditional one.This is a movie that will baffle many and probably only satisfy a few of those ... it is a movie that is not easy to digest at all. It is something you'd have to rewatch a few times ... if you have the will to do so! And maybe, you'll be able to decode and discover things along the way ... or maybe it is too much thinking and craziness for your liking ... does not change the quality of this one bit though!",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
1,CinemaSerf,A difficult book to adapt - and it doesn't quite get there.,6,23 December 2020,"This is a movie experience that rewards effort. If you try to watch it without giving it a decent amount of attention, it will come across as a jumbled shambles lacking narrative direction and any kind of plot cohesion. Even with attention, though, it's still a bit of a confusing melting pot of themes that only becomes a little bit clearer towards the end, should you have persevered that long. Jesse Plemons (""Jake"") takes girlfriend Jessie Buckley (slight clue as she is only referred to as ""Young Woman"") to visit his parents' remote farm. Once there she meets mother Toni Collette, father David Thewlis and things take quite a surreal series of turns that involve her questioning just about everything about herself, him, the family, the relationship - you name it. It is pretty faithful to the book and whilst that is to be commended; the book doesn't drip enough of the underlying premiss of the story to us quickly enough, and so after a while I didn't really care - about Jake, in any case. What is good though are the performances - all four of them are on good form, and had the story only given us more to work with, then these (and the whole film) might have been more appreciable. As it is, it's an odd choice for a cinema adaptation that doesn't really work for me, sorry.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
2,evanston_dad,Mind Officially Blown,8,11 September 2020,"Charlie Kaufman channels David Lynch in this eerie, creepy relationship drama that really knows how to get under your skin.Jessie Buckley, who gave an award-worthy performance in ""Wild Rose"" last year, does so again here, as a woman meeting her boyfriend's parents for the first time. Much of the film takes place in his car, as they travel to and from his childhood home in an Oklahoma blizzard. These scenes give Buckley and Jessie Plemmons, also giving a terrific performance as her boyfriend, long exchanges of dialogue that tease out the dynamic of this particular relationship, and the dynamic between men and women in general, and a dissection of the film ""A Woman Under the Influence"" (Buckley recites Pauline Kael's review of the film in character as Gena Rowlands), and includes a stop at an isolated ice cream stand, the film's most Lynchian moment, where a girl with a rash gives Buckley a vague warning. Much of the rest of the film takes place in Plemmons' parents house, where David Thewlis and Toni Collette play versions of Plemmons' mom and dad at all ages, from perky housewife to doddering dementia to dying in a hospital bed, and host perhaps one of the most awkward dinners ever to appear in a film. Then there are the scenes set in Plemmons' old high school, where a janitor (Plemmons as an old man?) roams the halls and doubles of Buckley and Plemmons reenact the ballet scene from ""Oklahoma!"" in the school corridors.What is ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" about? If that's the first question you ask before deciding whether or not to watch a movie, you won't like this one. I imagine different people will think it's about different things. Certainly it's about getting old. It's also about getting old without the comfort of believing that life has any purpose, or that there's anything waiting for us in the great beyond. It's about women and their relationships with men. It's about Jessie Buckley's character. Until it's not and it's instead about Jessie Plemmons' character, who gets the final scene of the film all to himself, a rendition of the song ""Lonely Room"" (again from ""Oklahoma!"") during which he comes to the conclusion that the fantasies on which we build our lives don't exist and we have to take whatever we can to most closely approximate them. It's a claustrophobic and deeply unsettling film, as much because of its aesthetics as because of its enigmatic mysteries.Is it a good film? I think it's very good, but I will admit that it didn't linger in my head as much as I thought it would while I was watching it. It kind of made my skin crawl in the moment, but it left me feeling like I was going to get all there was to get from it on a first viewing, and it didn't leave me wanting to watch it again to untangle its riddles.Grade: A",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
3,ferguson-6,"It's Kaufman's world, just go with it",8,3 September 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. We should never look to Charlie Kaufman to pull us out of the pandemic doldrums, although he is an absurdly talented writer who specializes in unusual plots and oddball characters. Mr. Kaufman is also an over-thinker and a non-stop thinker - I would imagine his brain rarely goes quiet. This time out, he directs his own adaptation of Iain Reid's novel, and the result is a mind and time bending existential crisis that leaves us feeling a bit down. Yet, as always, Kaufman's work keeps our minds racing.Jessie Buckley, who was so terrific in WILD ROSE (2019), stars as The Young Woman going on a blizzardy road trip with Jake (Jesse Plemons, THE IRISHMAN, 2019), her boyfriend of the last six weeks or so. They are headed to visit Jake's parents who live in a ""farmy"" and remote area. Act 1 is spent in the car as the wipers flap, and the woman and Jake hold awkward conversation. We, as the audience, listen to her inner thoughts, including, ""I'm thinking of ending things."" She is truly an outstanding actress, and carries much of the weight with this one.The woman is not really unnamed, in fact, throughout the movie, she has multiple names including Lucy and Louisa. And character names aren't the only fluid piece of Kaufman's puzzle. She is variously labeled as studying Quantum Physics, a writer of poetry, and an artist. Are you confused yet? If not, you will be.Act 2 takes place at the farm house where Jake's parents live, and it shifts the film from awkward to bizarre. Toni Collette (HEREDITARY, 2018) and David Thewlis (""Fargo"") play his mother and father, both excited for the visit, but unconventional, to say the least, in their social graces. Ms. Collette over-laughs just beyond the point of perplexing and nudges the beginning of downright weird. She and Thewlis are exceptional in their ability to keep Lucy off-balance, and Jake hyper-annoyed. We aren't sure what to make of what we are seeing ... and neither is Lucy. While none of these folks takes a single bite of the dinner spread, the tone turns to surreal. Overlapping time lines of past, present, and future become haunting and hypnotic.The film itself is disorienting, and Act 3 does little to help us regain our equilibrium. Jake and Lucy finally start their drive back, as the snow begins falling even harder. Throughout the production, Kaufman includes references to William Wordsworth, Pauline Kael, Andrew Wyeth, Mussolini, and more. He also inserts clips of a high school janitor (played by Gus Boyd) as he goes about his duties. This janitor is part of a finale featuring an animated pig and a dance number ... both of which occur after Jake and Lucy have debated the importance of Cassevetes' A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE, and the performance of Gena Rowlands.Oklahoma plays a role as both a setting and a reference musical, and a stop for ice cream at Tulsey Town, adds to the oddity and the feeling of dread that encompasses us for much of the movie (when we aren't chuckling at the absurdities). Kaufman mixes genres with glee - horror, comedy, and psychological thriller all lead us to a dance scene and many unanswered questions about what is real and what is only in Lucy's mind. We never see what attracted these two to each other, but we do wallow in their misery and discomfort. Charlie Kaufman's previous screenplays include such brilliance as ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, and ADAPTATION, although this one may have more in common with his SYNECHDOCE, NEW YORK - a film that can wrestle with this one over which is his least accessible. An existential film where past, present, and future mingle and bizarre observations are made on aging and memory, can only fit into Charlie Kaufman's oeuvre. It will surely make you think, though it may end with you asking 'why?'",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
4,trashgang,A lot of talking and still I watched it until the end which is really weird,7,8 September 2020,"Hyped all over the Netflix lovers and even here in region it's a top ten hit and being ushed to see it by some youtubers I was without doubt a bit afraid to watch it.Not for the horror or creepy moments but for the reason it's a hype. Not for everyone that I can tell. It clocks in over 2 hours and almost 1 hour 45 minutes we are sitting in a car, talking. But it's so well done that I wanted to know the who and why but it really isn't explained and even the last 20 minutes of this flick it gets weirder and weirder.I liked it and so far it does have a high rating even as it's all about blah blah.

5,deloudelouvain,Too bad the story is so confusing.,5,3 October 2020,"Although I was intrigued and interested by the whole story during the entire movie I can't say it is a good movie. It's much too confusing, you hope to get answers that you will never get and that's just not my idea of a good movie. It's just frustrating, certainly when you spend more than two hours trying to figure out what it's all about. That said if the story would have been explained correctly it could have been a good movie. The acting was really good, especially from Toni Collette which was my favorite. she has a smaller part but it reminded me of her character she played in the excellent series United States Of Tara. So it were not the actors that failed in this movie but the story and that's too bad because it had potential. I won't say I didn't enjoy most of the movie but for me there is a rule that a story has to be clear towards the end which is absolutely not the case here. I'm still wondering what I watched and probably never will get it.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
6,siderite,It's better you know what this film is about before you watch it. Charlie Kaufman does it again.,8,19 February 2021,"Usually I recommend people to not watch or read reviews, just enjoy the film in their own way. This one, though, is better if you are well prepared for it. It's a two hour fifteen minute film that requires another twenty minutes for the obligatory YouTube video that explains what you've just seen. Foundflix has a nice Explained for it, but watch or read whatever. Because you need to understand you are going to sit through the slow, oh so slow, dissolution of a man's mind, complete with heavy references to books and films and musicals, awkward scenes that make you want to skip forward, long internal monologues, the whole thing. It is also worth mentioning that this film is based of a book, one that is not written by Kaufman, but right up his alley. You might want to check that out before attempting to see the film.Once you know you are going to see that, you won't feel cheated when finally starting to watch the movie and realizing it will not entertain you at all. Maybe it will make you ponder the nature of reality and inner life, maybe it will make you grab a gun and kill yourself or your parents, maybe it will make you write a dissertation on it, so other people get what you got or at least friends will honor you for surviving through it, but relaxing entertainment or any sort of pleasure that is not purely intellectual you will not get.There are no twists at the end, the basic premise is made clear rather soon and from that moment you will wait for the film to end. There is no hero journey, no big reveal of information that will guide you through life, no story. The only beautiful thing in the movie is Jessie Buckley. So get into your Dostoyevski reading mood or whatever and only then attempt a viewing. Just trying on a whim and then complaining about it won't cut it. You have to work to see this film. Only when you're prepared to do that work will I recommend it to you.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
7,lasttimeisaw,Film Review - I'm Thinking of Ending Things (2020) 7.5/10,8,12 October 2020,"""Elsewhere, on the strength of two cracking leading performances - Buckley is very adept in registering subtle emotions and acquits herself beautifully through the woman's perplexing revelations, whereas Plemons is disarming and aw-shucks enough to underline Jake's all-knowing resignation, Kaufman's eclectic cultural references (which are not in Reid's novel) is another boon for sophisticated audience to savor (functioning as fodder to fill the pair's car-driving intervals), although giving a verbatim outpouring of Pauline Kael's scathing review of A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE may stretch too far, this reviewer would rather hear Kaufman's own assessment of Cassavetes' chef d'oeuvre, from which I'M THINKING... is tonally, aesthetically and structurally disparate, but not so much in its perceptive but dispiriting dissection of life's bleakness and futility.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
8,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Eternal metaphor for Kaufman's mind.,6,6 September 2020,"Kaufman's latest exercise in self-indulgence isn't exactly forthcoming when it comes to answers. What is 'I'm Thinking Of Ending Things (2020)' about? Well, it's hard to say. I certainly have my own interpretations of the film's events, but I won't reveal those here for fear of spoiling the experience. I will say that it didn't take long for the basis for my theory to form and, at least to me, my reading feels as though it's the intended one. Of course, a flick as stylised, surreal and, well, downright strange as this has the possibility to cause a lot of debate. The problem is that there just isn't all that much to say, aside from an initial guess (and, with Kaufman claiming to never confirm or deny any interpretation, guessing is all one can do) and a comment on how successful you think the whole endeavour is. I mean, it's not like it's a bad movie. It's far from it, actually. The performances are pitch-perfect, there's an off-kilter and often unsettling atmosphere and the picture's brazen bizarreness is sometimes acutely compelling. However, the thing just gets carried away with itself far too often. As I've mentioned, it's very self-indulgent and, dare I say, sometimes almost pretentious. It's ambiguous to a fault, almost nothing more than an elongated, purposefully unsolvable enigma. That's sure to put some people off. As is the thing's insistence to be as unfriendly as possible; it sometimes borders on becoming a bit of a slog to sit through, especially when it seems to be blowing its own trumpet. It's also a bit of a downer, with its many absurdly long monologues about the supposed meaningless of life eventually becoming straight-up tiresome. For me, there's enough in-the-moment success to consider the overall experience one worth having. It's generally rather effective, well-made and experimental. It's also relatively unique, straddling genres in a way that makes it hard to classify. It's even harder to rate. It works just as often as it doesn't, with several genuinely successful scenes making up for an equal number of tiresome detours. It also gets you thinking as to what's really going on. The trouble is that you'll stop thinking about it not long after it's stupidly small credits have rolled (seriously, they're are barely legible). The best ambiguous or, even, 'twist' endings are exciting; they provoke detailed retrospection, giddy theorisation and a whole new interpretation or appreciation for the events that led up to them. This flick's ending is kind of deflating, which is probably caused - or, at least, exemplified - by the abstract expressionism that makes up its final few scenes. It doesn't leave you wanting more, either. In fact, it leaves you wanting a little less. If you do look back on the experience, you're sure to find some fondness amongst the frustration. It isn't a great film, but it's an interesting one. There's at least some value in that. 6/10",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
9,ThomasDrufke,Nothing Happens,2,13 January 2021,"I think I've just accepted that I'm never going to be a Charlie Kaufman guy. He consistently makes films about an intriguing premise, but decides (very purposefully) to remove any sense of logic or the ability to comprehend the plot for the audience. Some people like films that you have to dissect long after viewing, but this is different. If you don't care about what's happening the first time around, there's no sense in taking the time to dissect it later on. One of the notes I wrote down in my notebook was ""nothing happened"".

10,gbill-74877,Fantastic,9,12 September 2020,"Perhaps nearing the end of our days all of us will fantasize about aspects of our lives that we wish had happened - a sweeping romance, winning an award, performing in a musical - or relive an aspect of our life that didn't turn out as we wished, like a relationship. The feeling of this old janitor reimagining a girl he knew briefly long ago, torturing himself with memories of his awkwardness and wishing he had engaged in long intellectual conversations with her is profoundly lonely and touching, and clearly he's been obsessing over her for decades. On its way to getting there, the film is eerie, surreal, and mind-bending, which made it a joy to watch. Aside from playing with our sense of what's going on, it's got great cinematography (those fields of snow!), great performances (Jessie Buckley and Jesse Plemons), and lots of little details in its scenes that reward a second viewing. Director Charlie Kaufman is not successful in everything he does (that CGI pig comes to mind), but he took chances and made something that's as smart as it is atmospheric. This is one to seek out.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
11,Cineanalyst,Of the Genus of Charlie Kaufman's A Beautiful Mind,9,11 September 2020,"Another metanarrative from cinematic postmodernist master Charlie Kaufman, ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things,"" perhaps, enters the terrain of the mind-game film, or puzzle picture, more so than the rest of his prior, albeit still characteristically offbeat, oeuvre. The boundaries between fantasy and reality are more blurred than in, say, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (2004) or ""Synecdoche, New York"" (2008). Once one discovers, however, that the disjointed surrealism of what we're viewing is the mental gymnastics of an unreliable narrator--to the point that we're misled by the voiceover and seeming protagonist as to the identity of the real narrator, the janitor--it becomes easier to appreciate the construction and what is a rather depressing story when one strips it down to the bones. Not only that we're seeing the probable suicide of a man cut off from the world despite cleaning up after it and from romance despite reading and watching its fictionalization, ""I'm thinking of Ending Things"" is also a disconcerting tract on the relationship between movies and spectator, of the ""societal malady"" of seeing ""too many movies,"" as the couple claim on their road trip--movies as rabies virus, as monster--replacing original or real thinking. Good thing the car's vanity mirror is broken; it may be uncomfortably close to home to look into this one.If we flatter ourselves that it's not a clever movie such as this that's warping our minds, or whatever else sophisticated cinema and art one might hold dear, Kaufman does offer some other targets. The low-hanging fruit is the abominable rom-com, which appears here as a film-within-the-film directed by, of all the random people, Robert Zemeckis (in an interview, Kaufman makes it clear that this gag truly was random, as it's hardly the sort of trash that Zemeckis is known for--any of his trash is of another order--but rather the sort of sleaze from the likes of, say, Judd Apatow, Richard Curtis, Cameron Crowe, Nora Ephron, Garry Marshall or Nancy Meyers). Indeed, the woman in the outer film, providing the misleading voiceover narration, is something of a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, or Wordsworth's Lucy. She's of no identity herself--her name, profession or where she grew up (is it a farm or an apartment) are constantly altered, as is how they met--merely a figment of the male hero's imagination, a janitor who has seen too many rom-coms and so now dreams of his younger self, Jake, visiting his parents, to introduce them to his fictional girlfriend. It's no wonder she doesn't know whether it's her or Jake in that childhood photograph and no wonder he seems to be able to hear her thoughts; they're of the same mind, so why not the same body, too. In one brief shot, the actress playing the young woman is even replaced by the actress from the Zemeckis inner film.Apropos to all its reflexivity, there are several (that's more than two, as Jake says) doppelgängers. Films-within-films turning into musicals-within-musicals, books within a movie adapted (reportedly, loosely) from a book, twin swing sets, maggot-filled pigs conflated with ice-cream commercial animation, characters assuming different ages and actors portraying them, including Jake and his girlfriend being substituted for an extended interpretive dance. Part of the enjoyment of ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" is just in connecting all of these threads--even its title has a double meaning, of ending the relationship and of his life. Jake's reality may be more relatable to ""A Woman Under the Influence"" (1974), having taken care of either of his parents experiencing dementia, but even this is attacked as his imaginary companion does a full-on impersonation of Pauline Kael (whose book we see among his childhood room's collection), quoting her review of the film verbatim while smoking the only cigarette seen in the entire runtime. This scene alone is enough for me to recommend ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things."" Medical or physics student, poet, artist, waitress, film critic: the Manic Pixie Dream Girl is whomever he needs her to be--even if it's to expose the haunted house, horror-film facade behind the door of his basement subconscious.While the musical references and, namely, those of ""Oklahoma!"" may not be as snippy as the criticism of rom-coms, Kaufman's strongest attack seems to be reserved for the movie that is unannounced (except for maybe a glimpse of a DVD case in the bedroom) in its allusion, ""A Beautiful Mind"" (2001), for which Jake recites its sappy Nobel Prize acceptance speech. It's not only artificial for the stage backdrop from ""Oklahoma!"" or that Jake follows it up by singing one of that musical's tunes; there's the manipulative background score during his oration, the blatant make-up to appear older, and, of course, his older, nude self was led to the stage by a CGI pig. Moreover, this highly musical climax comes on the heels of one of the movie's odd politically-correct discussions--in this case, the claim that ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" is a rape song (perhaps intentionally, the most muddled refutation of allegedly offensive language is when Billy Crystal, of the rom-com ""Forget Paris"" (1995), is called a ""nancy""). That certainly tinges, or colors, the subsequent adoption of musical elements and tactics of manipulative, coercive cinema for the climax.It's kind of funny, too, because Ron Howard's Best Picture winner, ""A Beautiful Mind,"" is also a mind-game film, but even in that regard it's frustratingly simplistic and hollowly engineered. Not so ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things."" There are tricks with the voiceover, including occasional overlapping mumbled narration and phone calls from the janitor; the initially misleading and ultimately revealing crosscutting between the couple with scenes of the janitor; the horrific, romantic and musical genre hopping; along with the general visual and audial oddities and surrealism with philosophical detours. Its reflexivity in calling attention to its own artifice is no celebration of cinema, but it's not hollow and simplistic, either, to show the mirror to the void of a quiet life of desperation filled by dreams and memories infected by art and fiction, by movies.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

13,eddie_baggins,A very untypical Netflix film full of mystery and intrigue,8,10 September 2020,"Building his career off the back of a series of quirky offerings that are as oddly funny as they are strangely moving, when you head into a Charlie Kaufman film you know you're in for an experience like none other (for better or worse) which is exactly what new Netflix offering I'm Thinking of Ending Things delivers upon.With the likes of his written films such as Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or the films he also directed such as the mind bending Synecdoche, New York or the little seen dramatic animation Anomalisa, Ending at times appears to be a straight-up genre film with initial thoughts this is merely an examination of a crumbling relationship between Jessie Buckley's unnamed main protagonist and Jesse Plemon's dry and boorish Jake but it quickly detours into something else entirely that may not be overly apparent until you're much further into its end game.In adapting Ian Reid's book, that itself is supposedly a quirky and abnormal novel, Kaufman has no doubt added his own spin on this quirky and deeply depressing tale as he looks to examine what it means to be human, what it means to feel alive and importantly what it feels to be loved and to love and while its subject matters don't always make for enthralling viewing as such (the film features two prolonged car-held conversations that may cause many viewers to tune out), there's an odd and effecting power to Ending that isn't frequently found in such tales.A huge part of this is down to Kaufman's ability as a screenwriter and he shows growth also here as a director with Ending looking and feeling fantastic but its also due to Buckley and Plemon's performances with both young actors proving once more their some of the best in the business and when they get to share the screen with industry vets Toni Collette and David Thewlis as Jake's eccentric parents, they more than hold their own, even if we as viewers might be losing track of exactly what is occurring in front of our eyes.It's a shame that many may dismiss the film or even not make it all the way through as when you finally begin to unravel exactly what is going on and why its going on, Ending becomes a truly moving and unique tale that will go down as one of the most original films of the year and easily one of the best Netflix originals of the last few years.Final Say -Stick with it and unlock its mysteries and I'm Thinking of Ending Things proves itself to be one of the years most pleasant surprises that features some great performances from some of the brightest young stars working today.4 animated pigs out of 5",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

16,southdavid,Custodian Sentence,4,16 September 2020,"I like to think of myself as a reasonably well rounded cinema viewer. As happy in the arthouse as the multiplex and open to less literal experiences - but (you knew that was coming) I couldn't connect with ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"". I think I understood it plot wise, but am less clear about what it was supposed to mean.Jake (Jesse Plemons) and his girlfriend (Jessie Buckley) brave increasingly poor weather conditions to travel to Jake's parents childhood farm and meet his mother (Toni Collette) and Father (David Thewlis). Once there, it's clear that all is not as it seems, as the personalities of the characters change and does their physical age. We also see an aged Janitor working the halls of a school and catch up with an alternative and more commercial movie within the movie.I actually quite enjoyed the opening hour. I liked the actors involved and enjoyed the slight surrealistic nature that the film starts with. It opens with a 20 minute scene of just Plemons and Buckley sparring slightly as they travel - with us hearing some of Buckley's interior monologue about how she feels like their relationship might be a mistake. The early scenes at the house are probably the best in the film, as Collette and Thewlis are great, and the odd cutting and tone changes make the films it's most accessible. This is where the characterisation as a horror film comes from, but let's be clear, the film is not a horror movie - unless you accept that definition to include a film about a life not really lived.I've read a group of reviews, here and elsewhere, that interpreted the movie for me and those are useful - but if I have to do supplementary reading afterwards to really get it, can it be considered a successful adaptation? I came away thinking about time and in particular a lifetime and that's the right area, but there are still numerous scenes in that second hour that I didn't understand the reason for.There's an inherent edge to some of the reviews here, that I don't want to fall into - so if you got more from this than I did - fair play.

19,jtindahouse,A bizarre ride that I absolutely loved,8,8 September 2020,"I've seen some strange movies in my time, but 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' is right near the top of that list. The movie starts out strangely, but by the end the early scenes seem like the most normal thing you've ever seen. This movie becomes bonkers. Even though I wasn't entirely sure exactly what what going on (I had hopes that the film would explain itself by the end - more on that soon), I oddly loved it. The dialogue, the characters and the bizarre interactions - it was captivating to watch.I would be remiss not to mention how great the cast is. Every single one of them nailed their role. They were perfect. It would be unfair to single any of them out, because they were all right on the money. And these were not easy roles to encompass either. Not only did they have to play themselves in many different ways, they had to do so amongst a chaotic storyline. Not an easy task.I usually love ambiguity in a film, however this was a rare case where I wanted a definitive answer. I had to go and look up the ending of the book this is based on which explains everything. Once I read that I could appreciate the movie just that little bit more, however I shouldn't have to look up outside information to understand a film if it is doing its job right. I have no problem with a film leaving clues lying around and expecting the audience to put the pieces together. In fact I love films that do that. 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' was too hard of a puzzle though I feel. That really is the only thing holding this movie back from being nearly perfect I would suggest. I would highly recommend giving this one a look. Be prepared though, this isn't your average film.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

With this movie, however, he may have made his weirdest yet. Sure, it was startlingly bizarre that John Cusack found a portal into someone else's mind in ""Being John Malkovich"", or that Nic Cage wrote a screenplay that turned out to be that of the movie we were all watching in ""Adaptation"", but in those movies, we had someone on screen to empathise with, because we felt how they felt.""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" leaves all of that behind. It's an endurance contest, seeming like it might make sense, addressing obvious themes but throwing spanners in the works of your understanding. The ending has to be seen to be believed, bringing in ballet, animation - multiple styles, mind you - and vocal performance.I got that the main theme of the movie seemed to be aging, but what was with all that?At times the movie seems to be heading toward some kind of bittersweet relief of its aching themes of senescence, but at other times it's unnerving and surprising, like something out of Lynch or Kubrick.Something should be said about the performances of Toni Colette and David Thewlis. Perhaps these are the only two actors around who could have done what they did here? Both give tour-de-force performances in everything they're in.

23,alindsay-al,An Average Art House Film,5,8 September 2020,"This film hit Netflix a few days ago and has got the internet talking so I thought I would watch I'm Thinking Of Ending Things and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young woman travel to her new boyfriends parents farm where she comes across some interesting things.Main Character
Jessie Buckley is the character we are meant to follow here and she does a really good job. The strength of this film is the acting and she makes it easy to follow here, she is clearly uncomfortable throughout the film and isn't exactly sure what is going on which makes her easy to follow as the viewer clearly isn't meant to know what is exactly going on. I'm not going into detail about her character or exactly the performance as it does play into the plot but her performance is really interesting to watch.Supporting Characters
Jesse Plemons who I know for his run as Todd in Breaking Bad plays her boyfriend and he also does a really good job, it is just a strong performance. Again I can't really go into too much detail but he gives a great performance and again his acting is one of the most interesting parts of the film. David Thewlis and Toni Collette play his parents and they are both great and fit the quality actors that they are.Story
Okay, this is where the review gets complicated. If you have watched this film then you know why, basically this film has an underlying narrative that is hard to follow. I pretty much had no clue what was going on for portions of this movie, but then when I finished watching the film I realised that actually the film has an interesting story, it just isn't presented pretty well. Lets face it everyone will google this film after and that is when you really realise what is going on, it is just a shame that it wasn't particularly shown that well.Script
The script is also not that great for me, there was no dialogue that stood out for me and again similar to the plot the script is over-complicated and at times is again hard to follow. I think there is something great here, it is just hidden by an over indulgent story.Style
This film does a good job of building an eerie setting, you can tell that Buckley's character is uncomfortable and confused and the style of the film does a great job of that. The film also does a fine job of keeping the longer scenes engaging enough when they could have easily been sleep inducing. But this film does have a slower pace and I would argue that it doesn't exactly do a great job of structuring its story which hurts the overall experience, it could have been a 90 minute movie and nobody would have complained. This is one of those films that art house film fans will love, it looks nice and has long dialogue scenes, but that doesn't always do it for me.Overall
Overall, this is an average experience. It is a film that over reaches and tries to be really clever and for me fell flat, it is held up by the fantastic acting but I would say unless you are a huge film fan this is one you can skip.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

31,masonfisk,ANOTHER KAUFMAN CINEMATIC QUESTION MARK...!,7,19 January 2021,"Charlie Kaufman's (Anomalisa/Synecdoche, New York) third film, airing on Netflix, as a writer/director finds him adapting Iain Reid's book about a recently met couple meeting his parents for the first time on a remote farm in the middle of a blizzard. Jessie Buckley & Jessie Plemons are the couple & it seems they hit it off on the notions of book smarts or learned ideals rather than looks since she seems to have accepted his hand out of default & maybe circumstance rather than anything resembling a carnal attraction while he seems sure over some things but unsure about a great amount more but hey the old maxim of opposites attracting may be at work here. Plemons can't wait for Buckley to meet his folks but the moment they hit his home, they're nowhere to be found & just suddenly pop out when you least suspect it. The parents, played by Toni Collette & David Thewlis, don't seem all there w/the majority of their dinner conversation gushing over their son & things seem off (Plemons shows Buckley an area in a barn where they used to raise pigs but had to be done away with due to disease yet ham is being served for the meal) when after the meal Buckley roams around the house & every time she re-encounters the parents they have visibly aged or have gotten younger. The moment they leave home (Buckley can't wait to leave!), Plemons gets it into his head to stop at a Diary Queen of sorts for some Oreo Blizzards & after not eating his, he decides to drive out of his way to his old school stomping ground just to toss out the neglected cup. Kaufman uses the school grounds (& an aged janitor who's still working in the middle of the night) as a final repose of this couple's future lives (we see an older Plemons receiving a lifetime achievement award while Buckley & his parents nod proudly from their seats) as we the audience are left to wander in the land of juxtaposition & speculation as to what all these artful accents actually mean (the old age make-up for example is very exaggerated, almost Japanese Kubuki like while the janitor, cut to at different junctures of the narrative, ends up being led through the empty hallways naked following a talking animated pig) but I give credit to Kaufman for never boring an audience even though some of it may be for effect rather than sense.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

33,I_Ailurophile,As phenomenal and riveting as it is artful and dense,10,31 August 2021,"Charlie Kaufman, as both screenwriter and director, has an uncanny ability to create features that feel unmistakably recognizable as his, even though each of his films are entirely unique from one another. Understated and dialogue-heavy, filled with quiet disparate scenes - from the very beginning there's a sense of surrealism in the disconnect between spoken word and visual display. And it only gets weirder and more wonderful as it goes on: 'I'm thinking of ending things' is an oddity, a marvel, a labor, and a joy.It is, in turn, captivating, jarring, awkward, tense, bizarre, disquieting - but always fantastical. Dialogue and voiceovers are variably existential, acerbic, despondent, sweet, ruminating, passive, philosophical - but always entrancing. Even having seen and adored Kaufman's other films, I'm not sure that I've ever seen a movie quiet like this. This is in no small part thanks to the extraordinary range, nuance, and brilliant, singular idiosyncrasy of each performance. David Thewlis and especially Toni Collette realize fancifully dynamic characters with outstanding vigor and spirit, parts wholly distinct from their past credits. Jesse Plemons is relatively steady and even in his portrayal of Jake, but there's nonetheless a subtlety to his acting, and at other times a daring breadth of emotional capacity far exceeding other roles we've seen him in. I'm less familiar with Jessie Buckley, but like Plemons, she bears a strong force of personality in depicting a character that from one scene to the next - or from one moment to the next within a single scene - may notably shift in mood or tone, in relation to others, or in the overall thrust of the characterization. Even the large supporting cast, actors with few lines and little time on screen, very capably play their parts.Art direction, production design - every single element of the film is meticulously, painstakingly considered and arranged. The makeup department's great contribution was especially crucial here, but this is hardly to count out hair, costume design, or props. Set design and decoration are primo, to say nothing of filming locations, and noteworthy work with editing and visual effects further the wonder and spectacle. As with other Kaufman features, there's a strong element of theatricality that further bends the reality before us. The choreography is marvelous, and kudos to the dancers for their astounding gracefulness. It's also a particular joy to see Plemons sing - again, far removed from other well-known roles, and he has definite skill. And it all but goes without saying that as director, Kaufman orchestrates some fantastic scenes, and arranges some especially eye-catching shots.Still, for all the excellence generally of 'I'm thinking of ending things' - the narrative, adapted with Kaufman's expert hand from the novel of the same name, is where lies the greatest challenge and reward as a viewer. The nearest point of complexity in Kaufman's list of credits is what I would argue to be his greatest achievement, 'Synecdoche, New York,' as his best known films are more straightforward by comparison. That said, 'I'm thinking of ending things' inhabits a space of at once being both more plainspoken in its convoluted artistry, and more obtuse. For even the most keen, observant viewer, multiple watches may be required to peel back the layers and discern the entirety of the true core of the plot; alternatively, an in-depth outside analysis may serve the same purpose. Yet as though the magnificent splendor of everything we see and hear weren't enough - once we do plumb the hidden depths of the story, only then do we truly see all the mesmerizing beauty of the movie for what it is. The grandeur of 'I'm thinking of ending things' is made more impressive still by how dexterous and fluid the complete presentation is: on every level, this matches or exceeds the storytelling and film-making expertise Kaufman and his collaborators demonstrated with his 2008 directorial debut. And that's saying a lot.By no means is this a movie that's easy to digest, or that a broad general audience may appreciate. The superficially disjointed, disordered, complicated plot and sequencing is no doubt a turn-off for many, as is the very need to dig deep to reach the heart of the film. That's perfectly okay - art is subjective, and everyone has their own preferences. All the same, this is a feature that can be enjoyed by anyone; before I very belatedly got around to watching, I was caught off guard by the person who most immediately recommended it to me, someone who ordinarily wouldn't go for something this heavy. That only illustrates the wide appeal of Kaufman's works, though, and how any viewer can potentially relate - from the beginning of his career, his screenplays have captured, as one character here calls it, the ""universality in the specific.""If all these words are too much, however, allow me to state it more plainly: 'I'm thinking of ending things' is a masterpiece, a beacon of resplendent, stunning skill of performance, screenwriting, and film-making, that everyone needs to see at least once. It's rich, absorbing, and not just rewarding but fulfilling - a profoundly gratifying cinema experience and fruitful use of time for anyone that enjoys the medium. I can't possibly recommend this any more highly.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
34,aidanratesmovies,Kaufman's first failure- although not as horrible as some may say,5,7 September 2020,"Charlie Kaufman's meticulous metaphorical journey throughout space and time, isn't only odd, confusing, and bewildering- but ultimately rather dull, shallow, and simply boring. Although I did not enjoy this film nearly as much as I hoped to, I did enjoy several things about it. There are some quite well written parts of this film, namely with dialogue- as Kaufman is quite a master on the articulation and depth of his characters. The acting is also quite good, namely Toni Collette who is terrific as always, and Jessie Buckley, who provides a nice surprise for the film. This film is quite messy, and very complex. It can be inciteful, but for the most part, it deals with common issues of missed opportunities that we see in our own lives but no so much on the screen. The situation and concept of what this film means seems to be almost gratifying, but unfortunately, Kaufman's direction makes the film seem rather dull and muttled rather than truly amount to anything rather significant. The cinematography in the film is quite beautiful and haunting, but the film never feels that way tonely, it feels oblivious to the world around it, and seems to get lost in the pages of its own metaphors. In the end, I'm Thinking of Ending Things feels like a missed opportunity. The film has great qualities, but doesn't prove to be anything memorable or worthwhile. It's a disappointment for me, as I am a fan of Kaufman's work, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind being my favorite film and all- its hard to see one of my favorite directors provide something so lackluster when it comes to film, and yet, here it is.

The things he's doing on screen are incredible, you absolutely have to give this your 100% attention to catch all the subtle nuances.The problem here, for me, is that it's slow, meandering. It's fascinating but it takes so long to really get anywhere that is hard not to get distracted and pulled out of it. A little trimming here and this might just be a masterpiece.It's hard to watch a movie that's so finely crafted only to not love it.

36,dierregi,A game of one-upmanship,1,6 September 2020,"In this dismal year 2020 there must be a competition going on between Kaufmann and Nolan to make the most annoyingly pretentious movie. I suffered through Tenet because I paid for the ticket, but this was a different situation.I didn't read the novel and I was hoping for something cleverly weird with a heart, like ""Eternal Sunshine"" (it isn't). The movie opens with an incessant monologue of the female character (called Lucy at some stage, but I learnt that's not her name).Lucy and boyfriend Jake drive a long way in the snow to visit Jake's parents who live in an isolated farm. Lucy sounds depressed (at the very least) and during the drive recites an endless, creepy poem to Jake. This scene is over 30 minutes long and could have been edited to 15 max.The dismal drive is interspersed with scenes about an old janitor and the rehearsal of a musical taking place at his school.From the opening sequence I inferred that the ""ending"" meant suicide rather than breaking up and I had the odd feeling that the janitor was Jake, perhaps in the future.Then follows another overlong scene with the young couple meeting the parents, who are predictably odd. After a long dinner, the time frame shifts and - suddenly - the parents are twice as old than two minutes earlier. By then, there was still more than one hour to go and I feel asleep.When I woke up, I checked the plot and discovered that I guessed almost right: the old janitor is indeed Jake and the girl was a ""metaphor"" for all his missed romances. He was already old, lonely and alone, reminiscing and thinking to top himself. The end.Since I guessed without reading the novel (which I will avoid), I suppose Kaufmann lost his bet, but I also have no reason to finish watching a movie about an old loser about to commit suicide. Obviously, it would have been more difficult to sell this plot for what it actually is...",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

38,jadepietro,Non-Sense,4,14 September 2020,"GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An earnest but artsy-fartsy philosophical exercise about a road trip that impresses with its testament to the power of words, even though its story crashes and burns.JIM'S REVIEW: Jake and Lucy are going on a road trip to meet the folks in Charlie Kaufman's film adaptation of Iain Reid's novel, I'm Thinking of Ending Things. Like most road adventures, it starts off full of promise and energy and downgrades to dumb and numbingly dumber detours by the end of its tiresome journey. Things just don't end well for the characters or the moviegoing audience.This road may be hard and less traveled as this couple in crisis drives past barren snowscapes to a remote farmhouse where Andrew Wyeth might easily have dwelt. The blizzard rages on as the window wipers noisily scrap against the windshield like metronomes pushing off the blinding snow. The duo converses about a myriad of subjects and we learn, through Lucy's internal voiceover thoughts, that all is not well in this relationship. The ride continues through the first third of the movie as things become more apparent that this joyless ride is slightly askew. Time seems to stand still or move swiftly forward as they reach their destination where things progress to a whole new level of weirdness. She wants to end ""It"" (her relationship? sanity? life?); He is just coasting, going along for the ride; You, depending on your own level of stamina, will be either thoroughly engrossed by their philosophical bantering or totally bored with this long day's journey into night.Director/Writer Kaufman quickly establishes an eerie atmosphere, abetted by cinematographer Lukasz Zal's vision of bleak winter landscapes and Jay Wadley's mood music. What Mr. Kaufman fails to establish in his film is one essential element: a cohesive plot. He is more concerned about discussions on a range of topics like the written works of William Wordsworth and David Foster Wallace, Pauline Kael's literary word-by-word critique of John Cassavetes ' indie fave, A Woman Under the Influence or a lingering strange obsession with Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma. Were that he have been more involved with sharper character development or a focused narrative! Actually, the film prides itself on throwing one off-kilter with its surreal non-linear structure and its surface oddities as it showcases a nightmarish vision of two characters lost in translation.Without much doubt, this one of the strangest films any moviegoer will experience. Sections of the film have characters age as they enter or exit a room, one character shifts identity in name and occupations, and behaviors by other supporting characters appear evil or menacing for no real purpose. We seem to have entered a Twilight Zone dimension. While the film might be a perfect parable to these COVID days where weeks blur into months and time becomes more of an enemy than friend, the overall effect of the film is more exhausting than exhilarating.The movie is a bi-polar mash-up of half-baked intellectualized ideas. Parts of this film are artfully eloquent while other sequences are so heavy-handed and contrived, especially as the characters reach the end of their journey. By the film's absurd third act, the film strains all credibility even in this illogical world. (Actually, the story literally veers off the road at the film's midway point, although the aforementioned Oklahoma motif dooms the seriousness of the proceedings and becomes unintentional laughable with its jarring musical sequences, a poorly animated talking pig, and some very bad make-up design.) One wishes Mr. Kaufman had reined in all of his quirkiness and spent more energy on his plot narrative. A secondary supporting character played by Guy Boyd makes little sense until the concluding final scenes and, even then, he remains a mere plot device to advance the incredulous action.Still the film has much to say and scores with many of its poetry-laden moments. Some of the dialog is so insightful and memorable. Nowadays, most movies rarely accomplish this high level of wordplay. It's just a shame that the screenplay becomes unmanageable. There are some clever philosophical musings throughout the movie. (Perhaps, you should just read the book tos savor those passages.) Here all the eloquence are tethered to a laborious slog of a movie.I'm Thinking About Ending Things is a modern day ode to the intimations of immortality. I would agree that the movie is a intriguing mediative exercise about isolation and the fragility of the human condition. Some critics have lauded this movie for its inventiveness and existential message, but not this reviewer. Yes, there is much to admire here (Mr. Kaufman's solid direction, fine acting by the leads, strong sound design, and good production values). But the film's wild exasperating conclusion makes this moviegoing experience ultimately unsatisfying. One wonders if anything that we witnessed is real in this unreal universe, but even that angle goes unanswered in this cinematic quagmire.Indeed, nothing makes sense in Mr. Kaufman's movie, although I'm sure this talented filmmaker enjoys the enigmatic paradox of philosophical questions about life he has lensed. I didn't. It certainly would have helped things if the filmmaker had put more serious thought about his cockamamie ending than he did in I'm Thinking of Ending Things. In fact, the film's denouncement is one of the most disappointing endings I have ever experienced in my many years of filmgoing. The film is a noble failure. And while its words don't fail, the inane actions and non-sensical plotting of these real or imaginary characters in this woeful story do.

This book and movie is about Loneliness and how this man who was socially awkward looked after his parents while they were sick and kind of built his own world in head where he has a girlfriend a girl he once saw in the bar but was too afraid to approach her.Jake's way of reframing his loneliness is through active imagination. There is a quote in the book which nicely summed up his life that ""Sometimes a thought is closer to truth, to reality, than an action. You can say anything, you can do anything, but you can't fake a thought."" The reason Lucy which is Jake's conscious is keep saying ""I'm thinking of ending things"" is because he is thinking of ending his life. Things are his Life which he eventually ends once his parents passed away.One major difference between the movie and the book is that book was psychological horror and the movie is psychological drama. In the book, it was in last 30 pages you learn the truth and it comes as an extreme shock but in the movie you kind of get it from the beginning in 5 minutes that it maybe in dream like state as you get flashes of Janitor and guy looking through window same as Janitor and Jake.I really enjoyed the movie though I believe it would have been more impactful if they aligned with book's ending; showing his horrific suicide in Janitor's closet and Lucy's realisation that she is figment of his imagination as Two become One in the school hallway when she is frantically looking for him. I can see the director treated the book as psychological drama than a thriller so ended it with a dance and song.The performances are great across the board Jesse Plemons, Jesse Buckley, Toni Collette, David Thewlis. I think Charlie Kaufman did a terrific job in finding a correct tone, sets and colour scheme to bring this noir surrealism to life. It great to see such movies are being made which are unique and make people think about it long after the credits are rolled. Eventhough, I preferred the book's ending still I would recommend this to people who are looking for something fresh and daring on screen.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

Yes, we can all conjure up coded, clever and complex interpretations on a life; distort them to our hearts content - but they need to anchor themselves on something you might reflect on as reality, or we might as well interpret the dreams of pigs to make sense of our own world.... and if, as several reviews suggest, you need to read the book to get a grasp on what we have seen, or you will see (never had to read the manual for a film before), that need lays fairly and squarely at the table of the director and writers, who were unable to make a successful and satisfactory transfer. It results in a very abstract but ultimately selfish and disconnected illusion.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
42,gedikreverdi,You can't fake a thought,8,25 October 2021,"I should have seen it coming. I already knew it was very metaphorical. I enjoyed the first part very much with their journey to the farmhouse in the blizzard and dinner at the house with time gaps and everything and they stopped by somewhere to get ice cream and drove over to Jake's high school to get rid of the melting ice cream and it's where it somehow loses its mysterious and unsafe atmosphere. The janitor kills the guy who dances with the girl and gets married to her and then he goes on a stage to accept his Nobel prize with the pig with maggots. Everyone was old in the audience including the mean ice cream girls, the kind one and his girlfriend. They're all the same as the pig with maggots regardless of their professions, looks and choices. But his car was buried in snow in the schoolyard in the morning and he was showing signs of hypothermia. So it was his dream to win a Nobel prize and be an important person that led a fruitful life? I think it tells the story of Lucia with her making different choices every time so she kept changing her job, name and even her appearance. At the end they even become the dancer couple and get married.The actors are amazing. It's always so nice to watch Toni Collette. It's as bleak as it gets like the blizzard. Getting older is inevitable for everyone and maybe that it's true for everyone is what keeps us going despite everything.Edit: I searched the explanation online and it turns out it is indeed the janitor's dream.

So I thought this might be a bit strange as usual but good considering the high rating. I was pretty disappointed at the fact that this is one of those movies that's just a bunch of symbolisms pieced together, which is definitely not my thing (my immediate thought was Eraserhead, which I also dislike). Now I got a lot of it, and the two (very helpful) top reviews here explaining the movie confirmed most of what I thought. Still, I really didn't find it enjoyable even with sort of understanding what Kaufman was trying to convey, and I found it much longer than necessary.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
44,blott2319-1,"Depressing nonsense that will appeal to some, but annoy everyone else",1,11 September 2020,"I knew going in that Charlie Kaufman is weird and his movies sometimes have unusual elements included to make a point, but I've always found them intriguing to some degree. So, for the first third of I'm Thinking of Ending Things, I was fully engaged and anxiously waiting to see what kind of weird twist he would add into this tale of a young couple going to visit the boyfriend's parents. It certainly seemed like something was slightly off, and I thought I was ready for anything. However, once I realized that there wasn't a real story being told and it was all just odd nonsense trying to make a point, I was thinking of ending things myself. All the air was let out of the balloon, and what was once eerily off-putting just pissed me off. It's the same kind of gobbledygook that David Lynch throws at the audience. Cobble together as much incomprehensible crap as you want, and no one can complain about the absurdity because it all takes place inside someone's mind (arguably someone who is going insane/senile.)I suppose I should commend the actors for their hard work in I'm Thinking of Ending Things. It can't be easy pulling off this kind of incoherence. Every character has to go through a myriad of insane behavioral shifts and the cast does their best to make that work. I'll also say that the general tone of the film was successfully conveyed. It is quite unsettling which I think was intentional, and I'd love to see what Charlie Kaufman could do with a real suspense-thriller. But once we hit the point where any attempt at a traditional narrative plot goes out the window, I became completely disengaged from the entire movie. From that point on, it felt like the film dragged on for way too long. It was one of those movies where I kept checking to see how much time was left before it was over. The final reason that I'm Thinking of Ending Things bothered me was the overall bleak and depressing mood of the piece. The last thing I need in the midst of quarantine during a pandemic is a maudlin piece that takes an esoteric look at regret, the meaninglessness of life, and the inevitability of death.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
45,aciessi,Polar Vortex,5,17 December 2020,"I wish I could have loved this. I wish I could have fully understood it. I didn't. I'm Thinking of Ending Things went way over my head and got on my nerves. Vaguely, I understood it as multiple visualized internal monologues involving a family and a dissatisfied woman that is entering the family. They all speak at length, either at each other or to themselves about how they feel about love and existence. A lot of it is meandering. But kudos to Charlie Kaufman for visualizing it in a tantalizing way. The animated sequences are by far the most mesmerizing part. The dance sequence is bizarre enough to split audiences. Personally, I hated it. This is not a bad movie, by any stretch. But good luck sitting through it",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
46,rockman182,I'm Thinking of Ending Things (2020),8,9 September 2020,"Let me tell you, when I heard Charlie Kaufman was directing another film and that it would be hitting Netflix, I was hyped. Kaufman's writing is so top notch. He has a unique mind and I can get engorged in a screenplay by him. I think he's a better screenwriter than when he sits behind the directors chair but I wanted to see what he could bring with this. While the film is quite long, I felt mixed about it at first and then decided that I love it. Regardless of my final thoughts, my eyes were glued to the screen the entire duration.Report this adThe film is a film that blurs reality with memory where the main story follows a relationship between a man and a woman. The woman has an inner monologue and wants to end the relationship with him. We see the couples relationship with the man's parents along with the decline in mental capacity and health of the parents. The issues and dynamics of their relationship are explored throughout a film that is at times fleeting and gives way to its ambiguous interpretation and artistic delivery.Jessie Buckley is the best thing ever in this film. She's always displayed talent in everything she's been in but with this film she displays talent at the highest order. All the pain and emotion can be seen in her expressive acting. Jesse Plemons is great in it as well, the pairing were a strong selection. Toni Colette in her limited time is great and at times so simply frightening (just like she is in Hereditary). Its hard to define this film and put it in a categorical box because it borrows from different genres. Its dialogue driven at times and you have to be ready for a minimal approach at times.I haven't read the novel but read the differences between the novel and the film. I feel like Kaufman leaves it up to the viewer's interpretation. I don't want to get into spoilers but I feel like I may have an idea what goes on and the link between the fantastical elements and how it relates to the male lead and his idealistic idea of a life where he is happy and a relationship that occurs on his own (often delusional terms). Of course, I cannot be certain of this interpretation as its very ambiguous and not very linear at all.Report this ad
Report this adThe beauty of the film is that it requires multiple viewings. The lead character's clothing changes in different scenes, i.e the color of her sweater. There is a lot that is happening on screen and I don't mind re-watching this to just dive into it and see if there is anything else my eyes can decipher. I know a lot of people are bored or frustrated with this film. Its a grower that stays in your mind and its something I want to revisit because I liked it a lot.8/10",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
47,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A bizarre film that mostly goes downhill.,5,30 December 2020,"Perhaps I should have learned my lesson from when I watched Synecdoche, New York (2008). I have appreciated plenty of Charlie Kaufman's films, but only when he's the writer. Not the director. Or maybe this is a more recent change, as some of my favorite Kaufman films were released before 2005. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Being John Malkovich (1999) are some of my favorite films, with Adaptation. (2002) being at least something that I understood (despite its extremely meta nature).I'll admit that I thought I'm Thinking of Ending Things (2020) was initially about suicide by its title. As I started to watch, I thought I would be getting a thoughtful look at the midwest's mundane nature (a la Nebraska (2013)). Then a bandage switched sides on a character's forehead. From that point, everything became much more bizarre-to the point where I stopped even trying to make sense of it all. Was it an indictment of nostalgia and apathy? Was it the daydreaming hallucinations of a janitor? I honestly don't know, and I don't care to figure it out.What's disappointing to me is that I appreciated the car ride's intimacy and the poetry of the nothingness that one has to traverse to arrive anywhere in the midwest. Jessie Buckley definitely makes the film work, and now I finally have a movie where Jesse Plemons is his own actor instead of being a Matt Damon look-alike in my head. I'll usually forgive films trying to be ""artsy"" if there's a point to it all. Instead, movies like I'm Thinking of Ending Things make me so confused as to miss the point completely.A bizarre film that mostly goes downhill, I give I'm Thinking of Ending Things 2.5 stars out of 5.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

50,kjproulx,A Work of Art from Writer/Director Charlie Kaufman,10,8 September 2020,"Throughout the last couple of decades, writer/director Charlie Kaufman has been known for his deep dives into the minds of the characters he writes. If you ever watch one of his movies and aren't thinking outside the box from the very first frame, then he's absolutely working outside of his comfort zone. This film is completely and utterly a Kaufman production. From start to finish, the thought-provoking nature was sending my brain into a spiral, while also being completely fascinated by the metaphors at hand. This film surely won't be for all viewers, but here's why I loved I'm Thinking of Ending Things so much.The film follows Jake and his new girlfriend as they travel out tom his family farm. The point of the trip is so she can meet his parents and that's as far as the basic story itself goes, which is for the entire film, but it's not about that at all. To really dive into the psyche of the film's underlying messages would be to ruin the experience, so I won't get too deep, but rather explain it in a roundabout way. That in itself will also be difficult though because I'm Thinking of Ending Things is the perfect definition of a film that's completely up to your interpretation. I'm sure Kaufman knows exactly what's going on 100% of the time, but certain viewers will see it differently and that's why I think it was so brilliant to experience.I feel as though this is a film that explores the troubled mind of Jake. His girlfriend, parents, and smaller characters throughout the film are really just there as accent pieces for audiences to dive into this character. That's about as far as I'll go with that, but I did feel like I was watching inner love, pain, grief, and happiness bursting out of the screen all at once. Some viewers will take this film very literally on its surface, seeing it simply as a film where a woman is meeting a man's parents for the first time, but again, I don't think you're letting the film immerse you in the story if that's how you see it. There is so much more to this story under the surface.On top of the fantastic form of storytelling, this is a film that blew me away in two other aspects specifically. The editing by Robert Frazen hooked me from the very first scene, which goes on for a very long period of time. With the added masterful work of Lukasz Zal being the camera, the seamless way that sequences progress had me in awe. Lukasz Zal has been someone I've kept an eye on after being impressed with his work on both Cold War and Ida though, so I really shouldn't have been as surprised as I was, but he really is just that talented as a Cinematographer. The technical aspects of this film, although clearly budgeted, honestly took my breath away at times.I'm Thinking of Ending Things is only Charlie Kaufman's third film in terms of directing features and I really hope he dives into many more stories like this. Being more of a writer than anything else throughout the years like Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, nobody quite tells a story like him and I'm so happy that he's helming these projects as well. From the fantastic central performances by both Jesse Plemons and Jessie Buckley, to the wonderful look and tone of the film, there's wasn't anything I could find that I wanted to complain about. A huge complaint from some people will be that they didn't understand a lot of the movie, but if you really sit back and think about each moment, it becomes much clearer. I found this movie to be incredibly impactful and easily one of my favorite films of 2020. Now streaming on Netflix, if you're looking for something thought-provoking and heavy to sink your teeth into, this may just be the one, but be wary of how artistic certain moments will be.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

52,msbreviews,I'm Thinking of Ending Things is meant to divide critics and audience all around the world!,7,4 September 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Charlie Kaufman is undeniably one of the greatest writers of the 2000s. Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind are some of his most notable works, but it's Synecdoche, New York that's considered by many as one of the best films of the respective decade. Therefore, I was obviously excited about his return to live-action movies (since 2008, he's only made the animated feature, Anomalisa). I'm Thinking of Ending Things boasts an incredibly talented cast, capable of seating me down and make me watch any film they participate in, even though Jessie Buckley (Dolittle) is sort of a new face to me. My expectations were moderately high, so how did it go?I'm not going to lie, I found this movie so intricate that I had a really hard time figuring it all out. As soon as it ended, I knew I didn't understand it in full, which generated an unusual yet refreshing feeling inside me. I felt the need to not only think about the film all night but since I didn't have the time to watch it again, I returned to a few specific scenes in the next morning. I also researched a bit and talked with a fellow critic to settle some of my mind's internal debates. I write this to imply that this is not an easy movie to decipher, which will definitely throw some people off. It's a film that requires all of the viewer's attention and self-questioning capability. Otherwise, things will get complicated.As usual, I'm not sharing any spoilers, so I'll keep my opinion about the story's multiple interpretations to the bare minimum. Of all the numerous ways of explaining this movie, I found two: either from Jessie Buckley's character's perspective or from Jesse Plemons'. I like both for different reasons. In terms of logic, which every viewer will struggle to find, Plemons' character is the key to understand the remarkably complex, multi-layered narrative. Looking at the film from his perspective, everything makes much more sense. However, it's surprisingly from Buckley's view that I find the movie's message to be more interesting and likely to resonate with most people.Making an impactful move in life requires determination, courage, decisiveness. Moving to another country, switching jobs, ending a relationship... all can be extremely demanding and psychologically painful. I'm Thinking of Ending Things brilliantly demonstrates how one can delay these actions sometimes indefinitely. From the excruciatingly long car drives (almost an hour of the runtime is spent inside the car listening to the main characters debating apparently random philosophical themes) to the enigmatic transitions of time passing by, Kaufman's screenplay keeps transmitting a message of how people are stationary and time just keeps flowing.This film takes ambiguousness and metaphoric filmmaking to a whole other level. Not only everything the viewer is seeing has, in some shape or form, a philosophical meaning, but the dialogues between the main characters are themselves about cultural, intellectual, sophisticated matters. Some of these conversations have an eventual impact in the narrative or in the characters, some just feel like Kaufman needed to express his thoughts on several subjects. With a runtime of slightly over two hours, this movie overstays its welcome a bit due to the insistence in delivering repetitive, similar scenes with the same goal.The time shenanigans performed in the parents' house is undoubtedly intriguing, but it's more distracting than helpful story-wise. Having in mind the already puzzling narrative, the confusion associated with understanding how time works only creates even more doubts. It also deviates the viewer's attention from the real focus, which didn't help my first viewing. In fact, I was so concentrated trying to comprehend the purpose behind the old-young versions of the characters that I completely lost track of the runtime, ultimately thinking the film was near its ending when it still had forty minutes to go...There's a limit to how abstract and implicit a movie can be without becoming genuinely hard to understand, and Kaufman walks that threshold. Successful sometimes, not that much in other moments. Nevertheless, I can only share compliments from now on. Firstly, the cast. I've been in love with anything Toni Collette does since Hereditary, and once again, she's weirdly captivating as an amusing yet disturbing mother. David Thewlis offers a subtler performance, as well as Jesse Plemons, even though the latter explodes with emotion in the third act.However, Jessie Buckley steals the spotlight in impeccable fashion. Like I mentioned in the beginning, I know very little of her as an actress, but I'll make sure to add her to the list of ""actresses to follow closely"". With one of the biggest emotional ranges seen this year, she delivers an incredibly captivating display, one that should guarantee her name in future contender's list for the awards season. From citing entire poems to fiercely debating any topic thrown at her by Plemons, her commitment to the role is palpable. An astonishing performance that I will remember for a long time. However, it's in the technical realm that this film achieves perfection.Without the shadow of a doubt, this is the best movie of the year when it comes to the technical attributes (until the date of this review, obviously). Almost every filmmaking element carries a tremendous impact in either the narrative or its characters. The purposefully rough editing (Robert Frazen) adds to the perplexing atmosphere. The lighting plus the production (Molly Hughes) and set design (Mattie Siegal) help identify ""where"" a particular event is happening. The detailed costume design (Melissa Toth) and the impressive makeup are vital to the understanding of everything that occurs in the parents' house. The distinct cinematography (Lukasz Zal) elevates every single action performed by the characters. It's a technically flawless film, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it being nominated for several categories when the time comes.I'm Thinking of Ending Things might be a Netflix original movie, but it screams A24 all the way. From the incredibly perplexing narrative told through bizarre storytelling to its distinctly unconventional technical characteristics, Charlie Kaufman offers a remarkably complex film that can take different interpretations (and may require more than one viewing). His insistence in transmitting one of the film's messages through never-ending philosophical conversations and confusing time-bending distractions stretch the story to an unnecessary long runtime that hurts the overall piece. Nevertheless, all messages are successfully delivered through an intriguing, head-scratching, weirdly captivating story packed with cultural debates and unique characters. An absolutely outstanding Jessie Buckley elevates every single line of dialogue, showing tremendous emotional range, but the impressively talented cast also improves the multi-layered screenplay. Technically, it is and it will remain as one of the best movies of the year. Every technical aspect is close to perfection, and almost all have a massive impact on the story and how the viewer interprets it. It will undoubtedly create a gap between critics and audiences since it has all the ingredients that usually place these groups at opposite extremes. I can only recommend it to people who are able to dedicate their full attention to what they're watching while being capable of self-questioning. It's not your usual Netflix flick to pop during tedious home tasks to help pass the time, so make sure you know what you're getting into!Rating: B",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

There the film goes up, but then, for me, because so many things are already mixed that it does not go anywhere.The actors are great, especially the parents, the reflection of the older couple, you're great, we'll see if they don't make it to the Oscar.I like the lighting indoors and at night, I don't like the day, it's like no lighting, but the rest, it puts you in the movie.

It fails a bit in the end, it really shows that they have put something in their faces.The director, who liked his fans, I personally, I do not like, I do not like the way he tells things. Having to do innumerable shots in a sequence, because he knows that it is boring, and he tries to give life and rhythm to the film based on montage, but it is not clear.

57,MrDHWong,Moves along at a snail's pace for an extended amount of time for something that most audiences will fail to understand in the long run,5,3 December 2020,"""I'm Thinking Of Ending Things"" is a psychological thriller film written and directed by Charlie Kaufman (""Synecdoche, New York"", ""Anomalisa""), based on the novel of the same name by Iain Reid. Starring Jesse Plemons and Jessie Buckley, it moves along at a snail's pace for an extended amount of time for something that most audiences will fail to understand in the long run.On a cold winter's night, a young woman (Jessie Buckley) travels by car with her boyfriend Jake (Jesse Plemons) to meet his parents at their home on a farm. Along the way, the two of them recite poetry to one another, causing the young woman to internally question the type of person Jake really is. After arriving at the farmhouse, the young woman begins to contemplate if she and Jake are truly right for one another and whether or not she should break up with him.I am quite familiar with the works of Charlie Kaufman, who is responsible for writing the screenplays for films such as ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", the latter of which being one of my all-time favourite romance films. Each of them had their fair share of confusing oddities and bizarre quirks to help set themselves apart from the rest of the recycled and rebooted movies that Hollywood tends release in this day and age. Kaufman's latest offering ""I'm Thinking Of Ending Things"" takes all of those aforementioned oddities and draws them out into one of the most tedious films of the year. Constant back and forths between the main characters simply weren't all that engaging as they quote poems and lines from stage musicals that only a select few people would be able to fully understand. It felt punishing to be unfamiliar with the source material being quoted as it alienated me from the story and made scenes that were already long and drawn feel even more so. I haven't read the novel from which it was based on so I can only assume this would have worked better on paper, but on screen it was such a slog to sit through.Even after letting most of it sink in, I am still confused as to what writer/director Charlie Kaufman was attempting to say with this film. ""Being John Malkovich"" was an amusing critique on celebrity culture and that fantasy of living out the lives of someone famous whereas ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" was an examination of love and compatibility. With this film, I simply have no idea of what to make of what I just watched. I suppose Kaufman intends this to be study of what time can do to a relationship and how much strain it can put on individuals who try to make it work but that's only after playing back certain scenes in my head to get some sense out of them. This ambiguity was probably intentional but if that's the case, I don't think he was very successful in making it understandable to all audiences. What I did admire was some of Kaufman's creative decisions regarding cinematography. Certain driving scenes and hallucinations reminded me of the works of David Lynch, where the viewer is frequently questioning what is real or not. Unfortunately, most of this is saved for the end and is too short lived to leave any major impression.Another thing that was actually quite good was the acting. As tedious as most of the scenes were between them, I did think that both Jesse Plemons and Jessie Buckley were convincing as this couple who each have something intellectual to say to one another. Despite many of the references being lost on me, I did find it somewhat interesting examining their introspective natures and this at least prevented the film from becoming a complete bore. It's just a shame all of this led to a pretty underwhelming conclusion that only made me feel as though I have wasted my time, rather than left with something clever to ponder upon.Though I wouldn't call it a bad film per se, ""I'm Thinking Of Ending Things"" instead feels more like a miss from a streak of hits by an otherwise acclaimed filmmaker. After reading and doing some research online, I have gained a slightly better understanding of the film enough for me to not consider it a total failure. However, if I need to look things up on the internet just to comprehend the basic premise and message of a movie, then that just ruins the entertainment value for me. I think we all deserve better than that.I rate it 5/10",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
58,Alexander_Blanchett,Expect the Unexpected,9,4 September 2020,"Another mind f'ck movie that came out within just a few weeks. First ""Tenet"" and now on an even higher extreme this one... and it is truely great. The film seems like a simple story about a fresh relationship that doesnt seem to work that well, however its also a Charlie Kaufman film so you cant expect anything linear. And it's not. It's far from that. In fact there are so many bizzare moments and the film is loaded with metaphors, symbols and poetry. And the great thing is ... in the end it all makes sense, at least if you are willing to let yourself soak into it. Its rarely that a film isn't bizarre just for the sake of being bizarre. It kind of reminds me on ""Mulholland Dr."" when nothing made sense on the first viewing but once you really interpret what's going to happen all of its weirdness makes perfectly sense. And it is the same in the case of ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"". I am not saying too much but, yes if you give it a non-linear look you will see that all of it makes sense and the essence is fantastic and original. It is a film about aging, looking at your life and loneliness.
The acting is fantastic. Jessie Buckley is brilliant. A fantastic newcomer that makes me hungry for much more. She really nailed the role and gave her character so many different facettes which was needed for the course of the story ... and she plays it off magnifically. Even the great Jesse Plemons often looks a bit colorless next to her, even though he has some fantastic moments too. Especially when he tries to build up a connection to Buckley's character. There are supporting roles by Toni Collette who bizzarily overacts her role, but again let it happen, don't complain, it is essential she does it, even if it seems annyoing at first. Same goes to David Thewlis on a lower extend.
The cinematography is fantastic, the way Charlie Kaufman tells the stroy through his screenplay but even moreso through his direction is unique and creates such a fantastic atmosphere, that even during rather""Slow"" scenes when there is just one location and a lot of ""Philosophical"" talk, he really builds up a certain tense and holds that throughout the whole film.
One of the best films of 2020 so far.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
59,bshaef,Note to Myself,5,5 September 2020,"Never watch anything written by Charlie Kaufman. He writes for himself and not his audience. A crashing bore. Anyone who says this is a thought provoking film is nertz. I call it a waste of talent of three of the best actors in the biz, Plemons. Thewlis and the woman who played his wife. I can't remember her name right now because I'm still in a near catatonic state from watching this.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
60,cliftonofun,"Classic Kaufman: confusing, quirky, and powerful",8,21 August 2021,"When a Charlie Kaufman film feels even more bizarre, intellectual, and creepy than usual, that says something. Nonetheless, I was entranced by the first half of this movie. This story was not quirky for the sake of quirkiness - I could sense that the trippy moments were leading someplace, and every haunting image, bread crumb, or confusing conversation served to increase my sense of intrigue. Unfortunately, the last half dragged a bit, and I'm not 100% sure the payoff was worth it as a result. Still, the Kaufman spark was there. Higher highs, lower lows, and overall experience that somehow leaves you both scratching your head and feeling all the feels.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
61,elicopperman,Profound Contemplation of Suicide,8,26 September 2020,"Charlie Kaufman is one of the most celebrated screenwriters of the modern era, but he's also one of the unluckiest filmmakers as of late. As highly imaginative and profound and his works can be, his attempts at directing have proven to be unsuccessful critical darlings like the controversial Synecdoche, New York and the modern sleeper hit Anomalisa. The mere fact that he was able to make a film adaptation of Iain Reid's book I'm Thinking of Ending Things is a miracle within itself, although it does help when you have Netflix backing you up. As a complex surreal take on romantic human condition, there's a lot of unpack here.The film's bare bones synopsis involves a young woman traveling with her boyfriend to meet his parents in their secluded farm. The best way to describe this film is a philosophical interpretation of a psychological thriller and a horror story, as many of its themes lay within an almost dreamlike symbolism. What would seem like a simple premise on the surface has far more layers sprinkled throughout, mainly within Kaufman's persistence on exploring isolation in the human condition. The way the film presents the couple in a farmhouse on a terrible night ends up feeling like a David Lynch film, as it juxtaposes back and forth between reality and a dreamlike version of it, as if the idea of hope and happiness is more of an illusion than anything. These confusions of whether what is going on in the movie is literal or interpretive keep the momentum going from its structure alone, as if the viewers are supposed to keep guessing as opposed to getting general answers. Even the word ""ending"" in the title could imply anything: death, divorce, giving up on a dream, so one can ponder without feeling overwhelmed.Creatively, the film knows how to tighten any scene with a 4:3 aspect ratio for levels of anxiety common in the car rides to the boyfriend's parent's place. In addition to mixing in sounds of wind around the conversations, the claustrophobic environment around the couple is intentionally off-putting from the start. Speaking of the couple, Jessie Buckley and Jesse Plemmons really give their all as the young woman and her boyfriend Jake, as they're able to make even the smallest interactions relatable that give other performers a run for their money in cheap methods of anxiety. With all the different introspections within Jake's own mindset, the film becomes far intriguing from a characteristic breakdown than most films out there. Given how the film goes into how time can affect the decisions you make in your life, the mere confusing and sporadic versions of all these characters end up as mirages of what could have been had the main characters gone certain routes. Whether or not you see the movie as a character ""literally"" ending things, it's all up to what you perceive.It's a shame that Charlie Kaufman has barely gotten any of his projects funded in recent years, because works like I'm Thinking of Ending Things really know how to challenge their viewers. Contemplations of depression, loneliness and suicide can often resonate with an audience more when they're wrapped around in surreal metaphors that are found outside of mainstream cinema. If you're in for a film that doesn't hold your hand and allows you to interpret itself however you wish, then it's definitely up your alley. It may leave you questioning a lot of things, but it will never lose your interest.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

63,ronakkotian,It's a lot to take in...,9,5 September 2020,"Charlie Kaufman is an absolute genius. Throughout the summer I saw every single one of his films in preparation for I'm Thinking of Ending Things and I honestly don't know what to think of it.With I'm Thinking of Ending Things, Kaufman presents us with his most complex film yet in my opinion. This film is very strange. So many weird events and a lot of surreal imagery is present within this movie. One watch is simply not enough. If you're expecting this to be a horror/thriller film then you will be disappointed. Kaufman has left a lot up to interpretation and has included poetic scenes that will certainly confuse you the first time you see it. This is a very dialogue heavy film with scenes that go on for like 30 minutes where characters just talk. Many people may find it incredibly boring but I personally loved every single bit of it. Kaufman is a very good writer and there is much to discover within the dialogue upon multiple viewings. After it finished, I just sat there as the credits rolled thinking about this film's themes and overall story. I love movies that make you think as those are the movies that stay in my mind longer. I'm Thinking of Ending Things is one of those movies. It's a film that left me very confused but intrigued and fascinated at the same time. It's a puzzle I cannot wait to solve.The performances are absolutely incredible. I've never been exposed to Jessie Buckley but now I want to see more of her work. Jesse Plemons does a fantastic job and, in the supporting roles, Toni Collette and David Thewlis are mesmerising. I honestly think all four should receive an Oscar nomination. The cinematography is really beautiful and the 1.33:1 aspect ratio creates this perfect claustrophobic feeling as this snow storm takes place throughout the majority of the movie.I'm Thinking of Ending Things can be very baffling to a lot of people. I don't even understand most of it but I cannot stop thinking about it. Charlie Kaufman has delivered yet another thought-provoking film that be watched and analysed his fans and film lovers for years to come. As of right now I really like it but upon multiple viewings I may consider it to be a masterpiece.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

This movie is so crazy and mind bending. The moment after the end credits roll, you'll think or say what the heck was that. But thinking about it and unraveling all those pieces in your mind, you'll get the whole picture. I was content the whole picture. The movie has a stellar cast who was at their best, a beautiful cinematography, and good direction. I felt really bored at some times but in the end, it was worth it.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
65,andrewroy-04316,"A fascinating, dense psychological study and my favorite of Kaufman's work",8,12 September 2020,"I've been more mixed on Kaufman than most, especially Synecdoche, New York, so I was a little nervous coming into this one. I had nothing to worry about. I'm Thinking of Ending Things does explore some of the same existential questions and self-doubts of a character and their blending of fantasy and reality that Kaufman explored in several of his earlier films, including Synecdoche. However, ITOET was a much more complete and human story. Where Synecdoche and many of Kaufman's films go into nihilism or don't have the same depth of psychological character consideration, here the themes are thought provoking and character driven. You can tell something crazy is going on from early in the movie, and after a bit of time in the farmhouse it becomes fairly clear that Lucy and Jake are the same person. This is definitely a movie with tons of ambiguity and complexity to its plot, and my interpretation will surely be different than others.What seems clear is that Jake is the janitor and that he is fantasizing about his younger self bringing a girl home to his parents. None of the events in the farmhouse are really happening; they're all in his head. Where theories start to diverge is in what inspires Lucy in his mind. I think it is a combination of several factors that come together in a less than coherent, dreamlike way. Obviously part of Lucy is an idealized girlfriend (as Jake mentions in a reference in the car at the start of the movie), but I also firmly believe that she is a representation of his younger subconscious. The big arrow pointing to this is when she sees the picture on the wall and says she thought that was her, but we also see that the poem she ""wrote"" was in his childhood room and the paintings she painted were actually painted by him as a child. Jake talks about how youth is so hopeful and how he sees younger being better, which also lines up with his idealizing of Lucy. Lucy is a bit more impulsive than Jake is as well. Jake wants to hide his disappointing reality from Lucy, most clearly manifested in keeping her away from the basement to see his janitor uniform. What's really interesting about Jake's fantasy is how it's not all that cheery. The entire trip, Lucy is on the verge of breaking up with him, and the dinner with his parents is awkward to say the least. The awkwardness with his parents shows his conflicting emotions in being embarrassed by them and seeing himself as better and more successful than them, but also in not having many real friends and having them as the only true people in his life who cared for him. Lucy thinking of ending things is clearly a part of his subconscious ready for him to die in real life, which is what we see happen at the end of the film. It's a fantastic exploration into the psychology of an isolated, lonely man who worked hard and wanted more for himself but ended up watching time pass him by. The hints dropped of how he'd see kids in the high school grow up was well done. The A Beautiful Mind ending scene (which we see a copy of in his childhood room) points to the sad contrast between Jake's fantasy and desires for himself and reality. It's also a film about stories and fantasy more generally - Jake loves trivia and consuming media, and ultimately for better or worse it seemed that stories kept him going. Maybe if he was less invested in those individual hobbies he would have been happier and made more friends, but on the flip side it's good that he had something he was proud of and confident in. The road trip was one final story he told himself before he left for good.I find the story to be extremely compelling and reasonable, and the technical elements are the icing on the cake. Both Buckley and Plemmons are really fantastic, and the cinematography and editing is amazing. The eerie uncertainty of what's going on during the farmhouse scenes and the awkwardness of dinner were perfectly conveyed through the camera. I'm not sure what worked so well for me here that didn't as much in Kaufman's previous works, but this is a fantastic movie and my favorite of any of his films.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

And that is the only reason I gave it a rating of 5 stars.Visually interesting but shot in 4:3 format which does nothing at all for the film, indicating that the Director thinks far too much of his interpretation of the story by Iain Reid.It's not surprising considering Charlie Kaufman list of credits which demonstrate his interpretations are poor attempts at producing 'art' in the form of film (rather than cinema).Overall, this is just another attempt to make something that pretends to be art by creating obscure and pretty much meaningless associations between events and characters.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

When I watch it again, which I will, probably many times, I'm unlikely to be more certain, but I will notice more details along the way.Charlie Kaufman. What an artist!

70,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Kaufman returns to form for another signature/classic!,9,22 September 2020,"LOL. I can't believe how many people hate this movie. I recently watched Anomalisa for the first time - it was the first Charlie Kaufman movie that I disliked, and I disliked it strongly. Considering that, and the fact that 80% of people seem to despise this movie, I expected that perhaps I would too. But I was way off. This is the Kaufman we have loved, back to his classic form. This has all the expected elements that generally form a signature Kaufman offering: complex philosophical dialogue, tense relationships between characters, heavy surrealism, fear of things ending suddenly (obviously), fear of aging, and of course, LAYERS like no one else can pull off. This definitely reminded me more of his previous masterpiece Synecdoche, New York than any of his other films, but there were pieces of all of them within it.Dialogue really does not get any more brilliant than this. That is by far the film's strongest suit. I won't hesitate to say there are profound concepts discussed at least every five minutes throughout the entire film. Really, it's so smart, written and performed with such a speedy yet organic flow, so self-aware, and so nihilistic, that I was cracking up through pretty much the entire film - I found this movie to be truly hilarious. There are even a couple segments where the characters mock the film itself, within the film (the rant about A Woman Under The Influence, as a clear parallel? amazing!) Sometimes, one insane concept is just beginning to sink in as its being discussed in the most intense manner, when all of a sudden another one is cannoned at you. It's a lot to process, and thus, it can feel very overwhelming. I really think one of the main reasons a lot of people don't like watching this movie is because it is literally OVERLOADING their brains and they can't handle it. It's not CHILL. haha.And the fact that the entire cast did such a phenomenal job of delivering this completely surreal assault of psychological battering is just beyond impressive. Toni Collette and David Thewlis were both hilarious and terrifying with their otherworldly levels of awkwardness - the discomfort their characters create is straight up frightening. Jesse Plemons does his usual thing but it works perfectly in this - hesitant delivery with a subtle cynicism behind it. His character is never quite likable, but always keeps you wondering. But, wow, that song that he actually sings at the end? Incredible! And he's got a great voice! And, lead actress Jessie Buckley, who I was otherwise completely unfamiliar with won me over entirely - she gave a very complex, fully emotive performance - there were so many different emotions constantly shifting and being channelled through her performance it was nuts. If I was on the Oscar staff I'd be nomming her.Most people seem to hate the ending, but, it pretty obviously seems like the most entertaining part to me? Pure surrealism. What's not to love? For the most part, it seemed pretty straightforward - I'm not sure where all the confusion comes in. The only scene that seemed truly open ended was the very last one, but it's also not the type of scene that even feels like it needs a ""definition"".Honestly, this is the best movie I have seen this year. And no, I haven't seen that many movies this year, but, this was still the best one. It's the only movie I've seen this year that I would comfortably call a masterpiece. The Platform and The Invisible Man come close, but this just has way more depth. The only reason I gave it 4.5. stars instead of 5 is because it is a very demanding viewing. It requires a little time, a little patience, and a LOT of willingness to have your brain absolutely flooded with philosophies at one million miles per hour. So, it's not the type of movie that most people will want to watch over and over again, but it's another Kaufman classic! Excellent!",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

73,coreyjdenford,Kaufmanised,8,4 September 2020,"When an adaptation of a thriller novel is released it's always close to the source material, often relying too much on the original works and often this can result in some crucially missed moments, varying from a few paragraphs to even a few pages, thus weakening the overall adaptation. That happens here in I'm Thinking of Ending Things Netflix's latest thriller adapted from Iain Ried's phenomenal best seller of the same name, some of the material is missing here, but thankfully due to director Charlie Kaufman's brilliant mind and wonderful knack for his creativity to put our minds in a spin. He takes us on bonkers journey much like he did in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and 2002s Adaptation, anchored by stunning performances by both Jessie Buckley and Jesse Plemons Kaufman's third directing credit is probably his most unsettling piece yet, as he takes us on a mind-bending thought-provoking often confusing yet thoroughly unique psychological thriller into Buckley's mind as she constantly thinks about her life with her boyfriend, does she want to stay with him? Or does she want to leave? It's constantly putting us in a loop, a loop which we didn't want to end but unfortunately it did. It might not be Kaufman's best film but it certainly is one to remember but then again when it has name attached to it, it's often hard to forget it. And that feeling is always welcome and let's just see what he does next, will it be just as unsettling? Or will it be entirely different?

74,fciocca,The first act was good and I was intrigued. The last hour was overly complicated and I could not understand anything.,4,20 July 2021,"""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" is a strange movie and I was very intrigued for the first hour. I thought that this was some sort of psychological horror with a deeper meaning. I thought that it was the representation of a young girl struggling with depression slowly losing her mind and that was contemplating suicide. I really enjoyed the part in Jack's house, when the girlfriend is seeing his boyfriend's parents in different stages of their life. I thought that there was more and that the film was going to explore sensitive human emotions. What was building up as a promising production, unfortunately in its second hour became extremely pretentious and basically impossible to follow. There are too many references to books, poets and movies that I have never heard of, probably because they are not part of my European culture. Maybe this was a ""fault"" from my side, but let me say that if I need to retrieve a bunch of different works, just to understand what is happening, then the director is not doing a good job. The audience should be able to see your production, whether they read the original book or not.In the second and third act you could clearly see that the director was flexing his personal culture, trying to make feel stupid its audience. Well, I felt just a little bit annoyed. I don't feel unintelligent because I did not watch a certain film. I really love when there is an open interpretation, but you cannot just leave me completely clueless about some fundamental part of the plot. In the end, I did not understand what this thing was about. Very disappointing overall. This is just a presumptuous movie with really nothing to say.

A brief Wikipedia search of Ian Reid's original novel will clear most of your doubts, but I still think that a film should be understandable on its own without relying on outside sources. It's like reading a music score without a key signature, all the information clearly in front of your eyes but without a reference framework to hold them together.The film is full of rich, cerebral dialogues brought to life by the cast's solid performances, but it's never engaging to the point that you feel like watching the whole again to get all details and little clues.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

Director: Charlie Kauffman
Starring: Jesse Plemmons, Jessie Buckley, Mathew Thewlis, Toni Colette etcOverall rating 94/100I'm thinking of ending things is about a new couple where a young woman goes to see her boyfriends parents for the first time, but nothing is as it seems after they keep on ageing the longer she stays. I'm thinking of ending things was fantastic and something I had never seen before, so let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, I loved the narration, use of sound strange tone and great building of tension. I thought the use of Jessie Buckleys character as a narration was excellent, it added depth to her character and made you understand what she was thinking and was done in such an intelligent way It made me connect to her character, the use of sound was also excellent, the repetitive use of certain sounds to build tension was excellent it caught you off guard and made you on edge not knowing where to focus your attention was great. The film had an amazing strange tone and building of tension throughout. The movie had such a strange and uncomfortable tone that never went away, there was always something off with the characters or the places they went to and this slowly built up more and more as the movie progressed making me feel more and more tense and on edge so this was excellently executed.My next few positives would be the cinematography, performances, clever and unique plot as well as the fantastic script. The film's cinematography was fantastic, it largely went for simplicity but it really worked for the movie, with some fantastic set pieces and well explored cinematography and visual metaphors that worked really well with the desired tone for the film. The performances from everybody involved here were absolutely brilliant, everyone went all out and delivered intense, passionate and uncomfortable performances that shone throughout. But my personal key standouts have to be Jessie Buckley and Toni Colette who were both truly fantastic in their roles. I also thought the entire concept of the plot was also really well done and clever, the plot to this movie was so unique I had never seen anything like it before, the whole concept of an imaginary relationship or someone experiencing other people multiple lives was really interesting to me, it was well explored and had a lot of depth to it throughout. I also thought the script was absolutely fantastic, the script for me was the best part of the movie, there was so many clever and insightful things about how society and everyone within it behaves that I was left amazed at the cleverness of the dialogue, it was truly one of the best scripts I have heard and there was just so much attention to detail it was crazy.My only two slight nit picks would be the pacing issues and the unexplained plot points. The movie was a very slow paced movie which only on a few occasions made me lose interest, but for me personally this wasn't to big of an issue, but I can however see it being an issue for other people watching the movie, I also found the plot point of the Janitor fairly confusing and oddly placed for a lot of the movie, due to the uncertainty around his character for most of the movie I just found it strange that it randomly cut to his character with no explanation as to who he was for a large chunk of the movie.MY final few positives would be the chemistry between characters, plot twists and fantastic final act. I thought the chemistry between all the actors was excellent, Jesse Plemmons and Jessie Buckley had excellent chemistry and their back and forth dialogue was excellent and they bounced of each other really well. The plot twists were also excellently executed, they were carefully planned out and I definitely did not see them coming, they advanced the plot excellently, and all the parts of the plot that didn't make sense suddenly did. And finally the final act was fantastic, it was an explosive, shocking and well crafted final act that was so unique and like something I had never seen before adding to the creativity of the overall plot and the amazing direction.Overall, I'm thinking of ending things won't be everyone's cup of tea due to the strange tone and slow pacing. But for me, it was one of the most creative and unique movies I have seen in a while, also helped by the fantastically uncomfortable tone, script and performances that were truly fantastic.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
77,MogwaiMovieReviews,Torturously Self-Indulgent Later Charlie Kaufman,5,6 September 2020,"I still consider myself a Charlie Kaufman fan, which is a little odd since he's barely done anything the past 16 years that I've liked, and yet I regularly check for news of new films he's involved in on the internet. It's been quite a puzzle why there has been so little from him in all that time, just two not very well-realised movies.What I presume is the problem is Kaufman knows he has the reputation of the 'big brain' guy, and the pressure of having to continually surprise the world and surpass the majestic work of his past is weighing heavily on him. I also think it's very clear he's deeply depressed.There's always been a melancholic base to Kaufman's work, but from Synecdoche onwards, it's just run wild and extinguished any joy or delight that he used to be mindful enough to include and sweeten the pill. When Kaufman was still writing scripts for other people to direct, he had to work to make what he was trying to say clear, likeable and entertaining. Starting with Synecdoche, and then even more so with Anomalisa, he no longer had to do that, and so all of us fans of John Malkovich, Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine are paying the price.I've so far not read the book on which ITOET is based, but as I understand it *SPOILERS*, the big reveal is that the whole story is the imagination of the older Jake, now an aged janitor in the school, writing out the various ways his life could have gone, just before he kills himself. But this is not at all clear in the film, as it ends before that happens. And it strikes me we probably wouldn't care any more if it had. This is bad.As to the film's ending, my guess would be the snow piled up on the janitor's car in the end, parked outside the school, is an indication that he's now dead, but what the hell do I know.I do know this: If you need to have read the book to get the movie, the movie is a failure. I'm sorry, I don't make the rules. They were here before I got here. And I know ""I'm Thinking Of Ending Things"" is constructed out of overly-prolonged and exclusively depressing scenes that don't go anywhere or reveal anything interesting enough to warrant their inclusion. Yes, there are a good few flashes of the maker's old intelligence and insight, but they are small and widely spaced apart - really just crumbs of tastiness on a platter of agony.And yet, for all of that, I'm still a fan. Somehow. I guess that's what I'm saying. Maybe the next one will be better.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
78,christian94,Graduation from Writer to Director,9,23 September 2020,"Charlie Kaufman is one of the best and innovative writer in Hollywood for the past 2 decades with landmark films Adaptation, Being John Malkovich, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and Original Screenplay Award-wining Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. He wrote and directed interesting Synecdoche, New York which is a bizarre, artistic, and heartfelt look at the theatre and acting world. He co-directed animated feature Anomalisa with mixed results. His writing is always transformative and inspiring, yet his directing capabilities like many writers turned director sometimes falls short in the subtleties, especially with visual and musical cohesion. Here Kaufman ups his game and creates one of the year's most evocative piece of cinema. His storytelling choices are excellent as a writer but even more so in his directing choices. From the aspect ratio choice to the visuals in the car in the snowstorm, the contrasting conflicted narrator voiceover, the dance sequence, to the use of the surreal, homey and creepy multilevel house as focal point, Kaufman finds many cues and hues to make cinematic gold.I'm Thinking of Ending Things is an art film and makes no comprise about that. This explains the lack of enthusiasm from mainstream audience and I would not personally recommend this film to everyone. It has extensive dialogue about art (literature, cinema, etc), a spoken word poetry and asks the audience to be active and aware which sadly is not something most moviegoers are able or willing to do. There is no easy spoon-feeding here. I am thinking of some of David Lynch films like Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr. or Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut as references which all have many layers of understanding, meaning, intrigue and transcendence and are prime for repeat viewing.You can find many things in I'm Thinking of Ending Things if you look for them. The eerie ice cream stop in the snowstorm is so simple yet incredibly atmospheric. The perception of time, disease and death viewed through the metamorphose of the parents' conditions, the janitor perception of the world and an acceptance speech that may be an acceptance of life and the human condition. What Kaufman did here is go way beyond the writing and create an innerving, self-reflective prism of one's fears and dreams through a collage of exquisite scenes and a buildup of tension, focus and anticipation. Some dark humour is also found, as well as some philosophical, sociological and artistic questioning. There are already varied, insightful interpretations of the true meaning behind the surface viewing of this far-fetched yet simple tale. I believe it will remain a true and rare gem for those who can appreciate this kind of brilliant and troublesome endeavours that will stay with you long after the credit rolls and fade to black.Go enjoy this ""Thinking"" film. I highly recommend Thinking of Ending Things for these reasons if you are willing to dig in with an open (spotless) mind.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

80,bangel3322,Went right over my head...,4,5 September 2020,"I wanted to score this higher because it's different, and the acting was fantastic, and it had some great scenes. I had several theories about the direction this film would take, however once I got down to the last half hour, I realised how wrong I'd been, as the last 40 mins or so went to a whole new place and I was completely lost. So I've now read up on what the film is actually about. Kinda has Mulholland Drive vibes, (but I like that film better). It's a great idea, I'm just not sure about the execution. Where it's fantastic for some, it's just far too confusing for others who may appreciate it more if it's a little more simplified. There are ways to tell the exact same story, but make it a little clearer at the end as to what's happened. And for that reason, I can't score higher.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
81,madhukar30,Sole purpose of this Movie !!,2,10 September 2020,"I believe, the purpose of any movie is to either entertain the audience or to educate, sometimes
both. But movies like ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" opens up a third purpose too, which is to ""irritate"" the audience and that too as much as possible. I was attracted to this movie mainly because I loved Charlie Kaufman's works like ""eternal sunshine of a spotless mind"" and ""Being John Malkovich"" and I was severely penalised for it.""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" is just a big, bad, boring and a poor movie, however we put it.
Yes it is asymmetrical, yes it is makes us think a lot, yes it has a physiological element to it, yes it is filled with suspense, yes it is different in every way to the mainstream cinema. But the movie fails to achieve anything meaningful overall, despite the runtime of 134 minutes. I understand that there is fine line between Class and Stupidity, I am afraid it's stupidity all the way for""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"". The only bright spots were Jesse Plemons and Jessie Buckley's acting which was good. Toni Collette was at her usual best in a cameo.Overall, "" I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" definitely has certain interesting moments within, But the final product will definitely bore the viewers to death. I wouldn't recommend this to even my highly annoying neighbour even if Charlie Kaufman puts a gun to my head. 2 stars just for the Physiological element in the story. Thank you Netflix for spoiling my evening.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
82,patriciogl10,"Not a masterpiece, but a good film nonetheless.",6,8 September 2020,"Acclaimed screenwriter Charlie Kaufman is back on the director's chair to provide a polarizing and enigmatical effort to his legion of fans who won't hesitate to call themselves ""cinephiles"" at the slightest chance they get.
Of course, not knowing Charlie Kaufman and his writing style will catch casual viewers off guard when they think they are watching a regular film. It is based on Iain Reid's novel of the same name and its plot seemingly deals with a girl who travels along with her boyfriend to his parents' farm. A great deal of the film occurs in the car while they are driving through a blizzard, in which they have long conversations and we also hear the girl's inner thoughts. As the story unfolds, several hints are subtly placed which will eventually reveal a distorted reality that makes the viewer question what is actually going on on-screen.Before you know it, these hints become aggressively evident, specially when the two finally arrive to Jake's parents' house. After a rather strange introduction, a dinner table scene follows, where it is mentioned that Jake's girlfriend Louise studies quantum physics and that she enjoys painting landscapes as a pastime. The scene shows Jake's discomfort and embarrassment towards his ridiculously joyous mother; and out of the
blue, as his mother goes off-screen and seconds later she returns, her appearance is somewhat slightly deteriorated, oddly enough. More strange
elements are introduced, such as the aging of the parents showing different eras of Jake's life with them, Louise' cellphone ringing and a peculiar voice message, disclosure of camouflaged truths intentionally covered and cryptic encounters at a remote ice cream parlor. All of these details point to underlying meanings and undertones behind the basic plot of the film.In-between scenes of Jake (Jesse Plemons) and Louise (Jessie Buckley), an old janitor is seen performing his duties at a high school, then also on his break while watching an overexaggerated depiction of love statement in a film directed by Robert Zemeckis (which I found a bit insulting). These scenes are in fact occuring in present time, and the big reveal is that all of the scenes involving Jake and his girlfriend are simply a product of this janitor's recollection of his memories and also figments of his imagination. Plain speaking, the janitor IS Jake, a lonely, frustrated person who is thinking of ending things, which at first the audience is led to believe that the phrase means that Louise wants to break up with Jake, but when the truth comes to light, it takes on a whole new meaning. As a young man, he had prospect and potential but never lived up to his own expectations, he wanted to be a physicist, a painter, a well-read and cultured individual, knowledgeable about the arts; nevertheless, he ended up being a depressed and suicidal underachiever, who wishes that his life could have been different, with his ideal woman by his side and accomplishing the highest personal and professional honor as depicted in the final scene.Charlie Kaufman does a fairly considerable job behind the camera, slowly and steadily luring us into the surreal recollections of Jake's mind. Once you figure out what is real and what is the meaning behind non-reality events, it is obviously easier to keep track of everything that's going on.
While the narrative is certainly clever, let us not fall into the fallacy of thinking that because a film uses surrealism, hidden meanings or obscure literate quotes recited by heart doesn't mean that it is a masterpiece, or even good for that matter. There's a whole lot of people that seem to be under that absurd misconception. Which is the case for this; it's a fine film, with a good script but rather pretentious and somewhat patronizing at certain passages, especially the car scenes, where for instance Louise gives a grandiloquent review of John Cassavetes' A Woman Under the Influence, which felt pedantic and unrealistic, even if it was a product of fantasy. The dancing scene felt misplaced and quite pointless, and the speech at the end was just too cringeworthy for my taste.Toni Collette is great as always, so is David Thewlis. I didn't care much for Jessie Buckley and Jesse Plemons, but their average performances are
compensated by Kaufman's writing.
If you are a fan of Kaufman's work, you will certainly enjoy his adaptation, but if you are unfamiliar with it, you might want to try first other films he has written like Being John Malkovich, Adaptation or Synecdoche, New York (which he also directed), in order to get a real sense of what he is all about. Despite its flaws and its divisive nature, I'm Thinking of Ending Things inspires debate and critical thinking, and that is always a wonderful thing for a film to sparkle.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

I wondered if it was going to keep going the entire movie and of it we'd just the two of them in the car the whole 2 hours, so I paused and read some reviews, which ultimately made me stop for good.

84,noahgibbobaker,Charlie kaufman solidifies himself as a genius.,9,7 September 2020,"I'm thinking of ending things is written and directed by Charlie Kaufman and was my most anticipated movie of 2020. I love all of Kaufman's previous work and this film is no exception.There are a lot of interpretations about this film and I think I have a good theory about what we are shown.
I believe that Jake is the janitor in the school and everything we see is him reflecting on different parts of his life, we see it through Lucy. These experiences consist of bringing girls to meet his parents, watching his parents fight, seeing his parents raising him, seeing his parents grow old and eventually seeing his parents die, and most prominently, regretting doing nothing with his life in the short time he had. There are many points in the film that suggest that Lucy and Jake are one in the same, they often finish each other's sentences and they both think they are the person in a picture hung on the wall.Lucy is called different names throughout the film. She is called Louisa, Lucia and Ames. I think these are people Jake had interactions with in the past but, again we are seeing this through the perspective on Lucy. When we hear Lucy's thoughts, most of them about Jake, this is what Jake is realising about himself as he looks back at his life and more importantly, looks back on himself.In reality Jake is a high school janitor, he is very unhappy and has a lot of time to think. A lot of time to regret. Jake wanted to do something with his life before he died, like star in a musical. He marvels at the girls dancing in the musical. He even imagines a younger version of himself dancing to ""dream ballet"" from oklahoma!, the musical, a musical he loves and mentions many times. I want to mention how fantastic this ballet sequence is, the choreography along with the perfectly fitting song and the costume and set design is just brilliant and it's a masterclass in visual storytelling as well. It shows Jake going through various events and settings until he eventually dies having accomplished nothing. There is another scene, closer to the end, where Jake imagines himself in a musical. This time he is the star in front of a huge crowd of people, everyone loves it, but again at the end he grows old, then dies. No matter what you do with your life, in the end you will die.Technically I'm thinking of ending things is brilliant. The cinematography is amazing no matter what way you look at it. The long takes are very impressive, the scenes in the car are shot fantastically well and the shot clips during the montage give all the information needed in a very short amount of time. This is also due to the editing which was great, every scene is presented in a beautiful way, yet I still feel extremely uneasy until the credits roll. I mentioned the set design and costume design before but the overall production design is just so good. One of the couple issues I have is that during one scene while Jake is cleaning a hallway the score feels a little bit cartoonish, other than this moment I think the score was absolutely great.I mentioned I have a couple of issues, both are very minor problems. During the scenes in the car shot from outside the windscreen of the car it is very apparent the car is not moving. That and the slightly cartoonish score are the only queries I had. I can definitely see myself bringing I'm thinking of ending things up to a perfect rating upon inevitable rewatches.I'm thinking of ending things is a phenomenal film that everyone must watch. This film just further solidifies Charlie Kaufman as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

86,pranayjalvi,"Extremely slow, yet it is enough to grab the attention",6,4 September 2020,"I'm Thinking of Ending Things by Charlie Kauffman (Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind, Adaptation, Anomalisa) is a slow burn which takes it time to dissolve into the narrative and disclose what exactly is the plot of the story.At the runtime of 134 minutes, it is a bit tedious and audience might get succumb to boredom due to constant conversations among the characters and a dark but very less background music. Jesse Plumons was good, but the movie could have been better with 20-25 minutes less runtime, taking to the conclusion at a bit pace than what it took.I'm Thinking of Ending Things is a slow burn, but it might grab your attention and you may stick to the very end of it.

87,tccandler,Abstract enough for anyone to claim anything...,4,5 September 2020,"Charlie Kaufman is so odd that his films become very hit or miss. Sometimes he hits and misses in the same film. In this absurdist tale, there are stretches of fascinating dialogue performed masterfully by the entire cast. However, the overall abstraction becomes so manic and personal that only its creator, Kaufman himself, could make any sense of it. In classic form, he leaves it so vague that some rabid fans will claim genius where there is none.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
88,TheCorniestLemur,"Okay, NOW I get it",10,9 September 2020,"Okay I think I kind of love this now.
This is absolutely a film that requires you to watch it at least twice to comprehend it, which I didn't feel was necessary for Anomalisa or Eternal Sunshine, but watching it knowing what is going to happen (and maybe reading up a bit if you're stupid like me) will make every little bit of symbolism, character traits, and general weirdness so much more meaningful for you.
I won't spoil anything, but I think this is mostly a film about regret, and how it manifests itself in a damaged memory.
Make of that what you will.
I really can't talk about the story without spoilers, so I won't, but I think it's brilliant. There you go.
Everything else I mentioned in my other review still stands - the performances are amazing, the tone is constantly shifting but never jumbled, and it looks utterly beautiful. I'm even thinking I didn't give the cinematography in the car scenes enough credit now.
So yes this is now a wholehearted recommendation, I'm not pissing around anymore, give Charlie the support he never got with theatrical releases and maybe we'll get more of these.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
89,youngcollind,"Symbolic and abstract, but not devoid of meaning",9,12 May 2021,"As a long time Charlie Kaufman fan, it's interesting to see how his movies have taken the turn from being quirky to being full blown riddles. The plot is non-linear and confusing, but not in the David Lynch sense where you just need to enjoy the chaos without trying to connect the dots. I'll admit it took a couple YouTube videos to explain some things after the fact, but I will attest that the dots do inevitably connect. It is slightly to the detriment of the film that the story doesn't simply reveal itself on first viewing, but there are still plenty of other enjoyable qualities. Kaufman's typical bleak worldview and dark sense of humour are again on full display, with a tangible feeling of grief and regret hanging over the entire film. There are some intelligent musings on aging and some delightfully strange surreal sequences peppered throughout as well.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
90,TheVictoriousV,I've written about it and I still don't know what to say,10,5 September 2020,"Charlie Kaufman knows how to translate the most purely human concerns and anxieties - often to do with perception, love, age, and just life itself - into something unthinkable, where each minute filmmaking choice (no matter how dreamlike) accentuates the characterizations and themes. His solo run as a director remains promising, and I'm Thinking of Ending Things possibly surpasses even Anomalisa.Kaufman always seems to state what we're all secretly thinking - whether he asks us to piece together the literal series of events (à la Chris Nolan but with more focus on the humans and their worries, like if the dreams in Inception, while still making us ponder the nature of dreams, also better explored the characters' struggles), or decipher the meaning behind his surrealism, or deduce how many layers of meta he's on. More exactly, he puts into words (and images) the thoughts we don't want to admit we're having; more so the older we get.And even as we do admit these thoughts, we may tell ourselves more lies, falling back on ideas like hope and connection - ultimately ideas that we, the species, invented to make sense of things (sometimes after the fact). But does that mean it's meaningless?To boot, Kaufman knows how to make it riveting to watch, through wickedly original, dreamlike, and in this case old-fashioned presentation (the film has a tight aspect ratio and many sequences feel Bergman-esque while others are truly Lynchian). Here he's also helped by stellar-yet-grounded leading performances from Jessie Buckley and Jesse Plemons as one of those couples that stick together because it's easier that way.Their story starts out cutely awkward, moves into a cringe-comedy family meeting, and winds up deeply unsettling as reality (?) and fantasy start to blur until the latter swallows what's left of them. As nightmarish and increasingly ""off"" as it feels, it tells of the way things may derail if two people who don't love each other continue to tell themselves they do; that they're on the right path, if that's even a thing that exists. Can a wrong path be made right? If it is a lie to think so, does that matter?Also great are David Thewlis and Toni Collette as the parents of Plemons' character, whose relatably awkward demeanor hides something sinister. Thewlis has worked with Kaufman before and might be familiar to common viewers as Remus Lupin. Collette has a substantive career but is known to young cineasts for her role in Hereditary - dismissed as ""just making faces"" when it became popular enough to be cool to hate, as though emotive faces are an inherently unnatural occurrence that ruins an already emotionally convincing performance. As for The Janitor, the animated suid, and the eerie Tulsey Town employees, I'm not sure what to tell you.I can tell you how else Kaufman succeeds, I suppose, because the technical aspects make it all the better. The production design is purposeful and often eerie, with sets and locations that shouldn't exist. What he does with sound and music is also effective; there are no doubt some highly deliberate soundtrack choices that you will only appreciate upon the umptieth rewatch. Some of the aging makeup is unconvincing but you'll find that there's a reason.I have now written about I'm Thinking of Ending Things the way I usually do with movies, and yet I still have no idea what to say about it. I feel like I've only started, not sure there's anywhere to end.And to be frank, if I were to write about this film again and again until I properly understand it, I think there is only one thing I can say that will do it justice: see it. I can't stress those two words enough. See it. Whether I'm speechless or can't for the life of me stop, you'll understand me perfectly if you see it. I don't need the words. Movies like this are why I love movies; it may even be why we invented movies, or why we think that's why we did.There I go again. Where was I? Oh right! See it.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
91,jackgdemoss,"The writer dropped the ball, but the direction and ambience were still top notch",7,8 September 2020,"I am all for having a complicated enough plot that a bit of googling is in order so that the viewer may fully wrap his/her head around the narrative. That is NOT what is required for this film. An entire explanation is mandatory to read in order to understand what Kaufman was going for here. Instead of using the explanation to fill you in on the details you missed while absorbing the plot, you must use the explanation to fill you in on the plot you missed while absorbing little details.With all of that being said, the film still has top-notch ambience, acting, and conversation. However, I don't see this film reaching many audience members who crave the constant action and plot-driving thrill of recent blockbusters.As bizarre as it may sound, I would suggest that you read an explanation of the film before watching it.

It is difficult to talk about this film without spoiling the story, there are too many elements that can denounce the plot. Kaufman, in my opinion, wanted to show how life is full of ""what if ..."", how our uncertainties and fears can affect what could be a happy and bright future, and how many people conform to the standard and the ""normal"", which often leads to depression and distress. The first part is much more interesting than the second, and the climax is a little disappointing in my opinion. It is visually challenging (but I don't understand the 4: 3 ratio), and with excellent interpretations. Overall, I think that Kaufman has more interesting films, and this one will not be iconic in his career, like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or Anomalisa.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
94,Lewis_Heather787,Its 3/4 of the way to being great !!,8,5 September 2020,"I really don't know where to start with this film to be honest, it is such a peculiar film that really surprised me for the most part however left me with a lot of questions. Before watching it all I saw was the trailer and that was it, didn't read the synopsis or anything else, went into it as blind as possible which helped a lot.For the most part this film was extremely entertaining. The cast was superb across the board, Jessie Buckley, Jesse Plemons, Toni Collette and David Thewlis were all absolutely mesmerising on screen. Their performances alone are a reason to watch this film because they are insanely good, especially the scenes at the dinner table, wow!!! The directing by Charlie Kaufman was really really fascinating, using a wide array of shots and camera movements really kept the film feeling fresh. Got to the love the framing of the film to. The story for the most part although on the surface sounds boring and basic, its anything but boring or basic..........this film gets bonkers !!! I mean completely insanely weird, bizarre and really really uncomfortable at times....for all the right reasons. It has shades of ""Twin Peaks"", ""The Shining"" and a bit of ""Misery"" as well to it, one of the most suspenseful and unnerving films I've seen in a while.So you could more or less say that the film is great?? However for me not quite I'd say its 3/4 of the way there, although I do think its good enough for an 8 out of 10 due to all fantastically unique elements to the film. The last 10 to 20 mins of the film, completely lose me if I'm being honest, don't get me wrong I love films with ambiguity however this film takes it to another level. What happened?? Am I the only one who just has no idea what happened??? Maybe a second viewing will help me to understand it better??Overall though definitely something that I would recommend due to its truly uniqueness and some phenomenal acting and great directing, it just maybe goes on a bit too long for its own good. 80% out of 100 although I'd say thats a soft 8 , that ending really let me down because I was hoping for something to be at least partially resoled or explained and we got none of it..........well I didn't haha.

I've never read the book. I don't read a lot. This is a Netflix film and it's 2021...mostly no one will have read the book.... that's what makes this such a daring giving from Kaufman. The masses will not know what they are watching but if you are deeply intellectual then you just may get the just.This movie reminds me of ""Mother!"" Yet no where near as good. I love Toni Collette and she was great in this. The acting truly is very good. The first half of this movie seems quite unnerving and it sort of tricks the viewer into thinking they are watching a haunting drama or even the build up to a creepy horror type film. Truth is, Kaufman is confused on which genre he was going for. Creepy interactions and slick black dualogue gives way to beyond confusing randomness. I really really liked the build up. The conversation about the basement was very tense and the dinner table scene and the ice cream shop scene was also very creepy.You can get the point that Jake is the sad and lonely janitor and you can almost sense this from the start. There is too little said here yet too much shown. I wish this film had a moment of violence regardless what the dumb book has in it. There must've been some drudge from the book that could have been translated to violence in the slightest.Regardless this IS my type of movie and I dug it slightly more than I didnt. I'd recommend it just for the first half alone. The conversations stand out from other films. Let's see Kaufman do horror now that we see he can do utter creepiness.******update: watched it for the second time lastnight and I enjoyed it much more. I love these types of haunting dramas.

It's just stupid. Art for arts sake, no point. Really very very bad. The last 30-45 min ruins the entire experience. It's not even a thriller.

Clearly inspired by Waiting for Godot (by the way i recommend 1961 tv play ver. but this one took from gloomier ver). It is about time and the fact that we all just waiting for a better day. while moving towards death. Thank God its a not a remake, but an original art piece. Core goal was representing existential paradox (that i mentioned above) through young couple seeing the upcoming decades through old parents. tons of detail, vision and simple observations retold for us when others would not bother. The movie tries to show how the story of ones life blends into a sentimental mess of random TV and life events. When you have nothing, what you have left with is memories and fantasy. It's so weird to show how time can blend and confuse things. How even ones life highest honor just a grotesque self-petting charade.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

104,Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,Needlessly bizarre,6,11 September 2020,"Sure - after reading the helpful review on imdb that explains the plot, some of the film makes sense. And if you have read the book, Kaufman's surreal approach may be somewhat interesting. If you haven't, this is just a fevre dream that goes nowhere, and is clearly trying very hard to be intentionally incomprehensible. The acting is very good, but that's where the positives end.Important note: this is not like watching David Lynch at his most weird, where the paranoia is genuine and tongue-in-cheek and the search for meaning a lost cause, but more like a deliberate attempt to confuse the viewer, by withholding information and concealing (WHY) a story that is actually there.

Personally I had many issues with it, such as confusing the viewer TOO much and dragging on scenes for way too long. Might have been on purpose but too much for me! Why is film secretly about Jake and we think the girl is the main character most of the film? Why are they in cars talking for AGES with 4728 different camera angles (any angle they did NOT use?)? Just some examples that got me annoyed, even though I really am a sucker for challenging films.I personally do not like the (for me unsatisfactory) ending, but please, please make up your own mind!

Almost every aspect of this film is perfect but I need to understand the film more before I can give it a 10/10 but I could see myself giving this film that score in the future. All of the performances here are excellent with Jesse Plemons and Toni Collete steaming every scene they are in. Jessie Buckley and David Thewlis both do an amazing job also. Each of their characters are well developed and interesting to watch. They all have excellent chemistry with each other and they work incredibly well for what I think this film is going for. The writing here is amazing. Charlie Kaufman has always been an incredibly talented screenwriter and he shows off that talent again here along with his excellent directing abilities. The script is so layered and deep that it's insane. It takes in all of these ideas of regret, memories, life, and love and mixes them together perfectly if maybe a little too complicated. The cinematography is excellent as well along with the limited musical score. Both add a lot to this film and make it feel claustrophobic and scary. When I say scary, I don't mean jump scare scary. I mean that the ideas and how they are presented on screen is scary in itself. The editing could feel awkward to some but it's intentional and adds to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the film. If you are in the mood for a dark film or like Charlie Kaufman, then go check this film out as soon as you can.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

There is so much to pick up on purely based on the inner dialogue of the main character. It's best if one watches this film without really knowing much about it so, if you're reading this and haven't watched it yet, don't read anything else or even watch the trailer, just go experience this incredible, psychological and emotional movie for yourself. I will admit that I wasn't too fond of Kaufman's script for Synecdoche, New York, but this movie blew me away. Now I really want to read the novel as well.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

Charlie Kaufman's I'm Thinking of Ending Things is very much the marmite film of the year, some people will revel in trying to work it out while others will flat out hate it for that very reason. One thing for sure though is that Jessie Buckley continues her impressive rise to stardom with another fine performance alongside the impressive ensemble of Plemons, Collette and Thewlis.

Then they drift into what they think the future might be like. And they drift all over the place into apparently meaninglessness. There might be meaning in their mind, but it means nothing much to you. The story gets completely blurred with all the rambling, the associations and digressions and the drifting away until you're not sure if there ever was a story the person intended to tell you at all, and you wonder whether the person hasn't lost his mind. You are sure, of course, that the person must be some kind of genius, a great artist, a magically talented manipulator of narrative tropes and a wonderful disrupter of conventions and expectations.

116,haydenluz,I'm Thinking of Ending Things,9,8 September 2020,"I'm Thinking of Ending Things, directed by Charlie Kaufman, is a beautiful piece of art! Charlie Kaufman has this amazing sense of direction, crafting so many elegant shots, while utilizing the gorgeous cinematography, and well constructed production, to his advantage. With the darker, and dreary color pallet they went for, it really helped enhance the glum and sorrowful tone, keeping the mystery and tension present at all time. Charlie Kaufman wrote a beautiful script, with so many great layers, but he also did such an amazing job telling the story through creative imagery, and metaphors.This film wasn't necessarily made for everyone, because it calls for a lot of brain power, and ability to read in between the lines, but if you're able to do that, this film has a lot to offer! The narrative itself was fairly simple, but all of these amazing layers about life, death, and love, helped elevate each sequence to extreme heights! The film starts a little slow, which is where most of the films issues lie, but it picks up at the halfway point, and takes great twists and turns. The films pace was pretty solid overall, other than maybe the first twenty minutes or so, but there was no plot gaps, or filler; everything folded into the narrative nicely.The screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, was very intelligent, having so many intriguing pieces of dialogue, that felt so natural. He kept a steady emotional key throughout the narrative, that fit really well with the tone they were going for. This film relied a lot on it's dialogue, so it's very easy for a two hour and fourteen minute film to get boring, but Kaufman kept me engaged at all times, with his beautiful writting style. One small nitpick I have with the script; it can be a bit full of itself at times. There are a lot of great messages and philosophies, but it can feel a bit forced, and shoved down your throat, at times.The acting was just phenomenal - you forget that they're even acting! There is amazing chemistry with all four cast members, with everyone bringing their absolute best! Kaufman gave a lot of great characterization to everyone, Jesse Plemmons in particular, creating this great bond with the audience. All of the characters were extremely interesting, having great qualities!Overall, I'm Thinking of Ending Things is a terrific film!

118,mbhgkmsgg,What an experience,10,4 November 2020,"This was one of the most bizarre, curious, confusing yet clear, cinematic experiences I have ever had. i'm thinking of ending things was such a weird yet wonderful experience. I had certainly read a few reviews of this film and I went in prepared to be confused and perhaps even unable to understand the film. What I wasn't prepared for, was how impactful this film would end up being to me.Truth be told, I can't stop thinking about this film. I keep thinking about the meaning of the film and whether I got it right or whether there even is one true meaning. I keep thinking about the way the movie was filmed and how it was presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio, making it feel unusually tense and tight. I keep thinking about the spectacular performances. And I keep thinking about how soon I should watch this movie again.I like to think that I understood the movie at least for the most part. Although I'm sure that there is a lot that went completely over my head. Indeed, while I was watching the film, I felt like I was barely understanding any of it. Yet, as soon as the film ended, and I kept on thinking about what I had seen, I started to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Early scenes started to make more sense and interactions that seemed so extremely bizarre became clearer.
However, the more I kept thinking about the film, the clearer it became to me that there is no clear answer to what this movie means. I think, and hope, that its intention is to let everyone draw their own conclusions and meanings from it.I also assume that a lot of people won't be affected by this movie at all. And that's completely fine. Indeed, I was not expecting to have as strong an experience as I did. And to be completely honest, I have no idea why I had such an experience. Something about this movie just captured me from the very beginning and that something still hasn't let go. I have a feeling that I will be thinking about this film for days, if not weeks, to come. Which, may I add, is quite rare.I really don't know how to write about this kind of movie, or more accurately, this kind of experience. I tried to get across some of the feelings that this movie brought up but I don't think that that's something that I will ever be able to do properly. i'm thinking of ending things took me completely by surprise. I felt like it was exactly how I expected it to be, yet it was nothing like it. I will, without a doubt, watch this movie again sooner rather than later. Perhaps then, I will be able to write something more cohesive. But then again, I probably won't.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
119,punisherversion1,A trip through heartbreak and fantasies and lives half lived.,8,12 September 2020,"I'm Thinking of Ending Things
Written and directed by Charlie KaufmanI'm Thinking of Ending Things is the latest film from Charlie Kaufman, the writer of Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Synecdoche, New York. I say this because if you know any of these films then you know the type of movie he makes. This review will be a little difficult to write because I have to skirt around so much. This is a movie that needs to be experienced. I don't just say that because Synecdoche, New York is one of my favorite movies. I say that because a movie like this doesn't come along often.This movie is not for everyone. It really isn't because it asks a lot of its audience. It asks for patience. It is a movie that lives in the clues. It is a movie that lives in the dialogue that a lot of the time will be very stylized. There is a good reason for that.The snow is ever present. The mood is foreboding. The dread is constant throughout. You can never truly put a finger on what is wrong. It seems like a simple enough trip. She is going to meet her boyfriend's parents for the first time. They have only been dating for six weeks. It seems too early for this trip in the relationship. Something seems wrong. You know as an audience member and the characters know something is off as well.I mentioned before how difficult this movie is talk about because much of what
I want to discuss are things that would be spoilers. I would have to discuss what happens at the end and the meaning of the film. This is something that I can not do. I want you to be able to understand where I'm coming from in regards to this movie without me spoiling the bejesus out of things. I don't need to be that person.This is a movie that will ask you to look beyond what you see. Jessie Buckley plays a myriad of versions of this character but the truth behind who she is or who she was is right there from the very beginning. I found her to be captivating. I kept wanting her to flee this insanity despite knowing the impossibility of just such a request.Jesse Plemons plays a man who is keeping so much wrapped inside. You know that there is so much he is not telling you when he really should be. Who he is and who he wants to be are not necessarily the same thing.This is a beautifully trippy film. It is a decent companion piece to Synecdoche, New York. Both of them are relationship films just seen through the dream-like lens. You want to ask questions and please do. This is a movie that calls for questions. The answers are there. I'm not telling those answers here.I give this film a B.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
120,varun-25071997,"Nihilism, Existentialism and Hedonism In 3 Acts",8,4 September 2020,"Like all of Kaufman's work I'm Thinking of Ending Things simply doesn't tell its viewer what's actually happening, it offers open interpretations to each. After the first act, much of the film is ambiguous and dream like. The scenes are long and dialogue heavy throughout the film. Jessie Buckley and Jesse Plemons are exceptional as the film's lead actors but it was the supporting actors David Thewlis and Toni Collette who were at the top of their game.The premise of the movie is about a young woman (Jessie Buckley) who thinks about ending her relationship with her boyfriend Jake (Jesse Plemons). The film walks towards that path for the first hour of the film until Kaufman starts to mess with our brains by exploring age, time and ambition in a way most of us don't see. The movie is set in the midst of a snowstorm giving the creepy mood. The score is so similar to what we hear in horrors and the production design and makeup is top notch. The production design essentially makes is question the timeline of the film.The film from my point of view explores the themes nihilism, essentialism and hedonism in multiple scenes. The ice cream scene in Tulsey Town captures the very nature of hedonism present in humans so beautifully, its the best scene of the film. Jessie Buckley and Jesse Plemons look like they are caught in a debate between existentialism and nihilism throughout the film. Without spoiling the ending, I feel the film shows 2 different ways the life could have ended up for Jake.Jessie Buckley, David Thewlis and Toni Collette are bound to be front runners in the acting category this awards season. Other than that this film could get nominations for its sound editing, soundtrack, cinematography, production design and screenplay. I'm Thinking of Ending Things is one of the few films more suited to a small screen release instead of a theatrical one.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
121,joker-4,Mercurial to grasp; Foggy to discern,7,19 September 2020,"From the inventive, if not neurotic, mind of Charlie Kaufman comes I'm Thinking of Ending Things, his latest work of speculative fiction that keeps the absurdist theater deep in attendance, even during a pandemic. I'm Thinking... is bold, brilliant work to view but mercurial to grasp and foggy to discern. A beautifully shot movie indeed but weird in narrative and, pending point of view, pretentiously lacking in denouement.Of all of Charlie Kaufman's movies, this one is the most Charlie Kaufman-est.Kaufman is better known as a writer. Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind are all intelligent and engaging movies. They are also directed by someone else (two of those by Spike Jonze) and, more importantly, they are also more mainstream acceptable, albeit totally offbeat. Those different directors and external producers no doubt helped focus the Kaufman weirdness. That weirdness is totally at play here and Netflix is Kaufman's Bedlam.Kaufman, aided by cinematographer Lukasz Zal and editor Robert Frazen, shows a tight production with, essentially, three claustrophobic sets: a car, a house, and a school. All familiar elements that Kaufman twists with suburban dread. I'm Thinking... is a fantasy of sorts, a dream of possible lives, sculpted with a Brothers Grimm ire; colored with David Lynch-ian hues.Jake and Lucy (Jesse Plemons and Jessie Buckley) are a new couple on their first road trip through rural Oklahoma to visit Jake's parents (the always-and-equally-fantastic Toni Collette and David Thewlis). Jake is excited to be taking this next step but Lucy is, well, ""thinking of ending things"" with Jake, as her internal monologue constantly repeats.Following a long, snowy drive, coupled with long, run-on dialogue, the farmhouse provides the first glimpse that something is... off, aside from the overly-floral wallpaper. Lucy begins witnessing other moments as Jake's parents flow between their middle-aged selves to older versions to elderly.Reality skews itself through folds and repetitions. Lucy internally realizes that, ""People like to think of themselves as points moving through time. I think it's the opposite. We are stationary and time passes through us.""The oncoming blizzard has Lucy demanding a return to the city. Jake, tragic and unsure, is determined to show her his high school and goes on a detour. As does any remaining realism. Within, Lucy watches her life with Jake unfold in a beautiful dance scene before all crashes down in the head-scratching, time-altering confusion that is Charlie's - or is that Jake's - head.The dialogue is what makes this movie and attempts to hold together a narrative string as the plot ducks and weaves through time. Much of the dialogue is internal to Lucy, which results in competing conversation, internal and external, as well as with the parents over a strange family dinner. Background races to the forefront and vice versa.As the story dissolves, this strange interchange is all that truly makes relevance out of the sometimes incoherent scenes.Jesse Plemons is the proverbial everyman and stutters and stammers all the while as proof; flashing a charming smile when needed. Relative newcomer Jessie Buckley, who was silently strong in HBO's Chernoybl series, plays the perfect counterpoint. She is peculiar. And smart. And lonely. Buckley is great at showing all three.This is a visual experience, not an auditory one. However, the aforementioned dance sequence is as magnificent to hear as is it to witness. The music, borrowed from the musical Oklahoma!, is essential in the retelling, synchronized with the dancers' choreography and becomes that singular moment in the movie where everything is perfect.Make no doubt about it, I'm Thinking of Ending Things is pretentious as hell. Kaufman revels in the weirdness of imagined worlds, teases of dialogue, even animated illusions. This one will no doubt be divisive in years to come. Aficionados will ply worship upon it, while most direct cinema fans will shrug it off. The movie is not without its moments, with the dance number near the finale, one reminiscent of a similarly used feat in the Netflix series Giri/Haji, being a key one. The inconsistency that occurs in between these all-too infrequent moments is what becomes frustrating. The plot is simple but the narrative is overly messy. Patience is most definitely required. Kaufman, however, becomes too clever and concludes with an open ending that is maddeningly disappointing.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
122,emryse,You Probably Won't Enjoy Most of It,8,10 May 2021,"This film is an enigma to me, some parts of it are just a joy to watch, anything at the parents house, but other parts, when they're driving around, are just meh.I don't think anyone can argue that this film is thoroughly confusing and surreal, but it can sometimes get too much. There are long uninterrupted scenes that are just the two leads speaking about books I've never read, movies I've never seen and plays I've never watched. I think this film is has some really strong parts but overall can feel too philosophical. The performances are great though and the cinematography is pretty good as well, this is also probably my favourite film in terms of makeup all of which is outstanding.I think this film will not be enjoyable for the majority of people and I can completely understand why but I'd say that if you think you'll like it you'll probably really enjoy it.

126,IamROCKAS,I'm thinking of reviewing things,9,1 October 2020,"I have no idea what the hell I just watched and why the hell I always fall in love with movies like this. It's the kind of weird and surreal that I like. It's not a total brain scrambler that leaves you with a twist that's out of nowhere and unforseen before it actually happens but it is messing with the mind throughout most of its run with little details and obscure visuals.Everything here is contradictory and, in a way, perfectly planned. Just like the abstract art that came up in a conversation early on, this movie can be interpreted differently from different points of view. What we see throughout the film is an assortment of events that range from strange nightmare-ish like escapades that are just a few steps away from being horrific to surreal imagery and dialogues that leaves you questioning yourself and the movie. Time here becomes unmoored as people are getting younger and older, things are appearing out of nowhere and disappearing without any warning... the general weirdness occurs. It is completely baffling and I have no idea whether it would make more sense upon my second viewing.The dialogue was one of my favorite things here. It's mostly intellectual and loose philosophical rambling but the things like the poem, the discussion about (abstract) art, and the general use of words felt kind of... idyllic. I don't know whether that is because I'm having problems with speaking due to nervousness and a lack of self-confidence and a slight stutter that I possess doesn't help but seeing flawless dialogues as flawless as this has always been a beauty to me. And it's so quotable... I just want a shirt that says ""Other animals live in the present. Humans cannot, so they invented hope."" now.As mentioned before, this movie is just a few steps away from being a psychological horror flick but I still ended up developing a new fear, that I didn't think I'd have. I'm scared of meeting my significant other's parent now... and I'm scared of her meeting mine. The level of awkwardness that took place was beyond imaginable and even slightly reliable as me and my parent are rarely on the same page and I'd just probably end up screaming at one point or another. It's a fear I never knew I had. I'd probably be like ""The easier way out is to say yes"" too and just think about ending things.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

I'm Thinking of Ending Things feels like wandering through a labyrinthian hall of mirrors, each reflection juxtaposed and overlapped into a prismatic portrait of... I'm not even sure. An evening? A relationship? A life? A consciousness? It's disorienting, surreal, barren, and lonely. It's funny too.At one point, our protagonist struggles to articulate how a painting of a landscape can be ""sad."" How a combination of colors and shapes, textures and shadows can evoke an emotion just as potent as a warm smile or a pair of glassy eyes. That's precisely Kafuman's strength. The way he's assembled this film - the framing, pacing, structure, editing, sound - elicits such a particular combination of loneliness, melancholy, and existential dread.

I thought before this is crime thriller, perhaps some dark past, murder mystery, or try to open up cold cases in the small village, etc, but this movie uplifted more psychological meanings in the sense of thriller. The story begins when the main actress accompanied her boyfriend to meet his parents in small village, far away from the city, in the middle of nowhere, and some strange or awkward things happened. At the same time, audience can see the ordinary janitor in the high school just working and working. Later the audience will know the link of these two window-stories. I want to say that the idea behind the story is so deep, about loneliness, regret, and family time. At first, audience perhaps notice there are some scenes to connect the dots of what did really happen and why those seems normal, while the icons of meaning represented by several arts. This is the uniqueness of this cinematography. It looks like ""Mystic River"" or ""Eyes Shut Down"", sometimes past, sometimes present, then future. We can not judge the ending is under the settled circumstances, nor we can say all characters are coincidentally met. That's why we must consider this movie as serious thriller, because it affects audience emotionally how to value the relationships, especially to love and being loved.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

132,rarepeperonis,Inside out for adults,10,13 October 2020,This director makes weird confusing movies all the time it's meant to be rewatched and to think about it after. Kinda Lynchian.See some reviews about it being too confusing and people not getting it and the movie should be clearer. I don't think so. When it finally clicks the movie is even better.My only gripe is some of the woke kinda commentary that happens sometimes and it kinda gets you out of the movie main story. It's not that bad but you know you are hearing the director's view on certain stuff and not the old man views. It's so on the nose sometimes that maybe it's connected to the discussion about how movies implement ideas in your brain.Loved it.

136,Katz5,Being Charlie Kaufman,5,1 November 2020,"There is a line of dialogue in the Charlie Kaufman-written, Spike Jonze-directed ""Adaptation."" where Tilda Swinton asks Nicholas Cage (who plays Kaufman) what it's like to be inside Charlie Kaufman's head. Cage/Kaufman responds that it's nothing she would want to see. And here we are, some 18 years after
'Adaptation.,"" and now we know what he's talking about. This is some movie. And not for people who adored Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which benefited greatly from comedy and the fantastic, slightly surreal touches of Jonze and Michel Gondry (director of Spotless Mind). This work is aimed more at the fans of the Kaufman-directed mind f--k ""Synecdoche, New York,"" which Roger Ebert named the best film of 2008. I felt completely dense after reading Ebert's review. S, NY bored and irritated me to no end, so I guess I didn't ""get it."" This movie is a bit more accessible, but not by much. First off, the title does not refer to what you think it may refer to. It veers off into David Lynch territory many times, especially for the sequence in the farm house with the hero's parents, and the final sequence inside the old high school. And the movie spends a great deal of the time inside a car, where the hero (or villain) of the story played by Jesse Plemons (doing a rather believable impression of Philip Seymour Hoffman throughout the film) drives his girlfriend to and from the aforementioned farm house. The movie takes many detours during its over two-hour running time. It's not a movie to watch if distracted, and in fact in a pre-COVID, pre-streaming world, this film would've gone straight to art houses vs. the multiplex. Viewers may be tempted to turn it off after 20 minutes (I was). But if you can make it through the sequence in the farmhouse, you should stick with the entire movie. You won't see another film like it in a long time. Not sure if that's a glorious endorsement because in the end, I was wondering what the hell I just watched.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

And yet I must admit just when she recited her poem it kinda pulled me in. From that point I jumped on the emotional rollercoaster watching, listening, and guessing throughout. By the time she went into the school and had that brief conversation with the Janitor ... it hit me like a ton of bricks. More like a punch in the gut truth be told. His perspective being seen through a character not himself wasn't something I expected or ever saw coming.It's quite sad but also very unique. Unfortunately, as one gets older we'll all have regrets and reflect on the ""what ifs"" from our past - and it sucks. Too late is an understatement and the rest from there on out can be torturous.

138,HanShotFirstGR,An okay film I just didn't like at all!,6,11 January 2021,"Plot:Full of misgivings, a young woman travels with her new boyfriend to his parents' secluded farm. Upon arriving, she comes to question everything she thought she knew about him, and herself.Analysis:What seperates abstract art from just non-sense smudge? This is a question that you will ask yourself many times in this film. It's undeniable that Kaufman tries to express something, a philosophical or existential idea that comes in a form of a surreal weird story and that's a very good start for a great film. The problem is sometimes it's really hard to have fun and enjoy something like that, he even gives a slightly hint of insult for those who don't admire this kind of work. In the end, everyone will think his work is art, but is it really art just because it's complicated?The major fault of this movie comes with its major pretentiousness, a wave of much more self-praising than it should have. No one can ignore the fact that a deep meaningful movie is more satisfying than a casual simple one, but that doesn't mean complexity equals quality. This movie tries to tell you that it's your fault you don't understand this kind of films but it really isn't, art should be accessible from anyone and it must speak to everyone truly but meaningfully, so this pun wasn't just stupid, it was an annoying moment and a good example of elitism. This film isn't accessible at all, you'll find the solution but does it worth the effort?Continuing with the problems, it's a horribly-paced movie, some scenes are unbearable, the context is very interesting but they feel random and way too long. There are scenes that last over 10 or 12 minutes without anything moving the plot forward and tends to be more annoying than a viewer can handle. Every little quote feels like random thoughts of the creator talking about his ideology, it's not unappealing, it's just something that will make you tired.The whole story has an interesting idea and it could be really good but it gets dragged down by a plot which tries to be too complicated to look more artistic. When complexity is effortless you get a masterpiece like Bergman's Seventh Seal, when complexity is forced you get this one, an elitist's view on an interesting idea. It has a nice plot twist that was cool and satisfying, it helped a lot to have a better idea what was going on and it actually made sense. It has some very good elements that could've been much better if it wasn't such an unfun experience.Direction is pretty nice and differs from other releases of this genre. The combination of great cinematography and nice sequences of camera shots really highlights some very cool elements of this film, giving him a more mysterious, even disturbing at times, theme. All the tryhard feeling of the script wasn't noticable in the way it was directed, so visually it was quite pleasing to watch.It's really a very confusing experience when a film has such a good idea but it's still so annoying and unappealing. It has some really great moments and some moments that I almost left, the highs are really high and the lows are really low, so in general the overall lack of enjoyment overcomes the good side of this film, making this a not so good experience.Conclusion:It's a movie that praises elitism and tries really hard to be complicated, so I kinda hate it for that, but objectively it's well-shot and well-acted, it has a good idea and some intetesting things, I just personally don't like it at all and I could say that if you are someone who wants to have fun or a casual cinema fan, this will be a bad experience for you.Rating: 6.5/10",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

Everyone's performance was outstanding. With that being said, I found many things frustrating and annoying. Why have it viewed in 4:3? Bad choice. To drag the end out and have us Literally sit through a song-and-dance is very Arrogant and egotistical.

141,Criticalstaff,I'm thinking I shouldn't have watched this,4,3 October 2020,"I have a hard time getting this film. Even after the reading the explanation. It is a hard movie to sit through, it is very slow and boring; the whole movie feels like a fever dream.The movie starts somewhat grounded. The plot follows a woman who is invited to her boyfriend's parents' house, in the countryside during bad weather. Yet, from the get-go the movie goes into hardcore avant-garde stuff, as the first sequence is an uninterrupted car journey with the young couple in the car talking to each other. It is a twenty minute long sequence that feels double that, and it is excruciatingly boring. From the start, the dialogue scenes, which are almost all the scenes in this movie, are tense and uncomfortable to sit through. And that is by design, by the way. The characters don't talk to each other in this film, it more like the actors are exchanging lines of dialogue. It gets better at times later on when there are more than two people in the scene, but it is still what most of this film is.Later they arrive at the parents' farm and the movie delves into this creepy/horror tone which kind of makes things a bit more interesting, but it never delivers. The movie uses a lot of visual language and tropes of horror films, but is in no way a horror film. The film never ceases to give the audience a sense of unease and dread, and I am not surely why. Granted the movie acts fully as psychological horror, as after watching it you need to take a shower and hug your loved ones, but then you don't need the jump-scares, the haunted house bit and the dread of the blizzard night.Overall, there are some good things in this movie and I can appreciate the general idea behind it, e.g. the suicidal janitor's story told through his fantasy, but that is utterly buried under the weirdness. Also the way visual language is used is detrimental to the movie. The story and plot are not helped by the cinematography and sets; they are constantly fighting each other, which create another layer you must pierce to get to the meaning of the film. I am still unsure if it is a mistake from the part of the filmmaker, or if it is on purpose as meta-commentary. To be fair the movie left me too mentally exhausted to even care.The film looks like it was badly adapted from a stage play, which is paradoxical when it was in fact adapted from a book. That is why the film feels confusing. You will notice early on that mostly all dialogue feels alien. It feels like it engineered to be marveled at. It does not fonction as a means communication between characters, between humans, it is a tool by which the author, in this case Charlie Kaufman, lays out his worldviews and the themes of the film. The whole film feels like a rebuff of the rule ""show don't tell"", yet at the sale time it expects you to understand the janitor plot only by subtext.
The movie feels like it is constantly winking at the audience for using what it itself purports as these elaborately smart devices. But in truth, its intelligence is mostly unreadable and obscure.Starting this film, I was not familiar with Charlie Kaufman, I only vaguely knew that he was a screenwriter's screenwriter. There is nothing to change my mind here. However, if there is any movie that you could compare this to, it would be Synecdoche, New York which is similar in the way it refuses to tell its story in clear fashion, however that movie was at least visually grandiose.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

This film is rather torture than exciting. Two people sitting in a car, talking endlessly about this and that while driving through a boring countryside.

150,PaxD75,The Director failed,5,7 September 2020,"I came on here to completely trash this film but decided to read some of the top rated reviews with spoilers (""Explanation Post"" by aguti-09325 is a recommended read). After reading a couple of them I finally understood what this film was about.Basically, the director (Charlie Kaufman) failed to properly close out the film and give it the kind of ending the source book did. Instead, Kaufman mangled artistic images that utterly failed to explain what the movie was about. It is a film that builds to a climax and suddenly flatlines (unless you have already read the book).To Kaufman's credit, the first 80% of the film was truly engaging - in a slow-boil kind of way. I take a number of breaks when watching a film at home and found myself wanting to come back to see how the story unfolded.The lead actress, Jessie Buckley, was phenomenal, in an understated way. Jessie Plemons (low-key, a bit creepy)... Toni Collette and David Thewlis admirable in their quirky performances. The imagery, dialogue, tone and general feel of the film kept me truly engaged.When the film finally ended (and I wasn't quite sure it did, in a Sopranos ending kind of way), I was angry. Had I wasted 2+ hours on garbage? Initially, the answer was an emphatic yes. Reading the reviews, changed my mind. Most of the film was very good and the characters... both engaging and watchable.My recommendation is to watch the film without any further insight (spoilers). Afterwards, read the top-rated, spoiler-rich reviews. Or, even better... watch the first 80% of the film, read the spoilers and finish the film off.With a proper ending, I would have easily rated this film an 8. The director had a homerun here but tripped after rounding third, got up, started dancing and never touched home plate.

I enjoy psychological thrillers of all sorts so initially it was right up my alley. The first 3rd showed promise, it felt unique and quirky and I was looking forward to where it was going. Toni Collette as usual, brilliant.Let me also disclose I DID NOT read the book. I don't believe one should have to. I didn't know it was based on a book until I read some reviews.It is not a horrible film, but my main issues with it were:
1. Way too drawn out and in total about 30 minutes too long
2. Disparate styling resulting in a disjointed feel. I don't mind a dance or musical sequence but the animation was completely lost on me. One of the other not both.
3. Wooden acting by female protagonist. Lots of reviewers were praising her performance I was not impressed even when conclusion explained it somewhat. Which brings me to....
4. Zero connection to ANY of the characters. By the end I didn't care if any or all characters met their tragic demise, which is never a good sign.All told I did enjoy some aspects of this film and was curious about what was happening: time travel? Haunting? Mental illness? Anatomy of Marriage? 3/4 way through I stopped caring and prayed for it to end.

Upon arriving, she comes to question everything she thought she knew about him, and herself. (Via IMDb)This might be the highest rating I give for a movie that I did not enjoy AT ALL. After I read some explanations about the movie I kind of loved it more but it was still one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.The movie is so deep and it will make the audience very confused after they watch it, but that ""confusion"" was too much and over the limit in the movie. Sometimes you don't want to confuse the audience too much so the movie won't be boring to them and that's what happened to me in the movie, I got really bored that I couldn't wait for it to end, felt like the movie was 6 hours especially that the movie is very deep and heavy.The film's runtime was the worst thing about it, 2h 14m is A LOT, I think if it was decreased to 1h 45m then it would have been better.Although I didn't enjoy the movie at all, the film's cinematography, sound effects, set design, and custom designs are the ones that made me give the movie a rating of 7/10. The fact that it is a 4:3 frame makes it deeper, scarier, and way better, you will feel scared and confused because that frame is so narrow so it will build a lot of weird feeling inside of you. The film has a few frames that were very great and visually stunning. The different customs of ""The Girlfriend"" were beautiful, especially that one at the very beginning of the film when she was wearing a red coat. The design of the house was incredible. And the sound effects which gave the movie that scary taste, the sound of the wind or snow, the chains, and the windshield wipers were all some amazing details especially that the movie did not have a specific music soundtrack album.The script was well written especially that it was written by the amazing Charlie Kaufman who is one of my favs. screenwriters. The movie had many lines and quotes that were so deep but the dialogues were sometimes very long which made some of them look boring because it's been going for a long time. Not saying that I did not enjoy these monologues, they were just too long.The cast was perfect especially Jessie Buckley, she played her character very well and exactly how it should be played. Toni Collette (Plays The Mother) and David Thewlis (Plays The Father) were incredible especially Toni Collette's weird / scary / loud laugh.""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" was quite a boring / long movie that I expected more from it.

It starting making so little sense and was so off the wall and random in an unentertaining way that it finally reached the point of irritating by about the last half hour. It got so bad, it became godsmackingly boring and hard to pay attention to and I had to stop watching it during like the last 10 minutes because of how out of tune I was.

The film is gloriously beautiful in the way he brings symbolism and metaphor to life. It is gorgeously filmed and very well acted, although the pacing and editing could use a little less ego and a little more attention to flow. Other directors may have made some different choices in presenting those things that were more grounded in reality as opposed to those that were surreal. Instead, the whole thing was presented in such a state of hyperreality that finding the kernels of truth were impossible.The biggest failures come in the stark omissions: Kaufman's refusal to share what question is being referred to in those phone calls where the disembodied voice says ""there is only one question..."" That question is critical and is specifically laid out in the book. It is the entire meaning and motivation. He also fails to ever tie back that question, and the titular phrase, to the only character to whom they actually matter. He also fails to show or explain explicitly what happened to that character in the end, and without that ending, there is no meaning. The film just becomes a very beautiful companion piece to the novel, highlighting some scenes and lending new imagery to them. It is not, in itself, a complete story. It's more of a ""mood.""",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

At first glance, these seem trivial, if not unnecessary. But if you let them work, they say so much about the characters.The entire atmosphere is intense, dense and a hint of unease swings through the room. You notice relatively quickly that something is not right here. It's a pleasantly uncomfortable mood. This is reinforced by the ongoing snowstorm and the 4:3 format. These contribute to the feeling of being locked in.There are scenes that trigger a really oppressive, lonely and cold feeling. With time, you lose track of time. The distinction between reality and dream become blurred. You feel like you're in a fever dream.'I'm thinking of Ending Things' is a horror trip into the psyche. The movie lives from its dialogues and the atmosphere created. The plot and ending leave room for interpretation and make you think.

174,CutUncut2021,Several is anything more than two,7,30 April 2021,"As always, the critical reviews are revealing: maybe those weighing in felt a unpleasant shock at recognising themselves in the two vapid blondes at the ice-cream parlour in the blizzard. (The giant cup of ersatz ice-cream they serve up neatly represents the toxic sugary slop found in every mall across America, which Kaufman tosses into the dumpster.) Ironically, the petty nastiness of these two two dames quite accurately matches the eternally dissatisfied white male viewer who insists on externalising his poorly formed ideas and opinions. To some extent they are right: this is hardly a movie to ""enjoy"" (I didn't) but Kaufman's aim is to challenge his viewer, not lull them with ""closure"" (as one disappointed reviewer wrote). The only real closure in life is death, your own. The American obsession for resolve and solutions remains a mystery. Interestingly, many of the worst reviews were written mid-Covid. Despite the disaster raging around them they felt ""cheated' of a chunk of their lives they ""can never get back."" Lives of considerable importance, no doubt! Nobody coerced you into sitting on your flattened loner behind for two hours. Or maybe someone did, and your rant is a plea for help. If your hero is your dad who can cite every Red Sox win in the 1970s (and did so regularly to impress his drinking mates and at Thanksgiving), then of course anyone who cites authors you have never heard of let alone read, you'll feel irritated.

176,LittleLotti,I've read the book and even I had no idea what was going on,4,7 September 2020,"This was such a struggle to get through, and very unrewarding for doing so.Since I've read the book, I knew what was going on. I also had no idea what was going on. Kaufman's adaptation was so bizarre and unforthcoming that it had me constantly checking how much time was left (too much was the answer)..The first 20 something minutes are PAINFULLY slow, and the chemistry between the two main characters is so nonexistent yet they supposedly have this super deep connection. The character of Jake was so flat and mumbly - nothing like the sophisticated intellectual he was in the novel, but I tried to push that out of my mind. I was rapidly losing interest when the two finally arrived to Jake's parent's house, and there was a moment where I truly thought this movie was going to be incredible. Suddenly I was questioning what I was seeing, the unnervingly strange exchange between characters was unsettling and dread started creeping up in my chest. It stirred up the kind of uneasy feelings I got during my first viewing of Hereditary.I'm a huge fan of strange movies that feel like a bad dream, not a nightmare necessarily, but a dream where things make sense but don't at the same time, and you have a pit in your stomach but don't know why. I like subtle strangeness, enough to pique your interest without beating you over the head with it. Unfortunately there quickly came a point when this movie catapulted over that fine line and became so frustratingly bizarre. It felt like it was trying to be Mulholland Drive. I am all for a strange trip of a movie but it has to be coherent enough to make sense in some way. If I didn't read the book I would have no idea what this movie meant or what was really happening, it just became too ridiculous for me to enjoy.I presume people will talk about how bizarre it is on social media which will make people curious enough to watch it, but it was so unsatisfying and an overall waste of time.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
177,BestBenedikt,He's Thinking of Ending Things,8,4 September 2020,"I'M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS is undoubtedly one of the more inaccessible films Charlie Kaufman has made over the years, but it definitely carries his unique signature and might just be the best film of 2020 so far.Like every Kaufman project before, his newest in the end turns out to be yet again a film about life (or Charlie Kaufman) itself, masterfully depicting the human interior on screen. While the initial plot of a young woman visiting her boyfriend's parents at their farm may seem quite simple, the film takes an interesting turn, tackles many different themes and asks questions about desire, love, fulfillment, aging and death.With that being said, the surreal touch of the film at times became a little bulky and self serving, especially in the second act. But that does not conceal the fact that Toni Collette and David Thewlis both did a great acting job here (as did Jessie Buckley and Jesse Plemons) and little details like changing colours and garments were aesthetic and intelligently thought out.Charlie Kaufman's adaptation of I'M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS is definitely worth seeing, even if it's a little confusing for people who didn't read the novel.

180,smithpaulusmc,Now I am Dying to Read the Book,9,6 October 2020,"Most people know Charlie Kaufman as a cerebral screenwriter who made his name with works like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Being John Malkovich (1999). Through his films, Kaufman dissects the mind and paints as clearly as a mad scientist can, the hamster wheel brain we all have that defines our human condition. Keeping true to his style, Kaufman has returned to us in 2020 with his most recent and arguably one of his most compelling offerings, I'm Thinking of Ending Things.The story centers on the relationship between a young couple, Jake (Jesse Plemons) and ""Young Woman"" (Jessie Buckley) as they drive through a blizzard to meet the Jake's parents. Throughout the encounter, the Young Woman finds herself losing a grip of reality and interacting with Jake and his parents at wildly different portions of their life: Jake as a toddler, Jake caring for his aging parents, and Jake in the present. The story grows odder at every turn until a masterful turn at the end, revealing that the woman and Jake are not who you think they are. For the sake of the reader, I will dive no further into the tale.The film plays out like a book, full of beautiful dialogue and voiceover. The acting chops on both sides of the relationship are stellar and each scene's color pops vividly. I personally enjoyed the decision to film in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, which calls back to older films and stands apart from the all-too-common 2.39:1 we see today.Admittedly, by the film's end, I was left with more questions about what happened than I had answers. But please do not take that to mean the story is too confusing or poorly told. Instead, I believe there is supposed to be a shallow mystery about the film's meaning that is only understood by either reading the book or watching an interview with Kaufman as he explains what is going on. After I learned the nature of the story, I felt immediate illumination and the world of I'm Thinking of Ending Things felt completely clear.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' starts out boring and stays that way for like 20 minutes or so... but stay with it. Then all of a sudden with the introduction of Toni Collette and the ever brilliant David Thewlis, the mystery gets so thick, the cinematography so intense, that the movie will have you on the edge of your seat! If you pay close attention to whats going on, and thats obvious not the strong suit of all those 1/10 reviewers on here, the movie gets just a little too predictable afterwards. But that doesnt mean its not worth watching. There is a lot of thought provoking content here. Some of it based on thinking errors. But all of it is interesting.

It could be relational ideals, aging, regret, or whimsy. Likely its a melting pot of all of those and much more. But aside from what's hard to understand, there is real discomfort in having this movie happen to you, and that is what it does. It happens to you. I am told its easier to follow if you've read the book, but as I digress, and can add only that I had no choice but to watch this movie. Buckley, Plemons, and Kaufman were like new age meeting a part of me that longs for emotional contorttions, and I was for it. However, I likely will not revisit.

This is why I like to quote here a nice line from reviewer ""gortx"": ""But, like with Lynch, sometimes their films seem to only exist in the minds of the filmmakers. (...) It's both brilliant and not so satisfying.""
I think you get the gist.""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" sure isn't your average Sunday afternoon movie for its long and dragged out scenes. Also you have to attune your mindset to deep philosophical conversations. Jessie Buckley does a great job carrying the whole film while Jesse Plemons as Jake drags himself through the story, which of course is typical for this character. Somehow I didn't resonate with his performance.The setting of the old house is quite terrifying and many scenes need closer examination to feel the dark vibe of the daunting story. There are clues in almost every conversation about Jake and his tragic story. I couldn't see the whole picture until I had the puzzle completed.The film is both unsettling and confusing.

They are, in a compelling way, a guided meditation about our own existence. Not everything needs to make sense. Actually, I find the reflections that the movie makes us undergo much more important than the plot holes so many people like to criticize.This movie is all about perception and loneliness. The girl (whatever her name) never really existed or, more precisely, she was never more than a stranger that Jake met at a bar and never had the courage to talk to.She is the embodiment of everything that Jake could have been: a painter, a physicist,a cinema critic.... She is the girlfriend that he could have had, the illusion that keeps him company in an utterly lonely life.In the end, his speech mirrors the one of John Nash while receiving his Nobel prize which, I believe, is the ultimate confirmation that Jake has schizophrenia.The changing nature of Jake's parents is nothing more than a recollection of the memories of his parents through the years.The movie is aesthetically stunning and the direction is absolutely brilliant.The movie also cleverly uses the characteristics of an horror movie to give us an unsettling feeling that something is off.

206,shipwreckjack,So that was a movie,6,24 February 2021,"Just watched this. I can see the artistic touches of Eternal Sunshine. It's both highly nuanced and the most pretentious, drawn out movie I've ever seen. I believe I understand it and it's sad, it's twisty in a curious, dark way, and I kind of hate it passionately. There's peculiar scenes with details I don't grasp and I find I don't care, and a long dance scene that both shorthands the entire hidden storyline and underscores the inanity of everything you've watched.I feel I should watch it again at some point to absorb it deeper and I also feel I that it's best I never think of it again.

217,andrewhumphreys9968,I'm Thinking Of Ending Things - 8/10,8,11 September 2020,"I've been looking forward to seeing this since the trailer, the debate on whether or not it's a horror intrigued me and the divisiveness of the reviews made me want to see it for myself. Personally, I think it's a good film, just a little over-stuffed and unnecessarily surreal in some places. Speaking of, this is definitely Kaufman's weirdest film and I found it harder to get on with than Eternal Sunshine or Synecdoche, New York.The film doesn't necessarily explain things to you, instead giving you the final pieces needed to put the rest of the film into proper perspective. It strings you along for most of the runtime, but the surrealisms and pretty camerawork keep you engaged until the payoff. I wouldn't say this is a horror necessarily, it has creepy moments, an eerie soundtrack and builds up tension really well, but the underlying themes and truth to what you're seeing is a lot more tragic than scary. It's a brooding film that ultimately paints life as a monotonous, regret-filled and relatively pointless endeavour, which I guess is pretty scary when you think about it.The dialogue's very fast and filled with references to actors, films and authors that I didn't really know much about. There's a lot of existentialisms and ponderings on life that, on top of the fried stuff, make the whole film feel like a trip. The clues are there from the very start, so I'd advise paying close attention to the dialogue and try to take some of it more literally. I'm certain I've not got the full grasp of this film yet because there's still a few scenes that baffle me, most notably the girl at the Tulsey Town and the dog.Collette's great as always, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry during most of her scenes. Together with Thewlis, they manage to feel like some sort of bad trip and balance the line between comedy and creepiness perfectly. But, when you start to clock what's going on, there scenes also take on a mostly tragic note. The reason I liked Buckley's performance so much is how she changes throughout the film, only slightly most of the time, but it begins to become more noticeable and was where I began to, barely, get what was going on.Overall, the film looks and sounds amazing, but if you don't like being left up to your own devices in terms of figuring out the true nature of the story, you probably should steer clear. I'm not really a fan of having to put the pieces together myself, but the underlying sadness is an effective, hopeless gut punch that's a lot darker than Kaufman's more usual, sombre affairs. It's the sort of film that inspires feelings you wouldn't necessarily want to deal with, like guilt, regret and grief. I think there's a lot of other stuff in this that warrants more than a 8/10, but in terms of personal enjoyment, there's still a few parts to the film I wasn't a huge fan of/don't have a clue what was going on.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
218,nagan2020,Could have been better,7,11 January 2021,"This movie has an eerie atmosphere which is sort of like Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' meets David Lynch. It is slow paced, nearly boring at times, but had a strange attraction that kept me interested for the whole 134 minutes. But the biggest problem came in the last 20 minutes. The film ends with a somewhat awkward musical sequence, which I felt, is simply not powerful or moving enough to finalize this lonely man's tale of delusion.

224,Mr Nuff,"Jaw-Droppingly Awful, Pretentious Art",1,2 February 2021,"Don't watch. If you take anything from this review, know that most moviegoers that watch will regret giving this a chance. If you love plotless arthouse films with unreliable narrators, zero character arc, and fake characters who only serve as metaphors for a theme, then go ahead, watch, and rate 10. But everyone else will hate it.Ostensibly, this movie is about a young woman who takes a road trip with her new boyfriend to his childhood home: a farm where his parents still live. But (and I wouldn't really call this a spoiler since you have to understand this early on to get some enjoyment) his parents aren't really his parents (not in one time period, at least), his girlfriend isn't really his girlfriend, and he isn't really himself. The events, mostly didn't happen. In that case, this movie isn't really about a girlfriend visiting parents, is it?This movie is instead about getting older and feeling regret. Other spoiler-filled reviews will point that out. What you see on screen is a mixture of memories, hopes, dreams, and/or ideas. Why do we need 2 hours and 14 minutes to present these ideas? Only fans of experimental theater know why length seems to be equated with brilliance. Surely not every scene contributes further understanding to the main character's ideas. If, say, the ice cream scene was removed, the movie remains intact. It doesn't make you laugh, cry, scream, or even further your understanding of the character. It simply is.Why a 1 then? A movie can be plotless and characterless, and still contain enough to make you think or feel, right? This one cannot. Unlike another awful art film The House that Jack Built, you don't get scenes that shock you or action that excites you. You get embarrassing mom stories, anti-climatic spooky basement scenes, rude high school girls, a mediocre dance sequence, and an award acceptance speech. It's a hodge podge of unnecessary details that if you asked this movie's biggest and smartest fans about, they would be unable to give you an answer. What's up with the brunette ice cream server's rash, for example? Every detail is a throwaway random bit that the movie tricks you into thinking is significant until it's off to the next scene.For your average moviegoer, this is infuriating. While the opening scene makes you think that Jake simply has telepathy, and the next scene makes you think the house is somehow magic, the lucky ones will figure out halfway throughout the movie that none of the details are significant because we don't know if they signify a real event or a concept. Why is Jake afraid of the basement? Ooh, we get to find out now! Nope, we don't! Fooled ya. Onto the next scene! That's why this movie gets a 1. This movie where every scene is a metaphor for something that happened or *could* happen has been done over and over, and it's been done better than this.This movie is an affront of the art of cinema, a blemish on the resume of the cast and crew, a waste of film and talent, and a 2-hour regret I'll carry to my grave.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
225,elliest_5,Chaotic but charming,7,8 September 2020,"The best thing about my experience with this film was that I went into it completely blind. It came up on my Netflix recommendations and I clicked just because the title and poster seemed interesting, barely even noticing it had Charlie Kaufman's name attached to it (if I had stopped to ponder what this means, I would have immediately been more clued-up).So if you are reading this review trying to decide whether or not to watch this film, maybe stop right here, cause anything I say from here onwards (even if it's without any spoilers) will take away from the charm of gradually coming to terms with the film's insanity.Going in completely clueless meant that I started forming expectations of a quirky two-person drama, what looked like a break-up story told from the perspective of the woman. The early signs of this being something entirely different are easy to brush-off, but not easy to miss. This means that there comes a point where you keep thinking back to earlier moments in the film, constantly reinterpreting them under new evidence. This may sound like it could be annoying, but I actually found it mostly fun and refreshing.Making a film that has the viewer constantly wonder what on earth is going on is a bold choice, but it does have its drawbacks. Unlike other similar films, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind for instance, or most of David Lynch's work, the surreal part of the narrative comes without any framing. There is no obvious anchor to any part that we can trust as the story's reality, so the whole viewing experience is constant guesswork. At least by the end we do get a pretty confident interpretation of what it was all about, which is a relief.Artistically, the film verges on pretentious but manages to walk that tightrope quite carefully. So it ultimately comes across as genuinely committed to its innovative style and narrative, rather than looking like a random assortment of scenes that some filmschool student thought were ""cool"". Again: it's a delicate balance and it's not one that is guaranteed throughout - there were many moments where I thought ""did you *need* to put that bit there or are you just trying too hard?""The actors, the cinematography and the music are great. I really liked the film's aesthetic. The flow/rhythm is good too: despite the chaos, there wasn't a single moment when I thought it's dragging its feet.If you can cope with increasing levels of storytelling insanity then this film is quite a fun choice. And by ""fun"" I mean ""roller-coaster-y"" but I certainly don't mean ""light-hearted"", given how dark its themes actually are.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

231,hectorhtr,The dream universe of a mind without meaning,9,11 September 2020,"Charlie Kaufman is an unconventional author, suffice to say that anyone who has seen any of his films, both directed and scripted, does not forget them easily. He is extremely smart creating deep existential scripts. In them, the mental reflections are constant, both for the characters of the play, as well as for the spectators and Kaufman himself.In his early days as a screenwriter, he collaborated with Spike Jonze on Being John Malkovich (1999) and adaptation: The Orchid Thief (2002), and with Michel Gondry on Eternal Radiance of a Mind Without Memories (2004). Then he would fly free as a director with Synecdoche New York (2008), Anomalisa (2015) and reaching the present day with I'm thinking of quitting. The importance of his career lies in the fact that his first works are accompanied by directors with marked staging. This allows for a general cohesion, which elevates the scripts and lowers, a bit, the overwhelming pessimism.I'm thinking of letting him play from the first moment with the viewer. The story although it seems conventional; a couple that goes to visit his parents, turns back to the world of dreams. According to Kaufman, it is the best way to delve into the human mind, specifically the subconscious. It is a maxim in all his films, and here, we can see the ins and outs of a person's mind. This approach allows us to observe first-hand, their most hidden fears and desires. In turn, the representation of these concepts tells us about their ability or lack thereof, to relate to others.Being so impressionistic, it requires a viewer attentive to detail and surely the first time I passed you over. With synecdoche, it happened to me that reaching the end, I understood the base but had the feeling that I had been beaten. I'm thinking of letting it play with fewer elements and reducing its temporal space, allowing it to be, within its terms, more accessible. In the same way, the rhythm is much slower with dead times in the form of dialogues. But far from being boring, trying to link everything, every conversation is essential. Of course, they are dialogues with very pedantic and intellectual references. Each of you will see where your limits are and you may go over more than once or twice. Indistinctly, they are all well integrated into the story, and they work for her and not in spite of her, which is the important thing.It is his third film as a director, and Kaufman improves, above the rest, his visual semantics. Accompanied by Lukasz Zal, Pawlikowski's chief cinematographer (Ida and Cold War), they achieve a more narratively active photography that does not depend so much on montage. This photograph has hints of terror, without the film ever becoming one, which increases the sense of uncertainty. This dance between genres makes me deduce a feeling of greater confidence in the director Kaufman.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
232,eugenia_loli,Stories from the Astral World,9,4 September 2020,"What this film is, is the kind of atmosphere and ""feel"" people report under hypnosis when they try to see what happens between reincarnations. According to these reports, we go to this intermediate stage, where time loses its meaning, and we hop from memory to memory, as if in a dream. At the end, a higher evolved entity (symbolized by the pig in this film) comes and takes you to the next stage when you're ready. That's where all your achievements and disappointments are laid bare, and you understand that the only thing that mattered was love. It's hard to imagine that the author have not read these hypnosis sessions when the novel or the script was written.

233,BlizzyFoxTF,Classic Charlie Kaufman mindblower that demands a huge amount of afterthought,8,24 September 2020,"Easily the most abstract of legendary screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's works, and probably his most underappreciated, which says a lot considering how many of his films fit into the same description (Synecdoche, Anomalisa). To me, Kaufman is a mixed bag. Although one of a kind, his themes are bogged with self obsessed ideas of aging and relationship troubles that often come off as heavy handed. It shows up in this film, but like Synecdoche and Eternal Sunshine, veritable masterpieces need not distant themselves from these ideas. I'm Thinking of Ending Things is close to being on the same level as these Kaufman magnum opuses.My original view of the film was negative. Although I appreciate Kaufman's direction and his trademark enigmatic script, the film is so dense with obscure literary references and experiemental sequences that I fail to seek enjoyment on a facile level, which is important since the hook of the film is not there to draw the audience's attention to its core themes and messages. I cannot understant the film on the first watch, and I didn't receive the payoff that reward the boredom I felt sitting through its runtime. But a simple Googling on explanations regarding the plot immediately recontextualized what I saw. When the film makes sense, it is truly genius. It is typical Charlie Kaufmanism with loads of purposefully and beautifully intertwined references, foreshadowing, hints and details, and it demands multiple viewings to fully grasp.I suggest everyone who gave a negative review to look up its the plot. I do not think it is a good Charlie Kaufman entry film. I feel like the aforementioned masterpieces, and even Being John Malkovich are more instantly attractive and indicative of a Kaufman film's main appeal. Still, as big fans of the screenwriter/director's work, this is another fantastic entry that justifies its existence.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

She is with his boyfriend for 5 or 6 weeks and now they go a trip to his boyfriend's parent's house, she has some doubts but she accepts this trip. After they arrived her boyfriend's parents home, she feels some of things become weird but she feels it's a temporary thing so after the dinner she thinks that she'll get rid off this weirdness. When they leave her boyfriend's parents' home she wants to reach her home because she has some works to acomplish in the morning.
On their way back to her home everthing becomes weirder and the narration of the story becomes metaphorical as we can see from art house movies. I must say thay I didn't like the movie however I have found 1st part interesting. In the begining, It seemed a good road movie but when they have reached the girls' boyfriend's parents home, everthing have started to change and after that I bored in some scenes of the movie.

A masterpiece of filmmaking.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
249,asen-75377,"Thank you, Kaufman..I adore this film",9,6 September 2020,"Kaufman's latest psychological horror is noting but a great surrealist masterpiece...a fascinating and also unsettling Kaufman's nightmare. On the surface the plot seems very simple.. a young woman (Jessie Buckley) with his boyfriend Jake (Jesse Plemons) going to meet his parents but also she constantly thinking of ending her relationship with Jake...but the movie is not that simple..if you like straightforward narratives and don't like metaphorical representation..then avoid this film, it's not for you. Now before coming to the spoiler discussion, I just wanna tell Kaufman this time totally pushed himself beyond all boundaries..the same absurdism that I love in his films and visual detailings in each frame; everything is just perfect. Jessie Buckley really did a great job and also Jesse Plemons, Toni Collette and David Thewlis... really love the long conversations in the cars and throughout the films, Kaufman's using of highly valued artistic and philosophical references. Ok that's enough, now going to talk about what actually happened in the film according to my POV.As I had't read the novel, so it was confusing and didn't understand all the symbolisms totally. Now besides Jake and the girl, we as
lso see an older janitor working at high school- and that's the only thing actually happened and that is Jake in his real life now..old and working as a janitor..all the other things we got to see in the film are actually happening in older/aged Jake's mind...film presents Jake's life the way he wishes it had gone up (he lives in his past)The cold and somehow this isolating atmosphere is filled with a tone of sadness I can feel. At his parents' house when he and the girlfriend visiting them, they didn't come down the stairs for a long time and also the arguing between his parents...these things clearly reprsents that Jake was really lonely in his childhood and a troubled past with his parents. Even now he is lonely, that's why he spends time imagining what his life should be like.Jake's parents are also showed in different times..bcz Jake imagining theam at diff. time periods. We also get to see his relationship with his parents more than that..at their middle age Jake's dad looks physically unfit and his mom looks mentally unstable or going towards that..and aslo their old age, when his mom at the end of her life and his dad also lost all his stability almost. But without his parents, Jake is really alone..as there is no one without them in his life, old Jake imagining his life the way he wishes it could have been. Btw the basement actually represents the subconscious mind of Jake..where we see the paintings and the janitor uniforms.Now the girlfriend which in reality doesn't exist...bcz he didn't have any but rather a woman he admired a long time ago or an alternative character created by him. The young woman's backstory continuously changes and also her names..first she was a painter and named Lucy but after some time she was a waitress and named Louisa (but we can guess from wherever the idea comes in his mind bcz previously janitor was watching a movie where the lead female character was a waitress)..so she is technically a part of his imagination. Probably a revelation in the ending that he didn't talk to her, he just watched her and never able to make a step forward. Old Jake regrets that,thinks if he talked that day, life could've been different. So, Jake is so lonely and sad that he only can imagine the life with a girl he saw years ago. This is very saddening for me. A great life with a girlfriend and living parents but it didn't happen with Jake..he lives in the past by imagining that desired life..at present when he is working as a janitor in a school, the students tease him, making a fun out of that...he observes the high school student rehearsing a musical 'Oklahoma'. The movie's final scene shows an alternate (happy) version of Old Jake performing a musical and receiving award in the presence of his parents and his girlfriend (probably his wife now).
But that never happened in reality..after cleaning on a snowy night, he returned to his car and he didn't start his car and just sit there... remembering the moments of his life...his childhood, parents and cartoons of that time (during this time he strips naked), he follows the animated version of infected pig that died in their farm years ago. But the car shown completely covered with snow that probably means that Jake eventaully frozed to death in his car.The title has a double and darker meaning...Jake is actually highly depressed guy maybe suicidal. It's not the breakup, it's about Jake's suicidal thoughts..he all time thought to end his life...but at last he commits suicide or that is accidental we don't know. What can we do, life doesn't work out as planned or wished. Ultimately this stands as one of the most sad, depressing psychological films... his regret towards himself..he just only wanted to live his life by imagining about the good things that could be happened to him.Overall, this is the best experience I've got from Kaufman films and my favorite Kaufman film. Though have to re-watch to completely get the points..specially this film is close to me, any film about loneliness, depression, extreme sadness..I'm in. Thanks Kaufman for showing the life of Jake..really connected with this.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

254,sebastianschlicht,"""It's Good To Remind Yourself The World Is Larger Than The Inside Of Your Own Head.""",10,13 April 2021,"Despite his Oscar for ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (2004) and his directorial debut ""Synecdoche, New York"" (2008), Charlie Kaufman repeatedly struggled to get his new projects done. ""Anomalisa"" (2015), for example, was realized by ""Kickstarter"", but in the end couldn't even bring in the film's budget. So he turned to the streaming service Netflix for his third film (as a director). They really finance everything which is both a blessing and a curse. In the case of ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" we can truley speak of a blessing without a question. Based on the novel of the same name by Iain Reid, Kaufman adapted the story in 2020 and (wouldn´t you know) also wrote the screenplay for the movie. And how fitting because the themes in the book fit perfectly with Kaufman's unique style. As if the book was written for him.""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" stands out from the well-known Netflix program. If you don't know Kaufman and his projects, you should perhaps watch some other films by him before. ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" or ""Anomalisa"" are much more accessible, but of course I would recommend ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" to any film fan without hesitation. Towards the end, Kaufman's dark work can become a little ""artsy-fartsy"", but personally I thought it was brilliant. Like every other movie of his, ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" requires a very concentrated viewing, otherwise you can quickly get lost in the abstract nature of the story. However, if you are ready, you will be able to experience an extravagant masterpiece.The story centers around a young couple: Jake wants to introduce his girlfriend to his parents and drives with her to the farm where he grew up. But the weather is snowy and stormy, and the way is long. When the young woman finally arrives with her boyfriend, more and more things seem odd and strange...Not only does the young woman ask herself more and more questions in the course of the runtime, but we as viewers will also undoubtedly not understand many things immediately. But that's how Kaufman's films are. They demand a lot from you and don't waste any time with unnecessary explanations. In addition, his films should be viewed several times. ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" is no exception. In contrast to other projects, Kaufman mainly plays with a few surprises here and there and even makes use of some horror-tropes. While some people would certainly not define the film as ""horror"" or ""thriller"" nevertheless, there are very dark themes in the movie!Of course, everyone should find out for themselves which themes are used here exactly. You could analyze ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" down to the smallest detail, but as Kaufman himself said in interviews: ""Everyone should form their own interpretation and opinion on the film"". The story can be deciphered very well through the book, but Kaufman made sure that the whole thing cannot simply be broken down into one ""solution"". I have seen the film twice so far and I can absolutely confirm that. The film is obviously much more free in its interpretation, but since I haven't read the book, I can't really confirm that.Charlie Kaufman has clearly evolved as a director, which can be seen very well here. Lukasz Zal's cinematography in particular fits the story perfectly. Not only that the action is captured with strong images (I've rarely seen a dark film that is so beautiful shot), the film also has an interesting aspect ratio to represent the intimacy of the story. There is also a subtle but powerful soundtrack by Jay Wadley. The track ""The Dream Ballet"" in particular is beautiful and a perfect contrast to the darkness in the film.All the actors are also on a high level. Jesse Plemons and Jessie Buckley are fantastic in their naturalness. You want to hear, what they say, which is certainly also thanks to the great script by Kaufman, but you need talented actors who can authentically implement (and even sing) these words. Both are still very young and hopefully they have several big projects in the future. And then of course there are Jake's parents, played by David Thewlis and Toni Collette. Two great actors who shine again and again, especially in the art house-genre. Both are showing an impressive performance here. The differentiated and sometimes exaggerated acting is so wonderful and disturbing to watch at the same time.Everything is just right here!Conclusion: ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" is without a doubt the best film of 2020 for me. A gloomy yet wonderful journey into the human abyss, masterfully staged by the genius Charlie Kaufman.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

Might as well be picking up random books and reading 1 sentence from each one at a time. Which I guess is the point, but it was just too much. Right when I thought it was finally over, it turns out it was only halfway done and I only watched the second half to be fair to the creator.

Kaufman opts to have a go at the subject matter from a different angle and, in my opinion, fails miserably. The actors are excellent, but they are given meandering soliloquies, pretentious expositions and are sounding like they are reading film, music and book reviews for what seem like hours - in a very not-film-like manner.

277,IdiotBox_Recommendations,Thought provoking Intense Psychological drama,8,13 September 2020,"I'm thinking of ending things is Charlie Kaufman (eternal sunshine of the spotless mind) psychological drama adapted from the novel of the same name. The plot is about a young couple -Jake (Jesse Plemons) and a woman initially addressed as Lucy (Jessie Buckley) who take a trip to meet Jake's parents at a lonely farmhouse in the middle of a blizzard while the female character is constantly thinking of ending the relationship. Once they arrive at Jake's parents' house, things start getting weird and jumbled up and reality becomes distorted and everything feels like a lucid dream. Jakes parents (acted brilliantly by Toni Collette and David Thewlis) act fishy lending an eerie vibe to the plot.
The name and profession of the central character keeps changing, Jake's parents are seen aging and de-aging rapidly. The young woman keeps getting calls from different names on her phone. Glimpses of an aged school janitor are seen having no outright connection with the central characters. There is a general ominous vibe around all the characters.
This is not your usual straightforward movie with a linear narrative. Things get quite confusing and the movie does not provide any explanation at all. Symbolism and deep set conversations form a constant part and yet this movie keeps you engaged as you try and figure out things on your own. This movie touches the themes of Love, hope, loneliness, aging and mortality- all the things that we humans dread from time to time. As at some point on their road trip the young woman tells Jake ""I suspect humans are the only animals that know the inevitability of their own death. Other animals live in the present, humans cannot. So they invented hope."" The ending is vague, but read between the lines and you will not fail to marvel at the amazing craftsmanship that Kaufman provides yet again.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

I wasn't familiar with the novel it was based on, but it seems that i should've been more aware with it first. As the story starts out with a girl ( who doesn't have a name) that goes with her boyfriend to his parents' house during a snowstorm. It would make you think that the rest of the story would be at his family's house, who seem very weird, and all the unexpected things that would happen between them and their son's new girlfriend. Instead what actually happens are a series of unexplained things, like how the parents keep changing in age, switching between being very old and middle-aged, and how the girl suddenly sees herself alone in the house. Then the second half of this painful experience, is on their way back home, were new set of bizzare things take place, like seeing another couple appear instead of them, and how they end up at a high school that's covered in snow, and then the finale which also doesn't make any sense at all. My question is, can all novels be adapted into films, the answer have to be NO. and this film is the biggest example, and after knowing about the novel, iit seems that few changes have been made especially at the end, which could've helped in explaining some things of this very vague story. The saddest thing though is how this great cast was totally wasted in one of the strangest films i've seen.

That's really the only thing keeping me from giving it a 10/10. But most of the time I was fully on board with what I was being shown. Even the constant philosophical talk and quoting of poetry and film reviews kept me engaged.The car scenes could have been the most monotonous visually, like that Tom Hardy movie Locke. But the snow outside and the repeating imagery adds to the dreamstate. It's all just so mesmerizing.The movie is tragic and funny and weird and thought provoking and everything Charlie Kaufman does best. I cannot wait to watch this one again.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
286,Mikheil-H,Wow Kaufman... just wow,8,14 November 2020,"I'm thinking of ending things. 2020 was so close to becoming a skippable year in cinema history with releases being delayed, hollow cash-grabs filling streaming services and many anticipated films failing to live up to expectations. But despite everything, gems have risen from a coronavirus-laden industry and Kaufman's newest emotionally and mentally draining jewel is one of the brightest.I'm thinking of ending things. We follow Jessie Buckley (Wild Rose) as she travels with her new boyfriend Jesse Plemons (Breaking Bad) to meet his parents and contemplate a range of historic, poetic and philosophical concepts. However, as with most Kaufman films, nothing is what it seems and it is that mystery, enhanced by captivating performances that work to keep the audience invested in what could have been a very slow, self-important and ultimately forgettable film.I'm thinking of ending things. By far and away, the real genius of the Netflix original is the expert editing, directing and dialogue that permeates through every scene which helps draw viewers deeper into the unfolding mystery. This comes in a variety of forms such as subtle changes to characters' looks occurring between camera cuts, speech being out of sync with lip movements and seemingly mundane conversations twisting into nauseatingly intense confrontations. Whilst it makes for confusing viewing, it ultimately succeeds at challenging and motivating the viewer to catch any and every detail that hints at a true meaning behind the unfolding plot.I'm thinking of ending things. Despite there being a limited number of settings, the editing and directing also work to maintain a sense of uncomfortable tension throughout the film. This is even more impressive when at least a third of the run time is dedicated to two characters conversing in a car. The cinematography capitalises on this. Utilising a 4:3 aspect ratio, it beautifully frames characters and actions forcing audiences to maintain focus on the scene. This is never more wonderfully present than during scenes inside the parent's house where the combination of set design, character clothing and shot composition help to perpetuate the uneasy sense that our protagonist is far from safe.I'm Thinking of Ending Things might be the most complex, yet ultimately rewarding film of 2020. The layered storyline, depressing yet tense tone and bizarre adoration of the Oklahoma musical means Kaufman has created something truly unique. Even though some scenes drag for longer than necessary and one particular scene at an ice cream parlour presents mysteries that never get explained, the film succeeds at presenting a unique view on relationships, life and the 'what ifs' that fill them... It also works as a feature length version of The View from Halfway Down.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
287,benbhodgson,Hmmm...,1,12 September 2020,"If your going in thinking it's going to be like the Eternal sunshine... I think not! (Other than the way Kaufman messes with your mind!)
The feelings this film made me feel went through awkward, worried, scared, elated, angry and confused.
Don't get me wrong I'm not saying I don't want to feel something when I watch a film but personality this many feelings don't need to be messed with in this space if time or one film.
They messed about and had fun with this one!
Story line was weak but the ride you get taken on isn't one to tell the kids about...
I get art is experimental but I didn't enjoy it within this film!
I know there will be the people that absolutely love this film but they came here for the pretentiousness, so I'm sure they enjoy that buffet.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
288,jrwollscheid,Disturbing Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,10,4 September 2020,"I'm Thinking of Ending Things10/10Genre: Thriller, Suspense, Psychological Thriller, HorrorThis movie is simply amazing. I have no words to describe just how much this movie has sat with me. The movie centers around a girl going to her boyfriend's parents house where odd things begin to occur. The movie is extremely well-written and directed. The movie builds an amazingly bleak and dark atmosphere through the eerie and sad score to the cold bleak blizzard occurring in the background. The cinematography in the movie also helps add to the atmosphere as it feels extremely dark and bleak. The interactions between the family feel so unhinged as does many aspects of the movie. The movie feels like someone misremembering events in your past as stories are constantly changing as is time. The acting in the movie is also amazing with Jessie Buckley being outstanding. The movie is horrific and terrifying in the small ways as there is no real gore or jumpscares but just a complete feeling of foreboding eeriness throughout. The narration in the movie also really adds to the movie and the philosophical arguments within the movie really sit with the viewer. The camera in the movie is also amazing as it serves many purposes in the movie and feels like a character. The camera also adds isolation as it cuts everyone, but the girlfriend out of a lot of shots. The movie also has left me with a lot of questions and at least three different theories on what exactly it all means(I know it was a book and the author had his meaning) because I think Charlie Kaufman has made changes to the whole meaning of the book at least slightly. If you are interested in my theories either dm me or I might post the theories. The movie is just a must watch on Netflix and is for sure a must watch Psychological Thriller.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
289,TheSmallDeth,A trippy snowstorm,7,6 September 2020,"I had more struggles to understand this movie than i've had with Tenet. It's a big trippy road, filled with conversations that feel like they actually lead nowhere. I guess that's just the vibe this movie gives off; struggling to get somewhere in limbo.Even though it was a big pill to swallow, i really enjoyed it! The story and it's conclusion were interesting enough to keep me grasped until the end. The ending may feel open for interpretation and you might look up an explanation on the internet; but that's what made this movie 'good' for me. The acting and ost are great and really add up to the tense experience this movie is going for.Just check it out on Netflix, make sure you're ready for one of the 'heavier to understand' movies out there!",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

293,SimonsRants,Dark Horse Candidate for Movie of the Year,8,8 September 2020,"I'm Thinking of Ending Things 8.5/10No, Charlie Kaufman's latest film will not net him an Oscar, it's simply just not that kind of movie. Nor will it receive an overwhelmingly positive reaction from audiences because it is quite bizarre - as are most of Kaufman's films. But truth be told, this is the best movie to come out so far in a rather disappointing 2020.Quick disclaimer: I have not read the book and I don't honestly plan to; I have heard from many disgruntled fans that the book is far superior and that the movie trashes the ending. I don't know if that's true because I didn't read it, but watching the movie on it's own was a fantastic experience. One that I plan to repeat again soon.This movie is a puzzle for sure, so if you enjoy movies that make you think then you'll absolutely love this. I've seen people say you need to read the book to understand, and that's not true. But a quick google search or two may be a helpful shortcut to grasping the film but is not entirely necessary. It's an odd and confusing film that puzzles you without handing you any answers on a silver platter - but it makes sure the clues are presented plainly. If you don't get everything on the first go through, don't be ashamed just give it another go and things will become a little more clear each time.I'm not as familiar with Kaufman the director as I am with Kaufman the writer who has written such films as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Adaptation., Being John Malcovich. Needless to say, I'm a big fan of his writing but was unsure of his directing going into this. After having seen it, it seems he has gleaned from directors he's worked with in the past like Michel Gondry and Spike Jonze. His style is artistic and subtle but also direct and to the point. I can now say I am a big fan of his directing and can't wait to see whatever he puts out next.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
294,hortonstrip,Televisual Marmite!,10,5 September 2020,"Is it just me or are all the ratings either zero or ten?! Anyone that rated this film zero really needs to avoid filmmakers like Kaufman!! Stick with ""Ow My Balls"", yeah?
For me it was a ten, although like many of the more disgruntled reviewers here I don't have a clue what just happened either! Wonderful. T I N Y (i.e. massively) bit sad, but, again, Kaufman does this brilliantly. The first half of this film is like if Mike Leigh were less cheery. Then it goes full Kaufman. Will be watching this over, remembering to only ever do so when I have something really fun planned right afterwards, lest I start thinking of ending things!! Which is fully how I recommend anyone watch this.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

Two people in a new relationship trying to out erudite each other by quoting everything from Woodsworth to physics. Who talks like this? No one. And if someone did, I'd want to get away from them ASAP. Which is exactly how I felt about this film. It was painful to watch.I persevered, however, wondering if the ending would somehow give it meaning. It didn't. It was more half-*ssed than the rest of it. As in ""there's no real story, and we have no idea how to end this stream-of-consciousness mess, so let's just throw an animated pig at the wall and see if it sticks.""I suppose this is the sort of movie that young wanna be intellectuals pat themselves on the back for adoring.

298,silverspawnx,Hauntingly Deep,10,10 November 2020,"The first time watching this movie, my experience was one of utter bafflement and marvel at how bizarre and random everything appeared to be. The second time was one of realizing that, in fact, nothing is random. Far from arbitrary, the writing is quite tight: almost everything that happens does so for a specific purpose, and the most innocuous seeming lines turn out to be carefully crafted. Remember the sales girl saying, ""it's not varnish, it's not why it smells, you should know that""? Yeah. Here's a line you're not going to forget once you understand what it means. Brutal.This is pretty impressive. People sometimes talk about how 'everything makes sense in retrospect', but this is usually an exaggeration. i'm thinking of ending things is the only movie I know where that claim is justified. It really is the greatest change in perspective after understanding what is going on that I've ever witnessed. Shutter Island comes to mind as a distant second.But the truth is, I can't stop thinking about the movie now that I get it. I can't stop watching scenes. It is all just so well done, especially the ending. We need more movies like this. More movies that try something that has never been done before.Special props to the main actress; she's phenomenal.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

But whatever this Director did deviated far too much from the book to the point where it wasn't even enjoyable.He seemed to go out of his way to make the storyline more complicated than it needed to be and then CHANGED the ending in a way that completely ruins the double meaning of the title.

308,LeCronopio,An inner farewell,10,27 September 2020,"For me (starting with these types of premises it feels a bit idiotic, but well), and especially considering Kaufman's precedent (""Synecdoche, New York"", which constitutes his total search with the cinema), the present film it's the condensation of the imaginary of Jake (Jesse Plemons) in his old age facing the end of a life he has already lived and hasn't lived at the same time. It is a kind of mental review where memories live together with everything that he would also want to be a memory but it is no longer than an inconcretable desire: to share a life with a woman he once saw somewhere, a woman with whom then he spoke, with whom he connected, with whom he began a relationship, a woman who is ostensibly intelligent, is beautiful, is an physicist, is an artist, is an critic, is everything that he would have chosen as a couple and that it was no longer, that now it's just that fantasy mixed with memories as he goes through the last days of his insipid and routine life from his floor alone, from his van in the snow to the school as a janitor. He probably ""is thinking on ending things"", he comes consistently thinking about it, in the end (hence we see at the end, between the credits, his truck covered in snow); that is, Lucy and her many other names, her family , every person in the room applauds him, while he gives that honorary speech that he once heard in a movie called A Beautiful Mind and that he would no doubt have liked to give, that somewhat pathetic consent of protagonist of his own story in which everyone inevitably and shamefully we have ever incurred, it is his inner farewell, the last stretch of his thoughts in front of existence.I'm going to dispense with the details that are putting this together because the review would be quite long and also part of the charm of Kaufman's attempt is that the viewer detects those signals, that inconsistency in Lucy's identity and fear at the discovery of it as a fantasy (when she sees all the paintings that she presumably had shown her father-in-law, in Jesse's attic, at the place of his memories); the tacit and reproachful complicity between Jesse (young) and this elderly janitor, whom he knows perfectly inside; Jesse's narrative control in the plot in front of a Lucy who confronts it in a complete plane of uncertainty; the recurrence and presence of ""Oklahoma!"" that Jesse likes so much; the real story that she tells to an old Jesse, about a boyfriend who wasn't even her boyfriend and was nothing more than a rare that in a bar a long time ago didn't take his eyes of her, and who did not see again.
It is positive to approach cinema incisively and impartially, with an aesthetic and intellectual approach but without determining judgments, and that is why I ask who (although I doubt that there really is anyone) to read what I wrote, not to take it for granted or give it a truly restrictive quality, but take it as a simple hand to a reading that Kaufman proposed for his attempt.Rate: 10/10",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

But let me ask you, have you ever felt not good enough for someone? Have you felt trapped with someone becasue you are scared of letting go?This film encapsulates this to an almost perfect degree. It begs you to empathise with the characters, and demands a second, third and forth viewing.If you dont think you like the sound of this film you will not like it, and thats ok!But if i have managed to make you curious, go in with an open mind and an open heart.

Over the space of many years and hundreds of films, I have found that for the most part, ratings of 9 & 10 by critics, unless the movie is purely an entertainment vehicle, leave me shaking my head in wonderment and confusion.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
330,christianloteyro,I'm thinking... hard,8,5 September 2020,Great film. Bad thing I haven't read the book yet.It's like Mulholland Drive-- film that will make you think about what's happening. This kind of film is one of my favorite. You make a story in your mind what is happening then after some rewinds and/or rewatch you will figure it out.,I'm Thinking of Ending Things
331,reddice26,Misunderstood,3,9 September 2020,"If you are anything like me, you have just watched this movie and are wondering what on earth you just saw. It's weird right? That's ok, because even the people on here pretending to understand have missed the mark completely.So let's start with the beginning, where you see Jake in his apartment looking down to the street where his gf is being picked up by Jake. They drive off to visit Jake's family and it appears Jake can read this girl's mind, which is strange. Then, when they get to his parent's house, you see his parents in all stages of their live. Jake does not want to leave, but his gf does all the time. And there is a door to the cellar with scratch marks where he does not want his gf to go to. When they finally leave, they go get ice cream, where the girl is warned not to move forward in time by the other girl. Weird right? And then... they drive to Jake's former high school, where he kisses her and then dissapears.But....! That's not all. You also have Jake Sr, which is basically the old version if him, working as a janitor in a high school. BUT, this version does not live in an apartment, but in house with a swing on the front lawn.And now the real story unfolds at the end of the movie, so here's what happens. When young Jake is kissing his gf, he sees himself looking through a peephole at them. And later, you see a dance scene, between a man and a women, whereby the man is is killed by a janitor and the girl taken away. This represents how janitor Jake is watching 2 young lovers make out, he is discovered by the man. Then they fight, he kills the man and abducts the girl. This girl is actually the one that is presented as a gf throughout the movie. The scratch marks on the cellar door, those are hers, she is being held captive and ""does not remember when they first met"" and remembers she ""just wants to go home"". She has been locked up for ages, get it? The girls at the ice cream shop are warning her, meaning she has lost her mind after years of rape and is living in her own world. If she accepts her fate, she will get worse, so ""she can stay there"". Right after the kissing scene in the car, she says to herself that she had never learned to say no. The yes for the phone number became another yes, and another yes, and another yes. She is blaming herself for what happened! In the next scene, she says she was creeped out by Jake in the bar, which gives us another hint: One that Jake never took, he really thought she liked him. Hence the looking at her through holes and killing her real boyfriend to kidnap her. In the scene where Jake is on stage, he even thanks her! The ""friendly"" parents represent how his parents always always knew and always protected him and the kidnapping/raping. And he, in turn, cared for them while she remained captive. At a certain point, the mother tells her to go down to the basement!!! Get it? And the numerous missed calls are from friends and relatives looking for her still.And the death of the janitor at the end you may wonder? Well, that is NOT his car! If you don't believe me, look again because it is a very different car. It's most likely the car from the guy he killed, and where he may have stashed the body. Jake is thus NOT dead.So, now we're full circle. Young Jake is a perv, thinks a girl likes him, kidnaps her while killing the partner in the process. Keeps her locked up in a basement, his parents knew all along. The girl is locked up for years, all the while slowly but surely going crazy. The swingset outside is a hint that she had gotten pregnant at a certain point. The pigs with maggots on their belly represent the miscarriage, because he did not take good care of her. And the changing pictures of the child in the house represents that he would have looked like one of them. In the meanwhile Jake carries on cleaning a high school, possibly looking for his next prey. And even possibley full of guilt and remorse, that's the mental breakdown at the end. But still... he goes back into school. Friends and family still look for the girl. Building up for a sequel?I give 3 stars, because all in all it's not a very good story and the fact that everyone is interpreting this in the wrong way is ultimate proof the film maker failed.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

334,amanmsp,An interesting premise which suffers due to a lack of plot and a pretentious nature,3,10 September 2020,"Despite being a fan of these weird/metaphorical movies, I couldn't find myself connecting with this one. Although such a narrative style has always been Charlie Kaufman's trademark, it wasn't executed as well as he did in his earlier movies.In my opinion, the biggest reason for this movie's failure is the total lack of plot. In his earlier scripts like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind, Kaufman managed to create really interesting and original stories and managed to integrate all these metaphorical aspects into those stories. They worked because it was the plot which carried the metaphors and not the other way around. However, in the case of this movie, it feels the exact opposite. The metaphorical stuff take the center stage and the story is basically non-existent. The movie can be described as a serious of really weird events that serve as metaphors for various themes. Due to a total lack of an actual story, these metaphors come across as really pretentious. It felt like it was trying really hard to be weird and different just for the sake of it. The sequences that take place in the house started out as really unique and interesting and kept me hooked on to find out where it was headed. However, it also turned out to be just another unexplained event that is never addressed again, and it's only purpose is to serve as a metaphor for a theme.As positives, the performances by the whole cast are praiseworthy, particularly by Toni Colette and David Thewlis who shined really well as the creepy parents.
Overall, it was a movie with a lot of potential, a great cast and an interesting premise, which unfortunately turned out be pretentious and bland due to an overabundance of metaphors which lack a plot to be integrated with.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

Once I realized what was going on, I rewatched it with this on mind; paying attention to all the clues and parts of the movie I had overlooked. That's when the true appreciation of how beautifully done this movie was cane to me. I enjoyed it- but I think for most it's a love it or hate it movie.

337,isaacglover_05,The book really helps you understand this movie better,10,4 September 2020,"I have been waiting all year for this movie to come out!I am a huge fan of the novel. It was short, it was quick, but it was highly nuanced and it packed a great psychological punch to the gut. I was extreme.y excited to see the novel come to life on the screen, and to have it directed by Charlie Kaufman just makes complete sense.""Kaufman"" is an adjective just as much as it is a name. You hear that a movie is ""Kaufman-esque"" and you know exactly what it means. Something that will require multiple viewings, something that requires your attention to be on the movie at all times, something that demands you to take in every piece of dialogue and symbol and image and interpret it on the fly as the movie comes along. This movie is no different from Kaufman's other films such as ""Anomalisa"", ""Synecdoche, New York"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and so on. Nothing is wasted, nothing is there for no reason. It is all tightly packed and all comes together. The book may require a few re-reads, just like how this movie will require a few rewatches.I don't want to say a whole lot out of fear that I spoil the movie. But it is everything that I have hoped and more: atmospheric, dream-like, unsettling, glitchy and mind-bending. I am extremely pleased with how this movie turned out.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
338,JeopardyLeyton,Kept me interested but seems it's better if you've read the book.,6,1 October 2020,"So I haven't read the book, which meant that I didn't really get what was going on. I got that the janitor was Jake, that this seemed to be about dementia and a fragmented mind - it did a good job of giving some idea of what it might be like for someone suffering from dementia, getting lost in time, feeling confused, getting events and places mixed up etc. It's just that the female character seemed to be the main protagonist, so if you haven't read the book, you can't help but think she is real while watching this. I thought it was about her suffering from dementia, thinking of herself as a young woman the whole time, struggling with her identity and attaching her identity to the man she was with. I really expected to see Jake the janitor at the end looking after an old her or something. It was all about her, Jake seemed to be a side character, and I guess, having read other reviews from people who did read the book, Jake is meant to be sort of a side character in his own life? But that doesn't come across at all well in the film, because it's her thoughts we hear, we see everything from her point of view. I think it's a huge ask for people who haven't read the book to get that this main protagonist through whose perspective we see the events of the movie is just a figment of another character's imagination.So that makes the ending fall really flat for the non-book-reader. It comes across as nonsensical. Maybe at the end we are supposed to have the epiphany that it's all Jakes' imagination mixed with memories, but it doesn't come across like that at all, it comes across like wtf why is this guy naked and following a cartoon pig?Anyway, I did enjoy it, it made me think about things. It was bleak, and I liked the way it explored how horrible and dreary and painful life can be, and how things don't always work out - we can just waste our lives, living in fantasies, never appreciating the present moments, getting bogged down by hangups and the burdens our parents put on us. Also how media and films and stories can distort our understanding of what life's about and give us false hope and expectations for what gives us value as human beings or what relationships should be like.It sounds like I would've enjoyed it much more if I'd read the book, and I don't think that makes for a good adaptation. In my mind, if you're adapting a book, you should remember that much of the audience won't know what you know about the story, even if it seems completely obvious to you as a central point of the narrative, and should craft it with that in mind. Otherwise it can come across a bit messy and confusing.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
339,dhxmansarbajna,An Intellectual Dumpster Fire,4,6 September 2020,"This is for people who haven't read the book and were completely confused by ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things.""1. Jake's girlfriend (Louise) does not exist. She is a figment of his imagination. He met her at a bar as he recounts but never mustered the courage to ask her out. The narrative builds on the future they might have had if they were together.2. Jake is a failure, a disappointing janitor with his whole life filled with regret. He wanted to be educated, he wanted to paint (the paintings in the basement were his) but he never amounted to anything in his life.3. The ending is different, Charlie Kaufman's own interpretive understanding of Jake's life. His movies are, honestly not for everyone. However, this movie takes itself way too seriously quoting and discussing references from literary works and operas that you definitely need to have read and studied in order to understand any obscure reference.This was my most anticipated movie in September, as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was an evergreen movie to me. But by the time this ended, I had a severe headache and was terribly frustrated at the film's lack of respect for it's audience in piecing every puzzle of a film cut into thousand pieces, just so it feels like an abstract work of art. This could have been a short, amazing retrospective film about the futility of life but ends as a futile film that fails to give the audience or its characters a closure, defeating the very purpose of art, that it keeps criticizing for more than 2 hours.

As such there's really no point to it except to to be so abstract that any meaning could be derived from its convoluted plot (I use the word ""plot"" very loosely).The first half of the movie is somewhat interesting as it does have a story line and you find yourself getting interested wondering how they're going to explain what is going on. Then it looks like the writers acid kicked in and what follows is just unresolved scene after scene inserted just to confuse. You suddenly don't care anymore as you realize that its all just imagination and there's no reality to whats happening.And the ending is complete crap.

341,JARA-3,subpar work from Kaufman,6,30 August 2021,"Here's a quick and sloppy review:
Like all of Charlie Kaufman's work, this is essentially a meditation on the relationship between the self and fiction. Unlike my favorites from his oeuvre. Being John Malkovich, Adaptation. And Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, while I am still engaged by his intellectual exercise, I do not find this one entertaining. By the time we are 15 minutes into the movie, it is clear that everything we are being told is suspect. Not even I am as talented as Lucy appears to be, and yet she has clear spots of ignorance that suggest what we are being told isn't true. As a result, there is no sense of danger. It is always clear that either the girl or Jake exists only in the mind of the other. How else to make sense of all the contradictions and inconsistencies in their relationship? I will suggest that the title has a double meaning. One easily imagine that Jake went through a lifetime of believing that any woman who would be involved with him was always ""thinking of ending things."" Jake clearly finds sympathetic the character Jud from Oklahoma, another character who has trouble imagining that anyone would really care about him. But unlike Jud, Jake has been thinking of ending things in a completely different sort of way. Jake commits suicide freezing himself to death in his truck. However nothing has happened in this story to make me feel any sympathy for Jake, so when he dies it is very much a meaningless death for me. I think they're supposed to be an element of ""there but for fortune... "" but the complete absence of any sense of reality makes it impossible to sympathize with him and feel the idea that this could be our death as well.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
342,brontebrowning,"Truly, Truly Terrible",1,4 September 2020,"Don't get me wrong: I'm a moderate fan of Charlie Kauffman. And I can roll with meta, existential/nihilistic themes, surrealism and general weirdness with the best of them.But this film, good god, is pure dreck.Where do I start?Overwrought dialogue, for starters. So prolix, so studied, so BORING.Bad acting on every actor's part. I've always thought Jesse Plemons was overrated, so I can't say I was surprised to find him punching above his weight here. The actress who played the part of the girlfriend was too ""actorly,"" and I found her difficult to watch. Even Toni Colette turned in what may be her worst performance to date. Poor Toni Colette: part of the problem was the terrible source material, but she still played it way too over-the-top. What's more, I found her recycling some of her previous film/TV personas here. Not a good look for Ms. Colette.Overall this film lacked cohesion, focus and purpose. And somehow Kaufman's (I'm projecting/opining here) sense of arrogance and self-importance coupled with absolutely contrived dialogues/monologues (kind of reminds me of David Mamet in that way), coalesce to form an ego-heavy, pretentious, pointless exercise in futile film making.TRUST ME.

343,dennisforbes,Extraordinary movie if you approach it with the right mindset,9,27 September 2020,"A number of reviewers are approaching this movie in relation to the book. That is off the mark.

If your expectations are off, if you're agitated or upset by some of the material, maybe have your own hang-ups about aging or lost opportunities, it may be very off-putting. If you approach it with an open mind, and commit the time to just enjoying and interpreting, it can be a very enjoyable experience, if confusing at times.Having said that, I must confess that as the end credits rolled it didn't provide all of the material necessary to understand the movie. I, like so many others, had to jump online and figure out ""what was that about?"", to learn that it was the sad regrets and could-have-beens of a man in his decline, possibly suicidal.

345,louis_southwood,Another expertly crafted piece of art from Charlie Kaufman,10,5 September 2020,"I have been a huge Charlie Kaufman fan for as far back as I can remember, with Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind being one of my favourite movies of all time. I consider him to be the best screenwriter working today, each one of his scripts is so different and nuanced but at the same time feel so in touch with who we are as humans, are fears, Deaths, relationships, Are inability to truly connect to one another, all this and more is prominent throughout Kaufman's work and feels incredibly sincere and truthful in ways that no other filmmaker, as well as artist in general is able to portray in a way as significant as Kaufman can.I watched Im thinking of ending things yesterday and still have not been able to fully wrap my head around the film, there is so much to uncover and to be processed. For this movie I will need to let it sit for a few more months as trying to process it all does not happen over one night. Some may see this as a negative, However I believe that despite not being able to truly understand the movie yet, I am confident that this movie is a masterpiece.This is Kaufman's third movie in the directors' chair, having only decided to start directing his movies when Spike Jonze was unavailable for Synecdoche new York, since then he has directed all of his own scripts and with that he is now 3 for 3, the direction in this movie is immaculate. There is such an eagle eye for attention to detail throughout. The way all the filmmaking aspects come together to create this films atmosphere is brilliant. The costumes, lighting, camera movements, editing. Every aspect to this movies production just feels so precise and purposeful. Just like Synecdoche New York, which was able to hide extremely subtle clues throughout the movie visually to paint a clearer picture to the movies true nature, it's a movie that doesn't punish its audience for paying attention, which goes for this movie also, and despite the fact that Im thinking of ending things feels a lot smaller in scale compared to Kaufman's previous work, it's just as bold and daring in the way it tells its story.Every single performance throughout this movie was Master-class, Jesse Plemons, Toni Collette and David Thewlis are all actors who I have enjoyed in the past but here they each give some of their best work, however its Jessie Buckley who steals the show. She was fantastic and the way in which she can play of the other actors in the movie makes for some amazing scenes. The movie is very dialogue heavy and these actors managed to bring these conversations to life authentically and with very impressive range.In the end this movie simply blew me away. I was completely transfixed for the entire 2-hour runtime. I really cannot think of a single flaw. Pitch perfect direction, stunning cinematography, top notch performances and another audacious script from Charlie Kaufman. This is my personal favourite movie of the year so far and I cannot wait to see it again.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things
346,steve-599,"It all makes sense now, but will have to rewatch",10,16 September 2020,"I didn't read the book and I know nothing of Charlie Kaufman, so I was a complete innocent. I guessed none of the underlying meanings because I take things pretty literally until proven otherwise. I kept expecting it to go to horror rather than deeper into psychological drama. I did catch on that it was playing with time not having the usual meanings and that there was something dreamlike about it, but didn't quite take the bait to see the whole movie as a dream. So the reality of Jake's life kind of settled on me subconsciously without me realizing I was coming to see his life the way it really was rather than the way he was projecting it to be. It was pretty clear everything in the movie was meant to be symbolic, but I'm not very experienced at deciphering symbolism, so I started feeling what it meant without understanding why. I needed to read spoiler reviews to connect the dots. That said, the feelings Kaufman was trying to project using indirect language, pictures, etc., etc., got through, and seem even heavy-handed in retrospect, even though I couldn't figure out it was all wistfulness from missing out on life, which is why I need to rewatch.

347,DinosaurAct86,A confused man's sorrowful tale (my brief interpretation),10,6 September 2020,"I understand why people dislike this movie. Most people don't like to be an active participant in what we've been trained to think of as a passive medium-and that's okay, but don't judge an ""active"" movie as poorly made just because you prefer ""passive"" ones.If you are willing to actively watch and interpret what's going on with openness, you may reach the same conclusions as I have. I think this movie does make sense once you realize whose story it is.Jake is the janitor. Jake has either dementia or Alzheimer's, which can be genetic and was perhaps passed down from his father. This entire film is the attempted reconstruction of the past by someone with a confused mind, one that misremembers names, timelines, and details, but distinctly remembers movie monologues and musical numbers. The final scene, of course, never happens: it's a word-for-word (and nearly shot-for-shot remake) of the final scene of A Beautiful Mind followed by a musical number from Oklahoma. This is the ending he wanted. But that's not what really happened to him.What really happened, then? Jake cleaned the school during the blizzard, ate his lunch and watched a sappy comedy, then went off the mental deep end in his truck, where he sadly froze to death, only to be (presumably) found by the oncoming snow plow we hear in the end credits. During all of this, he's remembering a girl he met briefly at a bar, one who he's loved all his life but never spent it with. He never even learned her name. There were other women, like Lucy and Yvonne, but none of them matched how he felt about this unnamed girl. She's the one he hopes he could bring home to Mom and Dad, but he ends up piecing together experiences with other women to inform his vision of this girl with his family.Once I put all of this together, I realized just how devastating this movie is.

353,johnterrell-67238,A beautiful & unique meditation on loneliness & regret,9,15 November 2020,"Charlie Kaufman's new film ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" stars Jesse Plemons as Jake and Jessie Buckley as ""The Young Women"". The movie has been polarizing to say the least. Some of called it a strange, nonsensical and self indulgent mess, while others, such as myself, have called it the best movie of the year so far. While the movie is undoubtedly strange, on a second viewing I think many will understand that the complex puzzle that is this movie isn't unsolvable.
During my first viewing, I was mostly confused. However the message of it all didn't make sense until after the credits started rolling. I knew that his movie would be a grower (as somewhat of a revelation towards the end of the film will change your entire perception of the movie). Not too long after my first viewing, I re-watched it and completely loved it.
""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" is a resoundingly ambitious yet small scale art house film, that has you pondering throughout. The themes of loneliness, regret, fantasy, escapism, and time passing through people, really weave their way into your emotions and brain, as Kaufman delivers one of his most thought provoking films to date. Heck, he even throws in some themes of the impact of art/cinema while he's at it. It has been a while since I have watched a modern movie (that has gotten moderate attention) has had this much to say.
The plot of the movie would be hard to explain to someone, as it means multiple different things on separate viewings. The movie has the audience questioning what's real and fake. When it unravels completely and connects the puzzle pieces together, the message of the movie is 10 times more powerful. It is a unique movie. It's unarguably strange and perplexing, but it is all for the themes that Kaufman is trying to convey.
The actors all give very good performances as well. Jesse Plemons gives the most memorable performance of his career so far as Jake. Jessie Buckley, Toni Collette, and David Thewlis also all give quality performances.
I also loved the gorgeous cinematography and images in the movie. This is a good trait of many of Kaufman's movies, but I think this may be Kaufman's best looking film. The score by Jake Wadley is also remarkably elegant and I'm hoping for a Oscar nomination for the score at least.
I don't think the movie is perfect however. The film is very dialogue heavy, and while most of these conversations are very well written, introspective, and thought provoking, some just don't resonate as well (and go for a bit too long). There is also a scene or two that I think could've probably been executed better. The last 'problem' I can think of is honestly not really a flaw, but it might be for some people so I'll just say it. That 'flaw' is that the movie isn't nearly as enjoyable on the first viewing. It's fascinating, but since you are most likely confused a lot of the time, it can feel pointless and convoluted. Due to the fact that you are somewhat ambiguous to what's happening (until the end), it's not as effective. That last one all changes on a second viewing however.
All in all however, ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" is a resoundingly audacious meditation that many will love and many will hate. It's both beautiful and poignant, while being dark, unsettling, and crushingly depressing. While not a perfect movie, it is one that is unique and will sit as a gem for cinema in 2020.

355,kcskoul,Not for everyone. But if you appreciate art and you like deep philosophical thinking... It's for you!,8,12 September 2020,"It's a great and a difficult movie about life. The thing is that this movie isn't for everyone and I, basically, mean that not everyone can understand it as a piece of art. The interpretation is not like black or white, anyone can see it from many perspectives and that's what is about generally. The cinematography and the directing is amazing, it seems realistic and surrealistic at the same time and it tries to scare you in a weird way, which is preety much ""The Shining"" 's way. It also reminded me a bit of ""Get out"" but I personally think that ""Get out"" was a bit inspired from this book.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

The start of the film is lead by a monologue delivered by Jessie Buckley and we meet Jake. The film takes us through a convoluted journey but is always cinematically pleasant. The score is evenly paced and matches the tone.Unlimited references to literary works throughout. I suppose if I'd done more reading in English class maybe I would have understood more of the movie... The feelings it evokes mirror that of Mother!

362,IMDbabe1807,Does Kaufman even know what's going on?,5,24 September 2020,"I am a big fan of movies with hidden meanings which really get the viewers thinking. There were certain metaphors and double-entendres in this film which I really liked, although there were moments where a few pieces just didn't fit the puzzle. When I finally think I've figured out what it all might mean, I'll remember something else random that happened that just doesn't fit into my theory. I'd say it's definitely worth a watch to form your own opinions about what it means, but personally this film has left me feeling frustrated that I still haven't had that lightbulb moment of everything suddenly making sense. And I think watching it more times would actually make me more confused. Sometimes I wonder if Kauffman even knows exactly what it means. I do think that is kind of the point of this - there isn't really one definitive explanation, it's up to you to interpret it based upon your own perceptions. While this is something which some people understandably love, this personally doesn't sit well with me - I hate having so many unanswered questions!I must give credit to the fantastic actors which made the uncomfortable and confusing watch a bit more bearable. I was impressed with the casting of Jessie Buckley as the young woman and Jesse Plemons as Jake. I also think Toni Collette and David Thewlis gave admirable performances as Jake's parents.Overall, this film was very cleverly done, and I love Charlie Kaufman's unique style. I enjoyed some of the thought provoking and unsettling elements of this movie, however, there was something about this which just didn't quite hit the spot for me. Also, I'm just never going to be able to get that disturbing image of the shaking dog out of my head.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

(This was marketed as a Psychological Thriller which is why it popped up in my feed)1) Don't look at as a psychological thriller. I'm not entirely sure where to place this movie but it is definitely not horror.2) It does a great job of building tension so you are anticipating a jump scare or some sort of paranormal twist to occur but nope.3) It is entirely too long. If the movie was shorter I believe it would be a more tolerable watch.4) You don't need to have a MA in literature to follow the movies ideals. Plot? Possibly. The ideas of the movie? No5) The acting is good. It can be a little pretentious but I feel like if it cut down on that by like 25 minutes it would be deserving of a higher rating.Ultimately, if you have time to invest I'd recommend it. However, if you don't want your brain to do a lot of piecing together - and you want the people who get paid money to do it - this won't be the movie for you.I don't think it's worth a 2nd viewing but we're in quarantine so what else are you gonna do?",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

I praise myself as being a smart intellectually gifted and savvy viewer. I watched and enjoyed all but two of the movies written by Charlie Kaufman. I admit that I had to take a long break halfway through this movie, had a nap and the most amazingly vivid weird dream about an alternative development for GOT. ""I'm thinking of ending things"" challenged and inspired me. It is a compendium of what film can be as an art form. At times there are some scenes that reminded me of David Lynch. It is such a meta film that goes full circle beyond meta, all the while titillating the audience's knowledge of philosophy, literature and film criticism as if it was a full on caloric thought provoking Yuletide log, an erudite compendium to be savoured with eyes and ears. The cinematography is stunning, the actors (especially Tony Collette) give amazing performances and the plot, while difficult at times to follow, somehow crams into 134 minutes everything you will ever need to ponder on life, time, love and yourself.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

The main actress was so irritating that it was difficult to get past any dialogue involving her. This movie tries so incredibly hard to be ""smart"", ""thought provoking"", and ""edgy"" that is just makes you angry because it's none of those things.I am in disbelief at people saying this will win all types of awards.

371,vincedc,I'm thinking of seeing a professional...,7,20 April 2021,"I'm thinking a lot about this film. I'm thinking, I need to talk to someone about it. Maybe a professional.Charlie Kaufman has always fascinated me as a screenwriter. Like everyone else who worships him, ""Being John Malkovich"" was my gateway drug to his genius. His surreal treatment of the human condition challenges my perception of what a story should be. Of what life is. He's funny, but dark. Not for everyone's Netflix and chill evening.""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" is based on a bestseller by Reid Iain which I haven't read. The film is a psychological thriller, although that can be argued. The supernatural certainly creeps into it with Kaufman's crackerjack use of eerie camera moves, editing and music score.The pace is excruciatingly slow. You might need a couple of double espressos to make it through. The car ride at the beginning to Jake's parents house in the country takes more than 15 minutes, but the dialogue and interaction between the wonderfully quirky Jessie Buckley and the peccantly loveable Jesse Plemons engages you in some of the most exquisite lines ever put on film.Toni Collette and David Thewlis as Jake's parents deliver the kind of performance they're known for: edgy, bizarre, mystifying. I can never get enough of Thewlis. See him in Fargo season 3 and you'll be just as hooked. Make sure you watch out for the family border collie. How a dog can put me in stitches is what Kaufman is known for.When it's over, you might want those two hours from your life back or realize what you just watched was unavoidably cathartic. Except for the ending. As much as I'm a cinematic leech, I couldn't connect to draw blood. Thus, the 7 star rating.I'm thinking this might just be a beginning.

377,sean3240,My Interpretation of the Film,10,1 February 2021,"Just for the sake of ease I'll be referring to:
-The Girlfriend as: Lucy
-Younger Jake as: Jake
-Older Jake as: The JanitorI love the atmosphere created in the film, the cinematography is a big part of this, there are some really nice shots and the colours and isolated aspect ratio really help in creating the feel of this film. There is a sort of unease throughout, it never feels like this film is taking place in reality, it's very dream-like, and this feel only escalates as the film goes on.I really like what this film has to say about the problem of life imitating art. The Janitor watches these cheesy romantic movies and instead of relating to them and interpreting them for himself, as you should with art, he instead desires what he watches, he escapes into their world because he doesn't get the romance he wants in his own life. This is pretty clearly shown when Lucy literally becomes a character from the movie that The Janitor was watching earlier.The film also shows the effect our upbringing has on who we are today. As the film is technically from The Janitors perspective, every character is shown to us how he sees them, through this we can see the resentment he feels towards his mother. Whether she was truly like that or not, from his perspective, his mother is shown to be quite demeaning to him, she doesn't make many positive comments about him, and when she does they're bittersweet backhanded compliments. We see this clearly at one point when his mother says she is proud of what Jake has done considering how ungifted and untalented he is.Another theme that is shown well in the film is the conflict we feel within ourselves. The Janitor clearly has problems with who he is now and wishes to be the younger, 'better' version of himself, however that person is him, and so is everyone else in the story. We are introduced to everyone through The Janitors memories and the narrative he's made up in his own head so the versions we see of them are The Janitor. That means when there is a conflict between any characters, that is a conflict he feels within himself. This shows us how he is not happy with who he is, he doesn't even respect the way he thinks, as at one point Lucy calls his mother 'cold' and then Jake refutes her statement, even though we know from how his mother was presented to us that he probably does think this of her. I think it's also interesting to note, that while most likely unintentional, Jake and Lucy are both played by actors named Jessie/Jesse which is very fitting.Besides the flashbacks in the book the events of both the film and movie are very similar. The story is basically about the state of mind someone might be in when they decide to take their own life. The book and movie however tackle it in very different ways both tonally and thematically.For me, the book felt a lot more like a fantasy to The Janitor, rather than a representation of where he is emotionally. I felt that in the book he was imaging he had a girlfriend, rather than reflecting on a past relationship, as I feel he was in the movie. I think Lucy (who isn't even named in the book) not existing plays a lot more into the creepiness which is more present in the book, and therefore I think Kaufman was absolutely right to change this aspect of it, as it wouldn't have fit into how the film was executed.The book was creepy, it was suspenseful and verging on horror. I was scared at times while reading it and also very suspicious of Jake, who a lot of the time came across like a serial killer. It made me think a tragic end for the character of the girlfriend was coming, which is why it made it all the more surprising when the book ended with Jake killing himself and revealing that the girlfriend was non-existent.Rather than being creepy and suspenseful, the movie was manic and hilarious in a weird and dark way. Because the suspense didn't build here the same way it did in the book, the ending to the film had to be different, it wouldn't have been as effective otherwise. While the film's ending wasn't as surprising, it was a more satisfying and effective ending to the story, while also leaving us with more questions and ways to interpret it.I have seen people complaining about the film and that the ending of the book should've been used in the movie, but I don't really agree with this. While the movie and book have roughly the same events, they carry very different themes and are executed in vastly different ways. The conclusion to the book would've felt way off in a movie like this so I feel the ending to this film fit perfectly.One of the greatest things about the ending was the dance scene. I saw that scene as representing how The Janitor saw things really taking over his life. In the dance, The Janitor represents what he sees as the negative aspects of himself. Unfortunately for him, he is The Janitor now, and through the dance we see he's ashamed of that, and that he ruined the life of the more hopeful, younger version of Jake, who in the dance he literally kills, showing us he feels that the person who he wishes he was, and used to be, was robbed of life by the person he is now. The Janitor took Jakes girlfriend away from the both of them and then killed him, leaving only The Janitor. He himself is the only one responsible for the person he is today and that is why he's thinking of ending things.I'd like to note though that I don't think this film is condoning suicide, it isn't giving a justified reason for it. We're not supposed to think the person Jake is today is disgusting and deserves to die, we just need to understand this is how he sees himself.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

The movie was bearable to watch only because Toni Collette is a good actress and she indeed was amazing in the little role that she played.The 3 stars that I am giving is for the cinematographer Lukasz Zal. A round of applause to him.

First act is the journey to the ""farmy"" area to jake's parents and how awkward it's between them and we hear the inner thought of the girlfriend wanting to ending things while being interrupted for a random yet confusing topics. I think Jessie Buckley carried that whole first act.
Second act is the arrival of them to his parents house and how they are welcoming her yet annoying Jake. And let me say that this act was bizarre and confusing and i think was the most bizarre act i have seen in a while.
Third act and after that rollercoaster of thriller and confusion is the journey back home or as we think it is and it does continue the rhythm of you thinking "" there is something wrong in this movie i can feel it "".Finally i think the movie is about aging and loneliness and i think that this is all a dying ""lonely"" man memory trying to collect memories from here and there. Trying to think that he was a quantum physics scientist, poet, ""genus"", painter and had a loving girlfriend, family that supported him and was there at his biggest moment in life that he would love to have rather than being a janitor and returning to an empty home with no one but himself and his thoughts about what could've been if he wasnt a janitor and worked hard and reached what he hoped he'd be in life.I really liked the cinematography, the acting, the bizarre screenwriting and the thoughts it puts in your head, but i guess it was too bizarre that you'd get lost in the middle, and maybe even lose interest? not in my case but i think it'd be common.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

So much dialogue and academia name dropping, it was hard to keep focus and care what was going on. The 2nd half of the movie went to a whole other planet and by then it was too late to try and understand or again care what was going on.

I was actually ready to miss some potential crucial information or plot twist, as it had become so painful to endure. The singing scene was also a challenge to get through. I understand what the director was going for, I appreciated the acting and some of the beautiful shots.

As well as the scene of ice cream, how he was afraid of the two girls, evidence of his life in adolescence and youth, how he was isolated and always prone to bullying, except for the girl whose condition was similar.
Even the imaginations were similar to our dreams that sometimes they were messed up, and he was seeing mother and father at different stages of their lives, and even the symbolism of ice cream boxes in the school trash bin, evidence of the multiplicity of their failed relationships or fictional relationships that even with a fantasy he was seeing a failed and unfit soul for him to live
And at the end of the film, as the title, he decided to end his miserable life and commit suicide and remain dead in a car on which snow is piled up.
A very terrifying movie that leaves you feeling strange and frustrating, especially for fans of movies and series that we sometimes flee from our reality to fantasy worlds. We do not live experiences that belong to us because of the diversity of our reasons from person to person

The people that think it's ""artsy farts""...well ya...they have a point, but most movies are considered art anyways.
Really you just need to be more familiar with Kaufman to possibly get it, which he actually thinks ""every interpretation is right"", so if you're just thinking ""wtf did this guy take?"" Or ""wtf did I just take?"" Then according to the mastermind himself, you are correct!However, I am in fact a fan of Kaufman's films and even I needed assistance on this one so I had to trek into some interviews on the matter.
Turns out I wasn't too terribly far off, but reading up on it really helped.
So I got the gist early on that ""Lucy/Lucia/Ames"" wasn't real and that the janitor was Jake.
Truthfully that's as far as I got, but it sure was a heck of a ride!
Now for more details from the K-Man (and pulling from John Malcovich) the story takes place in Jake's head. It's why his parents were aging in all directions and everything was always changing, because his imagination was as well. He would play out different timelines in which she would fit in his life, different personalities she could have, and even different occupations. Now the kicker is that allll of these are taken from books/media.
The big giveaway is when the janitor is watching that film, in which later it's exactly how Jake meets his ""girlfriend"", with at one point she even turned into the actress from the film to really send that message.
Now at the end he comes to the conclusion that there's no way he would ever have a girlfriend (not even a made up one) thus him dying alone with his animated pig.It's a trip, but a good one if you're up for the ride.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

A master of his craft. A genius (or is that genus?) of a literate mind communicated onto screen, exploring the complexity of human emotion within fantasy vs reality.. Like all of his work, the more you study / re-watch, the more you uncover and begin to understand.Here we have another interpretational puzzle from Kaufman... again, with themes of existentialism focusing on relationships and time / age ( ""Getting old ain't for sissies"" - Bette Davis). Weathered 20 or 30 somethings Jake and the young woman with no name are six weeks into their relationship and they are off to visit Jake's parents. Early on we hear the young woman's inner monologue - ""I'm thinking of ending things"" then later she voices. ""people stay in unhealthy relationships because it's easier, basic physics"" so what's is going to happen....will the relationship ever end? Wait, is this relationship even real? Why doesn't she have a name?....well I guess you'll have to watch it.Kaufman writes dialogue that intrigues and stimulates, with nuggets of humour - A fly on a wall would stick around if it understood the English language. It almost feels like you're listening to an audiobook at times, but with visuals (I swear, I did not pick this up from Kermode...pure coincidence) - It's conversationally plentiful. Lines like '""Animals live in the present, humans do not, so they invented hope"" are as interesting and clever as an Oscar Wilde quote, who is recited in the film.Other creatives mentioned in conversation include Andrew Wyeth, John Cassavetes, William Wordsworth, David Foster Wallace and Anna Kavan to name a few, affirming cultivated characters, and they even get creative themselves ""Get your words' worth with Wordsworth - Jack""",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

That's what makes it my favorite film of all time. Kaufman took iain reid's story and turned it into a visual masterpiece. The color pallet does an excellent job of conveying sadness and a feeling of unease. Some people gave it bad reviews because it made them nauseous but i think that's what makes it great, it has the ability to evoke that feeling. Even without the color pallet, it's an uneasy movie full of awkward yet terrifying moments. The book is also incredibly good, it's able to evoke the same feelings without the advantage of visuals which i feel, don't necessarily make it better, but add to it in a way that makes it wonderful.

Some of us will unfortunately fail to connect with others, or never take that leap of faith, and even more painstakingly so, some of us might not be able to handle all the opportunities missed, the choices never made, and the people never met, which could end up a very hard and lonely life which leaves you feeling and thinking like there is only one option... ending things.Due to its simple premise and its brilliant trailer, 'I'm Thinking Of Ending Things' leads you astray from the real story that lies within, for instance, when you combine the premise of the film with the trailer, and then read the title, you instantly believe you're about to witness the breakdown of a relationship, where in the end, the young lady respectively ""ends things,"" and then once you've viewed the film and look back at the title, you realise what was in front of you the whole god damn time. It's a true testament to Kaufman's pure ingenuity and ability to confuse audiences with his writing, right up until he wants you to finally see the full picture.But this is not the only ploy used to stimulate confusion from the writer/director, he also uses some rather magnificent technical tricks with the fluidity of the camera movement, brilliant editing, smooth transitioning, incredible set designs and some masterful and extremely detailed use of props, costumes and cosmetics.The performances from the duo Jessie's are both nothing short of spectacular. Buckley once more reaffirms why she is one of the best working today with a performance that would test even the most revered stars. Her character is forever changing, from personalities to accents, and she's constantly adapting to her surroundings, which may I add are moving at a particularly brisk pace. The range of emotion pervaded through her telling eyes and facial expressions truly shone through in every scene. Her delivery of the dialogue provided especially deserves attention, because you feel every line, and I have to say, there are a lot of lines. She is truly special this one! Plemons gives what could be called the best performance of his career, he was given such brilliant material to bring to life and he did so in such a marvellous fashion. You can feel the confusion, anger and frustration permeating from his characters aura. Top work.The mind is a very powerful thing, and Kaufman and his crew plays on the senses multiple times, leaving you to not only question what is real, the choices you've made, and what is now, but also what was, what may of been, what could be to late to be, and what could still be.

Another example,after we see her showing Jake's parents some of the paintings she has done,those exact same paintings appear in Jake's room too indicating they are actually what he has drawn in real life.

Unamed female main character is visiting her relatively new boyfriend's parents. After the visit they get some cold drinks and Jake insists on dumping them somewhere. They drive to an old high school to dump them. Jake throws them away and comes back and starts to make out with his girlfriend. He sees a guy watching them and goes in to fight him. Never comes back. Girlfriend goes in after him revealing that they are the same person and Jake is thinking of ending his own life.
Some details are off.
They get lemonades in the book instead of ice cream. Because girlfriend is lactose intolerant. Very small detail, I know. And I don't really care if they got that right or not. Etc.
I also don't know why they cast A-list actors for the parents. The parents are barely in the book.
The book is like 150 pages of backstory, 40 are meeting the parents and the rest is the ending! I would've liked to see the part in the book with the security cameras and the red paint and all the creepy stuff in the school.
I sort of get the metaphor of Jake singing this heartbreaking ballad and then dying. What the heck was the interpritive dance supposed to mean?? I see that it represents a relationship. You see them get ""married"" and then a janitor kills ""Jake?"" What?? I'm very confused.
I'm very impressed that with almost no gore and no jumpscares it manages to be a very scary film.
Sort of beautiful in a way. I know that some fellow fans of the book will be kind of confused and others will think differently. This is the first Charlie Kaufman film I've ever seen. (I'm in high school.) My dad tells me that this is his thing. That he makes very confusing and ambiguous films sooo... I don't know.
Overall, very creepy story. Love the actors!
I've seen Jessie Buckley in Judy and she was great. Never seen Jesse Plemons before but I will definitely check out his other work. I've seen Toni Colette in Knives Out! And she was awesome. I've seen David Thewlis in Harry Potter and The Theory Of Everything. Weird to see him much older. Glad he is still acting!This movie kind of reminds me of Get Out in a way.I recommend this film if you want to get into horror but you're kind of sensitive to scary movies.

While I can appreciate that it was shot well, has a good plot, and very good dialogue - the payoff came far too late for a layman viewer to enjoy or celebrate. If you are a true arthouse film veteran and enjoy dissecting a film over multiple viewings back to back with deep cuts to other parts of the industry, this film is for you. If you do not consider yourself in the upper crust of ""film as art"" critics, this film is likely not for you.The Good:The film has an expert craft quality to it. The acting and dialogue is absolutely superb with an attention to detail we rarely see from most directors these days. I (not unlike RedLetterMedia) will always support a director having complete creative control and bringing his vision to life.The Bad:The film views similarly to a Jackson Pollock to those uninitiated to the art world. If you do not find yourself with a complete understanding of various parts of the film industry, including its history, or do not find yourself enjoying having to do research to figure out what these characters are talking about then I predict you will fall asleep within the first half of the film. This is no-doubt an expert film for those who love the directors work, but for 80% of the audience that will check out this film, I would not suggest sitting through it.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

454,Rob_Innes23,Monotonously ostentatious.,4,9 September 2020,"Hi, my names Charlie Kaufman and welcome to my film that is comprised of two things: Jesse Plemons and Jessie Buckley sitting in a car, discussing pseudo intellectual, pretentious topics that ultimately mean nothing in relation to what's actually happening (which is also virtually nothing) and some scenes in a house that jump between time for no logical reason at all. Oh and also the last 40 minutes is an incomprehensible pile of nonsense.On a purely technical level, this film displays levels certainly way above standard filmmaking competence, but that does not excuse how aimless this artsy guff really is. It's barely interesting enough to keep you going but, as I said before, the ending isn't remotely worth your patience.It's also just such a miserable experience. Now, I'm not saying that every film needs to be easily digestible and inherently positive, of course not. What I am saying however is that this film is incredibly preachy, it just comes off like a sadist wrote this to make his audience have an existential crisis after every ten minutes of watching this morose, bleak film.I have very mixed feelings on Kaufman's work overall. I liked some of it such as Anomalisa and films that he didn't direct, but wrote like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich but some of his other stuff just did not stick with me. Take Synecdoche, New York for example, the performances and technical stuff is all great (like this film) but it's just so overly speculative and odd for my taste, although I definitely preferred it to this.This is beyond an 'art film', it's just pretentious and I'm actually annoyed that I've p**sed away two hours of my time watching this.4/10.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

Surely to have finally Wordsworth and Guy Debord mentioned to bring some intellectual pickles is an epiphany for a media that is fearfully inferior to its bookish counterpart; it is to praise the recognition of its inferiority that the mentioned writers add to the rest of the frames the same message, i.e. 'whether you catch them or skip them, the indifference they bring to the consecutive safe musing is the same'.

466,consciousgeometry,"Bloated, tonally confused and overly nihilistic - still interesting",6,14 September 2020,"I thought the pig was very cool. Other than that, the ever compounding navel-gazing nihilism of characters bored with their own inadequacy, and their inability to communicate anything meaningful beyond standard intellectual tropes, was a bummer. The movie -- because otherwise it wouldn't be Kaufman-- is pedantically self-aware, which extends to the protagonists who frequently engage in off-handed existential debates without conviction. Sure, that is kind of the point. But there is something obnoxiously joyless about taking fairly interesting concepts (TV-show plots are like viruses that just want to find a home in our minds/ Peoples' selves are not their 'own creations', and more of a mosaic of opinions and facts they have absorbed from others/etc) and scattering them onto every other scene, merely to have the characters make one more remark upon whose conclusion they can look miserably out the window.As many have said, the basic idea behind the movie, combined with the apt setting of a road trip, a creepy farm, the rural menacing tedium in general, has a lot of potential to create an unnerving atmosphere. Had the movie been more grounded, had there been more actually coherent scenes --less inter-cutting, fewer abrupt transitions, fewer aggressive 4th wall-breaking-- it might have managed to be unsettling. As Kaufman chose to construct it, it never convinces you (never tries, actually) that anything within it is more than a clever artifice propped up to sermonize about the various dreadful aspects of the human condition. The film can't help but constantly blow its load and become very very explicit about its themes and how much of a surreal fantasy it is, as opposed to a straightforward narrative, so that it rarely manages to create a visceral moment of tension. There's also a weird amnesiac quality to it: Sometimes the narrative will forget about the multitude of loads already blown, and after having served up what seems like a complete deconstruction of the plot, tries to return to a sense of normalcy, as though nothing has happened. At these points, the execution doesn't seem willfully idiosyncratic anymore, and rather just shoddy.However, by sheer virtue of the great acting and universally relatable themes being brought up over and over again (what is success? aging is scary; dying is scary; being a nobody is scary; what is art; what it's purpose?) it can become 'engrossing' and thought provoking. But even when thoughts were provoked, I felt annoyed at the bluntness and self-indulgence of the scenes giving rise to them. Side-note: visually the movie had some truly high heights, but was as inconsistent as its structure. In my view it should have been much darker, less saturated, which would not only have fit the story better, but also made sense in that the cinematographer already showed the amazing atmospheres he's capable of creating in Ida.Not that anybody should give a damn, but this may be the movie that makes me change my mind about Kaufman (still, I will always love Being John Malkovich). I read the book only because I heard about this film-project, and even though I wasn't fully amazed by it, it was the much more interesting experience among the two. Whereas the novel had a fresh angle, this just felt like ""Kaufman film #X"": The protagonists are not people --not even archetypes-- but collections of abstract sentiments; there is dreamlike/meta-stuff, that has an awkward theatrical vibe; everybody is sort of miserable by default; things seem somewhat normal at the beginning, and head towards a crescendo of self-reference and incoherent existential musings.He did it much better in Synecdoche (in a sense, the protagonists of both stories try to accomplish a similar thing in very different ways). This one feels like a remake of that movie that wasn't constructed from the ground up, but instead injected into and parasitically reared in the body of a pretty decent and sparse, albeit mostly unrelated, horror novel. I think it is worth watching, however, because it's the kind of work whose potency may very much vary, depending on the mood you're in. Being far from an optimistic, jolly person myself, I personally still found myself not only bored, but acutely annoyed, by Kaufman's thousandth attempt to show us the hypocrisy, arbitrariness and wretched misery that is apparently the life of every vaguely self-reflective modern middle class individual.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

489,mskirollos,"Unsettling, nightmarish.. among the best in recent years",7,6 October 2020,"If there's a writer-director who I'd be willing to watch his intellectual *** on screen for over 2 hours, it'd be Charlie Kaufman (writer of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Adaptation). Like philosophical novels, I'm thinking of Ending Things takes the form of film as a vehicle for a philosophical discourse on loneliness, hopelessness, and the passage of time.Based on the novel by the same, the film starts with a young woman who is heading with her new boyfriend to meet his parents in a secluded house under heavy snow, and from the outset, we get hints that things are not quite how they seem.Kaufman does very well to create an unsettling, nightmarish mood that provides a perfect backdrop for the intellectual dialogue, helped by the brilliant cinematography and the muted tones.Admittedly, the film can feel a bit too long and slightly overdone at times particularly with the heavy subject matter, but the clever intellectual dialogue, the continuous references to other works of art, and the clues that are regularly dropped to paint a clearer picture of what's going on help the film from drowning under its own weight.From the opening sequence, the vertical frame compositions in 4:3 aspect ratio brought to my mind a personal film favourite from the last decade, Ida (Pawel Pawlikowski, 2013), and was interested to discover that Kaufman collaborated here with the same cinematographer, Lukasz Zal. The aspect ratio helped add to the intense sense of claustrophobia that gets more powerful as the film goes on.
Kaufman's film with its mood and heavy subject matter might not have a mass appeal, but it is among the best this year, and perhaps in recent years.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

500,ellishnoo,Arrogant self indulgent meaningless adaptadion of a great book,1,5 September 2020,"Great actors, acting, scenery, words, premise........
But it all falls flat on itself
with the obsession to paint a story of how society and ourselves fear our mortality
and the ignorant young
who demand equality and respect for everything
BUT their own maturityMost people who are conceived
Never are born,
and even less reach midlifeThis movie is typical of this new generation
that likes to act so educated
so evolved - so inciteful whilst having no original thoughtThe director took a great book
stole interesting concepts
and then threw them in the air
and only chose those who landed faceup
and then added some random extra featuresThis move keeps on making you think there will be a reason to it
but its just a beautfiul waste of time
I hated it and loved it
but would have rather not wasted 1.30 hours of my life!I love movies, used to work in a video shop
have seen nearly every important movie in last 70
hardly ever watchin one twice
But I hate the medium of movies compared to music
To truly give a movie a chance you must watch the whole thing
Give up your time for someones story to play out
only to often find in the last few minutes
it meant nothing
the ending was stupid
nothing really was connected
its like a joke
But the jokes on us
Wish movies would be like songs
only3 minutes
and you could tell instantly if it was gonna grove you out
instead Movie makers demand our time
how many years have I wasted watching movies
that like this movie look great
have all the content to make a profound impact on youBut in the end
This movie was just saying
life gives you hope
humans make words to give life hope
but most of us never get what we want
and if we do its spoiled by the fact that your happiness is at others expenseTake a selfie
and say Im wonderful
This is all the movie is worth
a snapshot of self indulgent FLUFF
This is wh
But all this move is a jumbl
The arrogance of youth
created this almost play
where nothing makes sense",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

502,erickdalexandrie,Another movie that relies solely on its director's name,1,5 September 2020,"After I watched the trailer I couldn't wait to see this movie. I love eerie, surreal movies that make you wonder what the f is going on, but only WHEN IT'S DONE WELL. That is clearly not the case here. This is just one of those cases in which the fame went to the director's head, making he feel like everything he does is genius work. His reputation is also responsible for 90% of the reviews praising this movie.Where do I start? It should be a huge red flag that both good and bad reviews here are telling you that you can only understand the movie if you have read the book. That's like selling you a bad chocolate and telling you that you can only appreciate if you have eaten cocoa beans before. Thanks, but if I wanted cocoa I would have bought cocoa, not chocolate. AN ADAPTATION IS SUPPOSED TO ADAPT, it should work on its own, and not as a supporting feature.About the movie itself, it's just painfully boring. Some things happen, sure, and it's a relief when they do, because a huge chunk of this movie is a boring couple having a very unnatural, pedantic and awkward conversation. I think there are 4 scenes in the car, one of them takes almost 20 minutes.The dialogue in the family house is tense and creepy, but it gets old quickly.
It goes like this: the mother laughs too much, the dad says something weird but innocent, Jake seems annoyed, the girl looks confused but starts to talk again, then the mother laughs and it goes on and on. I know it's intentional, but it's just boring and this repetition ruined the little tension this movie had in the beginning. After they leave the house the movie gets progessively worse, with more boring scenes in the car and then more ""creepy"" surreal stuff that you don't care about anymore because you already gave up and started scrolling through your phone.What TRULY ruins this movie are the aforementioned horrible scenes in the car! WHY, CHARLIE? WHY? Why did you think those entire scenes were essential to the plot? Why would you START the movie with a scene like that? You could have told a lot without needing 10, 15 or almost 20 minutes of mindless chit-chatting inside of a car. I wish the editor a good recovery from Covid-19, because I can only assume he was sick and you guys thought ""whatever, I know we should cut 40 minutes from this movie but what the hell, people will love it before they watch it because it's a Charlie Kaufman movie"". I honestly feel sorry for anyone who gave this movie a try thinking its quality would be similar to that of Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind.The ending, well, I didn't watch it, nor I will, but I've read about it here and I don't feel like I'm missing anything. There's one review here that explains the book and compares it to the movie, which made me hate this movie even more. Reading that review was far more entertaining than this movie.IF you want to watch a very good creepy and surreal movie, watch ""Mother!"".",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

It's complex and in a slow pace talks about existialism and how to endure a support ourselves and the differences of another's in a short but at the same time , an eternal loop of happenings and mundane quotidian. Sometimes life is unbearable even with people around who love us. But some people don't see the real love behind.
For me is a abstract love story of acceptance of ourselves and understanding of the world and others.

504,gregflakus,A Film for Adults who crave intellectual stimulation,9,6 September 2020,"This is not a mass market entertainment film that allows you to park your brain next to the popcorn bowl while watching. This is a film that challenges you in many ways, but it is not inaccessible to an average viewer. You just have to sit back and take it for what it is. Don't look for a traditional story line. Don't look for some revealing explanation of everything.The film starts with a couple talking in a car as they drive through a snowy environment. From the start we learn that the young woman is having doubts about the relationship and in her mind asks the question that provides the film's title. But as things move forward (are they moving forward or backward?) we begin to question the true nature of the people we see and where we are in time and space. There are numerous references to historic as well as literary figures, which is intriguing if you are well read, but could be off-putting to an average viewer. Some might even hurl the term ""pseudo-intellectual"" at the filmmakers. But let's give writer/director Charlie Kaufman some slack and assume he has drawn on these sources for a reason; that he is exploring issues that should be of interest to all of us as human beings.The film has many references to historic and cultural figures, which can be illuminating, but you don't have to be familiar with every person cited to enjoy the film. If you pay close attention you will see items and hear quick statements that telegraph an issue or even a cultural figure that will come up later. For example, the young woman (the excellent Irish actress Jessie Buckley) is exploring the childhood room of her boyfriend (Jesse Plemons) and we see a pile of books on the top of which is a large volume by the late film critic and essayist Pauline Kael. Later, on their drive home, she and her partner discuss a movie that he liked. She then goes into a long recitation of what I assume was Pauline Kael's New Yorker article on the film.There are touches of Kubrick in this film, especially in the staging and composition. Fans of David Lynch will find a lot to love as well. There is a bizarre scene at an ice cream stand on winter's night that could have been created by Lynch. There are also some scenes that reminded me of Terrence Malick. If you are not a fan of those kind of films, this may not be for you.I enjoyed this movie for its style, the acting, the cleverness of the script, the beauty of the cinematography and the dreamy exposition that leaves you wanting more. Within hours of my first viewing, I watched it again. People who have read the book it is based on say it helps, but I think the film works just as well without being tied too closely to the book. They are each distinct forms of art. Just watch it and don't try to figure it out as you do so. Just go with it and think about it later.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

Fun experiments with the storytelling but all over the place. It's weird from the offset, and stays at that level of weird, but without validation. I've seen people compare it to the Twilight Zone, but it's far more hollow.Spoiler bit; on the drive back from the parents house, about half way through this overly long film, there is real obvious dialog about how it's clearly about Jake and not the woman. However, the whole film tries to discuss feminism is a nuanced way, then thinks it has a 'gotcha' moment when it flips to become his story. This felt a little obvious and left a bad taste when they dedicated at least 10 minutes to the idea that women shouldn't be used as props for men.

511,rhett-46260,Wanting to Be Something More,1,12 November 2020,"I'm very careful not be overly critical, and as I'm thinking about this film, there are tangent ideas and plot moments that felt like they could lead into something substantive, but honestly as a whole the film feels like the arrogant rambling journal entries of a writer who thinks they're super deep. It struggles to actually connect with something relatable because as we travel down one analogy, we seem sidestepped by another.Some spoilers:The parent visit was fun, it seemed creepy, felt like it may go somewhere, and honestly, I thought, what if they are experiencing them in the future in some weird out of time experience. The dialogue in the car to and from the parents house was awful though. It was soooooo rife with random quotes and forced melancholy that it felt almost pretentious. I don't care how educated someone is, if I had those conversations with someone, I'd interject frequently to tell them they're full of it.We broke off to the ice cream shop, then the school, and I got real confused as to where the plot was supposed to be going. As we met the janitor, it became pretty clear that Jake was real and the janitor, but that the girl was less relevant and more a projection and object of the man's loneliness which frankly is just an annoying turn. I would have loved to see that more clearly signaled, especially at the end as we follow the janitor through a suicidal moment after his shift. Instead the strings to bring it together seemed to get tangled up in a corny, but beautiful ballet routine, followed by a cartoon come to life covering the janitors junk, and a comic book style makeup job of some grand speech he imagined himself giving. The extremes trying to tie things together at the end felt like maybe I got the whole film wrong twice and maybe he's suffering from dementia, but ultimately it just drops off with a meh song about being alone and leaves you just kind of scratching your head. I love a movie that makes me think, but there's an important line in writing between creating a complex narrative vs. creating a story that is messy for art sake with no real path or message. There may have been a purpose, but if it's so easily missed than it ultimately isn't affective.I gave this film a 1-star because while I stayed to the end hoping for some significant theme or plot point to tie up the confusion, it never came along. When I finished I started looking online for a theme assuming I'm just too thick to see a good thread, and what I found I saw, but didn't really connect in a way that was meaningful. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone because ultimately I rather promote films and stories that focus the effort on communicating a cohesive story.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

515,bijoubrown,Spring of His Zombiedom,7,5 September 2020,"If this movie were a smell it'd be mildew jello scent; it's pungent but not pugnacious. This movie is a frenetic mumblecore with a dash of surrealistic enigma. Hearing the titular inner dialogue of Lucy (I'm thinking of ending things), evoked a sense of self-administered annihilation rather than a longing to break-up with a romantic partner (never do we really see Jake and Lucy be truly romantic--their interactions are more like two ping pong paddles trying to bounce a boulder). There's a sense of rot and decay, like mold, from the beginning, and as rot goes, the movie continues to rhapsodically wane throughout until an end comes. There's also a sense of specific decrepitude which is pushed forward very literally via quantum physics (funnily enough Lucy is studying quantum physics). Jake and Lucy seem like walking corpses who wax poetic. As the characters express themselves through platitudes, the audience feels less and less like they are real people but more like marionettes.This movie is about time, loneliness, and repetition. The course of the characters is like a never-ending staircase or elevator where the sense of up or down, or forwards or backwards, is lost, like the pit of despair. The snow laden abyss that surrounds them very literally encompasses the loneliness the characters feel. The progression of the characters was like watching two tectonic plates crash and overlap, making a new alien landscape. This movie is seemingly also about identity and denial: Jake's struggle to find and accept himself, maybe even his own sexuality. Jake seems to live his life through the eyes of others, like a very lonely wannabe bard, and maybe Lucy is his fantasized doppelgänger or salvation. Jake is an outcast, almost like he's a burden to society or he has manifested himself as so, and Lucy is his tool to be involved in life.This movie is like a moving American Goth, if it had been painted by Caravaggio. There's nothing outwardly vicious but there is a grotesqueness in it's stylistic delivery.This movie feels like an odyssey. We know Lucy wants and needs to go home, but she's thinking of ending things, so it seems as though ""home"" might be inevitable death (maybe the family farm is limbo). The characters are tackling demise, but maybe this screenplay is a quest to a higher knowledge of mortality. Every word is like a razor blade, creating a sense of uncertainty and unease. The background to this odyssey is like a labyrinth and everything surrounding Jake and Lucy seems like a facade.I love how this movie was framed; it felt very claustrophobic, almost tactile and nauseating, as if the viewer is living out this nightmare through the eyes of Lucy.
The scenes with Jake's parents plays out like a nonlinear flip book of birth, life, death, human connection and cognitive experience. The consistent mentions of art and artists feels like a study in Ayn Rand's philosophy, like feeling is only known through superficial art.I was scared for Lucy throughout, and thought Jake was scary, but nearing the end I felt scared for Jake, sensing his doom and melancholy. In the end there's a relieving acceptance and that is cathartic in a weird way. To sum up this movie: so weird but so wonderful.This movie is like a long, beautiful bee sting. It's a thought-provoking movie with a unique, neurotic flair.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

When you watch a movie or a TV show, you are expecting something, be it mystery, horror, suspense, comedy, drama, story etc. or just finding some meaning after the movie ends. And I get the fact that certain pieces of work (talking about movies here) can be classified as art. And this movie comes under none of those categories. You are just blindly watching something while having a feeling that what you are interpreting is the right thing. But if that's the case, you can sum up the entire movie in 20 mins. There is no need to spend so much time building something when the audience can't get something out of it. This would have been better as a Broadway show maybe. It seems there is a book on which this movie is made from. Maybe one should read that book and forget about this movie ever existing.Now before I end this review, I wanted to compare this movie with Interstellar (which is my most favorite movie of all time). Interstellar at face value isn't all that good. But it has a deeper meaning while also being one of, if not the best sci-fi movies ever produced (with the brilliance of Christopher Nolan of course) and grounded in reality (for the most part).

This movie made me feel sad from start to finish as I had expected, they did cut out the suicide of Jake, I expected that much, but It's alright.
As for quality, this movie is good, above average. Toni Colette delivers like always, Jesse Plemons was the right choice for this movie and all actors were right. Nice work Netflix. The screenplay was top notch, Charlie Kaufman clearly wrote new stuff for this movie and it is amazing. He is an Oscar winner in the screenplay category. One flaw I found was the inorganic change in sequences, I get that it was intentional but had the changes in sequences been made a little more fluid, I would have given this movie 10 stars.

543,gamergod69,The End of Evangelion: Redux,8,4 September 2020,"Quarantined. In our minds, that is! This film (and I'm assuming the novel it's based off of) explores the inner workings of modern society and how we cope with the coldness that continues to surround the human race, how we close ourselves off out of fear of ourselves, and how we escape from ourselves. How time weighs down on the mind until we don't know what our lives look like anymore. Why we take actions, no matter how much it hurt at the end of it, whether it be a night with a 2nd rate boyfriend's parents, or living out an fantastical idea of life with someone you don't recognize until it's too late.While not a spectacle feast, Kaufman shows a lot of restraint to create a pinch perfect tight, lonely atmosphere full of things, lifeless things that fill up our lives. The cinematography adds to this feeling as well, and when it needs to convey an idea, you feel it. When it does need to get more technical, everything is the special effects/makeup departments was very well done. Everything on the technical department was very well done.The two main questions I have coming out of this film are:
1) Is the ability to watch a movie without understanding it's themes a valuable asset?This film feels more like a long essay than a narrative driven story, and you can only truly enjoy it (from what I'm seeing) if you have a deeper understanding of cinema.2) Should it matter if I disagree with the film's themes?I disagree with a lot of the notions Kaufman makes in this script about humanity, and while I would usually not really care, if the whole point of watching this specific movie is to gather meaning from it's themes, why shouldn't I rate it lower if the themes don't necessarily makes sense to me?While I don't know the answer to either of these questions, I still enjoyed the film quite a bit.

549,TheHound16,"Kaufman Didn't Properly ""End Things""",5,5 September 2020,"I had the pleasure of reading Iain Reid's book a few years ago, and remember devouring it in practically one sitting. The biggest takeaway from me was the incredibly eerie tone throughout, the multitude of questions I had, and then the shocking plot twist that gave the title ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" an entirely new and powerful meaning.
I am a fan of Kaufman's work, and was excited when I learned he was adapting this wonderful, creepy, and thought-provoking book. However, after watching it, I feel like his entire approach to the novel was a big mistake and took away most of what made it an entertaining and powerful story.
So, before I go into my biggest problems with the way this was handled, I have to say that clearly most of my opinions are based on having read the book beforehand. Therefore, I genuinely cannot say how I would feel about this film if I didn't have that prior knowledge and comparison. Others may very well enjoy this film and think it strong, but compared to the book...well let's get into that.1) THE TONE
My biggest takeaway when reading the book was that, though there was a very strong off-key/strange feeling to the characters and events, you were never entirely sure what was wrong, nor did you fully know it wasn't based in reality. This gave the story a very creepy and unpredictable quality that kept you guessing.
Though I have enjoyed Kaufman's surrealist images in his past films - this sense of dream-like scenes - from the first meeting with the parents at the farm, you immediately and undoubtably know this story isn't based in reality. I know this is a deliberate approach Kaufman chose, especially since he continually interweaves it with images of the janitor at the school, but I feel like it takes away from the spine of the story itself. Because of this, the eeriness from the book was largely gone and I found myself less interested in what I was watching because it lacked any grounding.2) LENGTH/EDITING
Much of this film feels very dragged out. I have a high tolerance for what others consider ""slower"" films, but in this case I feel that every change of scenery (the car, the farm, back to the car, the school) were long, dragged out scenes that could've used with moments of better pacing or editing. For example, in the beginning Buckley's character quotes a poem that she wrote. There were many interesting aspects of this poem, but it began to drag on and I came in and out of focus. Just one example in a film that could've used stronger editing or script tightening.3) THEMES
I give Kaufman credit for taking certain themes in the book, like aging, and crafting impactful commentary on how people are treated, looked at, and how they feel about their own lives as they age.
However, I do feel that - though oftentimes beautiful - some of these themes were too on-the-nose at certain points, therefore lessening its impact. I feel this happened more commonly towards the end of the film, once they got to the school (ex. The conversation around ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" felt more preachy, rather than a genuine conversation, or a written scene that added any original thought to this conversation. Just one example.)4) THE ENDING
This is the biggest problem and why the final shot of this film feels less like a button and more like a ""is it over?""
Getting back to the book, one of the biggest takeaways from it was the deeply unnerving sense of dread and fear the reader experienced throughout, especially as it continued to crescendo up to the end where a shocking twist was laid out!
Basically, the ""Lucy"" character was in the school, trying to find her boyfriend, and she ended up having to hide from the janitor who seemed like he was going to kill her. I was TERRIFIED while reading it, and had no idea where it was going. Then BAM, the twist ending that the janitor had actually created all of these characters and was writing about them before he committed suicide. Therefore ""I'm thinking of ending things"" took on an extremely powerful context that you hadn't yet seen, bringing the entire story together and staying with you long after you read it!Kaufman didn't have ANY of this. There was no real tension once Buckley's character talked to the janitor, and instead poetic images (dancing, choreography, a final musical number, etc) replaced all of this. Similarly to what I said before about being too on-the-nose with themes, we were very hit over the head with the janitor's sense of self, his comparison to the dying, maggot filled pig as he walked naked in the hallway, and then the musical number at the end that went on a bit too long and didn't have a strong enough impact.
Also to not have the janitor, at any point say ""I'm thinking of ending things"" is such a travesty and why the ending doesn't feel tied in properly to the rest of the film.Listen, the actors were great, as always, visually there were some stunning scenes, the lighting particularly stood out, etc. The big problem was Kaufman twisting this story that worked so well in the book into the story he wanted to tell - he didn't properly honor the source material, and what he did instead didn't work. This sometimes happens with adaptations, especially with an auteur, so I guess I should've expected it. And, again, if you haven't read the book then maybe it is powerful (though I still feel like it needed some editing). However, the original story from the novel was extremely well done, and incredibly creepy and unnerving. Mostly, though, there was a solid climax and jaw-dropping twist that made the whole story complete. Because Kaufman changed the entire ending, and took out all levels of creepiness, there was no actual climax, and I wasn't sure the movie was over until the credits rolled.
It's a shame, because the book was great and I don't want people to get the wrong idea about it. Honestly, Kaufman shouldn't have been the one to adapt this, or he should've, at the very least, properly ""ended things"".",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

554,dead_angel04,When the beautiful and strange mind of Charlie Kaufman...,9,25 November 2020,"... meets the strange and beautiful mind of Ian Reid, something bizarre and unique, like ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" is born. Is this movie for everyone? Hell, no. Is it confusing and hard to watch at times? Yes. Is it pointless or pretentious as some people claim? No way. They just don't get it. If you've never watched a Kaufman film, you should skip this one. If you've watched one of his films or movies like ""Mulholland Drive"" and you hated your guts, avoid this film at all costs. Simply put, this isn't for you. Even though I loved this film, I totally understand why some people can't stand it. Even though Kaufman adapted someone else's original idea here, this is pure Kaufman. He even made some changes compared to the book to make this film even more bizarre and inapproachable. So before watching this movie you need to be 100% aware of what you're gonna watch. Then, you need to clear your head and be totally focused on the screen. And you may be rewarded. Also, you may not! Does this sound like too much work to just watch a film? Well, it is! But I personally felt rewarded. For me this is such a well-crafted film. All the pieces of the puzzle are there. Truth be told, some of them are hidden behind multiple layers, but they're there. The perfomances are excellent, it's a shame that both Jess(i)es are probably gonna be snubbed by the Academy. The cinematography is a masterpiece and it's actually the first time I'm liking Kaufman's directing. ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" is probably gonna get a cult status in the future.

The 'middle aged Jake' murdering the boy dancer to get the girl. Lucy's changing behavior unfolding in the psychotic event.

Life is tough (specially for the elderly, the poor, the outsiders and the ill), full of complications, problems and obstacles. That's the reality we can't escape (or at least we try for brief moments) and that's why when a movie like this shows exactly all those things combined and compacted in 2 hours, it results in a pill very hard to swallow.It's okay if you are going through all of those things and cannot stand it in a movie because you wan't something else to put you mind into.

582,mravelin,Explanation,9,12 September 2020,"First of all i never read the novel before, so its make me more curious but also frustated in one time. I deeply search every explanation in google in every website And also read the director explanation. And after I realize what i just saw, its really dark and mindblow actually. So here some points so maybe you can accept this movie:1. Jack Girlfriend Was Never Exist
From the beginning of the movie, the director put the Jack girlfriend as the point of view and that is clever action makes audience think that this movie just about how dark her boyfriend family is or what she must do to ""ending things""/break up with Jack. But actually no! Everything that really happen in the movie is was Jack own imagination that he wrote in his book, from Jack pick up his girlfriend, meet his family, until they are stop at Jack highschool. The real thing that happened in this movie is the janitor clip. The janitor is Jack, he was a great student, smart, but bad at social things, he was working on the lab but he quit and become janitor. (Explanation from director and reference to the novel)2. What happened in Jack parents house?
Well like I said its just Jack imagination, but if you noticed, in one scene to another Jack make something different, first he said this and then he said that, it actually make sense because its up to Jack want, its just his imagination, and then it shows Jack parents from age to another age, its just represent how much his parents so worthy to him because he doesnt have any friends and the only one who cares about him is just his parents. When the jack girlfriend go to the basement and found janitor chlotes its connected to what i said that because it was the real Jack now. (Explanation From director and reference to the novel)3. Janitor Meets Jake girlfriend
This is actually show the audience the plot twist that everything never happened. its start when the girlfriend saya ""He never ask me my number"" And start to hug the janitor. And reveals to the audience about the truth, in the movie we are know Jack tell us that he stare his girlfriend in the cafe, start a conversation, and then his girlfriend give her number. Its never happened. (Explanation from director and reference to the novel)4. The Dance Climax
The dance was representation about the movie about Jack Life, what if he ask his girlfriend number that night? He maybe start a relationship and getting married, but at the end of the dance Jack was attacked by the janitor means that it cannot be happen. (Explanation from the director but not happen in novel)5. What happen in the novel?
Okay this is the boiling point the real ending, Jack like usual cleaning the school at night changing clothes and go home. Then he start remembering his past, the ice cream comercial and then a pig start to talk and ask him to walk. This is reference from the beginning of the movie when the girlfriend in the farm and Jack start tell her about the pig and how they died. The pig show him a way inside the school, that means the end of Jack life. Yes! Hes is commited suicide because he not get what he want, he really dissapointed with his life, depression and end his life. (Explanation from the director and reference to the novel)6. The phone call
Actually for this explanation its still not clear but let me try to explain. The director not give some explanation for this but if we read the novel it was Jack mind about end his life. When his girlfriend answer the phone it always saya ""there is only one question, what are you waiting for?"" It was Jack mind to end his life. (Not Yet Confirm but reference to the novel)7. Another Jack Imagination
At the end the movie show us the older Jack, girlfriend, and kids from the ice cream shop. It was alternative ending if Jack ask the girlfriend her number. They could het married, Jack success, and everyone happy. But its never happened. (Explanation from director)At the end of this explanation I hope everyone understand what they saw, actually I love the movie even its really slow, some people just sad because the climax was unclear (but that what the director want, to make everything unclear) and make the climax reference to the novel that darker than the movie. The genre itself was missleading people to see it, the truth is that is about drama and depression, anxiety, psicologhycal thriller. I hope my explanation helping people and please let me know!(This explanation updated at 13 September 2020, every explanation confirmed by the director, and i put some explanation about novel reference)",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

The scenes in the car where by far the most exhausting pieces of media I've seen in a while, the scenes in the house were the most entertaining because we had more of a back and forth between more than two actors, one of which can't convincingly show emotion. There are points in the movie were it feels like the plot is getting somewhere, but it decides it's better for everyone if it just ignores any semblance of a plot.
There is, in this almost 150 minute movie, a fully fledged dance, yes, the dancers are very talented and their dance is very beautiful, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with the film.

592,krazy_katherineg,"Beautiful piece of art, Challenging watch",6,21 September 2020,"I really appreciate what's been done with this film. I personally haven't read the book, but I love that watching the film allowed me think and discuss my interpretation in the same way as if I'd read a book. (I personally feel this is less common with film where music, lighting, acting etc all results in a specific interpretation - a side note, but just to explain what I mean).I'm thankful that I watched this with someone so that we could discuss it afterwards, adding each other's layers that we had noticed and interpreted. The acting is incredible, and visually the film is beautiful. Themes of time and thought are shared elegantly even when it comes to the movement of the camera, helping the whole film feel both like one moment and a series of moments. I could easily see this becoming a cult classic and of course one for film students to dissect.The dialogue is fascinating and eloquent, although I expect this would be an influence of the original book. Regardless, there was a notion shared at the start of the film that stuck with me (paraphrasing): Our thoughts are who we truly are and show our intentions; anyone can act a certain way but it's our thoughts that are more important. This struck me as kind of unusual, and it actually helped me with interpreting the film once it was over too. I imagine other prose would stick out to other viewers and therefore layer their interpretation differently.So with all of this praise, why did I only give six stars? I'm Thinking of Ending Things is a challenging watch. It's long, it's dialogue-heavy, it's ""weird"" (my husband's description), and while I feel as though I understood the story's ending and the film's sentiments (at least in some respects), the ending didn't feel satisfying given the length and depth of the journey the viewer is taken on. Although, perhaps that's the point...Regardless, I think some people will love it. In a way, I kind of did too. Yet it's not something I would likely watch again or feel that I could recommend to many people, simply because it is challenging. As such, I respect this film as a piece of art.

Perhaps he is a pretentious one, or simply full of disdain for people who watch Netflix? At this point, I don't even care.

I appreciate thoughtful movies, I like internal narration - especially if it works, like in most Woody Allen films. I sometimes enjoy strange and abstruse cinema, i.e. David Lynch. But this flick is a mess. Kaufman changed the ending of the book and didn't do enough to help the viewer understand that this entire story is inside the head of the suicidal janitor. His memories of his life, all mashed up. This is not evident at all upon the first viewing, it's hidden to well when it should have been obvious. It would have made the movie better.

The effectual scenes from the memory with the people that raised us, plays till the close accompanied by the magical songs once we loved.

There was no attempt at character development and next to no attempt to get you on the side of any character.The best comparison I have for this film without spoiling anything, is that it's like making your walk to the shop into a film in which you find a strange leaf on the ground and a load of random things jump out at you (and even that may have been more exciting).Don't waste your time.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

The young man is seemingly able to hear the thoughts of his girlfriend as she considers breaking up with him. The sight of a new swing set in the yard of an abandoned house only heightens the foreboding. Upon arrival the couple is greeted by a creepy figure plucked straight from a David Lynch fever-dream.Clues are carefully laid out but trying to decipher it is futile, akin to a kitten pawing at a ball of yarn. Writer/director Charlie Kaufman's adaptation of a novel by Ian Reid is inscrutable and frustrating. Kaufman struck gold as the writer of 'Adaptation' and 'Eternal Sunshine', but those works benefited from a visual flair and a sense of humour belonging to others (Spike Jonze and Michel Gondry). The light whimsy of those works is largely absent, replaced by shades of nihilism that feels unhealthy and morbid. Self-awareness coupled with esoteric philosophical themes has been Kaufman's signature.Jesse Plemons and Jessie Buckley as the young couple do a top-notch job of carrying the film with terrific turns by David Thewlis and Toni Collette as the parents. The film doesn't earn its 134 minute runtime, and as it loses steam it risks running off the rails. Lovers of highbrow intellectual art will hail it a work of a genius.

It felt like a mess with everything thrown in to a blender, with few deep thoughts sprinkled here and there in to a mix of driving, snow and culture references.
As a movie it should be able to stand alone, suck you in and leave you with something else than just confusion.

They're not even trying, but instead what you see just keeps getting weirder as time goes by.

624,CosmicPrune,Predictably unpredictable,5,27 October 2020,"If, like me, you haven't read the book, this is a movie of two parts. The first two hours is a well-executed psychological thriller. It is relentlessly unsettling and keeps you on the edge of your seat, even during the rather drawn-out road trip scenes in which Jessie Buckley reels off reams of complex monologue with only the occasional mumbled contribution from Jesse Plemons. The weirdness ramps up several notches when they finally get to his parents' house, and the movie appears to be on exactly the kind of unhinged arc that you would expect from Charlie Kaufman.And then there is the closing fifteen minutes. By that point I had given up any hope that the ending might explain what this movie was about, but I was still disappointed. Instead of any meaningful denouement we are treated to an incoherent morasse of interpretative dance, song, and an on-stage address from Plemons which fails to shed any light on what has gone before. I turned to my wife about half an hour from the end and said, this is the kind of film where the credits roll and you just stare at the screen and say ""Oh"". And it was.I'm not sure who this film is for. I'm sure the book must make more sense than this, and assuming it does, those who have read it must feel that Kaufman has missed something out here. And if you haven't read the book, you'll have no idea what you just watched until you come on here and read the explanation posts.Having read those explanations, I now appreciate that this a clever story, and a very clever title. The performances, especially from Buckley, are tremendous. But there was definitely some fat that could have been trimmed and by the end it just felt like Kaufman lost interest and someone else was invited to come and finish it off. With a better ending this could have been a great movie.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

That being said, it's one of those ""puzzle movies"" where nothing makes sense and you're slowly given ""pieces"" to figure out what it all means. They never explicitly give you the entire picture, though. No character appears to reveal a plot twist or explain what you've just watched. There's no ""it was a dream all along"" or ""that person never existed"". You're expected to figure that out on your own, so if you're not in the mood to put your mind to work and try to come up with theories while watching, you'll probably just be angry and confused by the nonsensical randomness of the story.
If, however, you like and are in the mood for one of those movies, this one's pretty good! Some scenes drag on a little too long, some of the dialogue can be quite pretentious and the ending can be a little too ""artistic"" for some, but I personally enjoyed it.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

There is absolutely nothing interesting or exciting about this film. The storyline drones on and on, with some existential dilemmas peppered through here and there to the point that the viewer is made to feel stupid if he/she doesn't understand the references being made to some obscure poets, writers, and artists. The acting feels cheap, mediocre and artificial, and just when you think there's something building up in the storyline, it dissipates into more meaningless dialogue between two people who make such an awkward match as a couple that it makes the viewer wonder how they got past the first date not to mention a visit to the boyfriend's parents.

Saw the movie with my girlfriend and we were throwing interpretations at each other all the time. I like that, so that's why I gave it 3 stars. I even bought the book to fully understand the film. Well, that helped just a tiny bit. Kaufman distorted the whole plot in a way, to make it more cryptic and he made editorial changes that add nothing or not much or leave completely false impressions. He lost it at the ending, which could have been cooling down irritated viewers, but he added some Kaufman'sche scenery which confuses more and misses crucial points. The original ending of the book isn't that ""original"", so he had to spice things up which completely went out of hand. It seems the movie is packed with notes Kaufman has written in his notebook over the years, which he never was able to place in a movie. ""I'm thinking of ending things"" gave him the opportunity to puzzle them in.
Maybe Kaufman made a confusing movie so Ian Reid can have his book be sold again. And the book doesn't help that much either. Great marketing!

With no Spike Jonze to hold him down he has created a dynamic whirlwind of emotions that encapsulates everything he has expressed about relationships in his previous works. Truly the culmination of all his earlier projects, but does it stick the landing? In all it's message gets to an active viewer, but not always, which, as they discuss in the movie, can be the point. Art can be our perception of imagery and sound, but with this much personal freedom, are we really supposed to derive anything from the plot without a subsequent google search of its summary?

The acting by Jessie Buckley was excellent and really carried the movie, telling the story through her but not really from her perspective as she is a character made up by Jake.

But none of it made any kind of real sense as per the ending. It was like the worst kind of shaggy dog story.So then I cheated and went to the synopsis of the book. And I was mostly right about the basics, but the movie seems to have gone off to fairy land without any point to the title. The book plot made sense, however crucial elements of this were skimmed over in the film, and made it all clear as mud.Anyway, it was enjoyable enough if you separate it into little vignettes of dialogue and excellent acting, and don't expect much else. I usually like this art-house style stuff and I get it, but I really thought this was rather a wasted effort, and could have done without the ballet scene, (which doesn't make sense unless you know what happens in the book), and the speech and song at the end were fairly lame in my opinion.
I liked parts but was so annoyed by so many things... It came off like a valiant attempt, but fell very flat in essentials.

644,aidenpedersen,Don't expect it to make sense upon first watch,8,8 September 2020,"Purposefully mind-warping, I'm Thinking of Ending Things presents many interesting ideas in an intriguing way. This film essentially begs us to consider how we view time, as well as how we make our choices. Should I take this risk? Is it even worth it if I succeed? These questions are pretty simple when you look at them separately, yet this film manages to craft an interesting film centred around questions and concepts like those. In terms of performances, everyone here is fantastic. Most of the actors in this film have to do some pretty abnormal stuff, and they pull it off quite well. Alongside this, the writing for characters (as well as the rest of the story) is fantastic. Notably, the dynamic between Jake and Lucy is great and really sells the points/ideas that the film presents. The overarching plot/story is somewhat sensible. Obviously don't go into this film expecting it to be a relaxed watch, you will most certainly have to be constantly paying attention to try and work out whats happening. But for about half of the runtime, you could likely have a decent grasp of what's going on (that does change though, I can assure you). This film succeeds largely due to Kaufman's writing and directing. I've so far only seen his writing in 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', and while I thought that film was far, far more accessible, I think that this film largely has more to dissect overall (still note that I'm Thinking of Ending Things is an adapted screenplay as opposed to Eternal Sunshine). Ultimately, while I still really don't fully understand this film, it's definitely one of the most intriguing I've seen in a while. I'm certain it'll prove more comprehensible and rewarding upon rewatches, and I think I'll definitely get around to seeing some more of his work shortly.

I'm pissed I wasted over 2 hours of my life investing myself into this pretentious artistic snob of a movie only to be taken down a road that led nowhere while being forced to listen to possibly the most ostentatious script I've ever come across in my life. I will say the dream/reality elements in this movie held my interest, but I absolutely loathed the dialogue. Who really wants to listen to over 2 hours of that self-elevated existential haughty back-and-forth about poetry, literature and psychology without even ONE fart joke in the whole entire movie?

The trailer was amazing and the reason I watched the movie, but I've been bamboozled I tell ya!!!

As a movie at least, it doesn't really know what it wants to be... constant shifts in tone and style, from mystery to thriller/horror and from there, to a romantic musical. Seems like the 4:3 ratio is present for no other reason beyond the audience's annoyance. Scenes and newly introduced characters are promising plot development, but there is none. Makeup, specially in a certain part of the movie, is horrible and easily outdated by 50 years or so. The moral of the story is presented in such a way, that flips its whole purpose to the opposite side. The so called symbolisms which automatically entitle this piece as ""art cinema"", are childish at best. To the upside, there are some good performances from the cast (the mouth twisting from the actress as a character thing got old really fast) and dialog has a few interesting moments, but those glimpses are unfortunately buried under all this failed, struggling attempt of the material, to become something deep and intellectual. Instead, the too hard effort to prove something, ends up making it precisely the opposite.EDIT: This comes from someone with a passionate taste for multilayered depth in any artistic piece, so if you read this as a ""shallow"" perspective, think again.

674,aj-84622,It's Brilliant Until the Ending,7,4 September 2020,"The entire first two hours border on absolute brilliance, with the actors bringing incredibly great performances complemented by Kaufman's sneakily metaphorical and symbolic writing as well as the claustrophobic and impeccable cinematography, cleverly composed to capture the most important details that you probably won't catch on the first watch.I read the book the week before this film's release and thought it was pretty great, although the ending could have been delivered better (personal opinion). If there's one thing that keeps this movie from being as great as it could have been, it's the way the ending is told.Sometimes Kaufman's movies take too long. They take a while to wrap up; he has so much he wants to fill in and say through his creative and visual ways, but sometimes they make for tedious viewing (while not significantly diminishing the quality of the overall film). I don't think he fully thought about how to end the movie correctly, and the final 15 minutes feels like an allegorical and metaphorical mish mash that no one can really fully understand unless they read the book.The book and this film are perfect companion pieces. They both fill in little, but important gaps for the other. What Kaufman does with the story and the liberties he takes to tell it are so wonderfully eerie and engaging. He stays loyal to the source material but sprinkles in little Kaufman-isms that elevate it as well. I was on edge for a large majority of this movie and really enjoyed noticing the little details that build to the grand, unexpected reveal.This is a very good movie with very darn good actors and a gorgeous visual style. You have to have patience watching this, that's for sure. The ending ain't the best; as a matter of fact, it's kinda wack and I hated it. But hey, to each their own.Good job, Kaufman.

679,Yobyoni,My interpretation of the movie.,9,7 September 2020,"Sorry if the layout of this is messy.So the janitor is obviously Jake, and I think the ""young woman (I'll address her as Lucy)"" is her own person at most points, rather than her actually being the same as Jake, which is a theory I don't understand.Most of what we see in the film is a fantasy. Jake is a person who holds on to all of his old memories, obsessing over what could've been. Right from the beginning, he is watching old cartoons on a vintage TV, then he looks out of his window at a swing set, which he's held onto over all these years. When he is in the car listening to the radio, Isaiah 1:18 is mentioned: ""though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow."" I think this could be in relation to him being haunted by his past, but is still hopeful that he can rid himself of this, possibly by inserting religion into his life. These memories keep coming back though. He sees two students dancing in the hallway, reminding him of the musicals he would enjoy. He watches on as the students rehearse a song from Oklahoma, his favourite musical. There doesn't seem to be any way for him to escape these memories.When Lucy recites the poem Bonedog, it talks about loneliness and the sadness of coming home to an empty house, it's obviously relating to Jake, which he says himself. He lives identical days as he gets older and older. I think it's reasonable to say that Jake has been a janitor for most of his adult life. He comes home to a house of bone. He's constantly wanting to come home to something, but instead comes home to the same, lifeless, barren home every single day.A little later, Jake says that he watches too many movies, that it passes the time to fill his brain with lies. This kind of relates to himself coming up with these fake memories to pass the time.One line that comes back many times is that ""things will get better."" Maybe throughout Jake's life, he kept thinking that things would naturally work out in his favour, but before he knew it, he was old and never achieved the things he wanted to in life.Moving on, Jake's parents are in no hurry to greet him, making me think that in reality, they always thought of Jake as an underachiever or a disappointment.I think the basement represents a few things: He hides the things he's ashamed of in there. The janitors outfits, the paintings that never got him anywhere in life. Even the line ""He's hiding in there"" is like him saying his true self hides in there, too ashamed to even leave. Another thing is when the mother asks Lucy to go to the basement. I think in this scenario she represents the ideal version of Jake as a child. The real child Jake might have been scared to go down into the basement, but Lucy is not scared at all.The inconsistencies with his parents ages could represent Jake trying to perfect these memories. Trying things out at different points in his life, but never finding that perfect moment because it was never meant to be. Even Lucy's career paths constantly change as Jake tries to work this into his imagination to see how much differently his parents might have reacted. His older self watches a romantic movie, he proceeds to insert this into his fantasy when Lucy gets a call from Yvonne, and even changes the whole story of how they met to be just like it was in the movie.His mother mentions that she was proud when he received the diligence pin, but Jake himself was disappointed that he didn't get a better pin. I'm thinking his ambitions in life may have been too unrealistic. His parents mention that he wasn't as smart as the other kids and his wish for a better pin could relate to him hoping for a career in painting, physics, etc. and that the diligence pin (probably referencing him becoming a janitor) is as much as he can achieve in life. When we see Jake caring for his mother, he is wearing the diligence pin, which even looks like it has a slight glow, as if it's the only thing that would make his mother proud (this is too depressing).When Lucy quotes the phrase ""Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else's opinions"", this could be in relation to Jake. His thoughts are all made up of other people's thoughts and ideas rather than his own and that now it has gotten to the point where he is replacing aspects of his own memories with things from movies. Later on, during the drive home, Jake forms his own opinion about A Woman Under the Influence, but when he hears the opinion of someone who he knows is more intelligent in that field, he instantly thinks that his opinion must be wrong (something I think most of us do actually).Now for Tulsey Town. I think it represents bad memories: ""Brutal place, the land of Tulsey Town."" The girls who laughed at him work there, the ostracized girl, who is like his younger self, works there. Tulsey Town itself is something from his childhood that he has held onto all the way up to his old age. Even the bad smell that the ostracized girl mentions could just be a metaphor for bad memories. His insistence on going there in the first place may have been him wanting to confront these bad memories and try to get rid of them, but ultimately, he becomes too cowardly to do so and then insists on leaving as soon as possible.An alternative, and very dark theory, is that it could be the afterlife? The first thing I thought of when the girl mentioned that the bad smell wasn't varnish, was that it was a dead body or something. She even says that ""you don't have to go forward... in time, you can stay here."" Maybe the girls working there are ones that he killed. The ones who laughed at him, he killed because he was sensitive. The quiet girl, he killed because no one would realise or care, because she was a social outcast or because she reminded him too much of himself. Even early in the film when he seems to lack any care about the lambs who froze to death could relate to this. I hope that theory is wrong, but it's something else to consider.If Tulsey Town does represent bad memories, then his desperation to get rid of the ice cream could be a metaphor for him wanting erase those memories once and for all because it has been ""preying"" on his mind his entire life.When Jake says ""sometimes I feel much younger than I actually am"", I think he's talking from the perspective of his older self/real self, who wants to be back in his youth so he can change what his life ends up like. And Lucy saying ""like a Coca-Cola commercial"", is again relating to the fact that Jake's mind is so filled with stuff he sees on the television.Then when Jake is finally about to kiss Lucy, he sees his older self watching on through a peep hole, as if it's impossible for him to alter his memories and that his older, actual self will always get in the way.We finally get to Lucy entering the school. We see the bin completely filled with ice cream cups, as if Jake has went over this scenario in his head time and time again. When we finally hear the truth about what happened with Jake and Lucy that night in the bar, which, to me, is him accepting the truth. Janitor Jake then says ""he's safe if he's here. It's safe in here. It's quiet."" To me this tells us that the school is the only place Jake belongs.Then we get to the dance scene. I think the dancer Jake is what his idyllic self is, the one who marries the woman of his dreams. But ultimately, the real Jake ends up killing his idyllic self, as if there was never a possibility of that being the real him.So the janitor finishes his day and begins having a mental breakdown in his car. To me, this is his life ending. He mentioned that he always liked road trips, and so remembers that. He remembers his parents, however it is of them arguing, so that might be the only real memory of them he has. He remembers himself as a young adult. And he remembers the Tulsey Town advert, the song that always made him cry. At this point in the movie, I think Jake is dead. The pig leads him to the afterlife. The pig is apparently him, but I think the maggots represent all the bad memories he has and how they are constantly eating away at him, all the way up until his death.Getting to the final scene, Jake recites the speech from A Beautiful Mind. As soon as the word 'delusional' is said the camera cuts to Lucy, pretty much solidifying the idea that she is just someone Jake saw at some point in his life, nothing more. Then there's the song:""As I sit by myself, like a cobweb on a shelf, by myself, in a lonely room.""
That is essentially his life. He works his regular job. He goes to his empty home, growing older and older by the day.""And a dream starts a-dancin' in my head. And all the things that I wish fer turn out like I want them to be.""
Through all this loneliness, he had no choice but to wander in his own mind, the only way he could be with other people.""I'm awake in a lonely room. I ain't gonna dream of her arms no more. I ain't gonna leave her alone.""
Maybe at some point in his life, he decided that he wanted this woman, but obsessively pursued her, not leaving her alone.Then everything turns blue. My guess is based on the inclusion of the biblical quote early in the film. Apparently, within the Bible, blue represents heaven and thus, Jake has officially ascended to heaven!When I first watched the film, I didn't think it was very depressing, which I instantly thought was off based on Kaufman's other films, but yes, now that I've analysed it, this is probably one of the most depressing films I've ever seen.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

It's ""brilliant""
Great acting
It's a ""Masterpiece""No, I don't agree, except for the acting (two stars for them).Why people and myself hate it
It's boring
Long drawn out convoluted dialogue
It's confusing
No explanation
Horrible ending
Poor editingLong story:The movie should have been edited to omit unnecessary dialogue and excess monotony. I get it, (NOW) the janitor is Jake, he's an older man that is fantasizing as many of us do. He is creating a story in his head of how his life could've been. Changing the character little by little. All inspired by different books, poems, movies, or commercials he has consumed. His life is monotonous, it's long, it's boring, and he's lonely and isolated. The drag of the film is the drag of his life. It doesn't make it better.This movie is for the film and literature buffs. Most of us won't remember the speech from a beautiful mind. Some of us aren't into poems, nor do we want to listen to a macabre poem all the way through. And, we don't all remember or had watched Oklahoma.The film was written for Kauffman and people like him, not the majority of the audience. People who read the book may like his interpretation. Some will hate it but they won't be as perplexed and confused as those of us who didn't read it.The focus honed in on the young woman, I thought she was the real person and Jake was a reflection of her. Then I thought, maybe he is someone she wished she said no to. Is she dreaming? Is she transgender speaking to her former male self? Did he kill her and she is in the hospital reflecting? Is she dying and created this warped dream? What couple talks like this? Did her name change again? Why is the janitor's clothes in the washer? Are we supposed to care about this guy? Jake has to be her. WRONG. I failed to realize, she is a reflection of Jake, and Jake is the Janitor. I saw the Janitor as an interruption and didn't see the point of him popping into the screen. Then when the janitor died in the car of what seemed like a heart attack. I was perplexed. And then the animated pig shows up and at that point, I knew this janitor died of a heart attack. Wrong again, it was possibly hypothermia from being in the cold. Since, what's her name said time is moving and we are staying still. His delusion was created in his car while he froze to death.I couldn't focus on the last scene because it bored me to tears. I played Township and looked at the screen ever so often. Then the credits rolled and I shut it off in anger. WTH did I watch?A masterpiece? No, not at all. A masterpiece is making physics seem like basic addition. Making a simple movie seem like astronomy is a stroking of ones ego to feel like they are better than who they created the film for. If using complex words your audience doesn't understand makes you look pompous, arrogant, and stupid. Why would making a film your audience doesn't understand any more than an over-inflated mess? Who is going to watch such a long drawn out movie a second time to see what they missed? Not I.Simpler is better. Unfortunately, he will continue to make garbage and people will praise it because it boosts their ego that they got it or believe they did.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

684,alanwilson-07115,This story is wasted on a movie,3,13 September 2020,"I can see why they wanted to adapt this book into a movie. I can tell the story is deep and philosophical, but ultimately this adaptation was a mistake.I played a game once called ECHO. It was a visual novel, an interactive story that explored the darkest side of a small town in Utah through five different paths. Each route began feeling relatively normal; it would start to descend eventually, developing both the characters and the world around them. Each route felt different: One felt solitary and scared, holed up for unknown time in unknown places, with the characters turning on each other and losing their sense of reality. One felt dark, heady, and confusing, like running through a cornfield with a mask on, as the main character devolves through time and madness into a revelation that doesn't work unless you've played another route first. One felt almost crushingly nihilistic, and I thought about its ending for days afterward. ECHO was my first experience with surrealist psychological horror, and it holds a special place in my heart - hence why I've said so much about it.It is also quite a bit better than I'm Thinking of Ending Things.This movie tries to do way too much using the wrong medium. Surrealist psychological horror does not work, in my opinion, unless everything makes sense in some way; it has to be internally consistent with its own wacked out rules, regardless of how detached said rules are from the rules of reality. This movie feels like a series of increasingly time-crunched vignettes that didn't have enough time to develop either themselves or their connections to each other. The only rules are those of Calvinball, where it is encouraged to express ideas in the most deliberately obtuse way. And there are SO MANY of them. Half this movie consists of monologuing about disparate, usually somewhat pseudo-deep topics where the primary punchline is that the characters are hypocrites. None are developed enough for me to call them The Point. I know I'm being a bit harsh here, but I've played ECHO, and I've seen and felt the kind of emotional impact that a complex psychological horror can have - but here, didn't. It feels like Kaufman played ECHO without understanding a word and cut off the end of one of the routes because oo shiny shiny surreal horror i want. That doesn't make for a well-conceived plot. It makes for a flat viewing experience, because if you can't develop a baseline of normal life, any surrealist stuff you do to the characters feels stakeless and ineffectual.I will say that Kaufman did the best he could with what he had. The tension in most scenes is palpable, the imagery artistic and visually striking, the acting fantastic mostly. It's just a shame that the artistic direction is let down so thoroughly by poor execution of the plot and themes.It is obvious to me that this story should not have been a movie. Despite how long they seem to be, movies are among the shortest creative media out there, and these scads of ideas and plotlines and mini-twists are all stifled in two hours and fourteen minutes. It feels bloated and wispy at the same time, and I feel unsatisfied.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

689,leopeyretti,Kaufmanesque,8,4 September 2020,"The first impression is that I want to see it again. The interesting thing about Kaufman's films is that the weight is not placed on the end, rather, it is impossible to define the end, it seems that the whole film is. The end is immersed in the beginning and in the end, and in every second between those two points. It is the viewer himself who is in charge of finishing the film and to do so he must watch it several times, although each time he does so he will see a different film.
One can easily tell this was directed by a screenwriter, as we saw at Synecdoche New York. The scenery, music and makeup are excellent. Some transitions and performances are not so.
I liked the weight / energy that the character of the girl has, it makes a beautiful contrast. The best thing about the movie is the tension.As in any Kaufman movie, you don't have to try to explain too much why things happen, they are just in the minds of the characters and they happen. Or what happens is the characters. Or the characters are the places and the places are the characters. Time goes back and forth and things get upset along the way and everything is immersed in the whole.

I get that some people didn't like it, but I think that to fully appreciate this film, or at least to increase your chances to, you need to be fully dedicated when you decide to watch it. This is because the screenplay is complex, but in my opinion there is not a single word or scene out of place. The problem is that to understand this, you first need to catch the key to interpreting what you are seeing, or have seen, but this won't likely happen until the movie is close to the end, or even after. Nevertheless, once you get that key, you can think of any single moment during your vision and find an explanation for that - and maybe even have fun doing so. That's precisely why I've loved it: I've never stopped ""watching"" this movie since I have started three days ago, because every time I think about what I saw, I catch a new detail or I give a different interpretation of a certain aspect.
So my suggestion to have the best experience from the vision of this film is to watch it carefully to get as much material as possible from this amazing trip through human psyche, which you can analyze and appreciate once you understand what is actually going on.

It was pretty obvious very early what was going on. So the rest just felt pointless. Unless you enjoy odd visuals and nothing else, the rest of the film provides no story of merit because the whole premise is it isn't actually a story. It's just some hash of someone's thoughts, that aren't anymore interesting than anyone else's thoughts, including the viewer's. I would liken it to listening to someone describing their dream from the night before. Really interesting to them, but of absolutely no relevance to anyone else. I watched till the end in the hope of at least feeling something more for the characters, but the length of time passing only served to increased boredom and irrelevance.

My takeaway on the ending was at first that Jake was the janitor and the reason the girlfriend doesn't have a name is due to him never finding someone in his life and he ends up a lonely old man cleaning his highschool. The reason we see so many icecream cups in the school dumpster is because Jake, the janitor, routinely gets them before his night shift at work because it is something that reminds him of being a kid.

The two characters seemed too intelligent for their own good, and both incredibly depressed. They seemed like two of your friends who wouldn't stop talking but you can't help but appreciate their insight and intelligence.But by the end I couldn't wait to watch it again to see how much more I could get from it. Once I had finished it I couldn't stop talking about it and I found myself wanting to read about it to try and understand it more fully. It seemed like a two and a half hour bad dream. A dream where you keep thinking you've woken up, only to have a random person appear and then disappear before your eyes.

Why is so much movie time wasted of them talking about ""smart"" stuff and making viewers feel dumb. Do it once, show that they are intelligent and Jake longed for that.

At some points, i felt like this was the situation, like the discussion of the movie from Gene Rowland which i have no previous knowledge.(-1) However, the dialogues over philosophy, ageing and human condition in combination of poetry were quite satisfying.3) Acting was quite satisfying too, i didnt know the woman actress but she is qute good. And i like the consistency of the male actor who always picks these weirdo roles.4) I also enjoyed the fact that i could feel everything was like in a dream kind of state, where time, colors and people are all mingled. Maybe that was the most original part for me.5) Throught the movie, i could get the tiny hints that the title of the movie referring to suicide and the janitor being the real character of the movie.

This is a movie that tries hard and dies hard. It is desperate to concoct complexity, but completely leaves you clueless. Whatever disillusions Jessie Buckley (unnamed woman) has in her grossly boring relationship with her boyfriend, leave the audience astonishingly disconcerted and outright disconnected from the movie.Aside from the mundane, drawn out, gobbledygook of an alienating script, to accompany that is a never-ending drab background of 'Fargo'-esque blizzards in Nowhereville. The sound editing is outright horrible, along with notoriously dim lighting reminiscent of the 'Game of Thrones' disaster episode, ""The Long Night"".This film is marred in weirdness, but fails to capture the essence of purpose (unlike, in the contrary, how David Lynch succeeds in this field). Beyond that, the film is brutally slow, painfully hard to watch, and gut wrenchingly boring. In the last 10 years of film-viewing, I haven't come across a film so unsatisfying, so devastatingly lame; failing to lead the audience on even the slightest of cookie-crumb trails towards underlying answers of ""how"" and ""why"" the movie takes the disjunct direction that it does.For those that think they can read into this movie, you may actually be misreading it entirely.

The snowstorm all throughout this film is basically one of the main characters in my mind.It's sort of a slow-burn movie, but in hindsight the peculiar atmosphere is present all throughout. The dialogue and acting is so engaging and smooth that it sort of obscures how ""different"" this movie really is; it's elegantly done in that way. I don't want to spoil anything about it, but even if I wasn't worried about that, I don't know if I would know what to say about it haha.It has a sort of psychological horror aspect to it (in true Kaufman style), and yet it's not ""scary"". It's funny, but it is not a comedy. It's heartfelt and about a couple (sort of?), but it isn't a romance. It's time bending, and in turn fairly mind bending, but it's not science fiction. My inability to categorize it is a true compliment really, it means that it does something *new*. Once I realized how out there this movie was willing to go, it was truly a breath of fresh air. *Finally* a movie that does something different!! Huzzah.It's sort of a quaint vignette of an a woman's awkward evening meeting her new boyfriend's parents, and yet it's basically an abstract suspense film, dense with self referential layers.I know I've said little to nothing about the content of the film, but that's the point. I suggest going in as blind as possible with no expectations. But as for motivation to actually take the time to watch it...I highly suggest it. I'm still wrapping my head around what I just saw, but I will definitely be watching it again. It's one of those movies that really has a little bit of everything (in a subtle, nuanced, classy way), and mostly importantly what it has is something truly *new* to offer. If you like Kaufman's other movies I can almost guarantee you'll like this one.Again, all of the casting and acting is great, and it definitely seals the deal on my wavering opinion that Jesse Plemons is legit af.I wish more films were able to transcend entertainment into the realm of Art like this one.

I do not care if the movie based on a book or not, it still needs to provide at least some level of explanation regarding to the many seemingly random and arrogant scenes that we just watched for more than 2 hours. It feels like this is a movie made by people who are only trying to win some awards and it feels to me that they do not care about their viewers at all. It seems to me that they just wanted to feel good about themselves and be praised by people who just wanna find meaning in the most random and unnecessary scenes but at the same time making most of its viewers who just want to watch a good movie feel like they are just bunch of fools for not understanding what's going on.In conclusion, I would not advice anyone who values their time and their mental health to watch this egotistical movie and make the makers of this movie feel like they made a piece of art.

764,peterdm1994,"""Wow"" is an all-purpose exclamation. I just realized that.",8,9 February 2021,"I remember seeing the title to this film, never having heard of the book, thinking it was a film about suicide. After seeing the trailer I realized I was wrong. And then wrong again one more time.
This story doesn't allow the viewer to believe things are as they seem. It doesn't allow the viewer to think they understand the characters history, values, or reality. Everything is in question including the film's title.
Upon giving the film's meaning a deeper look, it becomes clear that Jake and this Young Woman share conscienceness. Just as they share a moment of their own in the photograph. Just as they both share a general dislike of Jake.
Like I said, I haven't read the book but in reading other reviews, the mysterious phone calls were omitting ""the one question"" the caller was inquiring about which was supposed to be, according to the book, ""what are you waiting for?""
Looking back I think it's interesting how Jake and the Young Woman share the burden of death. We first hear it in the first words of the film which again are shared with the title. The Young Woman is the one who bears the weight of intending to ""end things"" although she isn't too keen on death. When she sees the dead and frozen sheep, she inquires about their remains and whether they'd have a proper burial someday. Jake's response is cold and short. He quickly changes the subject to an even more horrifying story about maggot ridden pigs who had to be prematurely slaughtered. Jake's childhood on a farm has prepared him to deal with death; however, we later learn that the Young Woman grew up in the country too, but her experience did not give her any bravery about death. There are even moments when the Woman's personality and visual presence are experienced as the woman in the rom-com who was studying to be an animal rights lawyer who couldn't bear the thought of eating animals let alone mercilessly killing them. Yet, it is the prime motive of the Young Woman: to ""end things.""
The Woman, as explained by Jake in his retelling of Wordsworth's story as an idealistic woman, has many different careers in this story. She is an artist, a poet, studying quantum physics, and evidently in her free time studies age. At one point the work she has to get back go in the morning is mentikned to be a waitress job clearly referencing the rom-com diner scene with the Sante Fe chicken. At one point the Woman, in her contemplation, admits her appreciation of Jake's education, yet the only work he seems to mention is his ability to see ""the kids"" rehearsing Oklahoma while he works. Obviously Jake is the janitor but we're given the impression that he is much more than that considering his education. But it is evident that the Young Woman's vast array of study and expertise is another delusion he is imparting on his version of a ideal woman, with the body of a woman he met long ago.
We see multiple occasions of Jake's interest sneaking into his delusion. There are the countless poems and movie references and references to authors dissecting the content. But one more interesting point is the entire lack of reference to the story's location. Except for one shot while driving of the backs of their heads, including the car's back windshield and license which reads: Oklahoma. There are numerous references to that musical. Most of them obvious even without having seen the show myself. After hearing other people explain the more detailed references to the show and Jake's relation to the main character, this is one more layer we can add to his delusion, that not only does Jake like the show, make constant reference to it, but also views himself as living IN Oklahoma. They have a conversation about movies and the saturation they have in our lives. Later making a point that everything wants to live ""even fake crappy movie ideas want to live. Like they grow in your brain, replacing real ideas. That's what makes them dangerous.""
Finally, I wonder if the high schooler with the rashes could relate to Jake. Generally speaking, the pair of girls who make fun of Jake could easily represent girls when he was in HS, the kids he sees in the supermarkets who used to rehearse Oklahoma, or the kids currently in HS while he works as a janitor. Whichever time of his life it is or was, they represent the unreachable. First they are female which was never attainable for him, a girlfriend or any rom-com style love. They're also bullies who look down on him for being a loner. And they're humans which shows his overall lack of connection even as a kind janitor. But the girl with rashes could easily be a symbol of empathy. She too is lonely and isolated. Certainly not every unpopular high schooler has suicidal thoughts. Although it is familiar to many people including Jake's story. I also wonder if she and the animated pig say the same things. She at the ice cream shop, quietly encouraging the Woman, saying she doesn't have to keep going, she can stay here. Perhaps referencing life and continuing to live. The pig's big line is: ""It's not bad, once you stop feeling sorry for yourself because you're just a pig, or, even worse, a pig infested with maggots. Someone has to be a pig infested with maggots, right? It might as well be you. It's the luck of the draw. You play the hand you're dealt. You make lemonade. You... you move on. You don't worry about a thing."" And I wonder if the smell in the back of the shop had anything to do with a maggot infested pig.
Now it is possible that the pig was also the final encouragement to ""end things"" considering the pig called Jake a pig too. And to farm-boy Jake, killing pigs can be brutal but is entirely necessary and normal.
This might be the case considering it seems Jake the janitor did ""end things"" after all when we get the final frame of the film. Art had been mentioned throughout the movie. But not just any art, painted landscapes. And although the Woman gave a few options to Jake's dad, the only emotion that seemed to stand out in this story was loneliness. The pictures in her phone, which were also those in the basement, all had dark and gloomy colors, projecting a sad and lonely feeling. As was with the final shot. His car was covered and left us to interpret his decisions as to whether he could have ""ended.""
This film took some digging to come to a conclusion on the ending and the pieces leading up to it. It became increasingly hard to follow but only drew you in even more. It was exceptionally creative and deep, matched with outstanding cinematography and acting. I think a second watch would give a greater appreciation for even those who didn't like it. But I'm excited to see it again, knowing what I know now, listening for every subtle reference amongst the already colorful dialogue.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

766,stefano-lucariello,"The movie is well done, but I actually hated it",6,5 September 2020,"After watching ""I'm thinking of ending things"" I felt like I had been scammed, robbed or 135 minutes of my life.
At first I thought that maybe it was me that didn't understand the movie, that perhaps there was something in it that I didn't get but that all the people writing good reviews did.
So I started reading all the good reviews, most of which explain really well the meaning and the subtext of the movie, and turns out that I got everything right in the first place and I wasn't wrong about being annoyed by this movie.
The premise and the plot, taken by a novel, are actually great, but Kaufman drowns them in half-an-hour long verbous dialogues about overlypessimistic poetry, philosophy and movie reviews, together with too much, unnecessary, directorial extravaganza.
The third act is actually the most annoying part of the movie (although being the less static one).
All I can think about the final 30 minutes of the movie is that Kaufman directed them like he was a lousy David Lynch rip-off and that it filled it with so many different cinematic genres just to show the audience he was able to do them all (and I'm gonna be honest, he actually is), turning the movie more in an exercise in style than in an actual work of art.Nonetheless I'm rating this movie almost a 6/10 because the actors in it are terrific and the thriller-horror section is true (sadly wasted) gold.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

The first three quarters of the movie are very good and if the treatment of the janitor was a little more subtle would be great. Then the plot implodes in the last ten minutes with bizarrely terrible fantasy scenes- the prize ceremony and dance are pitiful. The link to the dead pig is lazy.
Lucy is hiding from the janitor but with no context. Apparently in the book she is terrified, in the movie she seems to be mildly embarrassed.

771,lukeisajock,Horrible waste of time.,1,14 September 2020,"What did I just watch? I am so tired of these kind of movies that have no ending. This is not a clever way to end a movie to leave people thinking and have them start a conversation. It is just a lazy way for a no talent director to not come up with a proper ending. To be clear ""No Ending!"" is not an ending it is BS.There are just so many problems with this movie besides the lack of an ending. It was full of just seriously long scenes of two boring people in a car talking about boring pretentious subjects like quoting poetry. This is not entertaining, even if you have a PhD in literature, it's just pretentious and boring.The scenes in the house were full of useless details that never had a payoff at all. What is the whole point of the time dilation of the parents going back and forth between old and young?Also, the woman does not exist, which we never definitively know, she is just a figment of the imagination of the janitor. So why is the entire story told from the perspective of a character who does not exist instead of the delusional character that is actually imagining this? It makes no sense and is just a dishonest trick of the director.Also many comments say things like you need to read the book for this to make sense. If that is the case, the the movie is by definition a failure. A movie is not a supplement to a book, it should stand on its own. If you need to resort to other source material to make sense of a movie, then the director has failed at the medium he has chosen and not told the story properly.Also, this is all supposed to be the imagination of the janitor, yet in the imaginary conversations he was having with his imaginary girlfriend, he seemed to know a lot of real literature and physics. That just makes no sense, a person like that who wanted to imagine he was smarter than he really was would not know actual facts, quotes and big words, he would have imagined senseless pseudo-intellectual dialog.And can we talk about the ridiculous song and dance routine at the end? Seriously WTF was that all supposed to be about?Why are directors allowed to make movies with no endings like this? Do they really think they are so clever that the movie speaks for itself and that people will engage in a dialog about what they saw? No, people just watch a movie with no ending and get pissed off at the movie and the director and choose not to watch more movies by that director.

780,soegaard-17035,An Incoherent Bunch of Stuff,3,21 May 2021,"I hate this film intensely, but instead of getting caught up in emotion, I will attempt to express myself in a civil manner. The trouble with this film is that it's ultimately uncinematic. It is not a movie, but more a riddle, where everything, every little detail is something to be deciphered. As a consequence, there is no immediacy to anything, and as the movie progresses, every remnant of emotional continuity is sacrificed and reduced to seemingly random utterances, obscure references and a Pauline Kael review quoted verbatim by the main character. I'm not saying it doesn't make intellectual sense. Charlie Kaufman writes his scripts with a very specific meaning in mind, and that is in my opinion his greatest flaw. He gets so caught up in his own cleverness, in the convoluted architecture of the plot, that all emotion often becomes numb in the service of some intellectual gimmick. This movie is certainly the worst offender in that regard. The strength of the film medium is its elegance, the ability to contain multitudes in a single scene. When you make something so overwrought as this, you could might as well write a philosophical treatise. There is no elegance, no simplicity in the storytelling and concepts are thrown at the viewer in a never-ending flood of information. The direction is clunky, with camera angles appearing out of nowhere and the editing is strangely hyperactive.

The elaborate exploration of the forbidden love dilemma trope ""don't wind up grinding coochies with my brother or I'll literally never talk to you again"" incontrovertibly extinguishes any preconceived apprehensions viewers may hold from the genre, ensuring a fantastic experience for audiences of all ages. This delightful comedy is intricately entwined with compelling drama throughout the movie to enthral even the most easily distracted of viewers. The pacing flows naturally like a leaf in a stream and every joke tickles your bone. The unparalleled nuance of the mesmerising characters and their driven arcs is undeniably the result of the artistic integrity of the creators who all deserve endless praise.

The book is paced well and keeps you absolutely obsessed with finishing it. Kaufman didn't include a LOT of the elements that make you realize, after the twist, that you've been in the mind of a sick man the whole time. I can see how parts of the book would be difficult to adapt but I'm disappointed in the direction of the film. The big twist, that the girl is made up by Jake and that Jake is the janitor, gets sprinkled into the film slowly and I think that ruins it. The female actor did an excellent job and would have excelled in portraying the book more authentically. The other actors likely could have done very well in their book-described roles too.

831,broehl,I kept hoping that it would eventually make sense...,1,14 September 2020,"... but it doesn't.It's basically just a series of increasingly strange and random events, followed by the closing credits.Almost all the positive (or even mixed) reviews I've seen are from people who have read the book on which the film is based. Their knowledge of the plot (and in particular, the ending) allowed them to follow what was going on in the film. I'm happy for them.But a film should stand alone -- I should be able to watch it from beginning to end and appreciate it for what it is, without having to already be familiar with the story before the opening credits roll.Taken by itself, the film makes no sense. As I kept watching it, minute after excruciating minute, I was hoping that it would eventually come together and make my two hour and fifteen minute time investment pay off. The fact that it doesn't is hugely disappointing, and is the reason I'm spending time writing this review -- to warn other people of what to expect.Yes, I've read the various reviews that explain what's actually going on. But there are so many loose ends and unexplained random characters and events that are left unresolved at the end of the film that it really does feel like just random nonsense thrown together in an effort to make the film seem deeper or more meaningful than it actually is.The in-film references to abstract art are perhaps intended to give us a hint about this. But this film isn't abstract art -- it's more like a Rorschach ink blot, in which audiences are forced to invent interpretations for themselves in order to create meaning where none exists.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

I only know about this because I took of a couple of courses in college years ago, focusing mostly on Samuel Beckett and Eugene Ionesco. If I hadn't studied this, I would have been completely lost and annoyed with this movie. I didn't read the book and I know a lot of people are unhappy he changed the ending, but actually I thought it was pretty good. All the annoyance you feel during every second of this film is intentional. All the dragged out moments, all the lengthy recitation of the literary citations, all the endless driving in the snow. All the depressing scenes. It's not a happy movie. It's not for everybody and there's nothing wrong with that. I don't think anyone finishes it feeling good. But that's true of most of the Theater of the Absurd dramas. Would I recommend it? Only if you don't mind this kind of thing. or are a fan of the genre, or just respect it for what it is. It's not my favorite genre, but it always gives me a lot to think about.

People compared this movie to David Lynch but I don't see it. David Lynch is one of those artists you look foolish trying to imitate. I think that might have happened here. It had its moments like the scene at the Dairy Queen, the nod to David Foster Wallace, the main character (who I don't think is even a real janitor, why does have to be? He can be anything unless he is an actor like Matt Damon playing a part, right?) reciting the scene from a Beautiful Mind (why did none of the reviews mention this?) Overall this felt like a movie about artists feeling alienated from their audience, incapable of sacrificing something that would allow them to connect with their audience and Charlie Kaufmans sticky fingerprints are everywhere.

However, I think the ending could have taken a few pointers from the book. The way it ended made the movie seem incomplete. I also think Kaufman made the mistake of completely omitting the plot-twist. It wasn't apparent enough to the audience that Lucy/the Janitor was Jake the entire time; or even that fact that they were a figment of his imagination.I don't know... and the fact that Jake didn't kill himself with the coat hanger completely ruined the double meaning behind ""I'm thinking of ending things""; given that throughout the story, the audience was under the impression that the girlfriend was only going to break up with Jake.Last but not least, the mysterious message from The Caller. ""There's only one question we need to resolve"" was used in the story as a precursor to what should have been Jake's suicide. It was later revealed that the question was: ""What are you waiting for?"" but that part got left out of the movie. why??Everything about the movie was FINE, except I was hoping for the much darker ending.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

I believe the cast and truly captivating acting are what made me slog through this longwinded and distant film without pulling out my hair. The high minded depth of the story is difficult to appreciate when I don't find any reason to care about the characters. From the outset of the movie a building sense of suspense and dread turns into a very real sense of ""get on with it."" The ending was interesting but again, why do I care about this man? Or his ""girlfriend?"" Was it the distant and benign conversations? The puzzle of the basement that was wildly disappointing? Or maybe the 200 cuts within the same drab car?

The first part of the movie isn't too terrible because you begin to feel unsettled and hope that the spooky atmosphere will have some pay-off. It really falls off the rails when you have to watch the fifth 15 minute long pseudo-intellectual conversation that has no relevance to the plot. I thought about walking away, but I stuck it out with the hope that all would be explained. Don't waste your time waiting, nothing ever is revealed. I generally like thought-provoking movies and this could have been that, had it been 40 to 50 minutes shorter. The last 20 minutes drew on for what felt like hours as it promised to finally end, then didn't over and over again. This movie had promise, but its execution was god awful.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

As I got into the movie I became confused at 'several' points thinking that I must have missed something and at points had to rewatch the previous 5, 10, 15 minutes. That helped me to understand it a bit better... no, just kidding, it didn't. I wondered at times if I was simply simple for 'not getting it', questioning the quality and content my education and life experience. I simply didn't understand what I was seeing. Its like viewing a work by Wassily Kandinsky (yep, I went there) without having any background information. So, its an art-film... maybe. A long 'art-film' that you have to have studied up for to fully appreciate it. Maybe I'll rewatch it, reinvest, after reading the book, doing a lit degree, and blocking out some very, very, free-time. If you possess the prerequisites you'll likely appreciate it out of the gate but if not perhaps another choice to fill in the time. The acting and cinema photography are pretty good but are drowned out by the byzantine nature of the plot.

Clearly it's made for people who get off on finding out the deeper meaning of a film and thinking they're smarter than everyone. The film does have a deeper meaning and that meaning is very interesting. The only issue is you need to sit through one of the most dreadfully boring, painfully irritating, and needlessly droning two hours of your life to maybe somewhat get it, and then there are some details you'll never understand without reading the book because the film in no way on it's own makes it clear. This does not make the film deep. It only means it's poorly executed. There are many films that are long but hold your interest. This is not one of them. There are many pleasurable films that are cryptic. This is not one of them. There are many exciting and tense films that are focused on a small cast, mostly in conversation. This is not one of them. There are many films that are enjoyable on the first watch and increase your appreciation on subsequent watches. This film is never enjoyable to watch. There are many films that are uncomfortable watches but are still fulfilling to watch. This film is just uncomfortable to watch.If you want to appreciate the meaning of this film, you can by just reading the book or even an explanation of the movie. It's interesting to read what this story is truly about. What's not interesting though is sitting through over two hours of this atrocious mess.Don't let pretentious viewers make you believe if you dislike this film then it's just too ""high brow"" for you. The film just manages to pull off the outstanding feat of having amazing actors all doing a good job, having an interesting premise, and still somehow falling completely flat on it's face.

887,M5TO,Alternative explanation post (compatible with book),10,10 September 2020,"The entire trip stands for a relationship between two emotionally unavailable people: a closet narcissist (a janitor who dreams of receiving Nobel prices and standing ovations) and an overachieving student who is afraid of abandonment (she is a physicist, a poet, a painter, a cinema critic, studies gerontology, and when she sees Jake and herself, she sees two perfect people, loving each other, getting married and the relationship ending abruptly, at the hands of an unidentified threat. Her younger self is afraid of the future, of death, and doesn't want to go forward).Although they have a few good conversations and seemingly intellectual connections, the relationship quickly becomes cold, dark, stormy, the passenger feels that things do not make sense, there are inconsistencies (new swings in front of old empty houses), never ending stops (at the parents), unwanted detours (at the ice cream parlour) and diminishing trust (on the way to the highschool). She wants to stop early on, feels the need to have a closer look at things, but the car just goes on, the ""irrelationship"" keeps going.The closet narcissist is in the driver's seat. He barely knows her name, doesn't really see or know her, simply sees her as an ""it"", an extension of himself, who is there to validate him, to make him feel worthy and confident. Also, she is beautiful in her own way, a way that he can feel comfortable with, that he doesn't see as a threat (like the blond girls from his high school, who made fun of him), and this is also why he can tolerate to be with her.She is avoidant/dismissive, she admits to herself that they have a great relationship, a true attachment, but she doesn't know that she cannot really tolerate intimacy (and this is why she is with a guy like that in the first place) and thinks that she should end things, without really knowing why. Because she has actually found ways to feel worthy (overachieving and being successful at it), in contrast with him, she does not need others' validation and she might actually truly be comfortable with ending relationships (but this part is unclear, because she is also insecure in her own way).Being in a relationship with him involves ""visiting his parents"", being exposed to his childhood trauma: parents who only value achievements because they live through him (they have their own issues, poor health/lack of education and he is their ""it"", their object, they obtain validation through him, his achievements). They never value who he really is, hence his feeling of worthlessness, his need for external validation through extraordinary achievements, even if the achievement is here another (objectified) person.He feels so much toxic shame about who he is (a janitor and not a physicist) that in addition to being a closet narcissist, he is a controller: on the one hand he is very diligent but on the other, everything is on his terms, she will only go where he wants her to go (not the basement, for instance), she will only get as close to him as he will let her while not really showing her who he truly is (someone who is really just using her because he feels empty and sad, because his parents were really sweet but cold, never truly there for him).The more they progress in the ride, the more she understands the extent of his general lack of attunement. He doesn't hear her, she has to raise her voice, get angry, repeat what she wants, that she wants to go ""home"". They are not really going home and she feels like they are not really going anywhere. He repeatedly abandons her, when he is scared (at the ice cream parlour), when he is angry (at the high school). Her subconscious is calling her more and more often, telling her that something is really wrong here.And indeed, there is something wrong, because he is so self-centered that it's all really only happening in his head. This is a one-sided relationship. He actually never manages to connect with her or anyone else.This is the best film I have seen in a very long time.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

905,anshitarora,"Do watch it, if you wish to know how and lonely life can be and how it still is okay.",8,16 September 2020,"I'm thinking of ending things - a constant monologue where Lucy is unsure of this very comfortable relationship she is in yet wishes to end it. She's often seen counting the qualities in Jake to weigh how he's good to her, yet it's not what she wants in the longer run.Let's start from the very beginning: It's a lucid tale, rather a collection of dream sequences playing inside the head of an old man (Jake - nearing his death) who wished his life had played out differently and then dreams of what could've been. The viewer is made to think of it as a tale narrated by a girl, but instead her entire persona is made up inside the head of Jake. He sure did meet her once at a club, maybe exchanged a dialogue too but that's about it. She was out with her 'girlfriend' celebrating their anniversary, so the probability of Jake actually dating Lucy is doesn't exist.The old Jake - loved watching movies, musicals and read a whole lot of books but wasn't very good looking and was somewhat timid and shy. He grew up in a household where the relationship between his parents wasn't pleasant. The scratches on the door that lead to the basement were probably his own from the time his parents punished him for not behaving as they wanted him to. So, this guy grows up with insecurities and complexes, often bullied and never did what he really wanted to in life. It's just his imagination that allowed him a certain break from reality.
We witness a calm Jake breaking into fits because that's when the reality catches up and it upsets him. Nothing Lucy say holds any importance since Jake here is the main lead. How frustrating it must be for Jake to accept that even in a dream sequence, the girl doesn't wish to stick around. It's a fight with loneliness that he wishes to ignore but is unable to. His visit to his parent's house shows us a love-hate relationship he had with his parents. Where he is conscious at all times, where he doesn't believe Lucy when she says that she liked them. The insecurities from his past surface time and again.Lucy saw her past and present in Jake's house. One might question why? the answer is as simple as: 'how accurate do you expect dreams to be? Of course she felt like she's known him all her life, since she is just role playing a character Jake made up. But we see her telling the old Jake in the school that she doesn't remember what Jake looked like because the real her met him ONCE in a pub somewhere. She even said that they never shared a dialogue. Here we see Jake hugging her goodbye since it's time he let her go. He has no strength to left to dream no more.We break into a ballet here and give Jake an award for his writing where everyone seems to be pleased and happy for him. This is nothing but an alternate reality he wished was true. He doesn't commit suicide; he simply follows his end. Follows the pig, he dreaded all his life, filled with maggots and worms, gaining words of wisdom about life and what connects us all.This string of events is just an escape for Jake where he finds love in an alternate universe and pursues his dreams of being a writer and wins and most of all is not lonely. Supporting parents, caring wife and a life of value.Our internal monologues and dreams are all we have to support ourselves. I understand Jake because I've lived a similar life (so far). I have scenarios playing inside my head where I'm happy and loved. I know it's all in my head but it makes me happy and allows me to live, if only for a few moments.A person of his calibre ends up being a janitor, cleaning the school he once attended. The beginning of the end started here and this is where he leaves us all. (I'm assuming the auditorium in the end is of this school too). My hobby in life is cleaning. Weird but it's true. I often dream while cleaning. I'm smiling while writing this. I hope I don't end up like Jake. Oh and I'm a writer too. *grins*",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

I also appreciated both Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich from the same writer, but this was outright unenjoyable.The acting was very good. Jessie Buckley's line memorization skills were fantastic (much kudos for her numerous, VERY wordy monologues); Toni Collette and David Thewlis are terrific no matter what they do; and I felt Jesse Plemons was well-suited for the lifeless character he portrayed. The movie itself was well-made - both odd and artistic.The story, however? Meh, bleh, and pa-tooey ... The script was confusing as hell. I mean, I'm not an idiot - I understood things that were happening in the moment, but those moments never seemed to culminate into a bigger picture. (Maybe I AM an idiot?) If I'm going to subject myself for two hours to a movie that seems to be going nowhere and everywhere all at the same time, I expect a GREAT twist at the end to justify all of my ""wasted"" time. I didn't even realize this movie HAD ended ... I thought the end credits were explaining a new scene! Now, I have to go read other peoples' explanations - which I hate doing, because every interpretation is different, but I feel obligated to try and find the meaning of something I wasted two hours of my life on.

Even the ones that gave it a high score.First off, there will be a large number of people who will hate this. Hands up if you are neither interested in dreams/psychoanalysis or feminism. You guys are going to have a bad time here.This is a dream sequence of what it feels like to be a woman who's life is subsumed into the life of a man she doesn't really madly want to be with. (""I'm thinking of ending things"")Oklahoma is the background foil (a story of a woman's identity created by the dude she chooses to marry) to a complicated, messy story of a kind woman accidentally throwing her life away into the hands of just some guy who knows nothing about her. He doesn't really know her name. Her friends try and call her, but she loses them. What she does for a living is a plastic thing, and more importantly, all she does in the first half of the movie is try and get back to this nebulous job that may or may not exist.She become his mother for a brief moment in the first act! - it's magical!I feel like Kauffman has moved a lot from the source material to tell a very interesting story. The entire history of a male/female love affair, with the madness of the source, but the achingly real truth of the reality of a lot of women in the world. They defer their lives to random, always idiosyncratic men. Women's relationship with men, often, for example, mean living a life in that man's high school - dealing with the complexity of his relationship with his childhood - this is what women do. And then they clap the man, failure or success as he was in their old age, for awards the are as surreal as their clapping.It's a magnificent, feminist movie. It's unique, I think.

For the first hour I got hooked, I was expecting, hoping for something more, but then, the whole movie stayed flat. I know there are movie snobs that think this is an excellent film, based on symbol and interpretation, however, this means nothing if the film is outright bad. Myself, being quite good at interpreting deep, meaningful films, while also being big fans of them, was left nothing enjoyable from this film. I want my 2 hours back Netflix. I also don't understand what audience this film is for, and if I did, it would probably be a very niche audience.

Worth viewing more than once and I expect it would also help if one has seen the musical Oklahoma which I have not but now definitely will.Ultimately I found it to be profoundly moving and quite sad.

919,wondervalley,Wow that was terrible...,1,22 September 2020,"I think this might be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This review may appear to contain spoilers, though I'll be as vague as possible.The biggest issue was ""fantasy"" ending. Once they started dancing, I started fast forwarding, assuming I was in for another far too-long ""poetry reading"" unimportant to the plot, like earlier in the film. I then could not stand and had to fast forward through the singing part. I ended up fast forwarding all the way to the end, and rather than rewind and watch, I just googled the ending because I couldn't make sense of what I watched nor could I bear to spend another moment with any of these characters. I'm middle-aged and this is the first time I've ever skipped the end of a film or searched for the meaning of an ending I couldn't mostly put together myself. I have a BFA. I studied film. I've written screenplays and midterms on european art films and I worked in hollywood. I am by no means a good critic or trying to make myself sound important in any way, but this was actually the first film I saw that I didn't understand the ending of, nor did I understand the plot. The film in it's entirety lacked cohesion. The characters all make you feel somewhere between incredibly uncomfortable and completely irritated. I don't understand the ""horror"" genre label. The only horror is being trapped on a bad date via this film for 2 hours. This screenplay feels like it was a rushed finals project by an undergrad who turned their nonsensical drunken dream into a directionless paper so they could avoid failing the class.I could go on, but I can't wait to try and forget I wasted my time on this.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

921,woofits,"Not everyone's cup of tea, obviously.",9,26 September 2020,"Sunshine of the Spotless Mind remains one of my favorite all-time movies. I watched ""Ending Things"" after listening to ""The Next Picture Show"" podcast which included only a few plot spoilers. So I knew from the the beginning some of the difficult to figure out plot elements. I can see how the movie would confound a viewer otherwise. Even so, I watched the movie twice to unpack more of this movie constant drip of cryptic clues. Hardly any prop, any line of dialog or song lyric is a throwaway. Seemingly everything connects and serves to reveal to the observant what is really happening on this fractured road trip movie. What seems like inconsequential lines like when Jake mentions that he has chains in the ""bed"" to reassure his ""girlfriend"" that they will be safe on the car trip home, hint at the true identity of the characters. Cars don't have ""beds"", but pickup trucks do. There are hundreds of these tiny clues that slowly reveal things aren't at all what they seem, and slowly assemble like puzzle pieces to reveal the dark landscape that lies beneath the surface. There are so many themes in this movie, its plot reveal does not play like the one trick pony of Fight Club, or Identity. It mines disturbing subjects like one's deep regret of a life wasted, the ravages of aging, childhood trauma, psuedo intellectualism as a cover for intense feelings of inferiority, misogyny and so many more. All themes Charlie Kauffman has in spades in every project he has ever put his stamp on. This movie takes more effort, and is more uncomfortable than his previous works, but I believe is worth the investment. Watching it twice is almost required to begin to truly comprehend the movie. For me anyway this movie is not one that was easily dislodged from my brain when the closing titles ended.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

923,nordicnoir,A psychological masterpiece far away from nonsense,10,27 September 2020,"I'm geting a bit annoyed with all the reviews dismissing the movie because they don't understand it therefore calling the plot nonsense. I admit that it is not easy to understand but I do think it is possible to do so. I didn't feel like I fully understood it when I first saw it, but I still appreciated it. The atmospheres created are terrific with a strong unsettling feeling throughout the whole movie that really gets under your skin. I've never seen a movie so close to my experience of dreams, or maybe nightmares would be a more accurate description.I was mesmerised by it even though I couldn't fully understand it. I could have left it there, but the movie stayed with me. I kept thinking about it and discussing it with my partner and found that bits and pieces came together. I read some interpretations of it and finally also a interview with the Kaufman confirming many of these interpretations and ideas that we had about it. That the movie actually is understandable did not make it flat or boring though, I was even more amazed by how cleverly it is built up and found it even more touching. It is an incredibly sad and tragic story made so alive and even beautiful.Just because something is not easy to understand does not mean that it is stupid. This is a movie that dares to demand things of its viewers, where everything is not served on a silver plate. You don't have to understand it and you are allowed to make your own interpretations, it's still a strong experience. If you really want to understand the thoughts behind it, it is also possible. But I suggest you don't read about it before seeing the movie, it would take away some of its magic and the chance to have your own thoughts about it.Overall one of the best movies I've seen and I hope that you will give it a chance!",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

Its two pivotal characters, Jake and Lucy, are portrayed brilliantly throughout their rollercoaster ride through romance and homecoming. The film is unapologetic in its invocation of the very best in cultural theory (Guy Debord) and psychoanalysis. Yet the intellectual content in no way subtracts from the fascination of the characters or the quirky time-lags and future shock masking the events so memorable. The film boils down, in the end, to the reminiscence and fantasy of a midwestern high school janitor in the dead winter of the year and of his work-life.

Lars von Trier, David Lynch all their heavy stuff is at least leading to something. After 30 minutes of the movie it was clear that the characters are all the same person, but at the same time it was not clear. The move made me doubt that every now and then. At the same time I was asking my self ""ok it may be some kind of delusion, but than where does it lead to?"" And to be hones it lead to nothing. I waited and waited and the movie didn't have a motive except ""reality is not what it seems, live is dreadfull repetitive and boring and icecream is now a synonym for missed oportunities."" It is in a similar way self absorbed and self destructive as ""melancholia"" but way less visually bombastic. It is something but for me it is not enough and for a broader public it is too much. I kept on wondering, is this supposed to by an elaboration about live? If it is, it is way to broad and way too intellectual. There is not enough room in this movie to cover all it wants to tell and at the same time it is too long. This should have stayed a book, it feels certainly like one and that on the other hand is the strength of the movie. Its poetic nature which is appealing but it can't carry you through its length. And if you are not a fan of musicals and American movie history the last 40 minutes will be torture.

It's definitely difficult to wrap your head around and it basically requires a 2nd or 3rd rewatch, but I still thought it was fantastic the first time. Great acting, cinematography, and writing. Its definitely a slow burner but if you're into that kind of stuff then it works really well. The slow pacing and dreamlike quality of this movie along with a bizarre story that unfolds and isn't clear until the end will definitely turn off a lot of people, but if you like that kind of stuff then you'll enjoy it.I understand why people hated this movie. It was released on Netflix and had a misleading trailer which led a lot of people to watch this when it probably wasn't going to be up their alley. I'm not saying that people who don't like this movie are dumb, it just takes a certain personality and taste in movies to enjoy it and a lot of people who wouldn't have normally seen it ended up watching it because of the Netflix release.I recommend it highly if you like ""artsy"" and ""confusing"" films. Give it a watch, then a rewatch, and maybe look on YouTube to find other people's interpretations. This is a fun film to discuss with other people and hear different perspectives.

I should start with saying that I have so much respect and admiration for the cast. The portrayal of the girl, Jake, his mother and his father were amazing. In his own right the janitor also tugged at my heartstrings. However, the performances do not make up for the overall deficit this film created. I think my main issues with this film boil down to its adaptation from the book and its marketing. Choppy is the best way I can describe the transition from print to film. Things were either verbatim from the book or completely fabricated and left me wondering why they thought that piece would add something to the film. With no material that fit in the middle I just felt discombobulated a lot of the time. If someone hadn't read the book I think they would watch this movie and either turn it off about 20 minutes in, or watch it in its entirety, and have no idea what just happened. I also have to say how incredibly disappointed I was that this film was marketed almost as a ""scary"" movie. I completely agree that this is a psychologically stimulating book but I feel it was very misrepresented by Netflix. This story is raw, real and thought provoking. All of that gets lost in the film. My heart goes out to the janitor.

968,AlexReviewsNews,The pig represents bad choices,4,25 April 2021,"One of the big themes of the book was wasted potential. The ending of the novel is an emotional reveal that we've been experiencing a 'Remains of the Day' style re-imagining of what life could have been with braver and better choices.True to the book, the film is a meta-exploration of choice and wasted potential.The strange casting decision of the main character - canonically a lanky and awkward but attractive academic - as the heavy-set psychopath idiot redneck from Breaking Bad struck me as odd. The film was fine though, if a bit pretentious or slow at times, until the dreadful new ending where the boyfriend suddenly follows a cartoon pig into the snow.I now realise this choice to squander the terrifying and easily-translatable-to-film ending of the book, in which the main character believes she's been locked in a
school by a psychopath who just murdered her boyfriend, in favour of a bespoke musical number and talking cartoon pig was intentionally trash!It shows how in life, and in creative pursuits such as film-making, there are objectively wrong decisions. Personally, given the aim was obviously to trash any semblance of tension or emotional pay-off for the viewer, they should had a new janitor played by Nicolas Cage step out of a locker and fight the original janitor with a mop. Midway through the fight, Cage - losing to the protagonist - would crack his mop in half with red light sabre blades popping out from the splintered wood. The protagonist then reveals he too is a Jedi and force pushes Cage back into the locker from whence he came.Summary:
All the acting is fine; just a really trash end to an otherwise okay script and I do think a nerdier actor would have made more sense. I'm not sure who the movie would appeal to.

Apparently daydreaming in a really creepy way about his none existing phantom disappointed girlfriend.. Actually pretty cool, but why so surreal and hard to watch??
Really offending how disgustingly present the the artsyness is holding its chin.
But philosoph.. The univer.. Alzheim.. Everything is meaningl.. A philosophy janitor.. Wow
A boiled down soup of easy to ask no answer life questions leaving you with a cheap bad taste.
Easiest means of envoking emotional envolvement.... Confuse everyone and throw some alzheimers in there and wrinkles and then that'll surely mess with heads. Dirty and easy tricks to get people feeling demented.
Time is running out, everyone is getting old, the janitor is old... you see??! and YAWN dying too with belly cancer.. The extra small credits at the end made me regret my life decision of pressing play on this joyless piece of embarrassment. 2 hours negative impact on my life. And now I get to feel old and blind too? So clever that I forgot it already because so much time had passed.
Sometimes you just know how a director is right there, behind the camera, at all times.. Reminding you that it's all ""just"" ""art"".. Art which is now going to make many people feel like having had a bad dream awake.
Intellectually robbed by being fed nothing other than old universal ideas of sadness. A janitor giving up his life to care for parents and awkward with girls??? A janitor.. The sad genius janitor ruined by life. Such a good idea for a movie.

995,jackthornefuturemft,EXCELLENT BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE,9,25 September 2020,"Charlie Kaufman is well known for his head-scratching plots but ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" takes that idea to a whole other level. If you are looking for a linear and logical plot, don't bother. This is not a story that moves in a straight line. In fact, it's more like a fever dream. It's the type of film that can only be enjoyed on its own terms and not the viewer's. But if you are willing to let it take you down the rabbit hole, the payoff is good. Many people are getting frustrated with this film and I'm not surprised. The same thing happened with Aronofsky's ""mother!"" and Lynch's ""Inland Empire"".

1005,cannedcorn,Not worth the effort of watching,5,7 November 2020,"I like non-linear story telling. I like movies that make us question the nature of truth and reality. I like Charlie Kaufman films, even his ""bad"" ones. But this movie, I did not like. The first forty five minutes or so were pretty good. Slow paced, but I thought I was in for a decent movie. But the movie becomes almost unwatchable once the main characters leave the farmhouse.Movies don't need to make sense or follow a traditional narrative. Some of my favourite films don't make sense, but if your movie doesn't follow a traditional narrative, you'd better make absolutely sure your movie evokes emotion and interest. For me, this film does neither. Aside from a vague feeling of discomfort because I didn't want to spend this much time with the main characters, I was mostly bored and didn't care. Much of the dialogue is incredibly pretentious, and I felt like with this film Charlie Kaufman was really trying to tell us how smart he is. Charlie, don't tell us, show us.Another failure is the fact that there is in fact a narrative to the movie, but it's completely buried and pretty much impossible to follow. I gathered pretty early on that the janitor was Jake, and a few pieces of story along with way, but maybe because I got bored and started checking my phone it wasn't until I came to IMDB and read other reviews that I had an idea of the actual story. A movie doesn't need to have a story to be good, but if your movie does have a story but is so opaque the audience can't really tell that it's there, you've failed as a filmmaker. As well, with a tragic story such as this one, it's important for the audience to actually care about the protagonist. Jake didn't evoke my interest. I didn't care about him or his emotions. I didn't care about any of the characters at all.I boosted my review to five stars due to excellent performances, particularly from Toni Collette and David Thewlis. If you're watching on Netflix, fast forward to their scenes and turn the movie off when they're done.

1008,Gintius,Less confusing than the book,9,8 September 2020,"Having read the novel first, I was really curious to see how this story could be transferred to the screen. I feel like the book leaves more for interpretation and it's possible to see it in a different light, wheareas the movie clarifies a certain narrative, The film does stay true to the book for the most part, although the ending is dealt with in a different way (trying to avoid spoilers here).The way I see it, it gives a glimpse into a troubled mind's perspective on life. It is clear that the protagonist - Jake has mental health issues. Some of the names of ilnesses are mentioned in the film - schizophrenia, alzheimers, dementia. It is mentioned in regards to Jake's parents, however, he himself displays some of the similar symptoms.All of the characters except Jake have no stability - the woman who is Jake's love interest has a few different names and seems confused about it herself at one point. The parents keep aging rapidly and don't act like real people would. It is all happening in his mind.An intellectual person struggling with mental health issues, living in his imaginary world where he creates different scenarios, finds comfort and where he comes to when trying to decide whether he wants to end things for good. His imaginary family and partner is all he has.The rotting pig that comes to lead him to his end becomes a metaphor for a person being ""eaten from the inside"" by the mental struggles and torment. Nobody notices until it is way too late and the only way to deal with is is to end their suffering.While it is a really dark subject to tackle I absolutely loved how it was dealt with. The unexpectedness, the poetic motifs, the subtle details that unravell this heavy story little by little until it reaches its culmination.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

I will say that Kaufman has a a skill when it comes to horror, there were scenes that made my skin crawl. However, I'm saddened to say how much of a disappointment this film was. When people say you need to read the book to understand the film that is a sign of a film poorly made. A filmmaker should be good enough that I can understand the film completely without having to read the book.

I would not recommend this film to just anyone as I have learned many don't enjoy the intellectual aspects of movies. People want films they can take in with no effort. Audiences want to be spoon fed cliches that are easy to digest. This film is not that.I was glued to the screen. And it took days to wrap my head around all of the metaphors and symbolism.

1023,famourt,"Best When It's Funny, Worst When Ponderous",5,14 September 2020,"So the overused (and often misquoted) line from Winston Churchill goes like this: ""a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma."" That little phrase might apply to Charlie Kaufmann's ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things,"" were the film not too cryptic even for THAT description.This is the type of movie that will completely separate two types of viewers: those who don't mind obtuseness versus those who need clarity. For this viewer, I don't mind European or art-house films, but I do tend to grow weary of that which is cryptic for it's own sake.And for my taste, there's far too much of that in this film. Unlike Kaufmann's shining glories, say, ""Eternal Sunshine..."", there's really nothing that grounds this film. There's no baseline of reality, narrative nor emotional, to tether the bizarre flights of fancy.Don't get me wrong. There are stretches of this movie that I loved. The dinner with the parents has so many moments of deadpan hilarity amid all the awkward pauses, I thought I was watching vintage Coen Brothers.But Kaufmann spends too much of the film throwing out hints of ideas that never pay off. Characters refer to incidents in the past, or to odd visual cues like ominous scratches on a door, that simply lead nowhere. I'm not saying that every movie needs to provide a payoff on every element, I'm not THAT uptight. But I do want to feel that if I'm donating my time and attention to a film, the filmmaker has enough respect for me as a viewer to not simply indulge himself for two plus hours.There are those who will find the final 15 minutes of this film brilliant. To me, those folks are the type who declare nonsense as artistic, simply because it's not logical or linear. I'm not one of those folks.

While some films make it easier to make an analysis of the end, this film lead me confused and disappointed.

1030,lottielay95,"If you like it, you like it (I guess)",5,15 September 2020,"I felt, whilst watching this movie, that i should be enjoying it more than i was. The film is visually gripping; the story is told through the use of odd camera angles that leave the viewer feeling off balance, the movement (or lack thereof) in certain shots forcing characters into action in a way that feels not entirely scripted, but something not far off. There is an eery sense behind every interaction that a question is dying to be asked, but what question is not immediately forthcoming. (The world in which this story sits is certainly teetering on the precipice of the uncanny valley in all the right ways.)The performances of the main cast are compelling, and the sound editing and set design emerse the viewer fully in this tiny, packaged world of mystery. Like i said before, this is definitely a film i thought i was going to enjoy a lot more than i eventually did. My main problem was with the ambiguous nature of the plot.My issue lies in the ending; largely that it is left open to interpretation. On the whole, leaving an ending up to viewer interpretation is not always a bad thing, but if the viewer is left with a sense of ""but WHY did it end like that?"" or ""so what did all of THAT mean"" then you've probably taken a misstep as a film maker somewhere along the lines. Yes, the plot of this film is disjointed and the narration unreliable for a reason, but the overall payoff the viewer is granted for spending two hours attempting to decipher the meaning behind each line or look is.... not as gratifying as it should be.TL,DR: Overall, this film is beautifully made, but if you're expecting a satisfying ending or resolution (or an in-plot explanation of anything, for that matter) then brace yourself for disappointment. This film leaves you out in the middle of a blizzard not knowing which way to turn next.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

1034,teplovdima,A fine riddle making your blood run cold,8,12 February 2021,"When you're watching a film by Charlie Kaufman, you know it's going to make you think. And ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" is not an exception. Even though it's not an original screenplay, you will have some questions after the screening.The plot has some differences from a book of the same name by Iain Reid - so even if you're a fan of this novel, you'll find something interesting in Kaufman's interpretation. The adaptation still plays with genres and leads you to the things you couldn't expect. At one point you think this a breaking-up story turning to a thriller, then it has its comedy moments and in the end it feels like some kind of philosophical parable.During all film Kaufman gives you hints, that something is wrong. At least take a closer look at the clothings of the main heroine. And of course you will praise the work of art directors, set and costume designers - it gives you the vibe of 'The Shining' and early Coens' films.Talking about actors' performances, we should notice the work of David Thewlis - he again tries on his character image from the first season of 'Fargo' - his acting is even stronger than there, maybe a little more comical (But who said it is bad?) Jessie Buckley is playing a really nice and charming girl, and Jesse Plemons plays her boyfriend, keeping his dull and suspicious character with him.And after the credits you will talk with your friend trying to solve a Kaufman and Reid's riddle - and probably in an hour or so you will succeed. But let me ask you a question: is it what you want when you're watching a film by this ingenious director? For me the answer is 'please, no'.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

1055,miguelreyna60,"The more I understand it, the less I like it",7,5 September 2020,"Actually the more I think about this film the less I enjoy it. I keep thinking about how Kaufman could've made this one of the most upsetting/disturbing movies ever made. It's creepy, thats for sure. But instead, he chooses to simply thread surreal/disturbing set pieces together with ruminations on art and media that comes off as incredibly self indulgent. I get what he's going for, I understand why he does it. But it's not something that I walk away from satisfied. I simply walk away exhausted and slightly annoyed. The first half of the film is so brilliant in comparison to the last half. A meditation on the ugliness of a ""pathetic"", sad person's life, a meditation on memory and its destruction, on lost chances and false hopes, on the sheer ugliness of the maggots that feed on the underbelly of a life led wrong. The atmosphere was so thick it could be cut with a knife. The feeling of going inside an abandoned farmhouse during a blizzard that lacerates and seeing all the sad, desperate ghosts of the pasts walking along empty corridors on a loop looking for something but finding nothing. Its the emotions that the songs of The Caretaker evokes transferred into film format. But that second half slowly trails off into the annoying and self indulgent. I'm sorry, but I just don't think having a character recite the entirety of Pauline Kael's negative review of A Woman Under the Influnce for like six minutes is particularly clever or interesting, no matter how much Charlie Kaufman may think it is.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

1076,beatrizpvcoutinho,Here's some help understanding the meaning of the movie,7,4 September 2020,"To anyone who has no idea what they have just watched here is the opinion of someone who read the book (which helps a lot in understanding the movie).The book also starts with Jake and his girlfriend going to visits his parents house. The girlfriend had been getting strange phone calls for weeks from her own number, and whoever is calling always leaves a voicemail saying ""there is only one question to answer"" but she hasn't told Jake about it yet. When they get to jakes house the interactions are also odd but Jakes parents dont age like in the movie. When they finally leave they also stop at the ice cream shop and then at the school where Jake disappears. Worried , his girlfriend goes after him , and there are many pages describing how terrified she is while going through rooms from the school where only a janitor lives. That's when the big plottwist of the book happens. You find out that the girlfriend never existed, it was only someone Jake once met when he was young but he didn't manage to get the courage to ask for her number. You find out that when he was young he was a bright young man who worked at a lab but he lacked social skills so he was never able to make many friends, or even just interact with people, so eventually he quit and became a janitor so he could be alone. However he becomes extremely lonely, slowly loosing his mind while dreaming of the life he could have lived and the importance of relationships. You find out that the ""question"" mentioned on the phone calls is ""What are you waiting for"" (which unfortunately doesn't appear in the movie although the phone calls do). This is what Jake has been thinking for days while debating if he should or shouldnt kill himself. So he writes a notebook with this whole story of the girlfriend which is basically the book you are reading and he eventually kills himself over loneliness.In the movie there isn't a big plottwist because it is much more evident throughout the movie that this is sort of a dream, or that it's not really reality. The girlfriend says in the end that she never actually talked to Jake indicating that they never dated. The death occurs in the dance scene but it's not as explicit as in the book. The final song seems to be about not giving up which Jake tried for a long time. I'm just disappointed that they never reveal what the question of the phone calls was , because it makes them feel pointless...There are many scenes in the movie that don't happen in the book, but overall the story is the same. I believe they made an amazing adaptation! It is very visually pleasing, the acting is amazing and I loved the mixing of dance, music and animation when you weren't expecting at all.So there you have it! I hope this helped some of you understanding the movie a bit better !",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

1081,hannahmettam,Eternal sunshine meets black mirror,8,4 September 2020,"Although confusing and elaborate at times, this movie tackles many large philosophical concepts in great depth and a spectacularly poetic manner.A continuous theme appears to be identity and the lack of originality. Throughout the movie none of the characters are named besides 'jake'. His girlfriend is referred to by a number of names and said to have several differing occupations. This along with quotes and monologues delivered by the young women highlight the unoriginal and plagiarised personalities of many. The film emphasises the idea that no idea is original and everyone already exists in some variation or another.This film employs a dream like state to further this surrealist experience. Every scene appears out of the norm featuring quirky characters, and symbols set to classical music. The abrupt jump cuts and seemingly circular time line further emphasises this lucid dream like state.The confusing aspects of each scene and constant contradictory statements given by the characters are almost to say that everything is relative and meaningful while also nothing is -In a nutshell it is a very artsy, thought provoking film that I thoroughly enjoyed.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

Half-finished lines of needlessly pretentious dialogue mumbled in a poorly shot, poorly lit Oldsmobile (where you will spend over 46 minutes of this torture) and none of it lands or feels relevant. Nothing fleshes out the character. Other reviewers say Jake is meant to be a failed intellectual with severe social anxieties. The movie shows you an angry incel through piecemealed vignettes maybe commit suicide by interpretive dance. You will check your watch frequently while watching this movie; save yourself the 2.25 hours and rewatch literally any other movie. You're welcome.P.s. my fiancee nearly scalped herself in frustration trying to watch this film. It was an excersise of sheer will to actually complete this: something the movie itself can't even say it accomplished because it cuts to credits abruptly for no reason.

If you are a hip-hop aficionado you don't scold black metal releases.This is an incredibly sad and heartbreaking movie about lost chances. It scares to think how many people will actually recognize themselves... I know I did. It speaks to me on a new level I never imagined will challenge me. As someone who has also been alone most of their life, I can attest to know exactly what it's like to fantasize about women and create elaborate scenarios in my head.Topics raised are all but lighthearted - childhood trauma, ostracism, lookism, loneliness, having no life, mental issues, longing for human connection, abandonment, regret, suicide, aging, you name it. It's a huge genre-bending wake up slap for many. Not a date movie for sure.Probably labeling it Get Out type of horror was too misleading. It's still a horror movie, about horrors of life, getting older and obsolete and ugly.

I recommend making yourself familiar with Oklahoma!, A Woman Under the Influence and maybe even A Beautiful Mind, prior to watching, as each is referenced and can lend understanding to the themes.Kaufman has always been a master story-teller, and especially proficient in presenting a compelling visual palette, but with this film a dance is performed between the dialogue and the visual that - with close attention by the viewer - can help unravel the mystery of what is happening.Wonderful performances by Jesse Plemons,Jesse Buckley, Toni Collete and David Thewlis.",I'm Thinking of Ending Things

I am someone who very much plays out whole scenario's in their head and oh damn, was some of the dialogue in the film the epitome of just that process.Personally, I'm very impressed with this film.

As a big Kaufman fan myself I had wondered if this was where he had gone off into full pretentiousness. But after finishing it and thinking on it and discussing this movie. I can't get enough of it. It's been creeping on my mind ever since I first saw it. Then after a rewatch the movies ideas are baked into atypical structure & various small details.

1128,nadiakireiev,This film does a really great job.... at straying away from the book,5,26 September 2020,"This film does a really great job.... at straying away from the book but it was somewhat entertaining nonetheless... I was excited to watch the film try and tackle what treasures the book really has to offer.... but it failed to pin point major details in the book and left them out all together. That's my fault, however, for having such high expectations for two separate minds joining forces to convey the same idea... I think the producers of this film tried so hard to come up with an organic portrayal of such a unique original idea that it forgets its drawn its inspiration from a book. It often trails off and does it's own thing then remembers its based on a book... and reverts back to it, momentarily, only for it to trail off on its own again... choreographing new moves in place of already innovative techniques. It's like watching two realities crossing that normally run blindly parallel to one another. A fever dream is the best way to describe the film, but a timely unfolding of a man's internalization of his psychological grasp on the world is the best way to describe the novel. This book is riddled with amazing quotes that I could use to describe what happened in this film, or even how it made me feel, but the film fails to even hint at them most of the time, if at all really. The book will resonate with you whereas the film will leave you scratching your head.. as it becomes just another title on your recently previewed Netflix films. Never to be watched again unless you want to feel like you're lucidly navigating a strange drug trip. This film is like a post doctorate thesis branching off a concrete philosophical concept that already pioneered a new style of thinking.... shaping a new idea and using the book as a small citation for reference purposes. I'll give it an A for effort and originality but perhaps this book was best to be left exactly as that... a book.

And we do explore them.For awhile. I guess. But it seemed like Kaufman doesn't ever bother to come to a conclusion on any of it, and lapses into a surreal soup by the end. If I'm suppose to get any deeper meaning from all this, I lost hold of that thread back at the farm, and as the curtains close, I'm left without any meaning to hold onto.If I'd felt there was a sense of purpose to how he's left me, there might be some satisfaction in all this.
