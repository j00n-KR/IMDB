0,SnoopyStyle,intriguing start to old style romance,6,1 August 2021,"It's 1965 London. Jennifer Stirling (Shailene Woodley) returns home to her husband Laurence (Joe Alwyn) after a stay in the hospital. They're wealthy from the stuffy upper crust of society. It's a loveless and childless marriage. He's controlling and she's pining for escape. The couple goes on vacation. Reporter Anthony O'Hare (Callum Turner) arrives to interview Laurence. In modern day London, Ellie Haworth (Felicity Jones) is a dissatisfied single gal. She's been assigned to write a bio for a former editor of her paper. She had recently died and left her archival material with the paper. Ellie finds a mysterious love letter which intrigues her to investigate further.I like the start. It has good potential although the back and forth in time period always held a danger to the narrative flow. One side or the other could falter and stall the entire movie. To me, the emotional high point is the dinner early in the movie. This is a movie about Jennifer seeking independence from Laurence more than about a love story between Jennifer and Anthony. On top of that, they do the Love Affair turn going to meet on top of the Empire State Building. I'm disappointed that they're doing this old trope. Quite frankly, I'd rather have him die and she has to find independence by herself. The other side has a smaller issue for me. I want Rory to be more. They try to do the combative meet-cute between Ellie and Rory but he doesn't hold up his side of the bargain. He's too weak to fight back. This is an old style romance and there is nothing wrong with that. It's simply not anything more than passable.",The Last Letter from Your Lover
1,kosmasp,The Last Note Letter without a book,7,25 July 2021,"Well I can only imagine it is based on a book. And considering the similarities I can detect with Notebook (one of the best romantic dramas to ever grace our screens or wherever you choose to watch it) ... that should not be a surprise.Having said that, the movie has also really good actors for the different time periods it is playing and dishing out to us. You have to be inclined to like romantic movies at least a little ... otherwise do not even think about watching this. The timelines work (both) and you can see the connection (I don't think it is too hard to predict most of what is going to happen ... which is not really a bad thing ... it is the journey after all we embark on, that is the one that excites us)",The Last Letter from Your Lover
2,CinemaSerf,I think we will see more of Callum Turner...,7,15 September 2021,"It has taken them quite a while to realise that an A-list cast is only going to work if there is A-list writing too, but here Netflix appear to have managed to reconcile the two with this rather interesting tale. It all begins when Felicity Jones (""Ellie"") discovers an intriguing letter which, with the help of her archivist pal ""Rory"" (Nathan Rizwan), she decides to investigate further. What follows is a parallel story of the original, clandestine relationship from the 1960s featuring Callum Turner and Shailene Woodley told alongside the modern day tale of the search to find, and maybe to reconcile the two. It features some good writing, and the characterisations are engaging in a gentle sort of way. It has a simplicity to it that - especially from Turner and Woodley - elicits a sense of sympathy especially a the machinations of her then husband ""Lawrence"" (Joe Alwyn) become clearer to us. As you might expect, there is plenty of attention to the detail - costumes, lovely old cars and interiors that lend authenticity to this simple, but engagingly told story of love from a time when women had a right to choose how they lived their lives, but lacked much of the opportunity to implement that choice.",The Last Letter from Your Lover
3,vincentlynch-moonoi,Give it a few minutes,7,25 July 2021,"I have a somewhat flexible rule that when I start to watch a film if it hasn't captured my interest in 12 or so minutes I move on. And I was getting ready to move on when this film caught me. The problem in the first 12-15 minutes is that -- at least to me -- it seemed a bit confusing. Then it settled down, and what you have here is a very intriguing love story...of infidelity...that seems justified. That's not to say that infidelity is a good thing, but when your spouse is a jerk...Felicity Jones plays a young journalist who uncovers some old and mysterious love letters from 1965 that captivates her attention as she explores the archives of a present-day London newspaper. She finds quite a tale as she finds more and more of the letters, and eventually she discovers who wrote them.The lovers are played by Callum Turner as the financial journalist who falls in love with a rising young politician's wife played by Shailene Woodley.Meanwhile, as a side story, Felicity Jones' character has a fling with an archivist (played by Nabhaan Rizwan).Will the 1965's lovers ever get together. Well, the ending is not exactly a surprise, but there are many twists along the way as the story slowly unfolds as each newly discovered letter gives more clues.Toward the end of the film, the two lovers are played by Ben Cross and Diana Kent.With the exception Ben Cross, I wasn't familiar with any of these British actors, but they all do very nice job.The ending of the film is rather sweet, also I was a little dissatisfied with brief fantasy that the two old lovers have.But still, this film was very worth watching, and I recommend it.",The Last Letter from Your Lover

The chemistry between Shailene and Callim was good and the costumes were nice too. I also like to add that the 60s setting was interesting.From the novel by Jojo Moyes who also wrote Me Before You.

9,martimusross,"Not A Romance, More A Tawdry Adulterous Fling!",6,28 July 2021,"The Last Letter From Your LoverI enjoyed this movie while I watched it, but with hindsight it was riddled with some bizarre plot holes and was just overly contrived.What was good, the styling and cinematography was ravishing and definitely brought up this movie. From the wallpapers to the interiors, not to mention the hair and the fabulous sixties fashions, this aspect was a treat and then set this is the Côte d'Azur how could you fail.The whole ensemble was committed, but Jennifer Stirling played by Shailene Woodley was a triumph of making some terrible scenarios and clunky script work. Callum Turner dominated his scenes and just gets better and better!The main problems,I could see little romance, a decadent wife of a industrialist embarks, out of boredom, on a tawdry holiday romance. She then flirts with the idea of running away from her ""awful"" marriage. Due to circumstance this fails, she then has a child and lives the next 30 years with her ""terrible"" husband for fear her child is taken from her.Of course this is drivel, the husband stood by her knowing her folly, and despite being cuckolded he clearly loved her and seemed very kind to her, if she had wanted to leave she could have left the minute the child reached 16, the laws on divorce changed in 1971 so she was not trapped, and her lover was a well known journalist in New York, hardly difficult to track down.The societal comment on the state of romanticism today, portrayed by Ellie and Rory, reflected how much today is all about me, me and more me, hardly convincing when it is self-evident that the bedrock of the United Kingdom is still, in the main, the traditional family unit.Overall, this is a weak 6 out of 10,",The Last Letter from Your Lover

11,bob-the-movie-man,A proper old-fashioned love story that older viewers will appreciate.,8,9 August 2021,"Is ""chick flick"" a phrase that you can use these days? I guess not, since it infers that a movie is only of interest to a particular gender. Perhaps ""Sunday afternoon film"" is a better phrase. And ""The Last Letter From Your Lover"" is a real SAF.Positives:
""They don't make them like this any more"" the saying goes. This is a love story cum melodrama that is well told by director Augustine Frizzell, in only her second feature. The film zips backwards and forwards between different time periods, trusting the audience to keep up with where we are. The dialogue is suitably soupy for a film of this type, based on a Jojo Moyes book (who wrote ""Me Before You"", also well-filmed). I've seen a critic review in ""The Times"" where they mocked the sentimentality of the love letters: but part of me would love to say ""OK - let's hear what you would have written""!The story ticks all the boxes to keep you engaged. Although never moved to tears, a scene towards the end of the movie certainly generated a lump in the throat.All the leads are great. Shailene Woodley has been a personal favourite actress since her amazing turn in ""The Descendants"". And she certainly doesn't disappoint here.The production design is lush, particularly with the 60's scenes of London and the Riviera (reminiscent for me of the recent remake of ""Rebecca""). This is nicely brought out by the cinematography (by George Steel), with some of the scenes being 'hang on the wall' beautiful to look at.It's wonderful to see the late Ben Cross in the movie, and he gives an excellent and touching performance. Cross died of cancer in August 2020 at the age of just 72. This is probably not his last movie, since he was in another - ""The Devil's Light"" - currently in post-production. Such a sad loss to the industry.Negatives:
The movie tries to construct a love story in the 60's and one in the present day 2020's, contrasting the different rules and values at play. The 60's one works; the 20's one really didn't for me. Ellie comes across as a very unlikeable person. The contrast between the lack of communications in the 60's (waiting at a station, not sure if someone will turn up or not) and today's chat/SMS rich 'always on' world could perhaps have been brought out more. With my Dr Bob directorial hat on, I would have ditched the present-day love story entirely and focused in on two professional detectives uncovering the past together: not everything needs to involve love and sex.The film has a couple of rain sequences that are highly unconvincing. One Riviera in-car scene particularly made me chuckle. ""TURN FIRE HOSE ON!"" You can almost see the blue sky and people cavorting on the beach behind them!Summary Thoughts on ""The Last Letter from Your Lover"": There are actually few films around these days that feature love stories outside the teenage years. This is an 'old-fashioned' film that will appeal to an older age group, looking for style, romance and escapism. It reminded me in turns of movies like ""The Two Faces of January"" and ""The Age of Adeline"" in its mood and presentation. I'm probably not the target audience for this movie and I really enjoyed it. But the illustrious Mrs Movie Man probably is. And she declared that she absolutely loved it!Ignore the sniffy newspaper and ex-newspaper critics. I'd declare this to be a ""recommended"".(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web, Facebook or Tiktok. Thanks.)",The Last Letter from Your Lover
12,jeroduptown,About that letter...,5,4 November 2021,"The Last Letter tries to convincingly connect an unrealized love relationship from the 60s and a young couple today.

13,jwscott-home,Loved it!,8,2 August 2021,"Woolley showed great versatility and her best acting yet... Maybe a nomination or two, Actors guild or a globe. I'm not big on romance drama but this was very good, the different periods and the before and after within the periods, it kept me interested. Very well done. I have to mention Jones, good as usual and Turner was good also. Probably see more of him.Watch it whether you like romance or not and a great date flick..",The Last Letter from Your Lover
14,danybur,A good combination of melodrama and romantic comedy.,6,27 September 2021,"SummaryThe film is a kind of epistolary novel that effectively combines and articulates romantic melodrama and comedy to tell us two stories that take place in two different eras and to get in tune with them.Review:While undertaking a journalistic investigation, Ellie (Felicity Jones) finds a romantic letter from an enigmatic man in the 1960s to Jennifer, a married woman. With the help of Rory, the archivist of the newspaper where she works (Nabhaan Rizwan), she tries to find more letters to reconstruct the story of those two lovers.The film basically develops two timelines. In the 60s (which is not linear), we see Jennifer married to Laurence (Joe Alwyn), an English millionaire businessman. While they are both on vacation on the Côte d'Azur, she meets her lover, Anthony, a journalist (Callum Turner). The other line, in principle secondary, is the one corresponding to Ellie and Rory.Deliberately, director Augustine Frizzell uses two different registers for both narrative lines. For Jennifer, the romantic and glamorous melodrama, supported by a beautiful reconstruction of the period. I say glamorous because Jennifer's is a wealthy marriage and her wardrobe, the Côte d'Azur locations and the luxurious English house where she lives give her that character. This tone may seem somewhat anachronistic to some, but there is no doubt that this chronicle of lovers, with their dilemmas and disagreements, refers to a lot of cinema from that time (and earlier) and that is why the film adopts it, although without overflowing.The current history record is obviously more modern, with Ellie as a professional, independent woman and little affect on commitments, in a subplot that shows that disagreement sometimes transcends technologies. However, we will understand that her interest in the letters written by Anthony is not accidental. On the other hand, the articulation of both lines and styles through the letters that appear introduces the story to the field of the epistolary novel.It is interesting to note which of the two narrative registers will finally prevail when both stories somehow converge, in a film that will not generate passions but that is well constructed.",The Last Letter from Your Lover
15,toncincin,Good love stories,9,2 August 2021,"It jumped around a little - so hard to follow at first - but once I understood the ""rhythm"" - it was enjoyable. Great acting. Good story development.

16,atractiveeyes,Beautiful,9,24 July 2021,"It's so beautiful and classical. The story at first feels messy but then it unfolds gradually and beautifully. It has the vibes of old classics with its passionately romantic story, beautifully styles , costumes and locations. The Last Letter From Your Lover is poetic, sensational, extremely romantic and well made. It's one of the best romances Ive seen in years.",The Last Letter from Your Lover
17,isaacochoterena,A love story not so different,5,2 October 2021,"Although it handles absolutely all the cliches about romantic movies, this movie manages to convince me with the stories it relates to.Being so predictable and cliche, this movie exposes a message about forgetting the past, we must not let it overtake us if we want to be happy. Although I feel that there is a lack of further development of the story that takes place in the current years, it seems like a smart way to put them together and compare them. The performance of Felicity Jones captivated me as did the loving couple in the story set in the past. I also feel that there is a lack of character development because they seem a little cliche.Despite the flaws in the script development, I enjoyed this film, especially the ending, the compelling love stories, and the message it conveys to the audience.",The Last Letter from Your Lover
18,karinahatem,Definitely not the greatest romantic movie,5,24 July 2021,"Was kinda slow and boring, and each of the characters seemed distant from each other. And, adding young good looking actors won't make the movie any good.",The Last Letter from Your Lover
19,ScoobySnacks66,Young stars in Hollywood need better accent coaches,5,23 July 2021,"The movie is a by the numbers, formulaic romance that seems to be operating under the assumption that the audience will be satisfied by well worn conventions.

Felicity Jones mostly saves the film.",The Last Letter from Your Lover
20,witra_as,Off-balance but still a decent intertwined romantic drama,7,4 August 2021,"Decent intertwined romance drama from different eras.

21,andrewrye-06535,Left this review hoping I'd Feel Different.....I Didn't,5,29 July 2021,"A promising story done before and done better.We didn't spend enough time with either era to actually be sold on the romance.Briefly, journalist finds a letter in an old book and starts to investigate a romance set in the 1960s to see what happened. That's 1960s monied people who drive around Italy in open top mercs with servants. You know the rose coloured glasses version. Lots of money, little depth. Bored housewife meets journalist.In the meantime, the journalist who finds the letter trawls through the archives searching for more letters. Not sure how they knew the letters would be hidden in books in the archives but there you go. And, fortunately, they find the letters in sequence and just in time to propel the story along.Hmmm not convinced. Nether romance was sold to me. Modern day archivist was thoroughly enamored with the rude journalist from the get go. No idea why, probably because he owned a cat? There was nothing likable about her but that didn't stop him.On the otherside (1960s) a bored housewife has an affair that doesn't go anywhere. Tries to runaway from hubby, only to (wait for it) have a car accident and miss the train. Hubby finds out, tells wifey her BF was killed in the accident and wife swallows it hook line and stinker.Said modern journalist (with witless archivist) then set about reuniting the aging adulterers who are conveniently single (aging Lothario never married) and hey presto, back together and all is right with the world.Nothing to see here, seriously. The 1960s scenes were beautifully shot but neither romance was convincing. I kept waiting for High Grant to show up. Then I waited for the older woman to reveal that her daughter was really his and that the modern day journalist was her long lost daughter, that would have been the icing on the cake, or torpedo that sunk the ship.It's a 5 because it was inoffensive, beautifully shot although forgettable and unoriginal.",The Last Letter from Your Lover
22,BijeshNagesh,Indescribable Elegance,8,28 July 2021,"Nearly every frame of this movie evoked the emotional layering and patient filmmaking of classic cinema. That its settings contained locations from earlier eras further shored up the immersive cross-generational romantic threads that comprised this exquisitely 'embroidered' story.Shailene Woodley played Jennifer Stirling, and she was remarkably compelling in her role. She made me feel deeply for her situation and had me recalling similar moments (though much less glamorous) from my own past.Playing her (legally married) husband Lawrence was Joe Alwyn, who gave a winning performance in his own right.When Ellie Haworth, played by Felicity Jones, came on the scene, ""The Last Letter From Your Lover"" slowly started to take off to some of the most memorable heights. Her characterization was an interesting non-gender-stereotyped take on women at work and in relationships - it was truly enjoyable to watch.Ellie's date Andrew, played by Jacob Fortune-Lloyd, came and left a tad too soon. However, her (later) boyfriend Rory (played by Nabhaan Rizwan) brought balance with his character and to the overall plot of the movie. The sparks between Ellie and him were palpable - good character-chemistry.And I will never forgive myself if I didn't mention Anthony O'Hare, played by Callum Turner, whose character was the pivotal focus of this must-see romantic movie on Netflix.The lovers' older versions - Diana Kent played Jennifer and Ben Cross, Anthony - were wonderful in the few scenes they were together, wrapping a genuinely beautiful love story, one for the ages. What never happened at Platform No.2 finally found itself being fulfilled after oh-so-many years.The wonderful pacing of Netflix's ""The Last Letter From Your Lover"" demands a respectful doff of the hat to its director, Augustine Frizzell. She has the eye of a hawk and the heart of a romantic. The film felt more real than some full-fledged period romances I'd seen before, and this one had multiple modern-day sequences integrated into it.I am not a passionate fan of romance fiction but I have explored a few titles in the genre. This movie was adapted from Jojo Moyes's book after the same name. Whether or not the book was better than the movie, I'm afraid I cannot confirm because I haven't read it. However, I have often observed that a literary work is superior to its adaptation. That assumption in mind, I'm guessing the book will be better. A gorgeous literary feel did pervade the film, and almost convinced me to go read the novel that inspired it. If you love romantic fiction, I have a feeling you will truly enjoy Moyes's work.Noteworthy 'adapted screenplay' from both Nick Payne and Esta Spalding on ""The Last Letter From Your Lover"" Netflix. All those curious little 'easter eggs' involving soundtracks that played during Jennifer's time carrying over into Ellie's... Not to forget some deliberate costume similarities as well (the black-n-white checked coat)... Similar gloves to what Jennifer wore in the public garden, where Anthony and she ended up having an altercation, and when they finally met again after several years in the same garden, where she and Anthony made up at long last... These 'cos-bridges' were subtle and not indicative of any major plot-significance. Regardless, they were curious, cute, connective. It's the little things.""The Last Letter From Your Lover"" felt a little too 'white' where lead artists were concerned. However, I believe that's probably because the books featured all-white settings and characters. No real complaints here, after all not every single artistic endeavour has to contain a non-white figure. Besides, the movie did have a diverse cast with characters like Nick (played by Ncuti Gatwa), Rory (played by Nabhaan Rizwan), Janet (played by Ann Ogbomo), and others.But I did take umbrage from the observation that even this romantic flick was sticking to the clichéd trope of having 'pretty' actresses and actors playing the lead roles. I believe that real life romance has plenty of average-looking individuals who share extraordinary passion and love for one another. Few movies truly capture this element - I guess such IPs will be too real, and therefore not as profitable.Music was a core make-or-break element in this film, and I adored what Daniel Hart brought to the score. He captured the core emotional essence of this movie, especially that of its characters.Soundtracks were outstanding. I especially enjoyed the timely use of Haim's ""Cherry Flavoured Stomach Ache"", Nancy Sinatra's ""Summer Wine"", Marianne Faithfull's ""This Little Bird"", and others.The same sentiment goes out to visual effects and special effects. Art as well as set decoration were excellent - nods to Alice Sutton and Clare Andrade, respectively. Production design did not skimp on details. Their work introduced the most immersive element in the film without which I don't think I'd have found the story or its characters' motivations credible enough to relate to.George Steel's cinematography did this movie immense justice. Anna Robbins brought her A-game to costume design. Every minor detail was covered, with emphasis on the outfits and styles that women sported in the 60s. It truly stopped seeming like 'costume' after a while and just felt like 'clothes', if you know what I mean. Makeup did an outstanding number on this film as well.This movie will make you shed more than a few tears. It is absolutely worth watching, particularly with someone special. As long as you don't already have 'someone special' who isn't the one you are with J. Complicated, love is... This film managed to capture a good portion of that meaning.It will make you fall in love with the enduring value of old-fashioned romance. It will make you realize that one true love can inspire another, no matter the generational gap. It is still making me want to go and read the book.",The Last Letter from Your Lover
23,mycannonball,Dualing Stories Take Away from Full Story Development of Either One,6,9 November 2021,"Two storylines (past + present) CAN work in films but it's a delicate balance. Honestly, the present day romance should have dropped and the 1960s story should have been the focus. As it were, the present day story tried to be a rom-com which wasn't very funny and the 1960s got shortchanged with too many montage sequences to tell the story instead of actual scenes. Montages don't build feelings for the characters! Cinematography and costumes and lighting in the 1960s story was gorgeous.

Both actors had the chemistry required to film this movie, it isn't as up and down like the Notebook it's calm and shows two people who genuinely fall in love yet are torn because she's married and it's the 60's.I love how women were ladies back in that era and men were gentleman they dressed well (Shailenes wardrobe is stunning). Men courted women and the letters just cracked me.. the ending I had gone through half a box of tissues.It was nice to see a happy ending as it's not often these days.I didn't see much chemistry with the other leads but that's ok as we are too caught up with J & Boot to care.Don't listen to the negative reviews and enjoy this film.

Sadly, the actual depiction of the relationship was deeply unsatisfying; the characters were terribly dull and the way that it ended was telegraphed right from the start. On the plus side, Felicity Jones was delightful as always and the chemistry between her and Nabhaan Rizwan rescued the movie. Bizarrely, apart from one short scene set at Christmas, it always seemed to be autumn in London, irrespective of the century, with large orange leaves strewn artfully along the steps and gutters. And they made a point of dressing both female leads in a hideous black and white hounds tooth pattern for no discernible reason, except possibly to see who noticed.

29,pronitmallick,A nice appetizer,6,24 July 2021,"The Last Letter from Your Lover is a movie that starts it's presentation by throwing a concept at you that takes time to digest in your mind. Right in the very few minutes of the movie it takes time for the audience to completely blend in with the environment, but once it's done you find a river of elements flowing at soothing speed. The two main focus of the movie Shailene Woodley and Felicity Jones gave quite an unique performance that perfectly gets mixed with everything else. The screenplay could have shined more with a little bit more polish. The story itself brings many questions to us about what's gonna happen next or how it's gonna end etc. Though because of some predecessors it gets quite predictable to the audience but thanks to the direction and presentation, even with all that we stay intrigued about how the final act will drop before the curtains get closed. Overall it's a movie you can definitely suggest someone to enjoy on their weekend. In terms of watching it stands as a movie that you wanna watch for once only and keep the memory of it instead of going back to it for many more times.",The Last Letter from Your Lover

The script keeps it there and the past era setting just isn't believable. More like people were just wearing groovy clothes found in a vintage shop. Music did little to create mood. Zero chemistry between either couple and, to be honest, both female lead characters weren't very likable.I gave it three stars only because it's not the worse movie I've ever seen and managed to get to the end without shutting it off.",The Last Letter from Your Lover

For some reason she has never click with me. But in this movie i must admit, she is AWESOME. Could not be better.Ues, Felicity and Woodley made wonders in this film, adding more to their already brilliant careers.

I don't read novels much, but someone did say that a lot was left out from the book that would have made it more interesting and I feel that as I watch it, there's supposed to be more, a little something devoid.It's infidelity at its core but Netflix managed to bring out the romance out of it. It does have a happy ending, two long lost lovers who finally meet in their old age; but it made me doleful, imagining the life they could have had if they had just followed their heart when they were younger, still, you can sympathize looking from the situation they were both under.",The Last Letter from Your Lover

48,AndyCordReviews,Shailene Woodley delivers emotion range in an overly done love story,5,23 July 2021,"I wasn't that excited to watch this since I'm not a fan of these types of big dramatic romantic movies, but since part of it was set in the 60's I decided to give it a watch.It wasn't as awful as I initially thought and even though its pacing is a bit slow, the cast still manages to make it enjoyable, especially since Shailene Woodley delivers the emotional range needed for the entire film, managing to bring the character to life. The costume design for Woodley is quite beautiful and the movie has some beautiful shots, in the first act mostly.Felicity Jones and Nabhaan Rizwan have decent chemistry, but the story for their relationship doesn't quite deliver since we don't spend much time with them.Overall, if you have almost 2 hours to spare and you're into big romantic movies you'll probably enjoy this, the plot is predictable and I would have liked to know the characters a bit more, but it wasn't a bad watch, if you're a fan of Woodley, Jones or even Callum Turner, you'll find something to enjoy.",The Last Letter from Your Lover

52,RomanceNovelist,"Lovely, lush, and romantic...",9,21 September 2021,"In an industry where nearly everything on TV and in movies is murder-y or extremely crass, this movie was a breath of fresh air. I wasn't sure I would like it when the journalist-heroine comes off as a boorish , disinterested, air-headed man-eater in the first 20 minutes of the movie, who can't be bothered to remember a man's name after a steamy night. To me, this was childish, rather than liberating. But I appreciated the turn in the story that comes later and the character's eventual growth. She finds herself learning to care instead of continuing on the path of the clumsy inept ditz afraid to love or truly connect with another human being, which for me is a big cliché in today's heroines in both movies and books. Another character issue was the husband...Mr. Stirling was too one-dimensional and a bit of a cartoon villain. The actor plays him well, but the character had very little depth. I wanted more time with the character as that would have raised the stakes immensely but little time was spent developing him, other than to say, he was not a nice man. That aside, as a period piece the setting is perfection and I cared about the lovers and wanted them to be together. Even the modern romance...Ellie's love interest was perfect. I was rooting for them and wanted more of their story. Rory came across as shy and hesitant, but I loved that he could be very passionate, subverting my perceptions and expectations of the male love interest in romantic movies. Again, subverting norms...Rory was the ""shy librarian"" and Ellie was the cad. Men in romance movies tend are often bold and show less humility than a character like Rory. I love that Rory is humble and respectful but no less passionate when the moment arrives. Conversely, Mr. O'Hare is everything you'd expect from the standard heartthrob. Passionate and swoon-worthy. He was written with depth and imperfections making him a great character for a romance. Woodley as Jennifer Stirling is perfection as a lovely but tormented woman torn between duty and true love. I was very invested in all of the characters and felt my heart swell with satisfaction at the end.",The Last Letter from Your Lover
53,rmgaspar-49er,"So, who will like this? Who will not?",7,24 July 2021,"Romantics certainly will. Especially women because it is a rare (and welcome) case of female characters leading the story. It is not really that original, I thought of The Notebook, An Affair to Remember and a few others. But romance is a genre not based in new, revolutionary, original ideas. So, it will please this audience.Guys will have more of a tough time, for the genre, the way the characters act, and will often say ""Oh, not another one jist like 300 others"". It's a way of seeing it.Older people will love it, this is not about young people and immature circumstances/decisions. This is also rare these days. The poster makes you think it is a ""younger movie"" - marketing.I think it would be better if Woodley and Jones switched places. It is tough to see Felicity Jones as a real casual ""airhead"" person. I have the feeling they tried to avoid the obvious casting, and most times the obvious is better.Great opportunity to see Ben Cross (Chariots of Fire) in a small role.

Main actor not the best.

56,eandrusk,Calling All Happy Endings - Not Bad for Netflix,6,6 August 2021,"Secret love letters from 1965? The aristocracy of NYC and across the pond? Old books and archives at a newspaper? Oh yeah, we're making a cliché romance drama, but in a surprising twist for Netflix, it ends well. Perhaps because it's based on a book, but if you like Soaps, need a good cry, or just like cliché romance stories, this is for you.I love Shailene Woolley, but this wasn't her best acting. Specifically, I sort of hated how she was speaking, while reading her love letters in the background...it just felt very forced. Perhaps that's how the letters in the book were written, but they could have changed those a bit to make it sound less stuffy. I mean who writes like that? I can tell you that my grandparents certainly didn't.These aren't great letters, they aren't really dynamic characters, but the actors weren't terrible, so that was a saving grace. I liked Felicity Jones for the role of kitschy journalist/investigator. Somewhat flat on character development, but for what it was, it's a watch for a rainy day. I watched it to revel in the 1960's crème de la crème, so if that's your thing, you too might relish the background scenery - boats, cars, European vacation homes circa 1960. They must have had a nice budget to do this film :-)",The Last Letter from Your Lover

I honestly kept thinking while I watched the film that it must have been directed by a male, even though realizing that is a sexist thought, but that was not the case after I researched the film more. I am hoping someone can articulate better that I can regarding what was missing. I must add, Boot, Callum Turner, was truly awesome and have now added to my favorites.

63,cehutton,There is nothing romantic about this film,2,31 July 2021,"This movie was such a disappointment as I love romantic movies instead this was a movie that tried to romanticize having an affair. The world doesn't need any help with justifying an affair. The main character is in a loveless marriage of convenience which clearly was a mistake she should have made the decision to leave or suck it up. I did not feel sorry for her being neglected and rich. If her marriage was loveless and she didn't want to leave then why not devote yourself to volunteering for charities where you could find your passion instead of hurting others with your wandering eye. There was nothing to justify her cheating on her husband. The man she was cheating with had a history of cheating on his wife and child so he was nothing to feel sorry about either. Then there was the amount of gratuitous smoking in the film. I realize smoking was more common back then but it was annoying to see it so often and all I could think of was how much the characters clothes must have stunk or how yellow their fingers are, or how much their breath reeked. Again, nothing romantic about that either. I gave this film a 2 (1 star for the clothing and 1 star for the acting).

64,smasonnc,"Enjoyable, but missed opportunities",6,29 July 2021,"This was fun to watch for the period vibe, but Shailene Woodley was miscast. Although she is a wonderful actress, she is neither glamorous nor vulnerable enough to make it work. Her strong suit is emotional range, but she is more of a strong 21st century type than a lonely, forlorn socialite. I never forgot that she was in costume and she didn't have much chemistry with ""Boot."" Instead of sparks, it was more like they were flinging wet matches.Speaking of costumes, Woodley's wardrobe was often ill fitting or anachronistic (Did fashionable people still wear pillbox hats in 1969?) and once even made her look dumpy when she was supposed to be radiant. She would look good in a grocery bag so how did they even do that? Better 60s music would have taken us there and touched emotional chords. I thought the two elder leads had more chemistry and it was great to see Ben Cross. Sorry to see him go.Amnesia...really? Is this the Young and Restless?

This film was LOVELY, and it really did irk me emotionally (and i'm not one to cry over films; unless it's an animal but ya know). The characters are interesting and immersive, the acting is authentic, the plot is written BEAUTIFULLY. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who loves a heartfelt, romance affair!!!!",The Last Letter from Your Lover

🍒
2 star 1 star for cast trying their best and other is for cast again to make the characters a little bit barrable to watch.🍍
First and foremost think ""CHEATING"" is not cool at all.🥕
The story was so boring that 30 minutes felt like hours.🍇
By the time, I reached half I was like maybe it can be a one-time watch but as soon as I reached the ending God knows how I was like NO! NO!!!! It is just a waste of time.🥔
I don't get why they promote nowadays so much. If you are not happy just leave but please don't cheat.🍐
When they were on the boat he mentioned that he was unfaithful in his first marriage that the sign that you should have left because once a cheater always a cheater. And if you are unhappy with your relationship then end it don't cheat on your partner. Also separating children from mother or father for the shake of your cheating No big No Nooooo... And when you cheat on your partner and a kid is involved in your relationship you are not just demolishing their peace of mind but faith in loyalty. If you are not happy then end it find your happiness where you know that it exists but cheating on your partner it's more like selfishness it just means that you find happiness when you hurt somebody who is loyal. And one more thing using a child for threading your partner No please No.🍎
This movie is not only boring and awful but also wrong at so many levels.🥑
My suggestion is not to waste your time and the ending was also very much predictable.🍋",The Last Letter from Your Lover

121,katieikewilhelm,VERY little to fall in love with here...,5,23 August 2021,"The Last Letter from Your Lover by Jojo Moyes is an incredibly sentimental love story - not everyone's cup of tea, but if that's what you're looking for, it fits the bill. I had high hopes that this adaptation would capture at least some of that magic, but so much of the original story is left out that the characters and plot line fall completely flat. There's very little to care about in this movie without the backstories and relationships that draw you into the novel - in particular, the parallels between Ellie and Jennifer's romantic lives, as well as Anthony's relationship with his son (who is absent from the movie).Also, and I can't emphasize this enough, Shailene Woodley is HORRIBLY miscast as Jennifer Stirling. I don't mind her in other roles, but she absolutely lacks the elegance and sophistication to pull this off. I agree with other comments regarding the lack of chemistry between the two leads in Jennifer's storyline. The relationship between Ellie and Rory feels rushed - again, likely due to lack of context and the details needed to give a damn about them getting together.Overall, I'm so disappointed in this movie. Not enough attention paid to preserving the right things about the story in order to make it work.",The Last Letter from Your Lover
122,mariadelgadon,Too predictable,4,30 July 2021,"The two characters had zero chemistry since the beginning, but all of the sudden they fall in love? It felt too fake.

I LOVED the book...devoured it in two days...so it was tough to see it essentially butchered by the movie.

125,resh_da,Two romances don't match,3,5 September 2021,"Having read this book and am a big fan of JoJo Moyes, I was looking forward to this adaptation. But there's zero chemistry between the leads (the lost lovers AND the contemporary lovers). There's hardly any backstory (the story itself is butchered), J's husband isn't threatening at all, is cardboard and seems bored by everything. I'm disappointed in Felicity Jones's performance (she's an Academy award winner!) and the Rory character is uninteresting and totally miscast.Very disappointing.",The Last Letter from Your Lover
126,pringypurp,Good but nothing special,5,23 July 2021,I honestly expected more romance and more heartwrench from the movie but the romance comes off as a little bland and there is little chemistry between the main characters although I would credit this mostly to the writing.

128,kaulax,Don't watch this if you read the book.,3,24 July 2021,"They completely butchered the book. They left out way too much. Her husbands mistress, the way they reconnected after 4 years, her husbands company and everything about it, the way she left her husband for Boot. And the ending!! On and Emily's (the reporter) secret lover. Just so much they left out that they could've used in this movie that they didn't. Super upset.

130,carol_ok,Nice and pretty,10,25 July 2021,"Ok, I haven't read the book, however, after watching the movie I will for sure. Point in favor because despite the fact that this history has been seen in other movies, none is the same as the otherShai and Callum: I loved them, Shailene transmitted all the emotions in every moment of the film, the feeling of abandonment, the emotion of a new person, the passion to live something new, the pain of knowing that something is not possible, each scene is excellent, you really feel each of the emotions. With regard to Callum, what can I say? An excellent actor, a gentleman in the whole movie, (it's the first time I've seen him act), a man who makes mistakes but doesn't deny them, his performance (for me) has been beautiful, complete and clean, it conveys that desire to be with someone but knowing that the decision is not entirely in their hands, it was excellent ...Joe Alwyn: the perfect husband, but who considers that his duty is to work, his acting has been great, his toughness, his little interest, his social class, everything has reflected it very well (I loved and hated when he asked the waiter who spoke only in English) perfect for me.What I didn't like very much:The story of Ellie and Rory ... it was a bit annoying because it was forced to happen, it was a strange story that happened very quickly without development without emotion and without attraction ... I don't think it was them but the same script but not I really liked his story, I advanced it in the whole movie.It is a movie to see at any time you consider, it is cute, romantic, calm, without suspense, entertaining, it may have lacked development of some characters but it is understandable by time, I definitely recommend it.",The Last Letter from Your Lover
131,lexiheda,The ending doesn't make sense.,4,28 July 2021,"The first half of the movie was nice! But when Jenny and Boot were going on a goose chase, it kinda lost me there. I lost my interest and found myself bored. The ending was not nice. It doesn't make sense at all. Plus Ellie and Rory doesn't have chemistry. Why didn't they cast the first guy as Rory, tho? Anyway, im frustrated at the ending.",The Last Letter from Your Lover
132,kkgcndxf,Horrible movie,1,29 July 2021,"Just another garbage movie pushing ""strong"" female roles, frivolous relationships, cheating, and other things that are bad. Disgusting.",The Last Letter from Your Lover
133,csszym,All surface level...,4,30 July 2021,I am never one to do it but I must compare it to the book - simply because I LOVED the trailer so much I wanted to read it before watching (and did so in 48h). The movie keeps story at such surface level it is un fathomable why each of pairs of characters would be attracted to each other. Where it should be story of self discovery and exploring limitations of one's world it is a - undeniably pretty - picture of adultery in 60s setting. And losing the twist from the end of the book slash combining Old Librarian and Rory's characters is a loss.,The Last Letter from Your Lover

Callum Turner was a pretty poor casting, always felt like he was reading his lines and nothing about him felt authentic.

In my opinion, the role of a rich man who ignores his wife did not suit him at all. Maybe it's because of how very young he looks. Although the whole story bored me - in the end I cried anyway.
