0,TheLittleSongbird,"A classic of the genre, and still one of the funniest movies ever made",10,1 April 2011,"I do like comedy and spoof movies, and Airplane! is one of the best examples of the genre. The film still holds up well after all these years, with skillful enough camera work, and the direction is smart. The story is simple but well-paced and fun, while the film's cast is a distinguished one. Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty are great leads, and Peter Graves, Robert Stack and Lloyd Bridges look as though they are also having a whale of a time. But I will always remember this film for the late Leslie Nielson, whose comic timing is just genius, and the ""don't call me Shirley"" is one of comedy's most memorable and quotable moments. Where Airplane! succeeds most is in its humour. The script is brilliant and wickedly funny with very accurate spoofs and purposefully cringe-inducing puns that make me laugh anyway, and there are some inspired sight gags as well. All in all, a classic and how to do a spoof. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Airplane!
1,Leofwine_draca,Riotous comedy,6,24 February 2014,"AIRPLANE!, a laugh-a-minute spoof of aeroplane disaster movies, is a comedy that still works today. I'm a big fan of spoofs, slapstick humour and surrealism, and all of these combine in a film which is only now starting to look slightly dated. It's also a film notable for featuring numerous 'straight' actors making their comedy debuts, making their deadpanning all the more effective.The highlight, of course, is Leslie Nielsen, whose latter-day career in comedy was launched thanks to this, but the others are still effective - particularly Peter Graves and Lloyd Bridges as the harassed air traffic controllers. Meanwhile, on board the plane, all of the disaster staples and gags are rolled out to amusing effect. The gag rate is extremely high, and while not all of them are successful, at least there's never a dull moment.I have to admit that I do prefer the later spoofs by this time - such as the scattershot NAKED GUN movies - but AIRPLANE! is the one that helped to start the trend, and it's a lot of fun to sit through.",Airplane!
2,SnoopyStyle,The iconic disaster movie satire,9,8 March 2014,"Elaine (Julie Hagerty) is a flight attendant. She breaks up with Ted Striker (Robert Hays) who can't get over the war. He can't take it and follows onto her flight. When the flight crew gets food poisoning, surely Ted could save the day.Abrahams and Zucker have created the iconic satire of a disaster movie. It's a great take on a genre so popular at that time. It's a constant stream of jokes. There isn't any time in between to allow the jokes to hit. That's the point. Just when a joke hits you, the next joke is already on the way. There is no time to take a breath. This constant stream of jokes provide the blueprints for this genre for years to come. I'm not going to list the countless jokes here. There are too many hilarious moments. Just watch the movie.",Airplane!
3,Hitchcoc,It's starting to fade into the sunset!,7,22 March 2006,"Don't get me wrong. I thought this was hilarious the first time I saw it. It is full of wonderful sight gags. It has Kareem chewing out the little boy. It has the folk singer almost killing the little girl and Beaver's mother saying, ""Excuse me, I speak jive. These are really funny. What has happened to it happens to many topical comedies. A large portion of the movie has began to fade because of its topicality. What do todays audiences know about the pervasiveness of the Hare Krishna people? They fill up a significant part of the screen. Still, there's enough here to make up for this. The business in the cockpit. Pilots being carried out in full view of the passengers. Men with machine wrenches waiting to hit a hysterical woman. Of course, there's ""And don't call me Shirley!"" See it, but realize that many of the jokes are stuck in the past through no fault of the film.",Airplane!
4,Prismark10,Comedy heights,10,24 August 2013,"Disaster films were the rage in the 1970s and as the decade wore on the films got even more star studded and the stakes got higher, the script flabbier and our square jawed heroes getting even more po faced with each impending disaster.Surely this could not continue and after Airplane it did not, as it burst the disaster film bubble and stop calling me Shirley!Airplane with its deadpan humour, jokes with double meanings and risqué gags both visual and spoken broke the mould.Even more than 30 years later it entices a new generation even though some of the topical references (Gerald Ford, Ethel Merman) might be meaningless to some new viewers.The real beauty of Airplane was getting solid actors to play their part straight. Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack and Leslie Nielsen shine in their roles, totally ignoring the mayhem around them.For Neilsen a man known for playing solid drama roles, it gave him a lucrative extension in his career as a slapstick comedy actor.Airplane is just plane crazy.",Airplane!
5,mark.waltz,"So much to laugh about, so many times you can see it without getting bored.",10,25 August 2014,"As echoes of ""The white zone is for the loading and unloading of passengers only"" echo in your head (especially when you hear this outside any airport when you arrive or leave), laughter automatically explodes. The script of this visual and verbal comedy is so overloaded with gags that you would think that a special Oscar would have been created to honor the geniuses who wrote this, the poster child for all spoofs of all genres, and this includes those by Mel Brooks, John Waters, Tim Burton, Neil Simon, Woody Allen, Carl Reiner and Norman Lear.A cast of very serious actors crack you up just by being serious and not cracking a smile as they say their lines. There's handsome Robert Hays as a very nervous fighting pilot, back from the war, dapper Peter Graves as the airplane's pilot who befriends a young visitor to the cockpit in a rather sick way that still creates howls, deep-voiced Leslie Nielsen as a monotoned doctor who doesn't want anybody calling him Shirley, Julie Haggerty as Hays' pretty but dimwitted stewardess girlfriend, Lloyd Bridges as a substance abuser air traffic controller, Robert Stack as Hays' former commander who has a surprise under his sunglasses, Lorna Patterson as Haggerty's co-worker who has a secret, and of course, Stephen Stucker as Bridges' very flamboyant secretary. There's a passenger who lay eggs through their mouths after eating tainted fish, a frantic passenger who is violently forced to calm down, a sweet old lady who speaks jive, an ailing little girl serenaded with hysterical results by the well-meaning Patterson, and of course, all sorts of religious fanatics at the airport who get a taste of their own medicine from the disgusted Hays.Then, there are some surprise cameos, famous today, but unexpected in 1980. Ethel Merman's outrageous appearance must have delighted her upon learning what her part would be, and she tears it up as if she was still on Broadway belting an 11 O'Clock number. Fans of ""Leave It to Beaver"" will be thrilled to see Barbara Billingsley getting down and dirty as she goes totally urban, and T.V. favorite Ann Nelson (another cute little old lady) gets to show her feisty side as she deals with Hays' sob story.Jokes range from corny to disgusting, but none of them are offensive. The ""character"" of ""Otto"" is a bit too much, however, and the gag is a bit overdone. But one small flaw out of thousands of little gems is nothing to gripe about. Bits and pieces of classic airplane movies dating back to ""The High and the Mighty"" (but mainly 1957's obscure ""Zero Hour!"") make this a must for fans of Hollywood history, and honestly, is really a must for anybody who likes a good laugh and a love of silliness.",Airplane!
6,Sleepin_Dragon,"One of the daftest movies ever, I love it.",9,9 November 2015,"A flight ends up in real trouble when a case of food poisoning takes down the Pilot, co Pilot and lots of the passengers.Airplane is one of those films that no matter what kind of mood you're in it will make you smile, it's adorably funny. 80's humour had a sense of innocence, so different to what is classed as funny now. Dull to the point of absurdity, it is the original king of spoofs, you can't help but feel it led the way for future films in this genre. It's really nicely acted, Julie Hagerty and Robert Hays are just delightful as our lead characters Elaine and Ted. She is incredibly sweet, just adorable.It boasts way too many funny moments to try and pick out a best bit, but some of the highlights are, the kids with the coffee, the Hospital scene, Ethel Merman haha, the food poisoning sequences, especially the woman doing her makeup! the film is just true family fun.Don't eat the fish!! 9/10",Airplane!
7,classicsoncall,"""By the way, is there anyone on board who knows how to fly a plane?""",7,28 May 2015,"If done well, I find these parody movies a blast, and this is one of the best. From the opening 'Jaws' theme to the crash landing finale, the picture is filled with spoofs, puns and sight gags that come at you in rapid fire fashion from start to finish. My favorite bits were the jive talk sketch by the Beav's mom, Barbara Billingsley, and when the young kid got Kareem to crack over his defensive game. It would have been cool if Jabbar's character name was Lew Alcindor. For a movie of this type, I thought the cast was a high powered lot, with Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, and Robert Stack in the mix, and Leslie Nielsen owed his later career to the types of pictures that started here. By movie standards, maybe not a great picture, but for what it is, the film delivers in the laughs department, so if that's what you're in the mood for, this is one to catch.",Airplane!
8,gavin6942,Comedy Cult Classic,8,3 April 2014,"An airplane crew takes ill. Surely the only person capable of landing the plane is an ex-pilot afraid to fly (Robert Hays). But don't call him Shirley.With a cast that includes Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack and many others, how can you go wrong? You simply cannot. And of course by now everyone knows this is a winner -- if you have not seen it yet (you have had over thirty years, folks) you need to make this a priority.Although I am generally a fan of the Marx Brothers and Mel Brooks, there is plenty of wit in this. For every crude sexual joke, there are just as many clever puns and plays on words. A real range of humor styles that appeals to a broad audience.",Airplane!
9,lee_eisenberg,Remember not to call him Shirley!,10,4 July 2005,"By now, everyone must know about ""Airplane!"". A spoof of the disaster movies of the 1970s replete with every gag imaginable. Whether it's the announcers arguing over the red zones and white zones, the obnoxious solicitors, the jumping artificial heart, the oddly named crew, the automatic pilot, or the various media sources around the world, the goofiness just keeps on coming. The relationship between Ted Striker (Robert Hays) and Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty) basically takes a back seat to the outlandish one-liners (""We have to get this woman to a hospital."" ""A hospital? What is it?"" ""It's a big building with patients, but that's not important now."") If you ask me, humor doesn't have to reflect the real world; a bunch of wacko gags works just fine. And that's just what ""Airplane!"" is. I guess that you could say that Leslie Nielsen (himself a veteran of ""The Poseidon Adventure"", a typical disaster flick) was getting honed for the ""Naked Gun"" movies.",Airplane!
10,jboothmillard,Airplane!,10,15 June 2005,"From the writing/directing team of the Zucker brothers (David and Jerry) and Jim Abrahams, this is probably one of the greatest spoof and stupidity films ever made. Basically Ted Striker (Robert Hays) is pursuing stewardess and ex-lover Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty), following her onto the Trans American Airlines plane just about to take off, even when he has a deep aversion for planes because of the war. During the flight he tries to talk to her again and again, but many crew members and passengers are becoming seriously ill due to the fish dinner, including pilot Captain Oveur (Peter Graves). trying to help the situation is Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen), and it seems Ted is the only person qualified to fly the plane, besides Otto the blow-up auto pilot. So with the help of McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges, Jeff's father) and Rex Kramer (Robert Stack) on the radio, they try to land the plane safely in Chicago. Also starring Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as Roger Murdock, Lorna Patterson as Randy, Stephen Stucker as Johnny and Ethel Merman as Lieutenant Hurwitz. Sending up the Airport series very well, this comedy is very clever with all the stupidity, cringing and sight gags, and it also made a comedy star of Neilsen (my favourite), who followed with The Naked Gun films, a hilarious film. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy. It was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, it was number 79 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (Striker: ""Surely you can't be serious."" Rumack: ""I am serious... and don't call me Shirley.""), it was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 2 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Outstanding!",Airplane!
11,Woodyanders,A total gut-busting riot,10,19 July 2007,"This movie reigns supreme as one of the funniest features ever made. The key to this film's success is its gloriously inane and cheerful anything-goes comic attitude. Some of the jokes are crude (the s**t literally hits the fan at one point), others strange (Robert Stack walking out of his mirror), many are spot-on sidesplitting parodies of such popular pictures as ""Jaws,"" ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""From Here to Eternity,"" ""Zero Hour,"" and the ""Airport"" series, all of them work because they are presented in a perfectly deadpan, yet still wacky tone. Writers/directors Jim Abrams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker load the movie with so many throwaway jokes that you have to watch this flick several times in order to catch them all. Moreover, the game and engaging cast all give spirited performances: Robert Hays as goofy hero Ted Striker, Julie Hagerty as daffy stewardess Elaine, Leslie Nielsen as dour Dr. Rumack, Lloyd Bridges as harried airport manager McCluskey (who picked the wrong day to give up drinking booze, taking amphetamines and sniffing glue), Stack as ramrod Rex Kramer, Peter Graves as the kinky Captain Oveur, Stephen Stucker as the zany Johnny, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as co-pilot Roger Murdock. Plus we've got nifty bits by Ethal Merman, Kenneth Tobey, Jonathan Banks, James Hong, 70's child actress Michelle Stacy (hilarious as the little girl who likes both her men and coffee black), Nicholas Pryor and Russ Meyer starlet Kitten Natividad. Uproarious highlights include a sweet stewardess serenading a sickly girl with a sappy folk ballad, a little old lady sniffing coke, Stack beating up Moonies and Hare Krishnas asking for hand-outs in the airport terminal, Barbara Billingsley speaking jive, and the ""Don't Call Me Shirley"" running verbal gag. Joseph Biroc's polished cinematography and Elmer Bernstein's appropriately melodramatic score further enhance the overall sterling quality of this absolute hoot.",Airplane!
12,ccthemovieman-1,"Lots Of Gags, But A Bit One-Sided",6,21 November 2006,"There's a lot of good and bad in here, at least for me. For most people, especially Liberals, it's nothing but good. There are tons of jokes in here, so many funny ones that it made the movie a big hit and produced a sequel. When I saw it a quarter of a century ago, I, too, laughed my butt off. I particularly laughed at the ""Saturday Night Fever"" dance at the bar. There are so many gags, it takes multiple viewings to catch them all.That's the good news. The bad news is the more-than-obvious Liberal slants in which they trash their favorites: Republicans and ""religious"" people, or ""fanatics,"" as they like to portray them. You don't see Democrats or atheists ever trashed in films like this. There is also way too much sleaze in here for family audiences, which this movie drew. It's another on of these ""nothing is sacred"" irreverent films which critics think or so wonderful and liberating. What they don't tell you is left wing viewpoints ARE sacred and aren't given equal time in the bashing.",Airplane!
13,rmax304823,Very Funny Send Up.,8,10 August 2013,"You'd have to be catatonic not to laugh most of the way through this original and anarchic satire of airplanes-in-jeopardy movies. The springboard (or take-off point, if you like) was a 1957 drama/thriller called ""Zero Hour!"" which, in fact, wasn't too bad. Dana Andrews was the ex fighter pilot in that one. Not only was the central dilemma borrowed but the pilot's name too, Ted Stryker.The other 300 or so reviews have probably covered the plot and given away most of the gags, so I won't bother, except to say that this ranks up there alongside some of the Marx brothers' movies. It may be a bit sillier sometimes than the Marx brothers but the spirit prevails.I get a kick every time I watch the ligneous Robert Stack wearing a big pair of shades confront a subordinate. ""It's time to face FACTS,"" he declaims, and whips off his sunglasses only to reveal another, smaller pair beneath. Stack, who gave fine informal interviews, always reminded me of some kind of redwood tree on the screen. And it's by cashing in on this professional inability to act that he succeeds in the role. If Stack acted the way the others do, knowing it was a joke, it would no longer be a joke. And the writers have given him the best lines -- the climactic advice he gives to ""Ted Stryker"" after the successful landing. ""You know what Christmas was to me? A fall into the mud. Ever been kicked in the head? . . . by an iron boot . . .? No, that's silly. Don't answer that.""",Airplane!
14,Tweekums,Thirty years old and as funny as ever!,10,24 December 2010,"There have been many spoof movies made since Airplane hit the screens back in 1980 but few come close to being as consistently funny as this one. I think this is so funny because it employs such a wide variety of humour; there are puns, sight gags, references to other films and just plain silliness! Ted Striker is an ex-air force pilot for has boarded a flight to Chicago hoping to persuade his girlfriend Elaine, who is a stewardess on the flight, not to leave him. He hasn't flown in years though, not since one fateful day when he led a mission in the war and the rest of his squadron was lost. When the flight crew is taken ill he is the last person to want to take over the controls but as there is nobody else he has no choice.The jokes come thick and fast so if one doesn't quite hit the mark another will be along to make you laugh in no time. The cast does a great job especially Leslie Neilson who plays the doctor on board and Lloyd Bridges who plays the air traffic controller who picked the wrong week to quit his various vices. While some jokes reference other films it isn't necessary to know all of the references to be amused and these references are never explicitly pointed out. Surprisingly given that Airplane is now over thirty years old it doesn't feel particularly dated; if you have not seen it or haven't seen it for a while I recommend watching this if you want a good laugh.",Airplane!
15,ma-cortes,Wacky comedy with innumerable gags,6,13 August 2005,"Jim Abrahams , Jerry Zucker and his brother David Zucker (ZAZ) are American satirists and writers with successful work along and long time collaborators , they made their own comedy troupe , ¨Kentucky Fried theatre¨. Airplane remains commercially their most hit smash with the exception of ¨Jerry Zucker's Ghost¨ . In the film appears the habitual quirky and lunatic roles , thus : Robert Hays obsessed for events happened long time ago , narrated by means of flashbacks and with a memorable cameo of Ethel Merman ; Julie Haggerty as a flight hostess who must pilot the airplane just like Karen Black in ¨Airport 1975¨(Jack Smight) ; the nutty air controller LLoyd Bridges ; Peter Graves and his children's desires .The film was realized by the Kentucky group , the ironic humor is originated in the American surrealist comedy since ¨Hellzapoppin¨ (H.C.Potter) , Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields , and being based on the absurd , the lunatic and wacky comedy and , of course , the parody or spoof movie . The picture is an ¨Airport¨ (George Seaton) spoof , the references are continued , the parody is gross out but is also intelligent and audacious . There's one comic gag each ten seconds . Other references besides Airport (based on Arthur Haley novel) are the followings : ¨Jaws¨ with the musical theme by John Williams ; ¨Fever Satuday night¨ with Robert Hays dancing like John Travolta ; ¨From Here to the eternity¨ with Hays and Haggerty imitating the famous kisses on the beach between Burt Lancaster and Debora Kerr ; ¨Rocky¨ with a poster advertising an aged boxer.

16,paul_haakonsen,A wonderful timeless spoof...,6,23 June 2019,"Airplane!What is it?It's a great big metal object that flies passengers from one part of the world to another. But that's not important right now...""Airplane!"" will always be the original spoof movie for me, because I think it is actually the very first spoof I ever watched, so it pretty much set the standard of spoofs in my view.And it is actually a timeless classic in its own right, because this is the type of comedy that you can watch again and again. Even now in 2019, as I just watched it, it is still a movie that you can laugh about and enjoy.Granted, you need to watch ""Airplane!"" with a particular sense of humor, because the humor used throughout this movie can be something of an acquired taste I think. But for me, it fits like a glove.There is an abundance of jokes and funny moments throughout the movie, both verbal and visual. And there is always something going on that will make you laugh.The movie also boasts a pretty nice casted assembly of acting performers, such as Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Julie Hagerty, Robert Hays, Leslie Nielsen, Frank Ashmore, Jonathan Banks and more.""Airplane!"" is actually the type of movie that should be readily available on all flights throughout the world as a selectable option to view on flights. If you haven't already seen this 1980 spoof, then you definitely should take the time to do so.",Airplane!
17,blanche-2,Silly fun,7,17 August 2010,"""Airplane!"" was an immensely popular film when it was first released in 1980, inspiring a sequel, as well as ""Naked Gun"" and other movies from the team of Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker.The film is a parody of the airplane disaster movies such as ""Airport,"" but it gets its script basically from an over the top film, ""Zero Hour,"" in which the crew and many passengers fall prey to food poisoning, and a wartime pilot has to take over flying the plane.""Airplane!"" is particularly funny if you've seen ""Zero Hour"" and some of the disaster films. It's heavy on slapstick, and while some of the humor is pretty juvenile, there are some hilarious scenes. One of my favorites is Lorna Patterson as a singing flight attendant nearly killing heart transplant candidate Jill Whelan. Patterson has another great moment - when she has to ask passengers what they ordered for dinner. Her reaction - turning away from the passengers and biting on her finger with a look of abject horror - is priceless. I also love the ""Saturday Night Fever"" takeoff when the two leads (Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty) meet.Everyone plays their parts with dead seriousness; in fact, actors not known for their comedy - Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges, Leslie Nielsen (who started a second career with his performance) and Peter Graves, to name a few, were cast for just that reason. Great idea that works very well.Very enjoyable, with lots of funny moments and good performances.",Airplane!
18,Quinoa1984,HILARIOUS!,10,8 March 2000,"The Z-A-Z team's Airplane! is probably one of the most hilarious films ever. Surely it belongs a place in film history (and don't call me surely) as a comedy that brings parody, racial comedy, sexual comedy, and just plain old gags into one big explosion of hilarity.  The plot has all the elements to become a horrible thrill movie, but instead, angles itself into a brilliant comedy that is quote-able, admirable, and quite cool.  ""At times like this it makes me wish I hadn't given up snorting cocaine.""  And I agree.",Airplane!
19,sunwarrior13,Airplane! Is Timeless,10,15 September 2012,"Airplane! is a satirical comedy directed and written by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker. It stars Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty together with Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Lorna Patterson. The film is a parody of the disaster film genre which was popular in the 1970's and it is known for its use of absurd and fast-paced slapstick comedy, including visual and verbal puns and gags.It pulls out all the clichés as alcoholic pilot Ted Striker, who's developed a fear of flying due to wartime trauma, boards a jumbo jet in an attempt to woo back his stewardess girlfriend. Food poisoning decimates the passengers and crew, leaving it up to Striker to land the plane, with the help of a glue-sniffing air traffic controller and Striker's vengeful former captain, who must both talk him down. Along the way, we meet a clutch of stock disaster movie passengers like the guitar-strumming nun, a sick little girl, a frightened old lady, and two African-American travelers whose ""jive"" has to be subtitled.Although the movie is dated,it can still be enjoyable and entertaining especially with its laughs and gags as it pokes fun on disaster films.It is one of the funniest and most inspired of the madcap genre spoofs that I have ever seen in cinema.Also,the presence of Julie Hagerty elevates the film to higher status.It is definitely a timeless film ever made.",Airplane!
20,studioAT,Madness!,7,26 August 2013,This film is regularly voted one of the funniest ever so I was intrigued to see if it could match the hype.I'm afraid that some of the cameo appearances go over my head a bit due to my age but what makes up for it is the sheer volume of jokes that appear in it. From low brow humour to great verbal jokes there can't be more than a minute that goes by without a joke happening. And most of the time they are laugh out loud jokes too. This film contains more decent jokes in it than most do in their whole run.I don't think you could just see this film once though as it needs multiple viewings to appreciate all the quick fire jokes on display but I don't think you would need forcing to see it again anyway.,Airplane!

22,Scarecrow-88,Airplane!,9,30 December 2009,"Like other kids who grew up in the 80's, ""Airplane!"" was a comedy favorite we could watch over and over. Some of the gags & quotable dialogue could cause belly-laughs, while others would escape us which is a beautiful thing because we later came to a more mature age in understanding the rather risqué and provocative humor. The influence of this comedy is incredible and there was an influx of films inspired by it's brand of laughs, both in spoofing popular fare relevant to the audience of that time, while constantly poking fun at the English language and how to wring every ounce of silliness out of it's premise. Mostly the targets are those Airport movies, romances like ""From Here to Eternity"", war films, and every religion and culturally significant topic that Abrahams, and the Zuckers could lambaste and parody. Nothing and no one was off-limits. I think a part of it's success was the casting. The absolute perfect choices for the parts, played wonderfully straight, selling the jokes and sight gags for all their worth. I have to admit, that many of comic bits are more than a little goofy, but, as a child, they worked to tickle my funny bone.So many memorable bits including ""talking jive"", pilot Oveur's(Peter Graves)endless barrage of unusual questions to a kid in the cockpit(Have you ever seen a grown man naked?), co-pilot Roger Murdock's(Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) response to the kid's discovering that he's a famous basketball player(..particularly when the kid raises his ire while talking about how pops questions Kareem's playing, defense and offense during the regular season), Flight commander McCroskey's(Lloyd Bridges)addictions which reawaken as the airplane appears to be in peril(Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines), how there are plenty of volunteers to halt the frightened ravings of a passenger(plenty of folks willing to slap her silly, among others equipped with weapons!), a wonderful jab at movies which utilize the back-screen effect as Rex Kramer(Robert Stack)and an associate are heading for the airport, Kramer's assault of various religious members wishing for a donation, Doc Rumack(Leslie Nielsen)appreciating not to be called Shirley, Ted Striker(Robert Stack)causing various passengers sitting next to him wishing to commit suicide due to his depressing stories in flashback, the parody of Saturday Night Fever with Stack and Julie Hagerty(as Elaine Dickinson, a stewardess and Striker's love interest)getting jiggy to a disco tune by the Bee Gee's in a fishermen's bar as two girl scouts attempt to kill each other, the disastrous results of stewardess Randy's guitar tune for an ill child, the lieutenant who believes he's Ethel Merman, and so on.An endless stream of dialogue that causes you to either roll your eyes or burst into laughter, I always have a grand old time while watching ""Airplane!"" This movie made ""deadpan"" an art-form. Stephen Stucker is a riot as a nutty member of the team attempting to help Striker land the plane with Robert Stack in fine form as the one in charge, whose history with Robert Hayes is explained in the movie. The only other movies of this type that might rival ""Airplane!"" are ""Naked Gun"" or ""The Kentucky Fried Movie."" If you like this and have never seen it(..which I'd find hard to believe, by anywho), definitely check out the ""Hot Shots"" flicks.",Airplane!
23,Hey_Sweden,"""You have clearance, Clarence."" ""Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?""",10,4 May 2017,"The likable Robert Hays is Ted Striker, a war veteran who's been a neurotic mess (with a drinking problem) since a disastrous incident that claimed the lives of several of his comrades. Yet, he's the only possible hope for the passengers & crew of an airliner when the flight crew succumb to food poisoning. He will have to guide the plane through a storm in order to ensure the survival of many on board. His compatriot through his comedic gag laden flight is fed up former girlfriend Elaine Dickinson (the endearing Julie Hagerty), a stewardess.It should come as no surprise that this is widely considered one of the funniest comedies of all time. A fair bit of the humor is rooted in the era in which it was made, which would make it most humorous to those people who experienced the various movies, commercials, and pop culture references at which ""Airplane!"" pokes fun. Yet, it still works quite well almost 40 years later, due to the genius of filmmakers David Zucker, Jerry Zucker, and Jim Abrahams. It's childish at times without being overly crude or raunchy, and it's filled to the brim with extremely memorable dialogue.Essentially a skewering of the ""Airport"" film series of the previous decade, ""Airplane!"" actually takes its principal influence from the 1957 thriller ""Zero Hour!"". Lines from that other film are actually quoted verbatim (which was no problem, since Paramount made both features).It parodies such blockbusters as ""Jaws"", ""From Here to Eternity"", ""The Godfather"", and ""Saturday Night Fever"", and flows very well indeed. The gags come fast and furious, each one of them earning a laugh until its inspired ending.One of its biggest appeals is in seeing several veteran ""straight man"" actors - Leslie Nielsen (the doctor who dislikes being addressed as Shirley), Peter Graves (the pilot with the hilariously inappropriate questions), Robert Stack (the man who must talk Striker through the process of landing the plane), and Lloyd Bridges (the guy who's picked the wrong week to give up all of his vices) - in this sort of setting. Basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the co-pilot whose best moment involves breaking character. The nutty Stephen Stucker steals all of his scenes as Johnny. The lovely Lorna Patterson does fine as Randy the stewardess, and the cast is littered with familiar faces. I'll let you discover the cameos for yourself, but in small parts you can see the likes of Kenneth Tobey, Nicholas Pryor, David Leisure, James Hong, and Jonathan Banks.

24,Doylenf,Just when you thought it was safe to fly again...,7,10 October 2006,"AIRPLANE! is one spoof of Airport-type films that really works, registering a gag a minute as the plot spins along at a merry pace to show what happens aboard an airliner when the pilot and some of the passengers are overcome by food poisoning and the controls have to be taken over by a naive and neurotic pilot afraid of flying due to a traumatic experience in his past (which sounds suspiciously like the plot of Arthur Hailey's ""Zero Hour!"" with Dana Andrews as the pilot).Here ROBERT HAYS is the bumbling pilot who has time enough to daydream about his encounters with sweetheart JULIE HAGERTY (the ""From Here to Eternity"" flashback smooching on the beach among the waves and seaweed is one of the funniest). LESLIE NIELSEN as a doctor, PETER GRAVES as the sick Captain, and ROBERT STACK as the traffic control man are all adept at keeping a straight face through some hilarious one-liners.This one really hits the laugh meter all the way. There seems to be no end of both sight and audio gags lasting through the brisk 88-minute running time. It's even better if you get all the film references because there are lots of ""in"" jokes for movie buffs.Summing up: One of the best of its kind--well worth seeing more than once to catch all the gags.",Airplane!

He doesn't want to let her go and gets aboard an airplane where she's a stew to talk her out of it. While flying, the crew and some of the passengers get very sick from tainted food. There's also a storm brewing and they have to make an emergency landing. Only Ted can fly the plane...but he's too afraid.A VERY funny parody of the ""Airplane"" movie series and the 1950s movie ""Zero Hour"". Also there are countless parodies of other movies thrown in. The lines and situations are downright ridiculous but all are played straight with the actors not reacting to stupid lines or crazy events. Old pros Peter Graves, Leslie Nielsen, Lloyd Bridges and Robert Stack show up and pull off their roles perfectly. This is like a joke book--the jokes keep coming at you and if one doesn't work don't worry--another one will be coming in a few seconds. Also the movie is only 84 minutes--perfect for this type of movie. There are tons of funny moments but my favorite involves the singing stewardess and the sick little girl. This is also Ethel Merman's last movie and started off Nielsen's career as a comedic actor (before this he just did dramas). This only gets a 9 because there are dull spots, some of the jokes are dated and Hagerty and Hays are pretty wooden (but good-looking). Still, this is worth catching.

I have already seen this movie countless times and know most of it by heart already but it can still really make me laugh out loud, every time I see it. You just never grow tired of it! Also when you see this movie for the first time, you'll probably see some of the jokes coming from miles away already but this really doesn't make them any less funny or effective, in any way.There are lots of comedies like this one, that just fire jokes at you, at an almost nonstop rate but it is very rare that at least 90% of those jokes works out as well, as is the case with this movie. A truly great comical achievement, that also can be seen as the father/mother of all spoofs.I'm not sure that all new and young viewers will get this but this movie is actually being a spoof of the disaster movie genre, which was very popular, mostly during the entire '70's period. There were lots of movies as well, in which planes got in trouble, for all crazy sort of reasons. This movie pretty much follows the same sort of story and characters, only by making fun of it this time, as well as all of its clichés. But even when you won't 'get' this, it really doesn't matter all too much, since the story remains simply an absolute hilarious one.The comedy of the movie is actually quite absurd and you might even call it lame and childish. It's often very simplistic and can be seen as a combination of old fashioned slapstick, lots of visual jokes, comical dialog, crazy characters and a silly nonsense story. It's also the first movie to feature Leslie Nielsen in a comedic role. Quite hard to believe that he once was a serious actor, since he grew out to become the king of spoofs. And let me tell you that he is also absolutely hilarious in his role. But that pretty much goes for every actor in this movie, simply because the material they are given to work with is so great and just spot on.The timing, the buildup, the execution, it provides this movie with more than just a couple of laughs and memorable comedy moments.

I'd suggest watching Airport 1975 first, to get the full effect. I haven't seen Zero Hour!, so I can't say how that impacts it. Of course, having a basic knowledge of popular culture is also a help. This has just about every kind of material you can imagine: Slapstick, random jokes, sight gags, verbal humor, gross-out comedy(thankfully not very much at all), sexual, physical and possibly more. The vast majority of these work(they clearly put effort into it), and hilarity is the main ingredient in this. The timing is spot-on, and the performers are well-chosen. This is what launched Nielsen as a funny man, and you can tell why. Stucker is marvelous. The pacing is good. The plot is, as well. The acting fits. The effects are nicely done, and the production values barely leave anything to be desired(in spite of the low budget). There is some racy content in this, in addition to what I've already mentioned as types there is relatively strong language, in a moderate amount. Children shouldn't be allowed near this, although they hopefully won't understand all of it. I imagine there are alternate versions, and among them, there may very well be milder ones. The regular DVD holds a commentary track with the three writer/directors and Jon Davison, and while there are silent areas in it, it's worth listening through, and is nicely informational and entertaining.

Having seen it again today I have a greater appreciation because I saw all three Airport movies that Airplane! is based upon. This lampoon is a classic and it actually is funny.

34,AlsExGal,A courageous effort in its time,9,5 March 2010,"This film could have derailed the careers of everyone involved. For example, people under 40 may not even know that until this movie, Leslie Nielsen was strictly a serious actor in dramas both on TV and in film. Many may watch 1973's""Poseidon Adventure"" for the first time today and keep waiting for Nielson - as the captain of the doomed ship - to get up from the dining room table wearing just his heart-covered underwear below the waist, or for him to make that first clueless remark. He never does. But from this film onward, he was strictly a comic actor and a good one. Quite a sharp turn for age 55.Just think how tight a line you have to walk with such silliness in order to be brilliant versus inane. What could have easily been the first winner of the Razzie Worst Picture award instead was the first major film of its genre and over the last 30 years has inspired some creative as well as mundane imitators. To understand the film's success you have to look at the time in which it was made - late 70's early 80's. The sarcasm of the post-Watergate era in which everything is fair game for ridicule started on TV with Saturday Night Live, and first appeared on the big screen with ""Kentucky Fried Movie"", but this was the first and best big-budget attempt at such material.In addition to being the beginning of an era, it is sadly the end of one - one in which we all didn't take ourselves quite so seriously. There is no way today that you could make a movie where people are ""speaking jive"" as though it were a foreign language or where an Air Israel plane is shown complete with kosher beard. There would be an outcry followed by Congressional hearings. In 1980, there was still a perspective that making fun of certain perceptions and admitting that they are there is a better approach to bringing us all together than just ignoring them and sweeping them under the rug. There's yet another good approach to bringing people together - laughs, of which this film is full.Just a word of caution - if you've never seen any of the serious airplane disaster movies that preceded this one such as the Airport movies of the 1970's or the 1950's film ""High and the Mighty"", this film will ruin them for you. They all become comedies. Thus you might want to see them before you see Airplane - or if you want to laugh some more, see Airplane first.",Airplane!

Although he manages to catch up to her before she boards her flight he is crushed when she tells him that his obsessive fear of flying--brought on by his post-traumatic stress from an incident as a pilot during the war--is simply too much for her to handle. Deciding that he has to combat this fear once and for all he buys a ticket on the same flight to Chicago hoping to convince her that he is making a sincere effort to change. Unfortunately, when all of those in the cockpit come down with a severe case of food poisoning during the flight, it's soon up to Ted to take control of--not just the airplane--but his fear as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is perhaps the funniest comedy ever made with a joke or humorous incident happening every few seconds. Admittedly, some of the humor is on the crude side and the movie itself is somewhat dated, but all in all it still manages to retain its appeal over the years and I have rated it accordingly.",Airplane!

Because it has its own plot for the most part and just doesn't fill the movie up with scenes from other movies...though it does have a couple of scenes like that.  Most of the best spoofs made are like this, making more fun of a genre than just one movie.  Top Secret and The Naked Gun are two others that do this quite well.  This one of course is making fun for the most part, airplane disaster movies.  It does it quite well as it is one joke after another.  You have to play close attention to see some of the jokes in the background, others you have to listen for or realize what is wrong with what they are saying.  The cast is great, as Peter Graves plays the pilot of the plane, Robert Hayes as a veteran pilot, and even Karim-Abdul Jabber as the co-pilot.  Leslie Nielson of Naked Gun fame is in it as well, playing the role with dead seriousness, which makes his character all the more funny.  That is one of the problems with most of his later roles is that he is trying to be goofy and he is at his best when he is serious.

I love how he describes how he meets and falls in love with her on a tropical island. The rest of the cast is stellar featuring Lloyd Bridges, Ethel Merman, Leslie Nielson, Lee Bryant, Barbara Billingsley, Jill Whelan, Lorna Patterson, Ann Nelson, David Leisure, etc. The scenes are unforgettably funny when Hays confides in Nelson's character.

40,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Airplane!,10,20 December 2010,"They sure don't make comedies anymore like they used to. Airplane! is that quintessential must watch for any fan of the Abrahams-Zucker-Zucker brand of comedy, where they have perfected the art of punning and comedic irreverence, where everything and anything goes and you'll have to keep your eyes and ears peeled for the barrage of jokes, slapstick and punchlines that come in from the blind. Even after today this film still cracks me up for the countless of jokes from the get go.The crux of the story (yes there is one!) is the romantic dalliance between a cab driver and one time air force pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) who tries to reconcile with estranged girlfriend, stewardess Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty). Not taking no for an answer, he follows her onboard her flight to Chicago, and in between boring passengers with flashbacks to the good ol romantic days, his lack of confidence in flight gets called upon as all the pilots get put out of action through a bout of food poisoning.And it's a tremendously busy flight with a myriad of caricatures in the passengers that do things that are plain implausible it's funny. Not only that, we also get ground crew trying to guide the plane to touchdown at the airport, and one of the inane characters Johnny, played by Stephen Stucker, responsible for many of the literal comedic and nutcase moments. And of course there are famous names attached to the film such as Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves and even Kareem Abdul-Jabbar the basketballer, all eyes are of course on Leslie Nielsen as the doctor on board Dr. Rumack, who immortalized the line ""and don't call me Shirley"", with his signature deadpan reaction, and who would go on following this film to make the Naked Gun series with the filmmakers here.One thing that strikes you when watching this film in retrospect, despite its comedic intent, is how lax air travel security tend to be back then, especially when cockpit visits are now totally banned. Buying a ticket at the last minute at the counter in similar fashion as what was done in the film also doesn't raise too many alarm bells, compared to what if one is to do the same today. And barging into the control tower, well I guess the rules have changed.That aside, this film may look a little dated, but the brand of comedy the Zucker brothers and Abrahams have given to the cinematic world is priceless and extremely hard to emulate, try as hard as some hacks in today's era would in choking their film with impersonators and spoofing modern pop culture, which gets so tired after a while. Even up until today the puns in Airplane! is rock solid, and will still get me, as always.",Airplane!
41,SimonJack,This one-time funny film is slow and lame years later,4,28 August 2019,"""Airplane"" is an example of a comedy that worked for a time, but that loses its humor with age. It's not a ""dated"" comedy, per se. Those tend to be films in which the plot substance is dated and then not considered funny later when the situations are no longer relative to an audience. Rather, the substance of this film is still ripe for comedy, but the screenplay and script are no longer considered very humorous.Many movie buffs of a few decades will understand this. Reviewers occasionally comment about how they viewed various films quite different later in life. Usually, those are comedies. And, interestingly enough, some of the older comedies are more appreciated in later life. My theory about why this happens is that once a film's release goes beyond 20 years or so, it is in the category of past films that are judged against all the other films in that group.So, ""Airplane"" is no longer seen as a new comedy in decade in the 21st century. Now, to stand the test of time, its humor must match or beat that of other comedies of the past. And that past goes all the way back. Well, when one sees some of the great comedies of the 1930s, '40s, '50, '60s and '70s, the humor of this film pales or just isn't there.Anyway, the cast of this production probably had a rollicking time making this film. But, it certainly isn't on any actor's list of cinematic accomplishments (as, indeed, many of the great comedies of the past would be). Nearly two decades into the 21st century, ""Airplane"" retains some of its crassness that was intended for humor, but the humor is lost. The plot revolving around two characters, Ted and Elaine, seems quite lame and tedious. The shots of humor are occasional lines and antics interspersed. But they all are quite far apart. And when most are no longer very funny, the film drags.That's how it appears to this reviewer in the end of the second decade of the 21st century. The saving factor of most of the great comedies of the past was their masterful screenplays that are loaded with witty lines and very funny running dialogs.Peter Graves and Leslie Nielsen as Captain Oveur and Dr. Rumack are the only consistently humorous characters in this film. Their presence evokes smiles at least, and a few laughs. Without them, this film would be a total dud today.",Airplane!

This movie is buffoonery at its best. And while it doesn't reach BLAZING SADDLES levels of wrongness (the only other movie of its period that can comedically compare), it's not trying to. This is a movie that dabbles in absurdity. And it seems like every gag, no matter how inane, lands perfectly (and then outta nowhere, there's Leslie Nielsen). The jokes don't wear out their welcome, and there are myriad of tiny details you don't pick up on on the first viewing - which is why this movie retains its (re)watchability. Even when they're referencing a '70s commercial you've never seen, the joke still works. And that is why this movie is still gold.9/10",Airplane!
43,ShadeGrenade,"""Do you watch movies about gladiators?""",10,14 November 2007,"'Airplane!' was released in Britain in the summer of 1980 to zero publicity. The poster I saw did not even make clear it was a comedy. I bought a ticket expecting a rip-off of the 'Airport' disaster movies, and was astounded to find an uproarious spoof, the best film Mel Brooks never made.Loosely based on Arthur Hailey's novel 'Flight Into Danger', the film begins with an airplane crew succumbing to food poisoning mid-flight. The lives of the passengers therefore rest on two hopes: a) finding someone who can fly a plane and b) did not have fish for dinner. Enter nervous pilot Ted Striker.Incorporated into this premise are hilarious flashbacks to Striker's doomed romance with stewardess Elaine, these include spoofs of 'From Here To Eternity' and 'Saturday Night Fever'. The jokes come thick and fast, some don't work but most are on target.Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker were not the first to spoof '70's disaster movies; James Frawley's 'The Big Bus' beat them to it by about five years, but both films are excellent on their own terms.Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty are fine as the romantic leads, and words cannot describe the shock of seeing Leslie Nielsen sending himself up rotten as 'Dr.Rumack'. He had appeared in a real disaster picture several years before - 'The Poseidon Adventure'. Likewise those old-timers Lloyd Bridges and Robert Stack throw themselves into the fun, delivering the absurd lines with commendably straight faces. I do not think Peter 'Mission: Impossible' Graves' paedophile Captain Oveur would be considered amusing today! Upstaging the cast though is 'Otto The Auto-Pilot' - an inflatable doll who not only drives the plane but gets fresh with the stewardess.'Airplane!' is widely credited with having destroyed the disaster movie genre, much as 'Blazing Saddles' did with the Western. Actually, it had burnt itself out well before 1980, as anyone who saw 'Beyond The Poseidon Adventure' and 'Airport 79: The Concorde' will testify. All 'Airplane!' did was to hammer home the final nail in the coffin.With absolutely no sense of irony, B.B.C.-1 chose as its big Christmas Day movie offering that year - Charlton Heston in 'Airport 1975'. Coming only a few months after the release of 'Airplane!' it was impossible to view this turkey with a straight face.One person who could not possibly have seen 'Airplane!' was Robert Butler. His 1997 picture 'Turbulence' ( starring Ray Liotta ) was a virtual remake, minus the jokes.Funniest moment - the passengers lining up to slap a hysterical woman, many equipped with items designed to inflict maximum injury!",Airplane!

46,MovieAddict2016,Arguably one of the funniest films ever made,10,6 June 2004,"""Airplane!"" is, was and always shall be the master of spoof movies. It is single-handedly responsible for literally inventing a sub-genre of comedy. It is the ultimate Silly Movie. A satire of the disaster movies of the 1970s, particularly the ""Airport"" series, nothing makes sense and it doesn't need to. There's no real plot. Just laughs - and plenty of 'em.It was helmed by the ZAZ trio (Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker), whose dedication to making the audience laugh is surprisingly adamant. Recent spoofs may have left a bad aftertaste in your mouth, but it seems to be a universal agreement: ""Airplane"" is the funniest film of its genre ever made. (Closely followed by ""The Naked Gun"" - also penned by the ZAZ trio - perhaps.)The plot: Ted Striker (Robert Hays) is a war veteran-turned-cab-driver who decides to chase after his girlfriend, an airline stewardess named Elaine (Julie Hagerty), who has dumped him in order to pursue a new life. Right before her plane takes off, Ted climbs aboard, hitching a ride in order to woo her back into a relationship again.When the aircraft is in midflight, both pilots become very ill after eating their meals. Eventually many passengers begin to show symptoms of a rare disease, apparently transmitted by the food. Onboard, Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen) takes care of the sick passengers as Ted - an ex-fighter pilot from the war - decides to try and land the plane. If he messes up they will all die, and in a particularly funny scene, the pressure becomes so unbearable that he begins to literally sweat gallons in the cockpit.That is essentially all the film is about, but most of its duration is spent cracking jokes. Spoof films are entirely different from other movies because normally we would criticize a film if it considered its plot to be the least important element. Not so here. This is a truly brainless piece of celluloid - a movie that doesn't try to be anything that it isn't. From the opening credits - that cleverly spoof ""JAWS"" - to the closing we realize that this is an altogether unique film going experience.The movie's biggest laughs come through unexpected flashbacks, such as when Ted remembers where he first met Elaine in a crummy bar (""...it was worse than Detroit...""), and begins to disco-dance a la John Travolta from ""Saturday Night Fever"" (complete with Bee Gees soundtrack blaring in the background and the famous Travolta pose). Then, later, we are taken back to when Ted was hospitalized after the war, and finds out that he was responsible for the death of six men. ""Seven, actually,"" he is informed, which adds to the pain of the moment for him. Though this movie is very funny, many jokes misfire. If you're not pop culture savvy and you don't remember Mrs. Cleaver from TV's ""Leave it to Beaver"", the humor is going to go over your head. But unlike many comedies, ""Airplane!"" offers something unique for each person. I know that as a film lover, I picked up on many movie in-jokes that some people might not recognize. And then there were the gags that I first missed but picked up after a second viewing, or when someone explained them to me, or both. And I'm sure there are many yet that I'm not aware of. It seems that every time I watch it, there's something else to laugh at that I missed previously.""Airplane!"" not only was a huge success in 1980 (the year of its release), spinning off a horde of imitators and one sequel - it was also responsible for crowning Leslie Nielsen ""The King of Spoof."" Prior to ""Airplane!"" Nielsen had been a veteran of more serious productions, stemming back to playing cowboys on ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" and other embarrassing attempts at acting. However, Nielsen later claimed that he had always wanted to do a comedy, even when he first started acting seriously with projects such as the classic ""Forbidden Planet"" (one of the best science-fiction films ever made). He later reunited with the ZAZ trio for ""The Naked Gun"" trilogy, appeared in similar spoof films over the years such as ""Wrongfully Accused"" and ""Scary Movie 3,"" and had his iconic comedy shtick ripped off by many screen veterans - most noticeably by George Gaynes in the unbearable ""Police Academy"" (1984).When it comes down to a single evaluation, ""Airplane"" is simply the best spoof film ever made. It's like a MAD Magazine parody come to life. There are the occasional misfires, but unlike many other spoof film imitators, this one contains far more hits. The deadpan acting is genius and everything else fits into place, resulting in what may arguably be one of the absolute funniest films ever conceived and put on the big screen. And if you decide to watch the movie, don't blink - you might miss a gag or two. The ""Police Academies"" will come and go but ""Airplane!"" will never be forgotten.",Airplane!
47,lasttimeisaw,Airplane!,6,13 January 2013,"A hokum airplane farce in the 80s can still pull off some compulsive laughters, which is a n ironical manifesto to testify how rare a comedic feature could emerge unscathed from the ruthless timeline. This trailblazer hysterical slapstick from Zucker brothers (would later bombard us with THE NAKED GUN series and SCARY MOVIE franchise) and Jim Abrahams (the director of HOT SHOTS movies) has its erratic set pieces which can easily entertain its updated younger viewers, but the double edges also smear the continuity as a feature entity.The system of narrative is satirical and tongue-in-the-cheek, the most conspicuous example are the gags of nagging your next-to-you passengers into suicides later would later be plagiarized by Stephen Chow (the comedian) and Jeffrey Lau (the director) in their ultra- illustrious magnum opus A Chinese ODYSSEY (1994, 9/10) and A Chinese ODYSSEY PART TWO: Cinderella (1995, 9/10) among Chinese populations at least. And this is only one tip of the iceberg in expounding how this modern farce has its novel influence on its future generations, and even to the level of the zeitgeist of a wacky farce (although the plane model might be too jerry-built to ignore its low-budget quagmire). But, AIRPLANE! is a far cry as a textbook paragon in the comedy genre, the inconsistent and jumpy logics is out of context, tacky playfulness, performance torpor, all justifies its entertainment function is the only target of the team behind its wheel, it's a lost cause with ample fun and could be a reference book, from which many recent shoddy comedic productions are still shamelessly exploiting its residues. The cast is deadpan serious in their incompetent puppetry, leading man Robert Hays and leading lady Julie Hagerty are both wanting in comedic chemistry and basic savvy of acting, only leaving Leslie Nielsen to unassumingly outshine them throughout. Chiefly, the film would survive better if they could apply their magnificent novelty into someone who is much more competent and committed in delivering one-liners and keep the engine running a bit longer, since we haven't got enough crackling in its concise 88 minutes, right?",Airplane!
48,Red-Barracuda,You have to be clever to do stupid this well,7,27 January 2017,"Airplane was a spoof of the melodramatic 'Airport' series of disaster films. The interesting thing, however, is that you never see those original movies on TV anymore, whereas Airplane still gets regular airplay to this day. The spoof has become the template in this case it seems. This was the first movie of its kind, i.e. One that consisted of a rapid procession of absurd situations, sight gags and silly dialogue played out with deadpan acting. It constantly made fun of the clichés of the disaster genre as well as current pop cultural fashions. I remember when I first saw it on home video back in the early 80's with my dad, it was the only film ever where once we finished watching it we immediately rewound the tape and watched it over again. It is not an exaggeration to say it was the most purely funny movie of its time hands down.Sometimes this is a film that only gets faint praise that implies that it is just a dumb movie that is admittedly funny. But, unless you haven't been paying attention over the course of the last forty years it should be pretty obvious that you need to be pretty clever to do stupid this well. The silliness on display here is pretty inspired stuff to be perfectly honest. I'll have to admit here though that I don't find this nearly as funny as I once did. After all comedy dates faster than most things and the absurd style that is showcased here went on to be used many times by other film-makers, so Airplane is probably nowadays a bit of a victim of its own success in that its style of humour has been overdone over the years. Still, the point is that this was hilarious the first few times I saw it and it is a brilliant bit of comedy overall. There's way too many individual funny moments to mention quite honestly but a small handful that spring to mind are the jive talkers, any dialogue from Leslie Nielsen (who got a whole new career from this film when everyone suddenly realised that this actor synonymous with dramatic acting was quite simply one of the funniest guys around), there's also Peter Graves seriously dodgy pilot who asks a young boy all manner of questionable things such as 'Joey, have you ever seen a grown man naked?' (you would probably never see this kind of close to the bone humour nowadays!), the uproarious disco scene, the very funny performance of Julie Hagerty (second only to Nielsen in the funny stakes here in my opinion), etc etc. So, while it is showing some wear and tear due to age, this still has to go down as a bona fide landmark in comedy cinema.",Airplane!

Some may find the stereotypes offensive, but I didn't find it offensive at all. It wasn't trying to bash on another race or anything so it is fine. I didn't find this movie super hilarious or hysterical or anything but it kept a smile on my face and got me to chuckle a few times. Most of the humor comes from awkwardness from the characters and their unexpectedness. Overall this is a slapstick comedy done right and I can understand why this is claimed as a classic comedy. Even if there really isn't much of a story just very random stuff happening on a plane with flashbacks but watching this movie was like watching a live action wacky cartoon, in a good way. It's a dated comedy but for the most part it still a pretty good slapstick comedy that takes place on a plane.7.8/10",Airplane!

A subplot involves Striker helplessly trying to win his estranged girlfriend, Elaine, back.This comedy spoofs countless of other movies including Jaws, The Poseidon Adventure, Shane, Casablanca and Saturday Night Fever, delivered in this film where slapstick comedy, deadpan delivery, dark humor and witty remarks are all in abundance. Yet, while this movie is not meant to be taken seriously, the cast of characters were calm, collected and sometimes dramatic in their roles, providing you comedy that is not overly-acted or childishly done.In addition to the actors' performances, there are absurd humor popping up all over the place, for example, a smoking/non-smoking ticket with real smoke oozing out; castle thunder inside the airplane; falling watermelons; exploding cigarettes; radar screen with a built-in microwave oven; arguing airport voice-overs, etc.All the actors were awesome in their roles, especially Robert Hays, Julie Hagerty, Peter Graves, Leslie Nielson and Robert Stack.

After all, ""they bought their tickets. They knew what they were getting into!"" That's just one of the funny lines in this funniest of all the spoof movies that followed its lead. It's a dumb movie, held together by the story of Ted Stryker, a former fighter pilot who's long since given up flying, who gets pressed into service to land this huge plane after the entire crew comes down with food poisoning, in a clear spoof of the ""Airport"" series of movies. But the plot (such as it is) really isn't that important. It's the fact that you'll have a smile on your face from beginning to end and in many cases the smile will turn into laughter - sometimes uproarious laughter.This is truly funny stuff. Where would you start or end in talking about what works in this movie? Leslie Nielsen's perfect dead-pan humour; Stryker's ""war"" flashbacks (which ""war"" he was in we have no idea, except that it was ""off the Barbary Coast""); the hilarious bar scene with the dance between Julie Hagerty (Elaine) and Robert Hays (Stryker) as well as the disco-dancing scum who gather there; the confusion in the cockpit between Oveur, Roger and Victor; Elaine's encounter with the ""Otto-pilot"" and Oveur's chat with little Joey. Where would you stop? It goes on and on. If you want to watch a movie that makes sense, look elsewhere.

54,thesar-2,"Where did you get that dress, it's awful, and those shoes and that coat, jeeeeez!",10,3 July 2009,"I could fill this review of 'Airplane!' with the dozens of funny quotes I can do literally by memory and not by looking up on the internet. And I can simply say ""Surely, you can't be serious. I am serious, and don't call me 'Shirley'"" or ""A hospital? What is it?"" to anyone at or around my age (currently 35) and it will certainly invoke a smile. So I don't think I'm alone in saying this also had numerous other effects on other people. In fact, this movie probably had more of an impact on me than practically all others. It still ranks as my number one comedy by a long shot. Nothing has come close to it before or since. Sure, the original 'Naked Gun' or 'Scary Movie' also were down-right hilarious, but nothing captured the million jokes packed into just under 90 minutes. Strangely enough, to date, I have not seen the number one source material 'Airplane!' is spoofing: the 'Airport' movies. That doesn't stop me from laughing out loud at each and every joke. Every actor was pitch-perfect, including Nielsen, who reportedly got some of the most laughs after breaking from his straight-man roles he was previously (and never again) known for. Sure, it wasn't perfect – the set was literally held up by tape and Abdul-Jabbar, as funny as he was, was painfully reading cue-cards so he could (also reportedly) afford a rug he wanted as payment. After a previous fallout, ""drinking-problem"" Ted gets on board his flight attendant flight ex's plane to make up. Of course, the crew and passengers are doomed to bad fish and he's called in to save the day. I can't express much further that this is to comedy as 'Gone With the Wind' is to epic.

56,ElMaruecan82,Is there a pilot in the plane?...,8,12 April 2012,"""Airplane!"" is one of the greatest American comedies and deserves its place in any Top ten lists for that matter. You see, I'm not even discussing that and I already give the film an 8. I know for some hardcore fans, it's a sacrilege and I should fry in hell for not having given a 10. And any rating below 10 is an insult. I know, I know  but I still give it an 8 anyway. Shirley, I can't be serious? Well, I am serious and be serious too, it's not like my humble opinion won't change the face of the Earth, it's not like everyone would be reading this review! Gee, why am I ever wasting my time, my life for a bunch of miserable  whoops, sorry. Anyway, just allow me to make my point.Yes, ""Airpane!"" is one of the greatest American comedies, rightfully put in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Laughs, in the Top 10, along with ""Duck Soup"", ""MASH"" and ""Blazing Saddles"". But let me tell you something you probably know, most of the films' inclusions are based on pure 'classical' criteria rather than ratio of laughs-per-minute, and I believe ""Airplane!"" owes its place to its pioneering value on the spoof movies' sub-genre, but to say that this is the funniest spoof movie ever made is a stretch. For my part, I believe that Jerry and David Zucker, with their acolyte Jim Abrahams, the ZAZ trio, made the funniest comedy ever with ""Top Secret!"" and that ""Airplane!"" doesn't hold a candle to ""The Naked Gun"" or ""This is Spinal Tap"" from Rob Reiner, or a movie hysterically offensive called ""Man Bites Dog"" (a Belgian laugh riot and masterpiece of dark humor).But you know (you probably don't, and probably don't care), I used to love ""Airplane!"" whose title in French is even more hilarious because it means, ""Is There a Pilot in the Plane?"" I used to watch the film so much I could recite it by heart, then after a few years, I saw it again, and many gags fell flat. I tried to figure why I thought the film was 'slower' than the other ZAZ installments. And today, I think I can finally say 'Eureka!', I have diagnosed the problem with ""Airplane!"" and it' s a big one, believe me, the kind that can really undermine the quality and/or the overall appreciation of a film. So, the problem of ""Airplane!"" is (untenable suspense)  no, wait, there's a better way to demonstrate it. Think of all the most memorable gags, puns or slapstick jokes from ""Airplane!"" and tell me what are the ones you immediately visualize? For some, it would be Captain Oveur asking Billy if he likes movies about gladiators, the nonsensical exchange between Victor, Oveur and Roger with the operating tower, scene- stealing performances from Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Leslie Nielsen and Lloyd Bridges who picked the wrong week to quit smoking, drinking and sniffing glue the irritating Johnny, the little girl who takes it black like 'her men' (and the boy's priceless WTF reaction), Leslie Nielsen trying to reassure the passengers or slapping a panic-stricken woman, the jive- talking guys, the nun, the sick little girl, Leslie Nielsen having lasagna, how could I forget Otto, the automatic pilot and the 'Putana Da Seatbeltz' signal. I can go on and on, Oveur and Oveur again (yeah, I can do lousy puns, too) but didn't you notice there are two characters cruelly missing?Yep, Michael Hayes as Ted Stryker, the aviator and war-veteran and Julie Hagerty as Elaine Dickinson the flight attendant  the leads, the actors are good, don't get me wrong, but they're just good. The film features such a colorful and great gallery of supporting characters (even the passengers were funnier) that I couldn't believe it would feature such a dull romantic couple. Seriously, don't you feel like the real star is Leslie Nielsen (R.I.P), and that the directors probably remarked his comical potential? And that Hayes and Hagerty didn't make much a career in comedies after this film (I don't even want to mention the dull sequel) is a credit to my theory that ""Airplane!"" could have been better wit other actors. Am I alone who hated the flashback parts, not unfunny but too long without bringing much to the film, it distracted from the gripping atmosphere inside the plane to feature some 'meh' scenes.God, the dreadful flashbacks! As much as I loved Elmer Bernstein's opening score, I couldn't stand the romantic tune that was overplayed ad nausea. Just because ""Airplane!"" features a hilarious script and gags that sound great on the papers, I don't think it means you should take your casting for granted, some parts begged for a funny gag to work as the pay-off rewarding our patience but no. Stryker is in a bar, we hear a sax playing and it's Elaine who plays (funny?), then a bar fight is started by two big blonde girls (funny?), one of them hits the juke-box and the 'Saturday Night Fever' parody starts, too long a set-up for a too long gag. And the parts in the hospital or Africa were so painful that I wonder if the reactions of Ted's listeners were not a reflection of our thoughts, Ted was a real pain in the ass.Apart from the two leads, every single gag in ""Airplane!"" was funny or hilarious, the rest of the film, they're like the straight men of a joke they don't get but we do. The romantic aspect or the trauma in Ted's heart was overdone more than if it was a romantic comedy. Now, I feel better because I know what's wrong with ""Airplane!"" and I'm comfortable with that, and whenever I would ask someone about his favorite gag, I know it would never feature Hagerty and Hayes together, and we know that the best gags features neither of them.

57,paul2001sw-1,Don't call me Shirley!,6,30 April 2017,"'Airplane!' is, above all else, a very silly comedy, a spoof on 1970s-style disaster movies that was later followed by the brilliant 'Police Squad' and the massively successful 'Naked Gun' movies. Not every joke works, but they come thick and fast, and more often than not, the stupider the better. In some ways, the movie harks back to an age when air travel was less routine than today: on the other, it's notable there's a joke about ""no-frills"" passengers arriving as baggage from as long ago as 1980.

58,MOscarbradley,Don't call me Shirley,9,22 June 2007,"""Airplane!"" is marginally less funny than when I first saw it all those years ago. I've laughed so long and hard at the funniest, (and corniest), jokes in the stratosphere that a few of them have lost their edge. That said, this may be one of the two or three funniest films ever made, no matter how many times you've seen it. Who hasn't uttered that immortal line 'And don't call me Shirley' to a few uncomprehending young souls who have yet to experience the joys of this movie and haven't a clue what you're talking about.To say it's 'based' on that hoary old melodrama ""Zero Hour"" isn't quite accurate, (the 'plot', admittedly, does bear a resemblance). No, this movie has come straight from the joke-book mindset of its creators, Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker, who together take both writing and directing credits. Thirty seconds of this movie don't go by without a gag of some kind, (and the parodies of other 'disaster' movies are the funniest parodies ever). It also made a star out of Leslie Nielsen at the age of 58. Nielsen had been a reasonably handsome leading player of the second rank for years, (probably best known as the space ship captain in ""Forbidden Planet""), whose convulsively funny performance here, ('Don't call me Shirley'), catapulted him into the limelight and the role of Frank Drebin in 'The Naked Gun' movies which emulated the quick-fire scatter-shot gag ratio of ""Airplane!"" to almost equal effect and for people of a certain age and generation it's for this movie that Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves and Robert Stack will be remembered.",Airplane!
59,bowmanblue,Just funny,9,24 April 2015,"There are few films that stand up to the test of time and even fewer that are comedies. I'm glad to say that 'Airplane' is the exception to the rule. It's one of those 'spoof' films which sacrifices story in favour of joke after joke after joke. Nowadays, similar humour is applied to spoof movies which lampoon one or two individual films. Back in 1980 when Airplane was made it was less fashionable to make fun of just one film, instead 'disaster movies' in general are the topic of ridicule. And, luckily, the plot is pretty simple – the titular airplane loses all its pilots (and many of the passengers) to a freak food poisoning accident (just don't eat the fish!) and a former war pilot, with a questionable track record at the helm of flying machines, must step up to save the day.You need to know that 'Airplane' is hardly 'highbrow entertainment.' It never was. It never will be. And, most importantly, it was never intended to be. The film is filled with 'pratt-falls' and dumb and silly jokes. If you've watched any of the 'Naked Gun' films, or those 'Scary/Superhero/Disaster/Delete As Applicable' Movies, then you'll kind of know the drill by now. Only Airplane was basically 'the original' of this type of film, therefore it's definitely the funniest!Part of its appeal is the fact that the film-makers seemed to steer towards casting 'non-comedic' actors is as many of the lead roles as they could, meaning everyone plays their parts 'straight' and totally deadpan. Of course the main characters are great, but it's Leslie Neilson who steals every scene in what was his first comic role on screen (but definitely not his last!).Airplane isn't the kind of movie you need to think about. You just need to be in the mood for something a bit silly (and sometimes irreverent!) to get enjoyment out of this. Even after over thirty-five years, it still outclasses all those other 'spoof' movies. It is truly the original and best.And don't call me 'Shirley!'",Airplane!
60,Cineanalyst,The Thin Air Between Drama and Parody,9,21 July 2021,"Until last night, the Milwaukee Bucks hadn't won an NBA championship for 50 years, when they were led by part-time airline pilot flying under the pseudonym Roger Murdock, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, so I chose to once again revisit one of the funniest movies to my mind, ""Airplane!"" It's more than hilarious, though; there's a brilliant idea underlying it.Comedic tastes change and everyone has different notions of what's humorous, anyways. Like many such past movies, it's also gained some (internet) criticism for some politically-incorrect jokes, which is a shame in some ways. Admittedly, some of those just aren't any good comedically (e.g. The Air Israel plane dressed in a beard, tallit and yarmulke), but others may be rather incisive or, at least, daring. There probably aren't many comedies that begin with an abortion joke and move right on to Hare Krishnas, and forget about doing the jive running gag nowadays.One of the articles on the subject I read, from the website Medium--talk of picking the wrong week to stop sniffing glue--is particularly oblivious: claiming the dialogue written by the African-American actors who performed the jive scenes was from the white directors and writers, misidentifying the underlying humor as not based like the rest of the film in spoofing, which it certainly is, from blaxploitation cinema such as ""Shaft"" (1971), and ignoring that it isn't just translated into English subtitles but into another language stereotype, of supposed white speak (""golly"" should've given it away). There are plenty of actually offensive movies throughout the long history of the art form to get self-righteous about, and, Shirley, I could point one to some of my own reviews in that regard, so maybe leave the high horse in bed with this good-natured comedy, but I digress, and I'm not even going to get into what Captain Oveur says to Joey in the cockpit, but it's uproarious. Nothing is sacred here, and anyone suggesting otherwise ends up at the airport getting beat up by Captain Rex Kramer.Moving on, the underlying brilliance of this spoof is to expose what little difference there is between corny drama and amusing parody. I think critic Mike D'Angelo is right that ""Airplane!"" may be appreciated on different levels, whether or not one is familiar with the basis of the jokes, as they may benefit from a seeming randomness otherwise. Indeed, I'm not too familiar with the disaster flicks it primarily mocks, such as the ""Airport"" series, but those gags aren't necessarily any worse off for that compared to the ones from ""Jaws"" (1975), ""Saturday Night Fever"" (1977), or ""From Here to Eternity"" (1953) that I'm well acquainted with. Indeed, the film that ""Airplane!"" most takes from I've yet to see, ""Zero Hour!"" (1957), from the same writer of ""Airport"" (1970), tellingly. The similarities go so far as specific plotlines and dialogue being lifted verbatim, and the studio bought the prior film to avoid any plagiarism charges. This includes Abdul-Jabbar's casting, too, as ""Zero Hour!"" featured, speaking of one-time Wisconsin star athletes, footballer Elroy Hirsch as one of its pilots.Reportedly, the original plan for ""Airplane!"" was to be another ""The Kentucky Fried Movie"" (1977), which was also made by Jim Abrahams and the Zuckers, but the late-night TV movie spoof was so good that they dropped the idea of adding commercial parodies in between (although, also as D'Angelo points out, the Yuban coffee one still fit into the movie proper). This goes to show that the treatment may be all that stands between lousy dialogue and plotting and comedic gold. This seems to have especially been a revelation for the minor dramatic character actor Leslie Nielsen, whose path to comedic fame began here. It shouldn't be too surprising, though. After all, Mack Sennett figured most of this out way back when he parodied D. W. Griffith's last-minute-rescue one-reelers in ""Barney Oldfield's Race for a Life"" (1913). A main reason why, say, ""Young Frankenstein"" (1974) is so good is because it largely remains Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein,"" or Universal's, at least. It's a thin line, and in this case the movie being spoofed appears to have already been so laughable that sometimes all the comedians had to do was quote it and the actors merely to pretend to take it seriously.",Airplane!
61,g-bodyl,A Spoof Done Correctly!,9,15 February 2015,"Airplane! is a prime example of how to do a spoof correctly.

There is no denying that Airplane is a comedy classic that is timeless and enjoyable no matter how many times you watch it. This film, from the minds of David Zucker and Jim Abraham, is about a pilot who is afraid to fly boarding a plane to find his former lover, Elaine. But after the crew gets sick from food poisoning, it's up to the pilot, Ted to successfully fly the plane. But don't call him Shirley!The film is well-acted and the comedic timing is spot-on. Leslie Nielsen is excellent and delivers a career-defining performance. Robert Hays delivers a good performance as Ted and likewise Julie Hagerty as Elaine. Overall, Airplane! is a comedy classic and I feel ashamed for putting this movie off. This is the perfect example on how to make a funny spoof movie.

In all, it's one funny funny film, leaving me tired from laughing so much.There are guest appearances that blow you away (Ethel Merman takes that cake), some older actors at the end of the character acting careers, and the major turning point for Leslie Nielsen, who became and Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker linchpin in years to come.You can watch the movie once and laugh, and watch a second time and catch all the jokes you missed the first time, the stuff in the background, the word plays, the post-modern absurdity.",Airplane!
64,inkblot11,"Air you will be gasping for, from all of the lung-busting laughs, the ultimate mood lifter",9,1 December 2010,"Ted (Robert Hays) has just been dumped by his stewardess girlfriend, Elaine (Julie Hagerty). Once a military pilot, he now can't get on a plane, among other recurring nightmares. However, his love for Elaine triumphs all and he buys a last minute ticket to her next job in the air. But, horrors! This is one ill-fated flight. The captains (Peter Graves and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), along with many passengers, have fish for dinner, resulting in them becoming gravely ill. There is a doctor on the plane (Leslie Nielsen) but his intelligence level is highly questionable. When the pilots pass out, Elaine flies the plane for awhile, with the help of the chief ground control officer, Steve (Lloyd Bridges) and the ""auto pilot"", an inflated balloon-man with his hands on the controls. Ultimately, however, Elaine and the other passengers are doomed unless they can convince Ted to take over. Will he muster the courage to land the plane safely? So far, this description does not do justice to the non-stop hilarity that this film brings. Made on the heels of the disaster film decade that started with Airport and the Poseidon Adventure, this is a masterful send-up of the genre. The casting of the mostly serious actors, Bridges, Graves, Robert Stack and, especially Nielsen, to play against type is a stroke of genius. Nielsen's career changed 180 degrees from this role, leading him to the classic and much-adored Naked Gun films. But, Bridges and Stack are also extremely funny, as are the others. Just watching the former Sea Hunt superhero chain smoke and take uppers and Stack deck every panhandler in the airport, from the Hari Krishnas to a gentleman who claims to be collecting for ""Jerry's kids"", is fall off the couch funny. Jabbar, too, is fabulous as the co-pilot named Roger who, nevertheless, takes insults from a young kid who knows he is the basketball star. Hays and Hagerty, as the young, naive couple among veterans, do a fine job as well. As for the entire rest of the supporting cast, they are great, also. The film, naturally, looks a bit dated in setting and costumes, but who cares? Above all, the Zuckers and Mr. Abrahams, who wrote and directed the film, deserve the highest words of praise for giving this supreme mood elevator to the movie watching world. Anyone who can sit through this flick without grinning should be taken to the funeral home, immediately.",Airplane!
65,Bored_Dragon,Scary Movie of '80s,7,14 August 2017,"The movie that launched Leslie Nielsen is considered to be one of the best movies of all time, in the UK it is acknowledged as the second best comedy after ""Life of Brian"", and in the USA in 2010. it is chosen for preservation in National Film Registry. This film very faithfully follows screenplay for ""Zero Hour!"" and then upgrades it with parodies of many other, mostly ""disaster"", movies. Personally, my favorite is the opening scene that spoofs ""Jaw"", but almost every scene is a parody of something and that train of spoofs is so fast that there's no chance you could catch them all, even if you are familiar with all movies it parodies. To bring it closer to new millennium generations, this is ""Scary Movie"" of the '80s.7/10",Airplane!
66,ironhorse_iv,"Surely. you can't be serious. Airplane! One of the greatest comedies? Well, I believe so",8,21 March 2013,"""I am serious, and don't call me Shirley."" That line STILL cracks me up! Still the movie is a bit overrated. I like it, don't get me wrong. Anybody who doesn't like it, is probably name Joey who like movies about gladiators. That or they too lazy like Leon to give it a try. I've always wondered why Airplane! or ""Flying High!"" worked so well whereas so many other parodies of the same type were duds. Now I know: it just copied a movie call Zero Hour, the 1957 movie that was semi-actually good. Zero Hour's plot is about airplane that lost control of each of its pilots due to food poisoning leaving no one left to fly the plane. A broken down war pilot is the only one with experience, but he has not flown for 10 years and has no familiarity with aircraft of this size. Can he land this plane or crash killing everybody on board? Airplane! Pretty much follows that plot line. The spoof is the essentially parasitic form of art; it has no power but what it borrows from something else. Airplane works because of Zero Hour because Zero Hour was taken as a serious film. Airplane help launched the trend of gag based comedy in comedy movies. Until then, most comedy movies depended on character based jokes to carry the humor, with a few gags thrown in like Monty Python or Mel Brooks films. But Airplane went so far around the bend with its gag a minute by minute approach that comedies ever since have not been ashamed to rely on nonsensical jokes that broke reality and continuity. The reason why Airplane works while other spoofs fail is because it's not a Shallow Parody. Shallow Parody is when the movie produces a parody that departs too much from the original. Even if there is a lot going on in the screen, at less we know the plot is from Zero Hour. It's one of the funniest movies ever, killed the '70's jumbo jet disaster movie genre dead overnight like films like Airport and Airport 77. Surprising, if the movie were released five years later it would have received a PG-13 rating or R. The reasons for why it's PG is that the MPAA was still in it's early stages. But yes, Airplane! was rated PG and all that humor that was considered okay back in 1980 was not even close to a higher level so questionable for parents today (the poop hitting the fan, drug jokes, violence, the boobs nudity shot). All the character actors are funny. Robert Hays is laughable as Ted Strikers, the pilot that must land the plane. Robert Stack, the respected dramatic actor, playing an over-dramatic Air Force captain. Peter Graves as the original pilot of the plane who has something for kids in his cockpit. Lloyd Bridges as the man who pick the worst day to quit 'blank' who works in the flight towers with his flamboyant air traffic controller Johnny. The one actor that got a new lease on his career in this film was Leslie Nielsen. Today, he is known as the King of Parody due to his countless works on a number of parodies, but at the time, he was a straight respected dramatic actor. This was his first comedic role, and his launched his comedic career. Still, some people might not like it due to the humors being so corny, cheap by today's standard. It's more stupid than funny. Due to the years since the release, the film has become a bit a narrow parody. It occurs when the movie become too old, that producers might be afraid the target audience might be too young or just too snobby to catch the expected references, and have no concept of what they are saying. To me, personally. I believe this movie will forever stand the test of time at people will laugh at the simplities. It truly is a timeless masterpiece. So check it out. Don't take it so serious, and give in to the laughs. You find yourself, sporting a smile by the end of the film.",Airplane!

Spoofs on languages, idioms, movies, brands, ideologies, people, their behavior and mostly an airplane environment. Ridiculous situations are not made-up, instead they come out from the linear story. A romantic story running behind also induces lots of slapstick.Performances are good, but junior artistes seems to be laughing at their own antics. Music is good, editing is bad.

The large cast of familiar faces seems to be having a good time, including those previously known mainly for dramatic roles. Graves and Nielsen are particularly funny, with the latter delivering his famous ""Don't call me Shirley"" line. Some of the jokes that were timely and funny when the movie was made in 1980 don't seem that funny anymore.

69,The-Sarkologist,Probably one of the funniest farcical movies I have seen,8,12 February 2012,"After seeing some pretty poor Leslie Neilson films, such as Spy Hard, one becomes rather hesitant to watch any more of his movies. I used to think that he was funny, but with bad movie after bad movie, I began to find him quite boring. In fact I did not laugh once during Spy Hard.Flying High, or Airport as it is known in America, is not the case. In fact I found that Flying High is quite witty and very funny. There are a few things that seemed too stupid, such as the comments that Johnny makes in the flight tower at the end, but the humour generally is quite consistent, and funny.The thing about Johnny is that he does not really seem to fit in with the flow of the movie. The style of Flying High is that it is farce, namely the actors are dead serious while really bizarre things are going on around them. The actors will say funny things yet be dead serious about it as if it is a natural part of life. This is what makes Hot Shots such an impressive movie because Charlie Sheen is so serious in that movie. Johnny though does not seem to fit into the mould: instead he is a silly character that says silly things and is never really serious about it.Leslie Neilson, who plays the doctor, on the other hand is quite serious. He is not trying to be funny in this movie, and as such he is. The interaction between the pilots in the plane is cool. In fact Flying High has numerous word plays, Captain Oveur, and Roger the co-pilot. Then there is my favourite line printed below. Along with the word plays, which are very clever, there is also slapstick, which never really impresses me, and more blatant sexual humour, which I don't really like.The cast is quite well know as well: Leslie Neilson, Lloyd Bridges, and Robert Stack. The main characters are actually relatively unknown, but these three are some of the old guard, memorable actors from the early eighties. Neilson is still making comedies, which I refuse to see, I don't know where Bridges is, and Stack, the last time I saw him, was hosting America's Most Wanted.Flying High is actually quite a good movie. It is one of those movies which seemed to begin a trend in the style, though there were probably some before hand. Rather Flying High is the more famous one that most people can remember. I like it, and it has some classic lines in it as well.Favourite Line: Striker – Surely you can't be serious.Doctor – I am serious, and stop calling me Shirley.",Airplane!

""Airplane!"" has a couple of sources for its inspiration. The most notable is obviously ""Airport"".

The opening titles set the tone with an unexpected reference to ""Jaws.""The movie's funniest scene, however, is when the lead characters first meet and fell in love. The scene starts in a bar not unlike Casablanca , which is suddenly a 70's disco playing ""Stayin' Alive"" by the Bee Gees.Lloyd's Bridges, Stephen Stucker and a pre Naked Gun Leslie Neilson (in possibly his best career move) get the best laughs.I was a bit worries watching this with my kids 15 and 8 respectively, as I thought they wouldn't it get a lot if the references etc, and some did go over their heads, but they laughed at a lot of the right places and enjoyed it a lot.

72,sol-,Flying High,7,24 April 2016,"'Flying High' - or as it is better known, 'Airplane!' - this mid-air disaster spoof of 'Airport' (and other films) propelled writer- directors Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker to fame - the 'ZAZ' team who later went onto make the hilarious likes of 'Ruthless People' and the popular 'Naked Gun' series. The story here basically exists as an excuse for one gag after another, and ZAZ manage to cram a remarkable number of jokes into the film, ranging from sight gags, to physical comedy to deadpan comedic verbal exchanges. With so many jokes thrown into the mix, it is perhaps only inevitable that some fail while others succeed. The gags that do not work tend to be the more juvenile ones (the lead actor drowning in sweat towards the end), however, for every gag that backfires here, there are twice as many that work. Peter Graves arguably gets the most comic mileage from his part, constantly showing far too much interest in the young boy who he has allowed into the front of the plane, though the off-screen dueling PA announcers are arguably the funniest in the film, all the more so since everyone else in the airport goes about their business, oblivious to the quarrel -- which in turns suggests something about how little most people pay attention to such announcements. The film is best appreciated though without ZAZ's latter efforts in mind; the lack of three dimensional characterisations (such as in 'Ruthless People') makes it at times hard to get into the story. That said, Robert Hays does fairly well with his lightly fleshed out former pilot character who has grown to fear flying. Julie Hagerty is also always welcome to have on hand and the 'Saturday Night Fever' parody in which they first meet showcases the film at its zaniest.",Airplane!

Quickly boarding the same plane without her knowledge, he aims to win her back.

Also, the pressure is on the air traffic controllers who must help Striker overcome his fear of flying, so they bring in Striker's old commander Rex Kramer (Robert Stack).Spoofing the old airplane disaster films of the 70's, Airplane! is quite possibly the best spoof ever made. Back in the day when Jim Abrahams and the Zucker brothers were inspired and were actually capable of making good films, they don't miss any opportunities. I've never seen a film so packed and condensed with visual gags and witty jokes literally from beginning to end. This was Leslie Nielsen's first comedy role, and from the moment an air hostess asks him if he's a doctor and he sits their straight faced with a stethoscope round his neck and says 'yes, I'm a doctor', it's clear that they have stumbled upon someone truly special.

(1980).He stated that the Steven Spielberg project, 1941, was thought to be the sure thing hit both with the Critics and the Public (via Box Office). His reply in brief said that it was 1941 that was the part coveted by most any actor. The role in AIRPLANE! was considered as a throw-in,something to do, but little else.He further reported that he had the opportunity to invest in the modest budget for the Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker shoe-stringer, but declined; settling instead for just the Part of the highly authoritarian Captain Rex Kramer.Mr. Stack admitted his mistake in missing out on what would have been super profit, with 1941's being highly disappointing returns! Sorry 'bout that, Bob! The Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker team had been part of a College Years improvisational group called Kentucky Fried Theatre. It was based in Madison, Wisconsin-home of the University of Wisconsin. Their group was no doubt, sort of patterned on Chicago/Toronto's Second City units, which are seen as the Zenith of Improv.They had a previously made film, KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE (1977), written by the Trio and directed by John Landis. So, now they were out there on their own, Writing and Directing.The story of a pair of young lovers going through a rough time, with a fatally flawed Commercial Flight from Los Angeles to Chicago as the exciting back drop. The story did all of the obligatory character studies of the various passengers, as established as a must by Howard Hawks' John Wayne Starring Vehicle, THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY(Warner Bros.,1954);and followed by AIRPORT(1970) and all of its successors.The plot has the entire flight crew becoming victims of food poisoning and passenger ex-Airforce Fighter Pilot, Ted Striker(Robert Hays) into the Pilot's chair, all relying on him to save the day! This may sound familiar to you. There was this Paramount Feature Film, ZERO HOUR(1957), which the Production Team of AIRPLANE! took and fractured the script! They essentially went through the situations and the fractured them. They used the now more familiar and proved ploys of using the overly dramatic, the absurd dialog and some non-sequential happenings.A good deal of this was the exaggeration of occurrences and application of the ""Literal"" interpretation of commands or requests. I.E., or E.G., (whichever floats your boat!)Ted Striker: ""It's a whole new ball game, all together!"", Elaine(Julie Haggerty) and Dr. Rumack(Leslie Nielsen): ""It's a whole new ball game!"" In AIRPLANE! The Kentucky Fried Theatre crew proved themselves and brought in Big Buck$ for the Studio involved, Paramount Pictures. And this success led to Television's POLICE SQUAD!(1982) on ABC. Abandoned by a Network because, ""It demanded too much of the viewers Attention.""(WHHHAAAATTTT??) But that led to the adaption of the POLICE SQUAD! idea to the ""Big Screen"" in the THE NAKED GUN: FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD!(1988), and two sequels:THE NAKED GUN 2 1/2,THE SMELL OF FEAR(1991) and THE NAKED GUN 33 1/3: THE FINAL INSULT(1994).In the end, Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker were relocated to the upper tier of the Hollywood productions pecking order and Leslie Nielsen enjoyed a new birth, as his career ascended higher than ever before!",Airplane!

Plays on words and making fun of overdone movie clichés are trans- generational. ""Airplane!""' is a movie that needs no plot synopsis.

80,Anonymous_Maxine,The original spoof classic!,10,7 May 2003,"Unfortunately, Airplane! has been, for me, one of those comedies that I have seen so many times in the video store that its appeal has gradually worn down to almost nothing, resulting in a total absence of interest in renting it. I eventually watched it one day because I worked at the video store and could rent movies for free, and was continuing on my desperate attempt to watch every movie in the store (a goal which continues to this day, although by now I've come to realize that it's never going to happen). During my quest, by the way, I also saw the old 1970 film Airport, probably ten years after having seen parts of Airplane!, and realized that this is one of the many movies that inspired Airplane! In general, I'm a little cautious about movies that have exclamation points in the titles, but Airplane! is without a doubt one of the funniest movies ever made. Consider, for example, those little montages that studios sometimes put together and put at the beginning of movies when they come out on videotape, honoring the great movies that the studio has made in the past. They show lots of memorable clips from their old movies (and I always write all of these titles down, determined to watch them all, and then promptly lose the list that I made) to remind you how great they are. I had a good time watching Airplane! and picking out how many scenes are in the movie that can and do go into those memorable montages.
Airplane! is made up of a series of hilarious scenes that string together a thin shoestring plot, which ironically speaks in the movie's defense. In general, movies with weak stories that are driven along by comedic stunts and pranks and whatnot tend to be pretty weak, but Airplane! is not driven by stunts to cover a weak story as much as the quality of the stunts and the slapstick comedy is so good that they overshadow everything else. It's interesting to watch someone like Robert Stack so many years ago and see that he looked and talked exactly like he did in Unsolved Mysteries so many years later, a show the seriousness of which boggles the mind, given that it's hosted by someone who did so well in a movie like this one.My favorite thing about this movie is, obviously, the huge amount of sound bytes that comes from it, just the cleverness of the way it was written and put together. You have the main character's `drinking problem,' the airport announcers (`Listen, Betty, don't start up with your white zone sh*t again'), the stress of the people investigating the situation on the plane (`Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking/drinking/amphetamines.'), the plays on words (`There's a problem at the control tower!' `What is it?' `It's the big tower where the air traffic controllers talk to the planes.'), that one airport employee who was suspiciously bubbly and excited throughout the entire movie (while providing some of its best comedy), and then of course were the situational gags, such as Robert Stack pulling off his sunglasses to reveal another pair underneath (arguably the most famous scene in the entire film). This is a movie where a list like this could go on and on, and I'm sure if you go to the memorable quotes page on the IMDb you'll find a gigantic list of hilarious quotes from the movie there. It is no secret that this is something of a childish and immature comedy, but it is smartly written and has so many great scenes and bits of dialogue that it's one of those rare movies that makes you want to take notes so you won't forget a lot of the lines. It is one of the earlier versions of Leslie Nielsen's spoofs, a genre in itself which went on to tremendous success with lots of great (and some not so great) spoofs to follow.",Airplane!

82,hellraiser7,High Altitude for Comedy,10,23 May 2016,"Parody is my favorite comedy sub genre because to me there is a creative freedom in turning a cliché or material we're overly familiar with upside down on it's head and pretty much making anything happen, from what what we think will happen does to even what wouldn't normally happen does.This is my fifth favorite parody film and favorite comedy films of all time. It's also kinda another childhood relic of mine, at the time I wasn't familiar with both the parody and disaster film subgeneres, when I watched this I really did think this was a regular disaster film but as a comedy. As I've became aware familiar with both genres overtime and got older, seeing this film again just made it even funnier.This film pretty much parodies on the ""Airport"" film franchise along with a lot of the disaster action films in the 70's which came out like a mudslide like ""The Towering Inferno"", ""Posiddon Adventure"", you name it it's all there. Personally I felt this was a brilliant idea, taking a subgenere that was being overplayed and exhausted and just simply making a comedy about it to both homage and make fun of, this to me acts as a sweet sense of relief. Being able to laugh at an overplayed subgenere just made me appreciate that subgenere and the comedy genre even more; as the parody is a tribute to both.The film is like a live action Mad Magazine cartoon or Where's Waldo book illustration as there are just a lot of visual and verbal gags that are just excellent, it would take more than one watch to just get them all because so much is just happening all at once.I really like the characters as well as the story line, what makes this parody work is that everyone including the story itself plays it straight. No one is aware there in a parody, which is part of what makes it all the more funny, there is just so much craziness we're all aware and witness going one but they all go about it as if it we're just another day. But also I just love how the story just turns all of the conventions and clichés were familiar with in the disaster film subgenere and turns it on it's head.Robert Hays is great as Will Striker whom is basically the PTS war hero archetype. It's just funny how much of a nervous wreck he's become but worst of all became a person that goes into his own little world as he always tells his life story to some random stranger that always kill themselves at some point; yeah, I don't like long lectures either.Though to me, it's really more the supporting characters that stand out the most. Leslie Nelson and Llyod Bridges whom both became alumis to the parody genre are just fantastic. Leslie's character the Doctor is just so straight and serious that it's almost strange, which is why he's all the more funny. Llyod Bridges is just great as a gruff and tough controller just struggling to keep things under control despite the fact that there almost no point since there is just complete chaos all around him but he is somehow oblivious to that fact along with how many cigarettes he's smoking a minute.Robert Stack is also great as the straight laced commander archetype, I'll admit as a fan of the TV show ""Unsolved Mysteries"" it was surreal seeing the host do comedy but surprisingly he actually turned out to be funny.The only bad thing is not all the gags work, like for example there is this one running gag about this lady when observing her husband she suddenly goes into a thought which we all hear. I remember seeing those scenes and thinking ""huh""; that running gag really didn't add up to anything.But that's common in most parodies and comedies, it's the hits that count and this film has more that enough to fill an entire airport. I won't say all of them as there are so many. Two of my favorites are the jive talk scene as we see the actress that plays June Clever from ""Leave it to Beaver"" actually translate and talk Jive. I can't help but crack up because it was just surreal seeing this 50's sitcom alumi actually do it, and I'll admit she really was excellent at it she really sounded like a natural.And of course the one scene that was just hilarious and I love was seeing Robert Stack's character beat up a bunch of religious and cultist advertisers that were just coming randomly coming toward him. Yeah that is something I would love to do with most annoying cell phone salesmen.Overall, if your a fan of the parody subgenere then this is worth a test flight. Airplane has enough altitude to keep you laughs up.Rating: 4 stars",Airplane!
83,Captain_Couth,"The comedy team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker",8,7 August 2005,"Airplane (1980) was a comedy masterpiece (for it's day). Now it's a funny movie filled with dated references and humor. At one time, the writing and directing team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker could do no wrong. Until that fateful day came when they weren't just funny anymore. But we can always remember back in the day (from the seventies to the early nineties) when Z.A.Z. was at the top of their game.The movie takes place inside an airplane. A former World War II hero (Robert Hays) hasn't been in a plane since the war and has developed a serious drinking problem (no really). But on the day he sees his former flame (Julie Haggarty) leaving on a plane. Ted Stryker (R.H.) must over come his personnel demons and board that plane or he may never see Elaine (J.H.) ever again. But on the flight there's a serious problem...A funny parody of disaster films and war movies. Peter Graves plays the pilot with pedophile tendencies, Kareem Abdul Jabbar cameos as the co-pilot and Leslie Nielsen guest stars in a career changing role as a doctor. Classic stuff from the Z.A.Z. team. A sequel would follow (hey, it was made in the eighties). Filled with a lot of juvenile and low brow humor.HIghly recommended.",Airplane!

87,MaxBorg89,Best spoof you'll ever see!,10,4 June 2006,"When it comes to parodies, the ZAZ (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) team remains the most known name associated with the genre. In fact, they're the men behind the best spoof in movie history, the priceless gag marathon called Airplane!.This film has a ridiculously simple plot: on a flight to Chicago, several passengers get food poisoning. Among the victims is the pilot himself (Peter Graves). In order to avoid mass panic, a replacement must be found, and quickly. That replacement turns out to be Ted Striker (Robert Hays), a former war pilot who's on the plane to reconcile with his girlfriend Elaine. With some help, he must overcome his fears and get everyone back on the ground without a scratch.If you read a plot summary such as the one I just wrote, you may think you're about to watch some kind of air-based thriller, with a romantic subplot. That's not the case. Despite the story's seriousness, Airplane! will make you grin for ages. From start to finish, we're offered all kinds of gags, both visual (the balloon autopilot) and aural (""Surely you can't be serious!"" ""I am serious, and don't call me Shirley.""). And guess what? You'll have a great time even if you haven't seen the movies which are being made fun of (in this case, the Airport series, but also, in the fantastic opening sequence, Jaws).The jokes are flawless, exactly like the actors delivering them. Every single character is granted a moment in the spotlight, and that moment is successfully exploited. Hays is pitch-perfect right from the beginning as the naive hero driven by love, a pure, wonderful love, whose birth is shown to us in the movie's best scene, a hilarious flashback which mocks Saturday Night Fever (even my mother, who doesn't usually like this kind of comedy, enjoyed that sequence). The other notable presence is ZAZ regular Leslie Nielsen, ""the Laurence Olivier of spoofs"" (Roger Ebert's words), who makes his comedy debut playing the consistently calm and witty Dr. Rumack (when he first learns the passengers got ill by eating fish, he remarks ""Oh yes, I had the lasagna"").More than twenty years have passed, but Airplane! has aged surprisingly well, and keeps entertaining viewers all over the world. Lovers of comedy, make no mistake: this is the spoof to rule them all. Watch it, and you will experience 88 minutes of non-stop, genuine fun. Arguably the funniest film of the '80s.",Airplane!
88,estebangonzalez10,A classic comedy that changed the spoof genre forever,8,3 August 2015,"""I take it black, like my men.""It's a shame I never got to see this hilarious film sooner because Airplane! has been influencing comedies over the past 35 years now, and many spoof films have borrowed heavily from it. However I still managed to find the jokes quite refreshing and there are many quotable lines here. Just thinking about the best quotes in the movie bring a smile back to my face. The trio of directors and writers, Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker, often referred to as the ZAZ team, deliver a witty and highly quotable film. They went on to direct separate films as well and they each proved to be incredibly talented. Their greatest accomplishment was taking serious actors and trusting in them to deliver dead pan humor. No one did this better than Liam Neeson who reinvented his career after this and is now remembered by everyone for his spoof films. He was a perfect fit for the material and no one could deliver the ZAZ's ridiculous lines better than he did. Airplane! is a spoof film of disaster movies that is so cleverly written and well directed that it's hard to believe that now more than 30 years later it is still leagues better than any modern spoof comedy. The film didn't have to worry about being politically correct and there were many jokes that no studio would dare to put into their films now. Ted Striker (Robert Hays) is an ex-Air Force pilot who has been afraid of flying ever since he suffered a terrible accident. His girlfriend, Elaine (Julie Hagerty), has decided to end their relationship because he is not going anywhere in life. She breaks the news to him right before boarding a flight as part of the crew. Desperate to win her back, Ted faces his fears and decides to get on board the flight as well. In mid air several of the passengers begin to feel ill from food poisoning, including the pilots, Captain Oveur (Peter Graves) and Murdock (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). Dr. Rumack (Liam Neeson) is in the flight as well so he is asked to treat the ill passengers. With no pilot remaining, Elaine asks Ted to save everyone on board. With the help of McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) giving instructions from the control room, Ted will have to confront his fears in order to safely land the plane and save everyones lives.The film does take a while to take off as it slowly introduces some of the characters including the Ted and Elaine relationship. It's not until Neeson appears on screen that the comedy really hits on all cylinders. He has great chemistry with Bridges and Hays so getting to see the three of them deliver their serious dead pan humor was a treat. Abrahams went on to work with Bridges in the Hot Shots movies, which also ranks as one of the better examples of spoof films, while David Zucker had tremendous success working alongside Neeson in The Naked Gun franchise. Jerry Zucker didn't have the same success with comedies, but he directed the widely beloved romantic film, Ghost. So all three directors proved their worth after the huge success in Airplane! but they also have had success in their individual projects as well. However there is no doubt that their contribution for this film laid the groundworks for what was yet to come and hopefully modern spoof films can find inspiration once again from their work. The genre seems to be dead right now, but what a revival Airplane! was for the genre in the 80's and 90's. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Airplane!

The movie's jokes are still as funny today as they were then, such as the ""Don't Call me Shirley"" and ""What is it?"" jokes, as well as the scenes with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Stack. The main character's flashback scenes are first-rate. I loved them. Anyone interested in spoof films DESPERATELY needs to see this movie. I still love it. The sequel was good too.

90,jimbo-53-186511,Even Leslie Nielsen couldn't save this,3,25 April 2013,"I'm clearly in the minority, but I really didn't find Airplane very funny. I enjoyed the opening sequence where you just see the tail of the plane passing through the clouds to the theme of Jaws (the tail being the only thing u can see and it resembling Jaws fin which is just visible from the water). I thought at this point I would be watching an intelligent spoof/parody film. Boy how wrong could I be?To start with, Airplane was very repetitive and just seemed to recycle the same jokes throughout the film - this would be perhaps slightly forgivable if the jokes were funny in the first place - the gag where one person was announcing that you can drop off in White Zone areas and not red Zone and the other was saying you can in Red Zone and not White Zone wasn't particularly funny the first time, but this joke was repeated about 3 times. Ted (Robert Hays) boring everyone about his relationship with Elaine (Julie Hagerty) and each passenger he talks to wanting to kill themselves, this quickly became tired and predictable.There were also a couple of 'WTF' moments like when Captain Oveur says to the young boy 'Have you ever seen a grown man naked'? WTF why would you include that line in the script? I'm no prude, but that was just a little too weird for me and frankly I'm amazed that they got away with an old man saying that to a young boy even back in 1980. The other WTF moment was the 2 black guys talking in their own language, at the start of the flight. Later on in the film one of the stewardesses asks if one of the men is OK, the black guy shouts some incomprehensible reply which the stewardess doesn't understand. An old white lady then approaches the stewardess and says 'I can speak 'Jai' which is their language and replies back to them in the same incomprehensible way. This was painful to watch. I think if they'd have written the 2 black characters as posh people who speak in well spoken English accents and the crew wrongly assume that they can't speak English that this would have been more 'subtly' funny with positive connotations.The relationship between Ted and Elaine (which is told in flashbacks) was pretty boring to watch, but then again the whole film was pretty poor. We find out once we delve into their relationship that Ted was in charge of a raid that went wrong during the war in which 7 members of his crew were killed which Ted feels guilty for her as he says he is to blame - (this explains his reluctance to fly the plane when it turns out he is the only person who can fly the plane who hasn't eaten the fish which is what made all the crew ill) and this proves to be a problem for him in his relationship with Elaine as he can't let go of the past and she wants him to stop blaming himself and move on, but it also leads to him saving the day as Dr Rumbeck (Leslie Nielsen) tells Ted that one of his crew called Zip (who died during the war and shortly after speaking to Rumbeck) told Rumbeck that Ted wasn't to blame for the crew's death. Before this conversation, Ted had all but given up on attempting to land the plane as he had lost his confidence, but this spurs Ted on to land the plane and save the day.There were a few good moments in Airplane; Leslie Nielsen was great as Dr Rumbeck (although he was let down by a poor script). The 'Oveur' and 'Roger' scene at the start made me chuckle and the small scene where the 2 children are having tea together was also pretty funny. The acting was generally good, although Julie Hagerty was a little wooden.Unfortunately the bad far outweighs the good and Airplane is dated, largely unfunny, and repetitive. I'm at a loss as to what people find funny about it.",Airplane!

92,dwpollar,Classic comedy spoof of the Airport disaster movies...,7,20 March 2012,"1st watched 3/18/2012 -- 7 out of 10(Dir-Jim Abrahams, David Zucker & Jerry Zucker): Classic comedy spoof of the Airport disaster movies that is basically one joke after another for a full one and 1/2 hours. The writers & directors(Jim Abrahams, David Zucker & Jerry Zucker) continued to do this in other movies, but this was their first big one and in my opinion, their funniest. The premise revolves around an old airforce pilot, played by Robert Hays, who's chasing down his old love, played by Julie Hagerty. He boards the plane where she is a stewardess, and the movie uses flashbacks to show us their history. He's facing a fear of planes -- which he's had since the war due to an unfortunate accident that killed & injured many of his buddies. He, of course, eventually has to pilot the plane after a lot of the crew and passengers get sick from the fish they had for dinner. Pretty much everyone in the movie is there for the barrage of jokes from this group as they do it in the flashbacks and the current situation. Sure, a lot of the jokes are corny and some are just planned un-called for but it keeps you laughing. You have to be perceptive to get all the jokes -- sometimes they don't make sense and sometimes they just come too fast but that's part of the fun of the movie. Enjoy it and watch it over again to pick-up what you might have missed the first time around.",Airplane!

Hagerty's movie!!",7,28 April 2008,"I have found this nice parody moderately funnybut also certainly funnyfunny in a moderate way--maybe deliberately so.It is also,today,a very goodlooking film.It has a fine note, that opposes it to the harsher, rugged tones of later parodies.I know of only one parody that I have enjoyed moreand in a different waythe SOTL parody The Silence of the Hams (by Ezio Greggio,with Joanna Pacula,etc.);as for the rest, Airplane! is way better that the Naked Gun and Hot Shots and Scary Movie franchises. Not that it's more clever or inventive; but it has a gentler, finer approach.One of the actresses is very sexyJulie Hagerty; Lorna Patterson is pretty hot too.The cast includes several recognizable faces--Peter Graves, Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack, Leslie Nielsen.I have seen the movie also as a Julie Hagerty movie.Stylisticallyif such a thing might be involved hereAirplane! reminded me more of a LAND OF THE GIANTS episode, than of a Naked Gun or Hot Shots installment. Which is only natural, being given that a parody should spontaneously bear more resemblance to the thing is parodiesand whose approach is naturally borrows and makes its own, than to the patterns of a sospeaking parody genrewhich in fact doesn't exist.AIRPLANE ! borrows the colors, excitement, gusto and atmosphere of the legendary LAND OF THE GIANTS pilot.Its plot might come from the '50s,yet its look certainly comes from the '70s.Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker made several other such lampoons;to my taste,none was so successful as this first.Anyway,their names became practically synonymous with the highly acclaimed parodies.",Airplane!

95,slokes,"Comedy, Thy Name Is Shirley!",10,24 August 2007,"In my mind, ""Airplane!"" is the best comedy between ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""There's Something About Mary"", the best disaster movie serious or otherwise, and the best film with punctuation in its title. I guess that's another way of saying I like it very much.Ted Striker (Robert Hays) is an ex-pilot who hasn't flown since the war, which turned him into such a guilt case they put him in the special hospital with the guys who think they are Ethel Merman. His flight attendant girlfriend Elaine (Julie Hagerty), noting he lives too much in the past, tells him she's leaving him. To win her back, Ted buys a ticket on her flight out, bringing nothing with him but feelings of hurt, a fatal case of nostalgia (to himself and others), a drinking problem, and most importantly for the purposes of this film, no appetite for fish dinners.I just realized that I described ""Airplane!"" as if it had a plot of some kind. I apologize. What plot there is, taken directly from a 1950s flight drama called ""Zero Hour!"", is more a kind of wide-stretching net for catching any gag that can possibly be imagined, nearly all of which work. Abortion, the Bee Gees, Ronald Reagan, heart transplants, jive talking (not the Bee Gees' kind), rear projection, Scientology, the Peace Corps, nothing is too high or low for a cheap shot from director-writers Jim Abrahams and David and Jerry Zucker, a design inspiring the best (""The Simpsons"") and worst (many of ZAZ's subsequent productions) comedies ever since.""Airplane!"" is held dear for many reasons, perhaps mostly as the film that launched Leslie Nielsen's second career as deadpan funnyman, him playing a doctor named Rumack who pulls eggs out of a woman's mouth and quickly realizes she is deathly ill.""This woman has to be gotten to a hospital,"" Rumack tells Elaine.""A hospital! What is it?""""It's a big building with patients, but that's not important right now.""Nor is the fact it's been 27 years since ""Airplane"" was first released. It has aged, yes, but in a fine-wine kind of way. It's actually amazing how enjoyable the comedy plays after numerous viewings, in large part because of its solid tone throughout. Instead of mugging, Nielsen and the other elder B-movie vets on hand here play their roles absolutely straight. Well, straight may not be the word to describe Peter Graves' Captain Oveur, but he and Robert Stack as a gruff ground-control guy (""Flying a plane is a lot like riding a bicycle...it's just a lot harder putting baseball cards in the spokes"") give the film's best performances in a movie full of them.The disassociation many will have now from its more contemporary gags only enhance the genial surrealism that has always been this film's secret strength. Witness the falling watermelons, flying spears, and Stephen Stucker's zany non-sequiturs as a control-tower worker with a thing for Barbara Stanwyk and J.C. Penney's.If comedy never gets any respect from movie people, and it doesn't, it's hard imagining ""Airplane"" being the film to break that cycle.

97,TOMNEL,One of the best parody movies.,9,15 March 2008,"It seems like movie companies nowadays don't have a way of marketing parody movies. In the end, they just look like slapstick comedies, so instead of making parody films, they do terrible spoof movies, where every scene has 30 references people who see it in 10 years won't understand. Though Airplane is a parody of disaster films, like the ""Airport"" movies, it never actually spoofs a scene from the film. It's more like a typical disaster film. Everyone is completely serious in their roles, no matter how goofy what they have to say is. There's no stupid voices and dumb readings, and that's one major thing that makes this a great parody film.Airplane starts off much jokier than it becomes. Once everyone is aboard the plane, all the characters are introduced through a joke scene. For example, the little boy gives this girl he likes coffee, and she says, ""I like men like I like my coffee...black."" That is an old joke, but in context it's very funny. Any repetition in the jokes is admitted. Every time someone misunderstands what someone else has said, the actors end their sentence with, ""...but that's not important right now."" It's purposeful repetition that gets funnier as it goes along.Now, onto the actors. They were all phenomenal. Aside from the two main characters, who were fairly new to acting (This was Julie Haggerty's first film), everyone else was a long time serious actor. Leslie Nielson plays Rumack, a doctor who happens to be on the plane. Leslie Nielson takes the role completely seriously, never once cracking a smile to his ridiculous character. Robert Stack plays Rex Kramer, the man piloting the plane from the ground, trying to make sure everyone gets home safely. Peter Graves plays the weird pedophile airplane captain, and Kareem Abdul Jabar plays the co-captain. Lloyd Bridges has a pretty thankless role as the man down in headquarters trying to get Rex Kramer. So, this movie had some good actors, minus Kareem Abdul Jabar, who was still good.This is a classic parody movie, and a timeless one, and will live on much longer than any ""Date Movie"" or ""Meet the Spartans"".My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 83 mins.

98,Jonny_Numb,"what else is there to say, aside from ""I laughed""?",6,17 July 2005,"Like other efforts from the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team (""The Naked Gun"" and its sequels come to mind), ""Airplane!"" has aged somewhat awkwardly as a kitchen-sink parody where nothing is sacred. That being said, the movie contains its share of righteous hilarity and groan-inducing lameness, the laugh factor operating with enough consistency to weather the turbulent passages. The plot is really just an excuse to cram in as many gags as a frame will allow, but here goes: former military pilot Striker (Robert Hays) still lusts after old flame Elaine (Julie Hagerty), an airline stewardess; one fateful night, their paths cross when the flight is stricken with food poisoning, bad weather, and just about every other friendly cliché at your typical disaster film's disposal. The offbeat casting works extremely well, from Peter Graves as a gay pilot (""Ever been in a Turkish prison?""), Lloyd Bridges as glue-sniffing ground control, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the copilot (who, in a great scene, breaks character to put an obnoxious little boy in line). The gags come at a rapid clip, and what sets ""Airplane!""'s brand of humor above the more vulgar profiteers of recent years (the Farrelly brothers, for instance) is how subtly racy it feels, even today--from fellatio to cocaine to abortion to gynecology to the stereotypical way we perceive a person's manner of speaking (exhibited brilliantly in Barbara Billingsley's interaction with the jive-talking black guys), nothing is sacred (nor explicit), and that in itself is an achievement.

The trouble is not that comedies since 1980 have become so much more sophisticated - quite the reverse! - but that over the decades I've seen Airplane! so often that its jokes are getting a bit jaded. I've seen it so often I even forget I saw it at the cinema when it was released and split my sides with the rest of the punters. Some of the set pieces, comments and images are so indelibly etched onto my brain I don't really need to watch it anymore except to put it all into the right order.Loads of cabin crew and passengers on board civil airliner flying from LAX are struck down by food poisoning  Robert Hays USAAF vet with confidence issues suddenly has to effect a landing at CHI. In this he's guided down by brasshat Robert Stack (definitely not an old friend) and way out Lloyd Bridges in the control tower, whilst he has doctor Leslie (Shirley) Neilson continually wishing him luck in the plane. There's more than a gag a minute, with most working - the best were adapted from MAD magazine especially from their wacky strip cartoonist Don Martin. Of course it was all supremely silly stuff, but to me watching movies made since then hasn't been the same: how can deeply serious emotional flashbacks ever be taken seriously again without thinking of Robert Hays' continual melodramatic melancholic war musings? Or a star crossed lover ending his heart wringing pleas with What A Pisser?My all time favourite zany film is Hellzapoppin from generations ago but Airplane! along with parts of the Naked Guns/Hot Shots managed to hit the right spot too, over and over again.",Airplane!
102,davidmvining,"Wildly funny, and intelligently delivered",9,22 November 2019,"Airplane! is a few years older than I am, so I never saw it in its initial run and most of the cultural references it makes go way over my head. Did I ever see the exact coffee commercial that they play off of? Did I ever watch Leave It to Beaver? Did I know what jive was? Did I know any of this when I first saw the movie off of a TV broadcast when I was about seven?No, I didn't, but I still found the movie hilarious. Can we say the same of the spoof movies that have come out over the last decade? Have you seen the likes of Disaster Movie, Meet the Spartans, or Epic Movie? I have, and, besides all be dreadfully unfunny, they all require a knowledge of contemporary pop culture just to begin to understand the ""jokes"". They're not really jokes, they're really just references dropped into the films, inducing an, ""I know that thing!"" response.In Airplane!, the movie does use cultural reference points in the film, but it does the work for those gags so they can be appreciated outside of that specific point in history. Let's look at my three questions from above.The Coffee CommercialThe key to making this gag work is the first instance of it in the movie. The wife essentially plays the commercial out straight. ""He never has a second cup of coffee at home."" This is a play on a well-known ad at the time for Folgers (XXXX), but that's not the actual joke. It might have elicited a chuckle or two at the time in that ""I know that thing!"" sort of way, but the actual meat of the joke comes later. ""He never vomits at home."" That's all it is, just a twist of the familiar into something you wouldn't expect, sold in the exact same tone as the surprise that the woman's husband is having a second cup of coffee. Does knowing the reference help in appreciating the gag? Probably? Is it required? Not at all.Mrs. Beaver and JiveThe only place I would recognize Barbara Billingsley would be from this movie. I've never seen an episode of Leave It to Beaver in my life, but when she breaks out into jive talk, it's really really funny to me. Why? Despite having never seen an episode of the sitcom or even knowing what jive was, I can laugh genuinely at that gag, and it's because of how the gag is first built and the look of those involved.There's an earlier scene that establishes jive. The two brothers have a simple conversation with subtitles turning their dialogue into a rather formal form of American English. That scene in and of itself isn't funny, and it's not meant to be. It's supposed to be the point from which actual jokes come from. The second half of how the gag works is Barbara Billingsley herself. Again, I have no cultural touchpoint for her, but she looks and sounds like a nice old white lady. She does not look like someone who would be immersed in black culture enough to not only understand jive, but speak it as well as anyone else. Her breaking out into it, and her complete dismissal of their refusal to accept her help (without subtitles this time) is what leads to the laughs.Did the ZAZ team know that their movie would still play on TV decades later? That people born years after its release would watch it? I have a feeling that it wasn't all that present in their minds. They were probably not trying to create some cultural touchpoint of their own, but just a movie that they could laugh at and make a buck on.

Right now I don't remember much of BASEketball but what I clearly remember is that not long ago I heard from Trey and Matt that they were fans of Airplane! and since then I was like ""damn I need to see Airplane!, the South Park creators are fans plus it is listed by the American Film Institute as the 10th best American comedy of all time and it is really acclaimed by the fellow IMDb users"" so yes I bought the DVD and yes pretty much my only experiences with movies by David Zucker (he directed alone BASEketball while Airplane! is also directed by Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker) are because I'm a big fan of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, but anyway today I can say, after seeing Airplane! yesterday, that I'm not a fan, it was surely a disappointment, damn I wasn't laughing as hard as I expected and wanted, out of all the many jokes only the minority made laugh. Robert Stack plays Rex Kramer and he is in what is probably my favourite scene in the whole movie: when Kramer is driving!, that scene was really funny like other stuff (like the stuff with the black dudes) so for me Airplane! is funny but extremely overrated! 6.5 out of 10",Airplane!
106,nycritic,"""It's an Entirely Different Kind of Flying.""",10,3 August 2005,"Only the writing/directing team of Jerry and David Zucker and Jim Abrahams could conceive of spoofing a film like ZERO HOUR! while sticking pretty close to its source and garner a smash hit. It's a shame they didn't do more spoofs, or that their output has been rather infrequent, resulting in each of this team making their own movies with varying degrees of success, since there is so much material out there to rip apart from.Here, it's the fear of flying. That any flight could encounter problems either from the weather or from machinery is nothing new -- it happens, plain and simple. That a shot of the flight depicted here as it flies dangerously close to the Chicago skyline probably won't give anyone a 9/11 jolt nowadays, but the undertone is there. There is a fear of planes, and this movie takes that specific fear and turns it inside out with hysterical results from the opening shot to the closing credits.Using the premise of ZERO HOUR and the AIRPORT franchise, AIRPLANE brings Ted Stryker, a man who has a neurotic fear of failure and is a war veteran, gets on a plane to get back with his estranged girlfriend Elaine, a stewardess on the flight. That he tells his ""tragic"" tale to not one, but three people (all who commit suicide) is one of the many laugh-out-loud sequences, but some danger actually ensues when the meals are served and those who have eaten fish fall ill, and this includes the pilots. With no one left to fly this plane, Ted is called into duty and guided by Captain Kramer (whom he hates) he has to fly the plane to safety.This is, essentially, the bare-bones of the plot. The real stars of the movie are the incessant, mile a minute visual, referential, and verbal jokes that assault the viewer faster than he or she can register. References to classic movies, soap operas, commercials from the 70s (""Jim never drinks a second cup of coffee at home...""), pedophilia, basketball, voice recordings that guide people through airports, outrageous takes on characters from the very movies they are spoofing; in short, nothing is spared here, and it makes for a relentlessly funny movie.That the actors play it straight makes AIRPLANE even funnier. It's as if they weren't sure as to what exactly were they doing and were trying these waters out on a lark; luckily for them that it paid because not only it made David Zucker's, Jerry Zucker's, and Jim Abrahams' career, it also brought back Leslie Nielsen into the limelight as a deadpan funny man who could deliver ridiculous lines as if it were the real thing. Its success was so evident that it spawned an inferior remake, a slew of similar-toned movies, many of them directed by the Zucker-Zucker-Abrahams team, together or separately. This, however, remains as the spoof movie to watch, the one all spoof movie should measure itself to, and one of the funniest comedies of all time.",Airplane!
107,PredragReviews,And stop calling me Shirley....,8,4 May 2016,"Airplane - an all time classic. David Zucker stars in this fantastically funny movie topped off with a performance from Leslie Nielsen. This movie is great for a evening laugh, it does not take itself seriously which works well for this film as there is a gag at about every 30 seconds. It is one of the funniest films i have seen in a while while some of the humour is predictable most of it isn't and works very well and there are some great one liners which will stick with you. There is so much humour in the film it is likely you will have to watch it several times before you find all of the gags; some of them are very subtle and take stabs out of other movies of the time.The humour is never ending with hidden jokes that creep up on you in the next scene. The disco scene is excellent, not to mention Leslie Neilson's ""don't call me Shirley"" lines, the nun's cheery song, the Vietnam flashbacks, the hysterical passenger, the haphazard crew at the control tower.

Reminiscent of the Sid Caesar/Mel Brooks skit-parody style, but invented a new form of saturation comedy, stuffing the movie with every type of sight gag, wordplay, slapstick, satire, burlesque, etc. imaginable, regardless of good taste or intelligence or logic--who cares if one joke fizzles when the next three land, all in the span of about thirty seconds? Dated at times, and struggles to sustain itself for the full hour-and-a-half, but still one of the funniest and most quotable movies ever made. Cast to perfection with serious, steady dramatic actors giving straight line readings of ridiculous statements and questions (""Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?""), even reigniting Nielsen's career as a virtuoso of the deadpan.

Sure, there are a couple of half-funny laughs in this movie, like, say, the white woman who ""speaks Jive"", and some other stuff.

117,mattymatt4ever,A hilarious gem!,9,13 March 2003,"This is voted as one of the funniest comedies of all time, and it deserves that honor!  The film is filled with hilarious gags!  Sure, in every one of these campy farces, there's usually a few gags that are way too silly.  In this case, it was the ""drinking problem"" gag and that annoying gay man who works on Lloyd Bridges' staff.  But when I can actually count on my hand how many gags didn't work, that's a good sign.  The majority of the film sent me into a frenzy of laughter!  One of my favorites is when the blow-up auto-pilot runs out of air and Julie Hagerty blows it back up again.  You'll have to see the movie to find out why it was so hilarious!  I also got a great kick out of the running gag in which every passenger who listens to Robert Hays ends up killing themselves.  This is definitely the Zuckers and Abrahams in top form!  Unfortunately, I haven't seen a great spoof in years. The ""Scary Movie"" films were pretty good, but incredibly lewd and crude. And obviously the Zuckers and Abrahams have much better eyes for satire than the Wayans brothers.  I caught ""Scary Movie"" on cable and watched it a second time, and I didn't laugh nearly as many times as I did the first time.  I can watch ""Airplane"" 200 times and still laugh like there's no tomorrow!  The film was made back when comedies didn't go strictly for sex and toilet gags to make an audience laugh.  This was back when writers used to employ this quality called ""wit.""  ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" had some racy gags, but even those were witty for the most part.  There is a certain rhythm in every gag that helps make the film work.  For example, Lloyd Bridges starts out by saying ""I think I picked the wrong day to quit smoking.""  Then he says he picked the wrong day to quit drinking.  And when he finally says ""I picked the wrong day to quit amphetamines,"" I was laughing my head off!  So basically, you watch a film like this and feel the urge to mail a copy of the video to the Wayans Brothers and whatever crackheads wrote ""Not Another Teen Movie,"" along with a note saying ""THIS is how to make a spoof!""  There are so many other gags worth mentioning, including the ""Saturday Night Fever"" sendup, which is definitely one of the best comic moments caught on film!  That scene also contains my favorite line:  ""I told the guy next to me to pinch me to make sure I wasn't dreaming.""  After that voice-over, we see the guy next to Robert Hays repulsed and walking away from him.  Another great example of perfect comic timing and delivery!  If you want to get some authentic belly laughs--I'm not talking chuckles, but actual LAUGHS!--you must check out ""Airplane.""  Trust me, movies don't get much more original or funny than this!  My score:  9 (out of 10)",Airplane!
118,hall895,Surely it's a comedy classic. But don't call me Shirley.,8,20 June 2005,"Perhaps the greatest spoof in movie history, Airplane! is a nonstop laugh riot. The main plot, such as it is, spoofs airport disaster films but the plot here is hardly relevant. The plot really only serves to place the characters in hilarious situations as the film careens from one gut-busting gag to another. While those disaster flicks come in for the most abuse anyone and anything will be ridiculed to great comic effect. Some of the humor veers towards the politically incorrect if you're actually taking this film seriously. But if you're taking this film seriously you're missing the point. The whole thing is one big joke.If you are actually concerned with the plot, it revolves around Ted Striker, as played by Robert Hays, a wartime pilot who shall we say had some bad flying experiences during the war. He is on board this flight trying to win back ex-girlfriend stewardess Elaine, played by Julie Hagerty. The pilots of the plane (one played by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar who must surely be the world's tallest pilot) take ill and Striker is the only person on board who can land the plane. Is he up to the task? He certainly doesn't think so. Suffice to say much hilarity ensues.Striker (with Elaine's help) tries to fly and ultimately land the plane. Meanwhile, both on board and on the ground in the control tower, all kinds of wonderfully hilarious things are going on. Hays and Hagerty, whose characters are focusing on the task at hand, are essentially the straight people here, while the jokes and gags are left in the capable hands of the likes of Leslie Nielsen, Lloyd Bridges and Robert Stack. Nielsen plays a doctor trying to care for sick passengers while also boosting Striker's fragile confidence. Nielsen plays the role wonderfully, with the perfect blend of deadpan seriousness and subtle comic genius. Bridges' air traffic controller, funny at first, is a bit of a letdown. He's really only got one joke and it's beaten to death. The true standout is Stack as Captain Rex Kramer, who served with Striker in the military and is now called in to help talk him down to the ground. Stack brilliantly ignores all the nonsense occurring around him and plays his character with such earnest seriousness amongst all the lunacy that he turns out to be the funniest of all.Any student of popular culture will appreciate the spot-on spoofs and references throughout Airplane! Movies as diverse as Jaws, Saturday Night Fever and Knute Rockne All American are among the many films spoofed to great effect. But even if you miss some of the references (and there are so many you undoubtedly will) Airplane! will have you laughing from beginning to end. It hilariously spoofs so much of what has come before it while adding so much brilliant fresh humor of its own. A great script brought to life by some truly great performances makes Airplane! surely one of the most consistently funny films ever.",Airplane!
119,Beta_Gallinger,"Seems a little disappointing for a while, but overall, an admirable accomplishment in comedy",8,31 August 2010,"This spoof movie came into theatres six years before I was born, and I didn't see it until three decades after its release. It's been nearly three years since I got around to watching the 1988 David Zucker/Jerry Zucker film, ""The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!"" and its two sequels, 1991's ""The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear"" and 1994's ""Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult"", neither of which lived up to the original. I didn't find the third installment in the trilogy funny at all, after finding the second one to be hit and miss. For a while now, I've known that ""Airplane!"" was another Zucker effort (I now know that Jim Abrahams was involved in the making of both movies as well), and both films are very popular parodies. I also knew that both of them featured Leslie Nielsen in the cast. It took me a while, but I was intending to watch this 1980 comedy eventually, since I found ""The Naked Gun"" so funny, and now that's finally happened. For a while, it looked like I wasn't going to find it nearly as funny as so many other viewers have, but that didn't last.Ted Striker is a former American fighter pilot who is now a cab driver. He was traumatized during his service in a certain war, so he now suffers from a fear of flying and a ""drinking problem"" (not alcoholism, but the fact that he misses his mouth when he tries to drink). At an airport filled with religious people trying to get others to make donations, Ted meets his former lover, Elaine Dickinson, who is currently a stewardess and is no longer interested in him. Determined to win her back, the ex-soldier decides to face his fear of flying and buy a ticket for the next flight Elaine will be serving on. During this flight, it isn't long before Elaine discovers that Ted is on board, but unfortunately, his attempts to save their relationship continue to fail, and this flight is headed for a lot of trouble! He sits beside various other passengers on the plane and tells them about his days as a fighter pilot, how he met Elaine, and experiences he had with her, but listening to him makes these passengers suicidal! Eventually, the vast majority of the passengers fall ill from food poisoning, and after this problem starts, the pilots soon fall ill for the same reason, meaning they can no longer operate the plane! The film begins at the airport, and there sure are some funny parts here. The first REALLY funny one might be the argument between the two announcers about the red zone and the white zone. To me, it looked promising around this time, but didn't quite stay that way. I wasn't sure what I thought of all the flashbacks and more than one romance scene with a romantic musical score. For a while, it seemed only mildly amusing to me, and not enough to carry the film, but I then found that it improved. The flashbacks get funnier, with scenes such as the male soldier who thinks he's Ethel Merman (played by the real Ethel Merman) and others. Many funny things happen on the plane as well, such as the reactions of the passengers who listen to Ted's stories, a kid named Joey in the cockpit of the plane recognizing one of the pilots, Roger Murdock as basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who plays this character), the hysterical woman being shaken and slapped by several different passengers, the automatic pilot (an inflatable pilot which is funny to look at), etc. The cast performances in general are good, and Leslie Nielsen doesn't appear for a while, but once he does, he sure helps a lot with the humour in the role of Dr. Rumack, saying funny lines such as, ""Don't call me Shirley"" (in response to Ted saying ""surely""). Also, some very funny things happen in the scenes involving members of the control tower staff.28 years after the release of this successful comedy, a spoof film known as ""Disaster Movie"" came into theatres, which was written and directed by the mysterious and despicable Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. I don't know how many times I've said how much I hated ""Epic Movie"", another film of theirs released the year before that, which is why I've refused to watch any other ""movies"" they've done in the past four years, since none of them seem to have a better reputation than the one I saw! So, I haven't seen 2008's ""Disaster Movie"" and don't intend to, but know that as well as receiving a lot of criticism for being atrociously unfunny, it has also been criticized for its misleading title, as some of the movies ""spoofed"" in it are certainly not disaster ones. I can most definitely believe that, but ""Airplane!"" is a REAL disaster movie spoof, even though it doesn't have the word ""disaster"" in the title, and is MUCH funnier than anything Friedberg and Seltzer could probably ever dream of doing! I can't say I agree with those who say this 1980 spoof is one of the funniest movies or the funniest movie of all time, but if comedies filled with slapstick and silliness appeal to you, it is worth watching.",Airplane!
120,vip_ebriega,One of the funniest movies ever? Can't argue with that!,10,30 September 2009,"My Take: A spoof of the 70's disaster movies... and any movie in particular. One of the funniest comedies ever! No conversation about spoofing movies or making fun of movies can go without the mention of ZAZ's (Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, David Zucker) classic AIRPLANE! A spoof of the 70's disaster movies or any movie and cultural reference it can get its hands on, AIRPLANE! has become a yardstick of which all movie spoofs are measured. Some label it one of the funniest comedies ever (some would argue it is THE funniest), and it's hard to disagree with that.To the uninitiated, the movie is actually a shot-by-shot remake/parody of the 50's disaster movie ZERO HOUR! (with Dana Andrews as the original Ted Stryker!) ZAZ bought the script and basically remade the film, only giving it a comedic twist. AIRPLANE! makes fun of the clichés, stock characters, and silly subplots of the other 70's disaster movies, not primarily ZERO HOUR! but also other disaster movies like AIRPORT 1975 (the infamous nun scene). A shot-by-shot spoof rarely works, but AIRPLANE! does the job perfectly.But whether or not you've seen any of the movies it parodies, AIRPLANE! has a lot jokes and sight gags that work in spite of itself. Surely you don't need to see any of the movies to find the ""Surely, you can't be serious"" scene. This is probably why AIRPLANE! is widely revered as one of the best comedies ever. Forget the fact that this movies would spawn imitators like EPIC MOVIE and DISASTER MOVIE (which, to put it mildly, are one of the worst movies ever). AIRPLANE! is movie parodies done right.

121,one9eighty,"I am serious, and don't call me Shirley!",9,22 January 2021,"Parodying the disaster film genre has never been so much fun. This 1980 Paramount Pictures film was a success when it was released and has a cult following which consistently rank it in the top 10 funniest films of all time.Ex-fighter pilot Ted Striker has a pathological fear of flying and ""drinking problems"" because of a trauma he experienced during the war. His war-time girlfriend, Elaine Dickinson, has moved on and is a flight attendant due to do her job on a regular flight between LA and Chicago. Disaster strikes and the crew and majority of the passengers fall ill with food poisoning. With nobody to fly the plane and with conditions worsening there is nobody more qualified to save the day then Ted - but he must overcome some demons before he can be of any help.Compared to some of the other films I have written about, this write up has a relatively small plot to detail. That does not make it any less of a film, as it relies heavily on its humour which comes in many forms. Visual gags, slapstick, puns, gags, and obscure humour are all fast paced and handles with skill. The ZAZ trio wrote this film while they were performing with the Kentucky Fried Theatre group, they had founded in 1971. While recording commercials to 'send up' in the 1970's, something the regularly did to get material for their shows, they accidently recorded a disaster film called ""Zero Hour"". It was watching this film, which they later referred to as the serious ""Airplane!"" they decided to branch out and write what would become this 1980 film.The casting in this was a stroke of genius, ZAZ wanted actors who were known more for their serious roles who had not done much if any comedy before as this would play well with a lot of the dead-pan situations planned. Before Hays was cast as Striker, David Letterman and Bruce Jenner were auditioned. Likewise, before Hagerty was cast as Elaine, Sigourney Weaver and Shelley Long were auditioned. Robert Stack, Peter Graves and Lloyd Brides were more serious actors, but all were happy enough to come on board for a change - although Graves was more difficult as he thought that the script was tasteless. One of the biggest surprises was Leslie Nielson, he had been wanting to do something funny for a while, considering himself a closet comedian, and his role in this really helped him shine and go on to other things. He did make an appearance in the 1977 ""Kentucky Fried Movie"", but this was more of a leading role and it would lead to other comedy productions like ""Police Squad!"" and the ""Naked Gun"" films.It was essential that this film was watertight with a great cast reading from a great script as most of the shooting was isolated to the confines of claustrophobic space. Something that really helped was a fantastic musical score which was provided by Elmer Bernstein. Bernstein had previously worked on films like ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Great Escape"". He was instructed not to make an epic score for an epic film, but instead make something that was more B-Movie appropriate - still able to drive the film on, but cornier and more overdone. The music provided was great and at time becomes a character in it is own right, even to the point that the actors react to it directly and break the 4th wall of looking at the audience behind the screen.This film might not be the right level of humour for a lot of people, but it was right up my street with its fun. A film with a well-polished script which created many a quotable line, which, to my wife's frustration, I still use freely today some 40 years after the film first aired. Made with a budget of about $3.5 million this film went on to earn well over $150 million at the box office. It spawned a sequel which took things a little further (into space no less) and served as a platform for a lot more ZAZ comedy gold to be committed to the big screen.""Airplane!"" may look a little dated by today's standard, but one thing that has aged well is the humour that this spoof film contains.

Makes fun of just about everything from JAWS to Saturday Night Fever to any givennumber of war movies and disaster movies.Plus Julie Hagerty was kind of hot.Other good bits include the subtitles accompanying the ""jive talk"" of the black guys, the old white woman who can ""talk jive"" dissing the black guys, the thing with the guitar playing nun, the basketball player co-pilot, Lloyd Bridges beating up all the Religious fanatics who get in his way, the blow jobbing of the autopilot (you have to see it to believe it!), Robert Hays ""drinking problem"", everyone assuming their ""emergency landing positions"", and Leslie Nielsen (who laterparodies one of the running gags here in ""Scary Movie #1"").

125,gab-14712,One of the Better Spoof Movies!,8,6 November 2017,"Airplane! is an early example of a spoof movie, and is one of the better spoof movies out there. Maybe it's the garbage that has been released the past decade, but spoof movies are my least favorite genre. The concept of making fun of other movies is a genius idea, but the execution have been ranging anywhere from downright mediocre to absolutely horrendous. Fortunately, Airplane! is the right example how to make a spoof movie. There is no over-reliance on poop or fart jokes and although the movie is nearly forty years old, the humor ages like a nice bottle of fine wine. Plus it helps the movie sports a wonderful cast. One that began a career of comedy for many of the talented actors and actresses.Although the plot can be tricky to describe because it pulls from many films, I will do my best to tell you about the basic story. Ted Striker (Robert Hays) is an ex-Navy pilot who is afraid of boarding a plane because of the war. He faces his fear and boards a plane to find his former flame, Elaine (Julie Hagerty). You know things are wrong when he is the only sane person on that airplane! This movie came out at the right time. The 1970's were ripe with disaster movies, and as we headed into the new decade, the public became worn out by these type of films. That is why the time was ripe for these films to be made fun of. Casual moviegoers might be able to pick out films like Airport and Jaws as some of the films that the movie had fun with. However, the one movie that really influenced this movie was 1957's Zero Hour! I might add that this would be a good trivia question! There is no denying that the script written by Jim Abraham, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker is juvenile and silly, but I just could not resist laughing at some of the happenstances that occurred in the film. There were zany, memorable quotes such as that ""Don't call me Shirley"" quote. There were simple gags like the fin of the plane zipping through the clouds while the Jaws theme music is playing in the background. My favorite scene is when this lady is freaking out, a line of people line up to slap her silly by various means. That took me some time to stop laughing.Another thing that elevated this spoof movie is its cast. The majority of the cast was filled with veteran actors, many whom had no experience with comedy. In addition to Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty, we had Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Robert Stack, and the great Leslie Nielsen. Nielsen was mostly a dramatic actor prior to this movie, but Airplane! opened up a new side of himself and a new career path.Despite being overly silly at times, I rather enjoyed Airplane! It might be one of the best spoof films ever made. Not all the jokes worked, but those that did are instant classics. David and Jerry Zucker are genius comedic forces, and it is great they created this movie as a blueprint for future spoof films. It's sad that many of them will not reach the somewhat elevated heights of this film.""Surely you can't be serious."" ""I am serious, and don't call me Shirley."" ""You've ever been in a cockpit before?"" ""No sir, I've never been up in a plane before."" ""You have ever seen a grown man naked."" MyGrade: B",Airplane!
126,bankofmarquis,Holds up all these years later,9,27 March 2020,"Doctor: Can you fly this plane, and land it?Striker: Surely you can't be serious.Doctor: I am serious... and don't call me Shirley.And that, in a nutshell, is the humor to be found in the 1980 laugh-a-minute comedy AIRPLANE brought to us by the demented minds of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker. If you haven't seen this flick in awhile - or if you have NEVER seen it - check it out, you'll be glad you did.Parodying Disaster Movies that were all the rage in the 1970's, AIRPLANE tells the tale of an airliner who's flight crew is incapacitated by food poisoning and it is up to a Stewardess and her on again/off again former fighter pilot - fighting PTSD - boyfriend to land the plane and save the passengers.And...along the way we have a hodgepodge of quirky, weird characters that are not afraid to sling a joke in a deadpan style. It is an unusual film to watch.And...make sure you put your phone down and actually WATCH this film, for there is quite a bit of visual humor that you need to be paying attention to to catch it...humor such as...Kramer: Steve, I want every light you can get poured onto that field.Steve: Bein' done right now.(On the runway, a truck dumps a full load of lamps onto the ground)Also...the verbal humor needs to be paid attention to...Doctor: What was it we had for dinner tonight?Elaine: Well, we had a choice of steak or fish.Doctor: Yes, yes, I remember, I had lasagna.All of this delivered with a deadpan wink in the eye by such dramatic 1960's and '70's TV stalwarts as Leslie Nielsen, Lloyd Bridges and Robert Stack. Add to that the wholesome cuteness of leads Robert Hayes and Julie Hagerty with fun cameos by the likes of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Mrs. Cleaver herself, Barbara Billingsly (""Excuse me stewardess, I speak jive) and a fun time was had by all.Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't single out the craziness of the character Johnny (Stephen Stucker). He flits in and out of this film (in some cases quite literally) throwing non-sequiturs at the screen that had me laughing out loud on my umpteenth viewing of this film. Non-sequiturs like...Steve: Johnny, what can you make out of this?(Hands him the weather briefing)Johnny: This? Why, I can make a hat or a brooch or a pterodactyl...
This film gave myself and my family some much need yuks - even my ""eye rolling"" 19 year old College Freshman was heard guffawing out loud from time to time.So...check out AIRPLANE - you'll be glad you did.Letter Grade:: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)Oh...and one other thing...Kramer: Do you know what it's like to fall in the mud and get kicked... in the head... with an iron boot?

Suddenly, when some of the crew members start to fall ill from food poisoning, Ted must land the plane safely.To be honest, I was only born in the 1990s, but I did come across this film in my teenage years. After watching the whole thing, it got me interested because as far as comedy movies go, this is one of the best ones yet. Not only does the story do a great job at satirizing the disaster movie genre, it succeeds in delivering some surreal and fast-paced slapstick comedy that remains timeless to those who have seen the film. The acting is very good. Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty shine in their chemistry as Ted Strike and Elaine Dickinson while everyone else, including the late Leslie Nielsen, who provides the best lines in the entire film, deliver the surreal, bizarre and yet hilarious comedy very well.The pacing never has a dull moment, the directing and cinematography is very good, and the music score from the late Elmer Bernstein is perfect.Overall, Airplane! still remains to this day one of the best spoof movies of the 1980s and after 40 years, it still holds up.

Chock full of sights and gags, some of which could be missed on first viewing, it's no wonder it has stood the test of time. Of course, if this film was made and shown today, there'd be a long line of protestors outside the theatres. Some would say it's racist (jive talk), anti-Semitic (pamphlet of Famous Jewish Sports Legends), pro-pedophilia (Capt. Clarence), anti-religious (airport Buddhist monks), misappropriation of race (again, airport monks being white as opposed to Asian), ageist (elderly passenger hanging herself), etc. And that's too bad because it was all done in innocent fun.When I first saw this back in 1980, I was 18-years-old and thought it was funny, so much so that I've since used quite a lot of the verbal gags (misplaced modifiers) in my own speech and writing (""You got a telegram from headquarters today."" ""I did? What is it?"" ""Well, it's a big building where generals meet, but that's not important."", and so on.

Neilsen revealed an unexpected genius for straight-faced line delivery of absurd bon-mots, Stack is hilarious in that scene where he beats up all the airport charity collectors and Bridges...well I just can't think of him in this movie without laughing.I just can't mention enough about how wonderful some of the jokes are in this: the hysterical woman getting slapped, the camera pulling back to reveal a queue for of people toting weapons, the automatic pilot, the brilliant gag with the taxi driver, Robert Hayes' ""drinking problem"", these beautifully played sight-gags (and many more) are just superb. I think Empire film magazine once counted around 365 jokes in its 90 minute or so running time, so do the math.

138,Isaac5855,One of the top five funniest movies EVER!,9,17 January 2007,"AIRPLANE! was the 1980 comedic spoof of Airport movies in general and the classic ZERO HOUR in particular, in which an ex-war pilot (Robert Hays, in a star-making performance), who hasn't been able to get behind the wheel of a plane since the war,ends up, through a bizarre set of circumstances, forced to land an airliner full of passengers suffering from food poisoning. This on-target comic spoof spawned many imitations and clones, but this is the granddaddy of them all. The gags come at a lightning fast pace so that if one gag doesn't amuse as much as you think, there's another one not far behind. The movie is smartly written with a great deal of attention to the set-up of a joke as well as the actual payoff. Hays gets great support from Julie Hagerty, as the ex-girlfriend and head stewardess, Peter Graves as the pilot with a thing for young boys, Leslie Nielsen as a stone-faced doctor (possibly an inspiration for his Frank Drebin character), Kareem Abduhl Jabaar as the co-pilot who has an identity crisis, Lloyd Bridges as a grounds control pilot with an addiction or two, and Lorna Patterson as another stewardess.

142,movieguy1021,Airplane!: 10/10,10,19 October 2002,"For me, Airplane! is one of those movies which you have never heard of until once, and then you see it and it's hilarious. And then you can't stop thinking about it and you see it cop up more places.Robert Hays plays Ted Striker, a man who has never left his love for Elaine Dickenson (Julie Hagerty). A former pilot, he lost his entire squadron in Macho Grande, and hasn't been near a plane since. So, of course, Elaine is a flight attendant. Ted buys a ticket onto that flight (smoking, of course), and lots of kooky things happen, including food poisoning.Directors Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and David Zucker (ZAZ) make many plays on words to make us laugh, such as here between diologue from Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen) to Elaine: ""We need to get these people to a hospital"" ""A hospital? What is it?"" ""A big building with patients. But that's not important right now."" Filled with those kind of jokes, Airplane! cracks you up for 80 minutes.Hagerty's bubbly personality (Ellen Greene from Little Shop of Horrors, anyone?) and Hays' serious-but-maybe-not-so-serious type makes the characters fun to be around. Lloyd Bridges plays an Air Traffic Controller with every vice possible; Neilsen plays a doctor who happens to be on the flight. Robert Stack is another airport guy, and Peter Graves is the pilot of the plane. Ensamble comedy? No. Many characters aren't in most scenes, just there for comic relief, so to speak. As in a couple other movies, the actors don't think they're in a comedy.And, of course, how could I write a review of Airplane! without mentioning Otto, the auto-pilot, who may or may not have ulterior motions with Elaine. Laughing is what ZAZ want us to do, and laugh is what we do. I've seen this lots of times and I still crack up. Even though I've used lots of words, it can be summed up in one: hilarious.My rating: 10/10Rated PG for language, comic violence, and nudity.",Airplane!
143,Min111,It's a sick ride,8,13 August 2020,"It's one of the best comedy movies I've ever seen. It's probably the best comedy movie to have come out from the eighties. It's one of these eighties movies. I can't believe how good the movie was. It was breathtaking! That's how you would describe it. I like Airplane! The star of the movie was the amazing guy named Ted Striker. I just like how he takes control of the plane with barely any flying experience. Hope rests on his shoulders for the people on board. He takes control of the plane because the crew and passengers become sick due to food poisoning. His task is to guide the plane safely. Can he do it? You need to see it to find out. If there's any good news, it's that Ted Striker is a ""former"" pilot. He never landed a plane of that size ever. It's a challenge. I don't understand though why the title has an exclamation mark at the end. It would be better without it. My favourite character in the movie had to be that doctor named Dr Rumack. He was so calm. He didn't panic at all. There was a chance the plane would crash, yet he still didn't panic. I find that amazing. He was a nice character. He was the one leading the charge after the pilots get sick. He was also the one that discovered what caused everyone to fall sick - it was fish. Let's not forget another character named Elaine Dickinson who is one of the crew members - a flight attendant. I liked her very much. She is Ted Striker's love interest. She's attractive. The most interesting character was the guy that played one of the pilots. His name is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He's famous. He's a former basketball player. I can't believe how tall he is. He's over seven feet. I liked the scene at the cockpit where the boy tells him that he's in fact Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The boy was right. The character Kareem played denied the fact. I found that hilarious. It's a good movie. It's an interesting ride. There was also a sequel called Airplane II.

A movie like The Jerk still holds up in 2014 because it doesn't rely on the pop culture of its time.That said, it's still very watchable and its screen time flies rapidly. You wish more movies had the genius idea of casting serious actors and playing off of their stoic style for laughs. Leslie Nielsen's career took off after playing Dr. Rumack and he had a successful back-nine when it came to acting. Julie Hagerty (in her debut) may come off as somewhat mousy and spaced-out as Elaine but she could also be a knockout as seen in the club scene.The movie is worth seeing for those classic exchanges and some funny spoofs but I just feel it doesn't have that punch that it once had after seeing it again recently.",Airplane!

There's a plane, something happens to it, and they need to bring it down without killing everybody on board. But of course this is played for laughs. And trust me, it's full of them.ZAZ, or Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker as they were known, came to light years ago when they made the ""Kentucky Fried Movie"". It was a loose collection of skits as if seen from somebody flipping the channel on light night TV. But this time they dreamed bigger and wanted to make a feature length movie with an actual plot. And this is what we got.It's also where Leslie Nielsen got his start as a ""comic"" actor. He played it deadpan which went on to become his shtick especially in the later ""Naked Gun"" movies.The jokes come at you fast and furious, sometimes they're visual gags, sometimes clever word play and sometimes it's just incredibly silly.

This is my kind of movie comedy, which features one silly joke after another. And the best thing about it is that the jokes rarely stop. The Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker team are a master at this method, and they would display the exact same method with ""The Naked Gun"" films, which is the funniest movie comedy series ever. (""Airplane II: The Sequel"" wasn't as funny as this one and that was no surprise because Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker had nothing to do with that one.) A lot of people have said that the recent box office smash ""There's Something About Mary"" is the funniest movie ever made. No way! That movie is nowhere near as funny as ""Airplane!"" The jokes don't come flying out at 100 m.p.h. in that film as they do in this film (and in ""The Naked Gun"" films). All the actors in the movie (from Robert Stack to Leslie Nielsen to the late Lloyd Bridges) get big laughs. And what a comic performance by then L.A. Lakers great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar! This is a comedy not to be missed. **** (out of four)",Airplane!
154,dfle3,"A 3-D, 360 degree comedy classic",10,3 June 2008,"This would have to be the funniest movie of all time, in my estimation. In Australia, this movie is known as ""Flying high"" and was a parody of a spate of aeroplane related disaster movies (as in the sequence of ""Airport"" movies).Why is this movie so funny? Well, it is four-dimensional comedy. You will only get a fraction of the jokes in this movie, as they come thick and fast from every direction-in the foreground, middle-ground, background, in the audio and the credits. Flying High could be the movie that started end credits featuring jokes.Here's the plot in a nut-shell: a former US Air Force fighter pilot, trying to re-establish a relationship with his ex-girlfriend, who is a stewardess on a commercial passenger aeroplane, takes a flight with her which goes from bad to worse. The pilot and co-pilot get sick and the ex fighter pilot who is afraid of flying has too...(I'm not giving away too much here, but that's enough plot).Not sure if this is the first movie by the creators, but they have had subsequent success with this kind of absurd comedy, in movies like The Naked Gun. Perhaps The Kentucky Fried Movie was their first such comedy. All these movies are worth watching, as is the other obscure movie, Top Secret, which has some brilliantly surreal humour.Anyway, if you are a rather literal-minded person, you may not enjoy this movie too much...you'll complain about planes not really being like that, or professional people not really acting like that.This movie is heightened reality. The visual gags are funny & the dialogue is funny too...I still remember the bizarre and somewhat disturbing ex-change between the pilot and a small boy, named Jimmy, invited to view the cock-pit (as children often are in movies)-Pilot: ""Jimmy, have you ever seen a grown man naked?"". Hmmmm.Honestly, this is a movie that rewards multiple viewings, to absorb all the jokes you missed the first time around. And, like I say, don't forget to scan the end-credits for more comedy gold.",Airplane!

I could go into detail, but why read a description when you should go out and rent it, or even buy the movie!The mere fact that Barbara Billingsly speaks jive is worth the price of admission!",Airplane!
157,willcundallreview,One of the funniest!,9,5 October 2015,"Is it Silly? , Check, is it really weird? , Check, is it funny? , Double check. Airplane! Is one the funniest films, it just has to be because not only is it timed to perfection but it also just picks the very best things to make you laugh too. You might beforehand and after viewing see this as a silly little movie that is really dumb, but that is the whole point, the movie doesn't make any sense and half of the fun in this is spotting the little jokes played out in nearly every character on the plane. The whole plot plays out like the old disaster movies such as ""Zero Hour!"" and ""Airport 1975"" and really parodies them well with clichés in huge abundance all-round. We see ex-fighter pilot Ted Striker haunted by his past flying in the US air force as he basically buys a ticket on the flight to chase his love Elaine (Julie Hagerty). The flight becomes a farce though as food poisoning causes problems, and it may be up to Striker to help land the plane, if he can that is with all the ridiculous amount of sweat dripping down his face. Of course the plot is not as serious at all as it sounds and to be fair it's absolutely crazy, there is two guys talking ""Jive"", a girl who needs a transplant, a pilot who takes a keen liking to children and another pilot who's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The whole cast are like some kind of perfect casting, you just can't imagine many others replacing them and it just plays out like some kind of insane pantomime thousands of feet in the air. If there is someone who really stands out it is Leslie Nielsen as Dr. Rumack who is the definition of that timed to perfection jokes part I said about, the guys behind this picked him well and they would pick him again for the ""Naked Gun"" movies and the TV show they also made. Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker direct and write this as a group and oh what a job they do, they make this movie that on the cover may look not that good but within is like a comedy master class. I think they actually tried hard to create the jokes I mean they are smart and well thought up, they poke fun at people and at other movies too and they create a lovely mess of a movie that is really well, lovable. If I have ever seen slapstick comedy done this well then it's it probably not since the golden days of the silent movie, except this movie also has jokes by people talking too which makes this even better. If you're looking for good old fun in under 90 minutes this is your treat because not only does it get you laughing but also never drags, it gets it all out what it wants to say and I felt the guys behind it would have ruined this if it would been too long. I can see some not liking it because as I previously said it's silly, some might consider themselves too ""high-brow"" but in fairness no one can deny this is smart and well thought up, it's the kind of comedy I think everyone can enjoy not just certain ages etc. So overall is it the greatest comedy ever? ,well no or maybe who really knows, but one thing is for sure this has to be up there in the lists that people make when they compile the greatest comedies. On that previous point this in my opinion should be considered one the greatest, not only does it boast laughs but they are also memorable and the line ""And stop calling me Shirley"" is one of the most famous in comedy cinema history.",Airplane!

It takes highbrow intellects to craft elite lowbrow humor, and this brilliant spoof delivers it in an unrelenting downpour. To this day, ""Airplane"" flies in the rarefied air of The American Film Institute's Top 10 Comedies, and has spawned modern day descendants from the smartly vulgar ""Sausage Party (2016)"" to recent and raunchy record label parody ""Stadium Anthems (2018).""This is a gag-a-thon of the first order, and no stone is unturned: Sexual, racial, and religious humor punch through gleefully and without apology as a commercial airline's two pilots (Peter Graves and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) get food poisoning mid-flight. Ex-military pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) is the lone remaining flyer aboard, but he's only handled single-engine planes, and suffers mightily from PTSD. Back at the tower, lead air traffic controller Steve McKrosky (a sublime Lloyd Bridges) is drinking, sniffing glue, and blitzing on amphetamines. Only the airline's Chief Flight Instructor Rex Kramer (a deadpan Robert Stack) can talk Striker through a safe landing. ""Steve,"" Kramer says to McKrosky, ""I want every light you have poured onto that field."" On cue, a dump truck deposits hundreds of household lamps on the runway -- that's the kind of inspired genius we're dealing with here.With its torrential onslaught of the purely ludicrous, ""Airplane!"" is one of the best and most enduring comedies ever. - (Was this review of use to you?

Spoofing the disaster films of the 1970's was genius and bringing in the pure slapstick approach of literal comedy also gets my nod. The satire along the way is also poignant, but this feels so dated, and has been aped ad-nausea to the point that rude belching is acceptable on the Disney Channel, and Leslie Neilson followed this up with a slow dearth of un-repentful lunacy takes this further down. Let's not forget that ""Kentucky Movie"" was the genesis of the ""artform"" which seems left artful today. Don't get me wrong, I'll still laugh out loud at some scenes, but acknowledge the potty humor doesn't tickle my funny bone at 52. This was a fine effort that is simply out of date with what I really go for as a reaching adult. The minute the movie is over, so is the experience.",Airplane!
163,steiner-sam,A comedic parody of 1970s popular culture,7,10 July 2021,"Set in the 1970s Los Angeles and Chicago (and the flight path in between), it is a comic parody of 1970s popular culture, especially the airport disaster movies that began in 1970.The two characters present throughout the movie are Ted Striker (Robert Hays) and Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty). Ted was a former Air Force pilot and squadron leader whose decision resulted in the loss of life. Consequently, he has been unable to fly since. Elaine is a flight attendant who has been in a relationship with Ted but has just broken up with him as she's leaving for a flight to Chicago. He follows her onto the plane to try to attempt reconciliation.Several flashbacks throughout give us some background to Ted and Elaine's relationship. What makes the humor work is the use of actors better known for their straight dramatic or action roles. These include Peter Graves (Mission Impossible) as the senior pilot, Lloyd Bridges as the airport manager, Robert Stack as Ted Striker's former commanding officer, and Kareen Abdul-Jabbar as the co-pilot. Leslie Nielsen launched his comedic career by playing an officious doctor on board the plane whose deadpan dialog increased the absurdity of every situation. Many lines by all the actors are delivered straight in totally incongruous situations.The crisis occurs when everyone on board who ate the fish-option dinner gets violently ill, including all the flight crew. How then to land the plane. Ted is called to be the hero.This film uses a Mad magazine-style of humor, thus takes a certain mood to watch. I burst out laughing numerous times.",Airplane!

Here's my thoughts.......""Flying High"" is one of the original great comedies by the Zucker/Abraham combination. Essentially it's a spoof of airplane movies, with some of the great one liners of all times. The story begins with Ted (Robert hays) chasing down airline stewardess Elaine (Julie Hagerty) as she's about to leave on a flight. Ted decides to jump on the plane and convince Elaine to try to rebuild their relationship. Before long things start going horribly wrong on the flight when a stack of people, including pilots, get sick from the fish. Soon the crew are looking for a pilot to land the plane and turn to Ted, an ex-army pilot still recovering from the horrors of war.An outstanding comedic cast including Leslie Nielsen, Peter Graves, Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack and even Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

Or a severely asthmatic child (that little girl from the ""Loveboat"" crew) going into spasms because her medical needs are ignored in the confusion.All of these and more great gags make this film a delight to watch from the moment passengers are told to put on their seat belts for take-off. ""Airplane"", designed as a spoof of the ""Airport"" dramas of the 70s, is a welcome breath of fresh air (or laughing gas?). The 70s were the era of disaster films. Ushered in by Airport, the trend continued with The Posseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno, Earthquake, and more Airport installments in between breaks. It was time to forget the horrors and bring audiences back for some good laughs. ""Airplane"" definitely delivered! Not only did we get a terrific spoof of disaster films, but eventually more spoofs of the ""serious"" films came in the form of ""The Naked Gun Trilogy"", and anything Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, et al could dish together.

(1980), very few comedy films can make me laugh within the first five minutes. The first time I watched ""Airplane!"", I found myself laughing within less than 30 seconds. Immediately, I realized what kind of movie I was in for and I was hooked. This is what I always say: if a movie doesn't gain your interest within the first ten minutes, then it isn't worth watching. You only get one chance to make a first impression. ""Airplane!"" is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the top 10 greatest comedy films I have ever seen in my life. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect special effects, perfect sets/locations and a perfect soundtrack. The story is very clever, and just like all of my other top 10 comedy films, has everything I look for in a comedy, and then some! It's also a disaster movie, in a way, because the subject is: most of the passengers get sick from bad fish, along with both pilots, who are then unable to fly and land the plane. The only hope is a passenger, played by Robert Hays, who is a man with limited flying experience and has a fear of planes! What a situation, right? Along with brilliant storytelling, this movie has a plethora of jokes and fast-paced humor from beginning to end. All of the jokes and gags hit bullseye, and the movie leaves you invested, excited and also laughing all the way through. As far as the acting goes, all of the actors and actresses give it their all and put on stellar performances. The cast is insane! Robert Hays, Julie Hagerty, Leslie Nielsen, Peter Graves, Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jonathan Banks, and more! They all put on flawless performances, with the exception of one, Julie Hagerty. Now just hear me out, her performance doesn't hurt the movie, or any of the other acting performances of the other actors and actresses. But, her voice gets slightly annoying at times, and she has kind of that deer in a headlight expression throughout most of the movie. She almost sounds like an airhead when she speaks in this movie, or she's high on drugs. But, maybe that's just me, I suppose. Nothing wrong with her performance, she still does get the job done at the end of the day. Julie's performance is not bad, by any means, I'm just up in the air about it. The special effects are perfect, and have aged well. The sets/locations are fantastic, and they set the tone and story perfectly. Finally, the soundtrack is outstanding, it really helps tie the film together and brings it to life. Elmer Bernstein has certainly put together a phenomenal score, and just like the movie, it is truly memorable. ""Airplane!"" is a comedic marvel, and it is definitely a timeless film that is just as funny, if not funnier, today as it was back then. Just like fine wine, even though I don't drink, never have, never will, I'm just trying to make a reference here. This movie just gets better and better with age, and is without a shadow of a doubt, one of my top 10 favorite comedy films of all-time. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 stars. If you have not seen ""Airplane!"" yet, what are you waiting for? Go watch it now, you won't regret it! Now let's end this review with a moment of silence for the late, but great, Leslie Nielsen, Peter Graves, Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack and Stephen Stucker. Thank you all for providing great entertainment and making the world of cinema that much better. May you all rest in peace. If you're looking for a perfect comedy movie, yet at the same time, a disaster movie then this is the film for you.

4. The score helps to increase the general hilarity, whilst also cementing the tenseness of certain scenes.
5. The costume design, though nothing special, gets the job done and personifies the characters well.
6. Despite the plot having little substance, the pace never drags in order to fill out time.Cons:
1. The goofy sound effects are unnecessary and are more annoying than humourous.
2. Some of the jokes try way too hard, thus they end up falling flat.
3. The plot clearly comes second to the gags which makes it difficult to be fully invested in the story and the characters.",Airplane!

Funniest film ever.,10,25 November 2001,"Not just the funniest film ever, apart from the Great Escape & Magnificent 7 it is the best film ever.It so much harder for a film to have you in hysterics than a TV show, as they're normally 3 times as long, but Airplane manages it.This & the sequel are the only films where you actually hurt watching it as you laugh so much, infact you spend most of the time still laughing at the previous gag when a new one comes.You are so lucky if you've never seen this, it is brilliant. Watch it any time, day, night, whenever. I've met one or two people amongst thousands who don't find slapstick like this funny at all. I really feel sorry for them, even worry about them. I'm not sure what the reason is, but they're obviously lacking something.",Airplane!
183,tnrcooper,Brilliant stuff,10,14 April 2008,"I came of age when the Naked Gun films came out and Leslie Nielsen was a comic hero of mine. No one could deliver a line quite that deadpan and quite that silly as him. I was a little too young to have seen Airplane when it first came out and somehow I only got to seeing it a couple weeks ago. Having read a lot of the comments here (and fully expecting to enjoy it as much as I did), I know that the wealth of references to modern culture, to entertainment, to life in America at the time, was numerous. Having read many of the reviews (and not that I needed much encouragement-I had planned to watch it again some time soon) I will have to go back and see it again some time soon. I do remember the welter of disaster movies which came out, even after this film, and certainly it was ripe for parody. If you loved Naked Gun, just remember, without this film, Naked Gun would not exist.",Airplane!
184,herbqedi,Hit-and-Miss Slapstick Farce,6,10 July 2004,"This is a superior MAD Magazine spoof of Airport-type movies brought live to the big screen.  The Zucker Brothers are pun-a-holics and the runaway success of this farce spawned a 20-year career for them of making such farces for movies and TV.  Leslie Nielsen, who is terrific here, spawned his second career with his turn here and Lloyd Bridges adds some great deadpan also.Your enjoyment will tend entirely for your taste for such things.  If you enjoy The Naked Gun or most Steve Martin movies, then you are in for a treat.  Few have as global a foundation for farce as the Zuckers, so most people will not get at least 20% of the take-offs and landings.  Beyond that, a recent viewing left me a bit disappointed since a number of the jokes and reference points have not aged particularly well.  And, never has there been a screwball farce less well served by its lead comedienne than the ever-slight Julie Hagerty's doe-eyed stewardess who lacks even a hint of comedic timing.  Fortunately, Robert Hays handles the lead well and the old vets (also including Robert Stack and a marvelous bit by Barbara Billingsley) give terrific support.  Add an unforgettable big-screen debut by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and a movie-stealing performance by an inflatable doll, and there are enough belly laughs and giggles for most of us to forgive its many clinkers.",Airplane!
185,antagonist117,"As a broad comedy, ""Airplane!"" delivers laughs in a lot of ways",8,23 February 2014,"""Airplane!"" finds success with broad comedy. In many respects it is a parody of something particular, the disaster movies that were popular at the box office throughout the 1970s, especially 1970's ""Airport."" But it also grabs from a much larger bag of contemporary references: the movie opens with the ""Jaws"" theme, progresses to a ""Saturday Night Fever"" parody, and casts Kareem Abdul-Jabbar specifically to make jokes about his basketball career. Abdul- Jabbar's comedic timing is a little on the slow side, but it makes no difference because the joke is that he's playing himself playing someone else. ""Airplane!"" is still funny because of the kind of comedy it uses. When it goes for topical humor, it goes so big—the biggest blockbusters, the biggest athletes, the biggest politicians—that almost everyone is in on the jokes without explanation, even decades later. A few lines might send younger viewers to Wikipedia, but those lines are the exception rather than the rule. Mostly the movie eschews referential comedy in favor of basic puns and gags. As with all comedy bits, some work (the send-ups of epic movie speeches are all well-delivered), some get old (the gay jokes haven't aged great), and a lot just depends on taste (from what I understand, some people don't like puns!) Nothing pleases all of the people all of the time, but with wordplay, surrealism, and slapstick in its arsenal, ""Airplane!"" probably pleases all of the people some of the time. For a broad comedy that's the idea.",Airplane!

187,fjhuerta-2,Best of the genre,9,14 March 2001,"I love this film. I absolutely love it. It is one of those comedies where slapstick jokes are fun but not dumb, where raunchy humour exists but is not thrown in your face, where sex is implied or shown on the screen for less than half a second, and where the whole thing is so seriously treated (it is, after all, a disaster what we are watching) you cannot help thinking that this is one of those precious few comedies done right.Case in point: lets take a dumb comedy of our times: ""Big Momma's House"". Every joke in that movie deal with fat, more fat, fat women, fat farting women, sex, more sex, implied sex, dirty one liners, more dirty one liners, vulgarities and obscenities. Same as with Nutty Professor I and II. Or take ""Liar, liar"". Funny, but it wears off fast simply because it is as dumb as it can be while trying to convey a ""message"". Yack.""Airplane!"" might be a silly comedy, but it is never dumb. It works on many levels; the word plays are great and they just keep coming, one after the other. Vulgarities are kept to a minimum (as drug usage). People are abused, but not by the sake of it, but because (at one point or another) they truly deserve it. Lead characters are not one-dimensional; using flashbacks the story of each of them is told, so by the middle of the movie you develop some sense of affection for them.And Leslie Nielsen... what can I say about him. He made the movie. He gave the performance of his lifetime. He is so funny while being dead serious. He doesn't resort to making an idiot out of himself; he acts dignified and the circumstances make an idiout out of him. So refreshing.Few comedies are as well rounded as this one.",Airplane!
188,pkzeewiz,I have always appreciated this movie,5,22 May 2010,"This movie is basically a remake of Zero hours, but it is more commonly thought of as a parody of the successful AIRPORT films from the 70's. Basically while on a plane ride many of the passengers get sick after eating bad fish and that included the pilots. A guy on board trying to win back his lover is a military pilot but he had lots of problems that haunt him horribly and he is scared to even be on planes, yet he goes on chasing his girl. Now he is asked to fly the plane and he has to step up to the plate and face his fears. --That sounds like it could be serious, but believe me its one big wacky airplane ride.This movie has always been one that has made me laugh. I have watched those AIRPORT movies a few times and so many things about them are just too serious and too cheesy, and AIRPLANE holds no punches in making fun of them..my favorite of course is the sick girl parody.. Linda Blair plays a sick child in AIRPORT '75 and she is sung to by Helen Reddy who is a nun and plays guitar, and in here a kid is sung to and its just a hilarious spoof that cracks me up.This movie has so many one liners and speeches and puns and ad-libbed jokes and it's one of the best films out there to get quotes from. It parodies several movies including Saturday Night Fever with the ""staying alive"" number and also Jaws and so much more..Another great joke is the Autopilot being an inflatable pilot.This movie has some of the best actors too. Robert Hayes and Julie Haggarty are the leads, but thats nothing compared to the unexpected roles here.. 4 major players here are Lloyd Bridges, Leslie Nelson, Robert Stack and Peter Graves. Those 4 actors are serious actors who had never done comedy before, It's hard to believe with some of these guys that they were doing comedy for the first time because they were absolutely hilarious. Leslie Nelson is like the king of parody movies, but this was his first. All did such great jobs, so many great actors here...Kareem Abdul Jabar, James Hong, Ethel Merman, and even Jimmie Walker in a cameo, he actually played a year before in the fourth and final AIRPORT movie.The writing/directing team of The Zucker bros. and Jim Abrahams was a dandy one, and Elmer Bernsteins music is pretty good too, hes a great composer.I have always appreciated this film and had high respect for it, but it does have some boring parts to it, the Zuckers are often equally hit AND miss with their jokes and here is a good example of balance. The flashbacks were rather boring, although they lead to great parodies most time, but still left a lot to be desired.5/10 stars just because its a childhood favorite with some great actors and some great quotes and jokes.",Airplane!

What Story! Don't worry about the story, just sit back, chill out, unwind and let the Airplane team fill you with delight & laughter.I suppose my favourite gag would be Ted Striker (a fresh looking Robert Hayes and a man who's scared of flying), talking to the plane's medical man, Dr Rumack (the ever-excellent Leslie Nielson):-Ted Striker: ""Surely you can't be serious."" Dr. Rumack: ""I am serious, and don't call me Shirley""I had to switch off the video after that because I was in stiches of laughter and it wouldn't die away for hours.Its unfornunate but you don't get to see this kind of movie anymore, and if you do its generally sanitised or toned down to keep everyone happy.It looks terribly dated now but it doesn't matter cus you'll still burst out laughing afterwards.***/*****",Airplane!

194,kyle-cruse,Very funny,8,26 August 2008,"""Airplane!"" proved to be a very funny, enjoyable, and memorable film. Honestly, I wouldn't have thought the concept of a flight crew getting food poisoning and having a former pilot now afraid to fly take over for them. Nevertheless, I found plenty to laugh at in this film. For me, the most memorable characters were Leslie Neilsen, as the monotone doctor on the plane, and Lloyd Bridges, as the air-traffic controller. Neilsen, of course, gets to deliver his well-known ""Don't call me Shirley!"" in this film. Several of my personal favorites from Lloyd Bridges (the lines starting with ""Picked the wrong week to quit smoking"") also come from this movie. For me, it's the fact that this film throws in one joke after another that makes it so continuously funny. From the man dressed as a train conductor at the airport to the inflatable auto-pilot, ""Airplane!"" provides so much to laugh at. Once in a while, I found myself groaning at the jokes that were either too predictable or too over-the-top and badly delivered to be funny. The laughs far outweigh the bad jokes, however. Despite the amount of somewhat irreverent humor found in the film, I found myself laughing many times, and the film gets even funnier as I reflect on the gags in my mind.*** out of ****",Airplane!
195,huggibear,I don't quite fully understand all the hype on this film! Solid 6 Stars from me!,6,11 August 2017,"Minor spoilers included: So, it's 2017 and I'm just watching this movie. Maybe the humor from the 80's was better experienced then and could be more appreciated then as opposed to now, but I didn't find this movie all that hilarious. I found it silly and more like slapstick humor. It was alright. I liked the plot though. The synopsis on the top of this website page is quite vague saying that the man is afraid to fly. It's only because of his past military experience and his flashback of them that he is not comfortable with flying. Sometimes tragedy and life experiences cause us to fear. But he was brave enough to get on the flight as his intention was to work out the relationship he had with his girl, who just happened to be a flight attendant. So he proceeded to buy a ticket and board the same plane so he could be with her. She was going to dump him. To me, this was a sweet way to work out the kinks in their relationship that was going 'who knows where'. Did it work? Did he become 'THE' hero and/or 'HER' hero? That's for the viewer, you, to decide if you choose to watch it. It's decent, but if you want laughter, watch 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' as a throwback comedy that's got all kinds of emotions for ya. It's a very funny and touching movie with Steve Martin and John Candy. Either way, you choose!",Airplane!
196,smellthecult-com-1,Disaster movie parody.,8,23 September 2009,"The original, and probably the best. Two years before Nielsen took on the role of Frank Drebin in the extraordinary Police Squad series came Airplane!, a romp through all that is corny about movies. Taking the basic premise of a disaster movie (which were very popular in the 70's) this plays it all for laughs, throwing a gag every few seconds at the audience and, inevitably, some have to hit the mark. True, it's not infallible - the gay guy in mission control is hugely irritating - but there are more hits than misses. Parodying pretty much every movie cliché with some style, this has stood the test of time particularly well. My favourite part is when Kramer is making his way to the control tower and has to fight his way through people asking him to sign up for various organisations. The violence steadily increases until he is into full on chop-socky mode. Highly entertaining.",Airplane!
197,hfan77,A Very Funny Spoof,9,7 December 2008,"I remember seeing Airplane! is the early 80s and to me, it was a very funny movie. It set the standard for the Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker style of humor, which originated in their first film Kentucky Fried Movie, consisting of plenty of word play, non sequitors and many sight gags that would later develop in Police Squad! and the Naked Gun movies.The cast was outstanding with Robert Hays as the acting pilot, thrust into action when the regular pilot took ill, Julie Hagerty as his ex, Lloyd Bridges as the neurotic air traffic controller who picked the wrong day to quit various substances and NBA great Kareem Abdul Jabbar. A hilarious cameo came from Barbara Billingsley (better known as June Cleaver) as the Jive Lady. Her sound bite from the movie can frequently be heard on the Sirius XM 70s Channel. And let's not forget Otto, the Automatic Pilot, although he never said anything, he was a great sight gag. And finally, a regular member of the ZAZ stable Leslie Nielsen who quoted the famous line ""Thanks. And don't call me Shirley."" If you have never seen Airplane! or plan to see any of The Naked Gun movies, I highly recommend renting it since you'll enjoy seeing how the ZAZ comedic style has developed.",Airplane!

I've got to concentrate... concentrate... concentrate... Hello?... hello... hello... Echo... echo... echo... Pinch hitting for Pedro Borbon... Manny Mota... Mota... Mota..."" That pretty much sums up the seriousness of Airplane!, the lampoon of the 1970s Airport movies, and pretty much every other disaster movie pumped out by Hollywood. The same guys who pieced together the Naked Gun movies write and direct this silly movie. Most of the jokes need to be seen to be properly experienced, the first rate actors are what brings the laughs. Robert Stack plays it straight, over-the-top straight, as a problem solver for the airline who happens to wear 2 pairs of sunglasses at all times. Stack's comedic timing and deadpan delivery bring out some of the biggest laughs of the film. Lloyd Bridges is the over-worked, over-stressed traffic controller who has picked the wrong week to stop drinking, smoking, and sniffing glue. And Leslie Neilson plays a doctor who has an acute sense for the obvious, surely one who could save the passengers and airline crew if they land safely, just don't call him Shirley.

A friend asked me to go and I agreed, not expecting much.As the movie progressed, it was clear that it was a winner, to my surprise. Leslie Nielsen has been mining the same kind of humor for years now with varying degrees of success in the Naked Gun series and elsewhere, Peter Graves was surprisingly effective as the pederastic pilot and the late Robert Stack and Lloyd Bridges were also excellent comedians. Various cameos such as Ethel Merman as ""Lt. Hurwitz"" add to the fun and I loved the battling girl scouts.I want to mention that, at the preview, the gag with the multiple sunglasses (Bridges?) was quite drawn out and I think funnier than the subsequent ""truncated"" version we have now.A classic and still the funniest of them all.",Airplane!

The introduction of Dr Rumack ranks right up there with the reveal of Obi Wan Kenobi in episode IV. The film also features the greatest ever look to camera there has ever been in any film. Add to that the immortal Shirley sequence and the automatic pilot and you have one of the greatest comedies of all time.For those people who have never seen this film before this is one film that won't be a waste of an hour and a half.

Fifty percent more gags!'"" And in this film, that is definitely true. There are enough jokes in this movie to fill at least four films.
Nevertheless, the plot is not completely neglected: even with all the zaniness, there is still a firm plot. Maybe it's because the plot was loosely based off of ""Flight Into Danger.""

Really top notch comedy.However to me, that was all it was. A funny film. The fact that it tries to be too many things makes it too little of each thing. Like a jack of all trades, master of none. Also, while I believe that this plot had a lot of potential, the fact that it tries so hard, really so hard to be funny, that the execution itself just looks kind of bad.So, I'll say this.

Airplane!, not to be confused with Airplane II, is about the passengers and crew of a flight bound from Los Angeles to Chicago. Robert Hays, of the television series Angie, is Ted Striker, a disillusioned war veteran who's on the flight. When the pilot and copilot become sick due to food poisoning, the flight attendant asks if there's a pilot on board. At first, Ted denies that he's a pilot, and says that he doesn't want to do it.

If you liked Airplane, you might want to see:Horse FeathersDuck SoupBlazing SaddlesMonty Python & the Holy GrailPity that there are really all too few. The true mark of a proper gag-fest is that it NEVER takes itself seriously. If there's a poignant moment, or a scene where a character ""grows"", or anything like that, it can still be a great comedy, but it's not a true gag-fest. For the most part, all of the early Marx Brothers' films qualify (Coconuts, Animal Crackers, Monkey Business, as well as the two cited above). Kentucky Fried Movie is in there. There were some later Airplane-like movies that were good but not as memorable, like Hot Shots. I'm probably overlooking something good. Oh well, that's easily more than 10 lines now.

207,jbartelone,One of The Great Comedy Movies of Any Era!,9,22 May 2008,"Airplane! is a spoof of many modern big-budget disaster films from the 1970's, specifically Airport 75, which it imitates, in a hysterical way. In a previous review, I commented that you must see Airplane! to appreciate the humor of Airport 75. But equally important, Airplane! stands the test of time, flying on very humorous gags, some slapstick, and some clever subtleties as well. This is a movie that must be seen more than once to catch all the jokes. Some of them fall flat, but most of them are laugh-out loud funny.The story involves a neurotic pilot who was responsible for a wartime airplane accident. Haunted by his past, he tries to win back his girlfriend who is a stewardess. They end up on the same flight together, and the film takes the viewer to some romantic flashbacks with humorous twists on such films as ""From Here to Eternity"" and ""Saturday Night Fever."" Hilarity ensures as the passengers and flight crew succumb to food poisoning and now the pilot and his girlfriend must land the plane! Created by the famous Zucker brothers, Jerry and David, who would later go on to produce The Naked Gun, there is a great comic wit about Airplane! that makes the movie a play on words.It is the little things that make the humor stand out. One scene has the air traffic controllers reading a headline about the plane's certain crash when word gets out to the press. They each pass the paper to the next person, saying things like ""Passengers certain to die."" The next controller takes the paper and says something like, ""Chicago prepares for crash landing."" The third air-traffic controller takes the paper, turns it over and says, ""There's a sale at Penny's!"" These types of jokes and so many more make the movie. However, it is also the talents of Robert Hayes as lead character Ted Striker, the zany stewardess, Julie Hagerty, and the comic genius of Leslie Nielsen, as a passenger doctor that make this movie so memorable. Even June Cleaver herself, Barbara Billingsly, has a wonderful cameo as the ""Jive Lady!"" The only downside of the film is that a scene involving the ""scummy bar"" with the fighting girl scouts and the ""Staying Alive"" theme from Saturday Night Fever goes on a little too long. But this detracts very little from a fine movie. Although rated PG for some very brief female nudity and sexual innuendo, the film would be OK for most pre-teens.A bonus is that there are some scenes on the commercial TV print that are not in the theatrical release, along with some new jokes! I do not have the DVD, but it would be nice if the disk were to include a composite version of Airplane!

On top of that, it's also the type of film that has a jokes you don't catch the first time around, giving it great rewatchability. What do I mean by it being kind of dumb, but having intelligence? Well it is hard to explain properly. It isn't a bunch of random garbage thrown on the screen, like the Scary Movie franchise, or Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, etc. The dialogue between the characters sounds really stupid, if taken literally, but in the context of the film, they're quite smart and funny. Here's an example: Main Character: ""Surely you can't be serious."" Leslie Nielsen: ""I am serious and don't call me Shirley."" You see what I'm getting at? This wouldn't work if taken literally or if it was over exaggerated by the actors. It lets you decipher what is said, which allows you to laugh.

When it comes to the quantity of laughs a movie offers, this is one of the best.The story is basically a spoof of old disaster movies.  It revolves around an airplane on which the entire crew gets sick, and the fate of the plane rests in a Ted Striker (Robert Hays), who still has problems from what happened to him during the war.  The script is full of witty jokes ranging from spoofs of the aforementioned disaster movies, to flat out ridiculous puns (""Surely you can't be serious.""""I am, and don't call me Shirley."")The plane is full of great characters, acted superbly by every member of the cast.  Lloyd Bridges and Leslie Nielsen are particularly funny, but there is really no weak link in the cast.  I don't really know what else to say about this movie other than it offers as many laughs in an hour and a half as you could find anywhere. It has obviously had a tremendous influence on comic film from its point on, and it does what it does better than any other movie of its type.*** 1/2 out of ****",Airplane!
211,joshuafagan-64214,One of the Funniest Movies Ever,10,29 August 2015,"What kind of a movie has an explanation point in the title? Seriously. As a writer who uses no exclamation points in his work, it was almost surreal typing one. The only other quality movie I know that used an explanation point is Moulin Rouge! and that movie was as overdramatic and stylish as the collective wet dream of a group of theatre majors. To say this is a weird film would be like saying that the Eiffel Tower or the Burj Khalifa are buildings. The film is the most surreal thing this side of Monty Python. And it is the funniest movie this side of Monty Python.The eighties were a strange decade. Though I never lived in them, from my exposure to movies and music TV shows and games, I know that for a fact. Many genres and mediums deteriorated in it. Comedy films did not. While 80s comedies may not be the best comedies when viewed from a purely critical lens, they are the funniest. And isn't that the first purpose of a comedy? To make people laugh? The great comedies of the 2000s like Little Miss Sunshine and 500 DOS delve into deeper issues and give more insight than this movie. But aside from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, no movie has ever made me laugh as much as this one. The jokes come a mile a minute and many of them, from the plane crashing into the window to Otto the blow-up autopilot to the poisonous fish to the old lady who translates jive to the ""Don't call me Shirley."" bit have passed into the realms of legend. This may not be the most quoted movie of all time, though it certainly is quoted frequently, but it just might well be the most quotable move of all time. Every line is genius.And it even does what so many lesser spoof films can't; it tells a legitimately good story. You are interested in the characters and the situation. Kudos to the directors for that. What allows the few serious and many silly elements to flow together seamlessly is how straight the characters play everything that happens. Too many unfunny comedies feel the need to point out that they made a joke. But in this film, they just keep going and it is funnier for it. This is not an always-winning formula. In a bad movie with bad writing and acting, this wouldn't have worked. But in a film like this, it does. It blows you away with nonchalant absurdity.Surreal humor is something where you need to go all in. Halfhearted attempts at it fail miserably. You need to create the atmosphere for it to work. This film does that. Like Alice in Wonderland, while it is often dramatic and heartfelt, it is never quite serious. A viewer knows that another hilarious, ridiculous joke is coming down the pip in a couple minutes at most and they just wait for it with bated breath.It's like being on a roller-coaster ride; you know the rush is coming and while you don't quite know when, you want to find out. In a move that tried to be somewhat grounded, the whole bit with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar playing himself but pretending not to be himself would have come out of left field. But here, it just fits the film.Before, I said that this film is not trying to dive into deeper issues, like did the great comedies of the last decade. That is still true. But it is nonetheless one of the most important films of the time period. If you are of a certain age or just a film buff like me, you likely know of the late seventies disaster movie trend.While the films were not as bad as the ones made when the genre resurged in the late nineties, it is only because the first wave of films were at least kitschy while those films were overblown in every way imaginable. And no matter how much of a guilty pleasure Independence Day is to me and no matter how much strange fondness I have for the Poseidon Adventure (which I may do a review on if I ever get the time), the truth remains that both waves of movies are terrible.This film was the antidote. It took the histrionic, needlessly grandiose, hollow feel of those movies and played it perfectly straight while throwing in a whirlwind of jokes. If you want the complete effect, watch an entire stack of disaster movies before popping in. That is how the movie is meant to be seen.Not that it's not a good film on its own right, but seeing it after watching a string of disaster films that are about an hour too long and have people who would not be smart enough to function in real life, it is glorious. When they tell everyone to prepare for crash position and everyone goes wild, I laughed so hard. Those disaster movies were just begging for someone to deliver comedic payoff. This film does.It is one of the best comedies of all time. Nothing falls short, nothing feels forced. I first watched it at six o' clock in the evening on the ground in Colorado. But I recommend that you watch it on a plane while eating fish and hoping that this trip is part of the 'sometimes' that they 'get you there.' Other than that, I have no comedic or witty lines or takes on the film, so I will leave you with the film's original tagline: Slower than a speeding bullet, able to crash into tall buildings with a single bound: Airplane!",Airplane!
212,ray-280,The Birth of a Genre,10,15 December 2005,"Airplane! hit America like a ton of bricks when it was released in 1980.Filmgoers had been traumatized throughout the 1970s in burning buildings (Towering Inferno), underwater (The Poseidon Adventure), at sea (Jaws, Orca), and in the air (Airport!, Airport '75, and Airport '79), and had just about had it with the disaster films. Then came Airplane!, which rose from the ashes of disaster like a Phoenix to define a genre that now includes so many movies that the original merely blends in, to those who don't realize how innovative and groundbreaking it was.Plot? Yeah, there's one: disgraced Vietnam veteran and PTSD sufferer Ted Striker (Robert Hayes) chases his ex-girlfriend, Elaine (Julie Hagerty) onto the flight where she is a stewardess in order to convince her not to break up with him. Sure enough, the plane encounters trouble due to food poisoning of anyone who ate fish. Ted is the only one who can save the day, and will presumably win Elaine's heart back if he does. The only problem is that the last time Ted had to save lives by flying a plane, six people died...no, seven! The plot is not what carries this film, of course. It is merely used as a delivery device for rapid-fire satire of everything from American society to air travel, our pretentiousness, and the ridiculous plots of the disaster films it parodies. Overnight, Leslie Neilsen went from a moderately known veteran actor to an A-list comedy star, and he is cashing in as much now as then on the reputation he built in that film. The deadpanning and saracasm are liberally dispensed, and juxtapose brilliantly against the absurd backdrops that keep working their way into the film.A friend of mine said she didn't see what the fuss was about this film, and all I could do was call her by name and say ""Shirley, you can't be serious."" A must-watch and a must-own. One of the most brilliant films ever made. The number of successful films of this genre which would not exist were it not for Airplane! is staggering.",Airplane!
213,phillafella,"Up, Up and Away at Laugh-Out-Loud Humor!",10,11 April 2003,"AIRPLANE is among the greatest comedies of all-time, and with good reason. Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty are great in their roles as a broken couple brought back together by fate when they must take over the controls of a plane when its crew takes ill.  Full of one-liners, laugh-out-loud jokes and good performances from Leslie Nielsen, Lorna Patterson and basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, AIRPLANE has something for everyone.5 out of 5",Airplane!
214,scott-sw,Best comedy ever!,10,21 September 2010,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I can still watch it 30 years later and still laugh and enjoy the slapstick. Former pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hayes) is trying to mend his relationship with stewardess Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty). To do that, he boards an ill-fated commercial airliner. You see, one of the main meals has food poisoning, rendering the crew sick. This leaves Striker as the only hope to land the plane. Through all this, he meets a zany cast of characters: Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielson), Steve McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges), Rex Kramer (Robert Stack) and Johnny (Steven Stucker). This was also the premiere of the Zucker/Abraham/Zucker team that gave us great comedy parodies such as The Naked Gun, Top Secret, Hot Shots ... just to name a few. With this, they threw jokes so fast that as some fell flat, most hit the target dead-on. There are sight gags, one-liners, crazy situations and hilarious scenes that have aged well and are still funny to this day. I recall having to go to the movie several times to notice peripheral jokes, and hear the lines muffled by all the laughter in the theater. Not only does Airplane make a stab at the endless annoyance of the Airport movies, the ZAZ team knew how to poke fun at other great movies: From Here to Eternity, Saturday Night Fever, and the All American. Finally, what this movie did was set the standard for the parody. We have original characters, original story, and dialog laced with the lampooning and endless jokes instead of modern parodies which tend to copy characters and lines and are unable to become their own movie and find their own humor. Surely, this is the greatest comedy ever. (And don't call me surely).",Airplane!
215,Better_TV,Most of the Jokes Still Land,8,3 April 2018,"While nowadays the style of humor pioneered by the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams is passé - and, some would argue, practically ruined by its overbaked usage in some of their subsequent projects including the Scary Movie franchise - back then their humor was fresh, and most of the jokes in this film do indeed hold up today.There's double entendres, lots of one-liners, plenty of sight gags, a bit of politically incorrect racism and sexism, some absurd violence, the legendary scene where Barbara Billingsley says, ""Oh stewardess, I speak jive,"" a deadpan Leslie Nielsen, and more. My favorite actor in the movie was and still is Stephen Stucker as Johnny; every time he pops up to give some anarchic and ridiculous line, it puts a smile on my face.What always struck me about this movie was that, despite all the absurd humor, the central love story does actually take itself rather seriously; Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty are perfectly cast. There's also real suspense when Hays attempts to pilot the passenger plane to safety in a storm; even with all the jokes the movie knows when to give the audience some genuine emotional beats. That was one of the biggest problems the sequel had - it jumped the shark early and often, provoking many viewers to ask ""what's the point?""This one, though, is still a fun watch in 2018.",Airplane!
216,marydm-43470,Immortal Classic,10,16 July 2021,"First watched this some three decades ago on late night TV and laughed out loud all the way through.Just rewatched this on Netflix and was astounded at how after 40 years it's still fresh as a daisy. I laughed even more this time.Won't comment too much cos so many have pointed out so many aspects of what makes this film such a classic.Just a couple of things:
1. The willingness of the supporting cast of stars to appear and sound ridiculous, to take the mickey out of the very notion of star-studded blockbusters is at the core of what gives such longevity to the movie.2. Their willingness, too, to play the funny bits straight and not go for hyper camp and ""knowing"" irony, something that ruins so much cinematic ""comedy"".That's a killer combo on the screen, and the ""auto pilot"" joke is just genius.The last scene is a wink wink comment on the fact that the entire movie is a joke and that the viewer is in on it as much as the writers, directors, cast etc. This is collaborative cinema, in the sense that the viewer's intelligence is respected and an integral part of the viewing experience.The whole movie is meta-cinema in a way the most ambitious self-conscious art house films (look at me, I'm an auteur!) can only dream of being. You want successful movies, then don't look down on your viewers.The jokes in the movie may be ""puerile"" but this knowing approach to trusting the viewer's intelligence makes this a movie for cinematically literate viewers.Thanx everyone involved for the integrity with which such a spoof has been composed. Classic and paradigmatic cinema in every way.",Airplane!

218,cafescott,Cartoon-like gag factory,8,6 July 2014,"***User-reviewer ray-280 (""The Birth of a Genre"", ray-280 from Philadelphia, 15 December 2005) has good background about the disaster films of the 1970s. Also, Sandoric (""Airplane! spoofs ""Zero Hour"" Maybe, but watch 1954' ""The High and the Mighty"", sandoric from United States, 17 July 2005) has information about the two films that Airplane directly copies from.***Airplane! (1980, Jim Abrahams, David and Jerry Zucker) is laugh-out-loud funny throughout its 88 minutes (which fly by--hehe). It is rare that film comedies endure the test of time (and still remain funny). However, ""Airplane"" holds up well even as memory of the other films it refers to fade.Two films that ""Airplane"" shamelessly borrows from are ""Zero Hour,"" and ""The High and the Mighty,"" with John Wayne. (I haven't seen either.) Hopefully, no one fails to recognize the love scene on the beach recalling ""From Here to Eternity."" Disaster films ""Airport!, Airport '75, and Airport '79"" are obvious influences. ""Jaws"" appears in the opening credits. A few of John Travolta﻿'s dance moves in ""Saturday Night Fever"" return. ""Airplane"" spoofs all these and more, as the 1970s era of disaster movies gave way to the 1980s period of derivative silliness.""Airplane"" introduces a new sub-genre of comedy. Besides being a spoof of existing culture, scenes arrive in the style of cartoons. Any crisis that happens may be instantly forgotten. So, if a passenger (listening to sad-sack Ted Striker) has hanged himself, another has committed seppuku (stabbed himself) and a third has immolated himself with gasoline and a match, the resulting explosion will have no effect on either the plane's operation or the next scene. There is no reason to justify the litany of sight-gags either. Ergo, if Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen), the doctor on board, is suddenly performing a gynecological operation; or if he, Ted Striker (Robert Hays) and Stewardess Elaine (Julie Hagerty) are all now playing musical instruments in the cabin, these gags all come by surprise.The cartoon-like comedy style works because there is still some suspense; i.e., will the food-poisoned crew and passengers be saved from a depressed, under-confident, PTSD-suffering former war pilot whose last effort at saving a plane resulted in six deaths--no, seven. There are also great deadpan performances from the entire cast, as the principal male actors (e.g., Nielsen, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves and Robert Stack) all make their film comedy debuts here. Nielsen, as the doctor who appears midway, is the standout. The two principal stewardesses, Elaine and Randy (Lorna Patterson), are both skilled comediennes. Hagerty is deft with comedy and is an eye-catching romantic lead. She should have had a better career in film. (Keep an out for David Leisure, playing a Krishna years before he becomes ""Joe Isuzu"" in TV commercials.) ""Airplane"" pokes fun at Blacks, gays, Jews, WASPs, et. al, but doesn't seem offensive (to this observer). When ""Leave it to Beaver"" matriarch Barbara Billingsley intervenes in a discussion because she can translate the ""jive"" talk of two Black patrons (Norman Alexander Gibbs and Al White), this will (hopefully) produce laughter no matter who is viewing. Same with Striker's flashback during his time in the Peace Corps﻿ when he is teaching the game of basketball to an African tribe. Seconds later they are dunking with skill.There are also many sexually-based gags that seem to push the boundaries of 1980 decency. Of course a plastic doll that functions as the ""automatic pilot"" will deflate, requiring Elaine to blow it back up. (Guess where the valve is.) Also, Elaine's deadpan description of the last sexual activity between her and former beau Striker may inspire giggles and the wonder if she really said what she did with sparkling blue eyes. (However, the gay air traffic controller Stephen Stucker plays is admittedly too over-the-top in today's reformist cultural climate.) Even if you have seen ""Airplane"" many times, this gag factory is always great fun when it appears on the big screen.",Airplane!
219,saint405,Why can't there be more movies like Airplane?,9,25 June 2005,"On a rainy flight, a lone aircraft has all it's passengers and flight crew poisoned by eating fish. It's up to a Ted Striker, a man who flew in the war but accidental killed most of his comrades, to fly the plane even though he is scared stiff.The team ZAZ has brought us a comedic jewel that overpowers every other comedy in the entire world! A spoof of disaster films is what this film is, about Ted striker fallowing his old girlfriend onto a plane where she works but he must fly it when the pilots go numb from eating the planes main dish, a poisoned fish. Lloyd Bridges is hilarious in this film as a flight commander who has taken the wrong week to give up smoking, drinking, and sniffing glue.But the best performance in this whole film is the role of Johnny who not only is the funniest character but has the best lines. Examples. "" bad news, the fogs getting thicker."" Johnny jumps in and grabs a guys belly. "" And Leon is getting lllllaaaarrrger!"" Men are reading a newspaper about the plane. "" Plane sure to crash!"" "" People are to die."" Johnny looks shocked at the paper. "" There's a sale at Pennys!"" And there's the scene where the plane goes crazy when they see the runways lights go out and there's a shot of Johnny holding the cord. "" Just kidding."" Plugs it back in. examples over. This is a true comedy of romance, suspense and comedy. My props go to Johhny, Lloyd Bridges, and Leslie 'The spoof king' Neilson for his performance as Dr. Rumak. With him he gives the films most classic line. ""We need you to fly this plane."" "" Surely you can't be serious."" "" I am serious, and don't call me Shirley."" The film is hilarious with scenes as a whole group of people with weapons waiting to beat up this one woman who is freaking out, every time Ted tells someone one of his flashbacks they kill themselves, Teds flashback at the dance club, crash positions, Ted asks for a ticket in the smoking section and he gets a ticket thats on fire, and on and on and on.

220,MartynGryphon,A Film That Takes Comedy To New Heights,10,30 July 2009,"In my opinion, one of the funniest movies ever made. A movie that spearheaded a new, zany, off the wall type of humour that is still being replicated today nearly 30 years later. It was also the film that was responsible for re-categorising both Lloyd Bridges & Leslie Nielsen from ageing 'B' movie stars of yesteryear into 'A' list Comedy superstars.The film is a well executed spoof on the 70's disaster genre and takes place on a stricken airliner where the entire cabin crew and the majority of the passengers have come down with a violent strain of food poisoning, leaving ex Vietnam pilot Ted Striker, (Robert Hayes), the only person who can take the controls and save the day.It also remains one of the most quoted movies of all time, with immortal lines like ""What A Pisser"" and ""Don't Call Me Shirley"" and "" I take it Black...Like My Men"".However, Airplane's clever writing is not solely reliant on the spoken joke or throw away one-liner, it also contains a lot of visual sight gags that would have made Chaplin & Keaton as proud as punch, none more so as when the 'sh*t hits the fan'.It also has some extremely funny flashback sequences to explain why Ted, (a confirmed aviophobic), is even on the plane to begin with.The support cast is also simply brilliant with Peter Graves, Julie Hagerty, Lorna Patterson, Barbara Billingsley and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, (who, and forgive my Englishness here, was an Ex Basketball Player). However, the funniest characters by a country mile are Dr. Rumack, (Neilson), McCroskey, (Bridges) and Rex Kramer, (Robert Stack).If there had not have been an Airplane, there would certainly have been no Police Squad TV series, Naked Gun Movies or even Hot Shots. As I said in my opening summary, Its a film that takes comedy to new heights and after watching it, it will take you a while to come back down to earth.Roger....what?, Over.....huh?

For some reason in Scary Movie 3&4 Zucker copies Airplane: Scary Movie 3- ""I just want to say good luck, we're all counting on you"". both said by Leslie Neilson and Scary Movie 4- (on deleted scenes) "" Do you ever hang around a gymnasium?"" said by Captin Oveur and the fake Michael Jackson.",Airplane!
222,DVR_Brale,"Preposterous and smart, very funny and entertaining",9,14 September 2016,"I was around ten probably when I first saw this movie. It cracks me up every time I see it; even the trailer. There so much laughing material for grown ups as well as kids. Airplane! and Naked Gun series are my favorite comedy movies. Of course I'm an Leslie Nielsen fan (R.I.P.). These movies are just so much better than nowadays Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and James Franco movies with childish and immature humor.Now, someone could remark that Airplane! doesn't have sophisticated humor as well. I disagree. I don't think that humor has to be serious in order to be smart. Airplane! (and Naked Gun series) create a world filled with absurdities which protagonists seem to take for granted. Those absurdities are sometimes presented very subtly (nun reading magazine for nuns) but by themselves are not little absurdities. There's much, much more to this humor than to smoking pot, getting laid, cussin' and playing immature and stupid. You don't have to be very bright to enjoy that type of humor. On the other hand, you have to be smart and careful if you want to fully enjoy Airplane!. This movies is *filled* with jokes, lines, facial expressions etc. - that's why Airplane! is so highly re-watchable. It's unlikely you'll notice everything in first watch.So Jim Abrahams is a genius. He didn't' write a lot, but wrote Naked Gun and Airplane!. He also wrote Top Secret! (notice the exclamation mark) starring Val Kilmer who played Iceman in Top Gun. If you look at Airplane's! cast you'll notice Jim Abrahams playing religious zealot #6. Beautiful Julie Hagerty made this movie extra charming. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar playing co-pilot is funny on it's own. Peter Graves (R.I.P.) was a big gentleman. He started acting back in the 50's! Lloyd Bridges (R.I.P.) started in 40's. They had big on-screen experience before acting in Airplane!. And that's one more reason why Airplane! is so funny; acting is just great. I don't think lesser experienced actors could've done this good job. Leslie Nielsen plays Dr. Rumack. His surprised expression is my favorite one and I believe one of the most famous in the movie history.You can see that cast and whole film-making crew had a lot of fun while filming Airplane!. The atmosphere is very relaxing, friendly and entertaining. That's why I see this movie every now and then. And so should you - laughing makes you live longer.",Airplane!

However, with a movie with constant jokes it is inevitable that some of them are not received well - the sexual jokes in particular. And despite that some jokes are reoccurring, there is a enough wide range of different jokes that there will eventually be one joke that is funny. Yes, depending on ones humour, this movie might only offer a handful of chuckles. This might be due to the constant flow of jokes, one joke numbs the following joke and so on...

A good comedy you'll enjoy at least once. A great comedy will stand up to repeated viewings and still maintain its freshness. I've seen this movie so many times I probably know every single line, but damn it, it's still funny as hell! The basic concept of this film is pure genius. It's not that it's a spoof of disaster movies that makes ""Airplane!"" unique, but rather the choice to have almost all the major roles played by ""serious"" actors. Hearing ""Joey, have you ever seen a grown man naked?"" or ""looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue"" from someone like Bill Murray would have been good, but having it come from Peter Graves and Lloyd Bridges is what makes it great. It's all about hilarious dialogue and ludicrous scenes all being played with a perfectly straight face. And add to that a terrific soundtrack, with corny sounding ""disaster movie"" music playing at all the appropriate moments and a host of ""minor"" characters (""Excuse me stewardess, but I speak jive"" coming the former ""Leave it to Beaver"" Mom, Barbara Billingsley) and Stephen Stucker as the gloriously goofy and clueless air traffic controller and what you have is comedy heaven.11/10",Airplane!
225,cleary-joshua,What went so wrong with 'spoof' films?,9,12 July 2014,"We live in a world where satire is abundant and 'spoof cinema' has been taken to the extremes. Every year movies like ""Scary Movie"", ""Disaster Movie"" or ""Vampires Suck"" are released which attempt to lampoon recent film releases, but these always fail at the most simple hurdle – being funny. In order to find some genuinely funny spoof comedy, you must go back to the very roots of the genre, and there is no finer place than ""Airplane!"", the greatest spoof of disaster movies that exists. Why does it work so well? It's not spoofing its immediate predecessors, but films made around 25 years before it. It knows all the genre tropes so well, and subverts them for our entertainment.The film follows Ted Striker (Robert Hays), an ex-fighter pilot, who is on the same plane as his ex-girlfriend Elaine (Julie Hagerty) when both pilots and many passengers are taken ill and he is forced to try and rescue the plane. They are helped by the doctor on board, played by the genius of comic timing Leslie Nielsen, and together they manage to get the plane onto the ground safely. Normally I would apologise for writing the end of the movie in my review, but honestly, it's not the thing that you care about at all in the film.What makes ""Airplane!"" so great is the constant one-liners, and endless source of comedy in the fantastic actors, and the easy mocking of common tropes. The jokes don't feel cheap for a second, but subvert your expectations and use the many passengers, crew and people working at the airport as comedy. There are so many people involved, and everyone gets a look-in. Even the airport announcers get a joke at the very beginning, which is extremely funny and sets the tone for the film well. It's not afraid, among the barrage of lines, to refer to previous jokes and make them even funnier. The original ""Don't call me Shirley"" line which is so famous isn't actually that funny, but the followup line later on is what really qualifies the gag.Everything is spoofed in the film, even the classic ""disaster film"" soundtrack. Elmer Bernstein is used for his experience in serious films and genre classics (his scores for ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Great Escape"" are extremely well known), and is deliberately writing serious music so that the fact that none of it is serious is even better. ""Airplane!"" is fabulously written, and doesn't give the audience a single moment to breathe through the laughter. It truly is the greatest part of the genre that it revived, and it's a shame that its legacy is not better recognised by the trash that is ""A Haunted House"" and other films of a similar vein.",Airplane!

230,SeptumSin,a true classic,7,20 November 2008,Well in history there is a type of movie that we all know and love. These comedies use total nonsense w/ some witty banter to shock and make us laugh out loud. Similar recent movies would include the Scary Movie series and Superhero movie. Airplane existed when these movies were much better in quality.The movie is about a crew up in an airplane that has trouble and the shaken and slightly disturbed crew members must find a way to land the plane in time before it's too late.This movie is indeed a comedy classic. I found it highly entertaining and still very much able to get the comedy. Some of the cultural references may be lost on the current generation but this is one of the few things that drags this movie down.

232,Charles-31,One of my greatest movie-going experiences...,10,26 July 2002,"In 1980 I drove to the nearest city with a theatre to see some film I don't even remember.  I arrived late and missed the film.  Not wishing to go home, I went to another movie that was about to start called ""Airplane"".  Now, Airplane had just opened and nobody knew anything about it.  I had not heard of it and really didn't even know it was a comedy.  Few today will ever get the experience I got that night, seeing one of the most brilliant slapstick comedies ever made.  I was bowled over by the frantic pace and the brilliant irreverence.  Airplane is a great film.  The genre is common today, but at that time it was not.  Never had there been a film that toss puns, jokes, paradies, and everything else they could think of at you at such a frantic pace.  The movie never slows, bombarding you with a level of silliness that must make the Pythons jealous.  Today, it's just one of a large number of the slapstick parody movies.  But, I consider it great for two reasons.  It was the root of the entire genre and proved to be a strong root on which to build.  And, how many lines from this movie are know by everyone today?  Don't call me Shirley.  A hospital? It's a big building with patients, but that's not important right now.  What can you make of this?  And, someone finally put the right image with ""the s**t hits the fan"".",Airplane!

Its premise is rather simple. We basically have Transamerica airline flights that is Rife with troubles and needs to be landed. Absurdly simple and even downright silly. What makes it work is its wide a range of Comedy. Slapstick, dry wit, meta humor, dark humor, are all in here somewhere and executed exceedingly well. It's as good as it gets in each respective way and does get a laugh every time they show up. It also never goes too far with its laughs doesn't go into Adam Sandler happy Madison variety it keeps things more subdued more Elegance almost and that makes the film a lot more watchable in a lot more enjoyable, which also is complemented by its rather short runtime of an hour and 20 so minutes.It fundamentally works because it takes a simple premise and knows how to run with it as far and fast as it can with what it has, that being is humor. This is what makes this a truly classic Landmark comedy comic, a uses all the satire all the commentary, get you in with the laughs, lets you move right on to the next joke, and your back watching again until the end which is not too far away.

It's a very funny spoof of those 1980s Airport disaster films and it lampoons every possible cliche from that genre. Almost all of the actors do a great job with their characters. Deadpan Robert Stack is hilarious as the ""no-nonsense"" senior pilot who, via radio, talks down the troubled plane, being flown by Robert Hays. Lloyd Bridges is in command of the control center and I, personally, have never been as entertained by him as I was while watching this movie. Leslie Nielsen showed that he could play comedy as good as, or maybe better than, most actors. One down note for me: The character of Johnny, played by Stephen Stucker was, IMHO, not funny at all. In fact, he was extremely annoying as he acted like a real jerk throughout the story line. In real life, Stucker died in 1986 at the age of 37. Cause of death is listed as AIDS (Gee, what a surprise).",Airplane!

Perhaps it gets even funnier because the comedy is played so straight. To me the dance scene at the seedy bar is pure classic comedy gold.

Not the first parody film but it did take them in a new direction. It was done with more genius than almost every comedy made before and after, and it will remain a classic forever. It is jam packed with gags and one liners that would make Groucho Marx proudThere really isn't anything bad to say about this film. Immature? Yeah, sure, but still funny to almost everyone regardless of taste. Its easily the best comedy of the 80s if not the best comedy ever made. It doesn't get annoying like many other films in its style, it stays hilarious the whole time, and it will be hilarious for years and years to come. I don't think Leslie Nielson would be remembered the way he will be without this film. He plays one of the greatest comedy roles ever, and with the help of Robert Hays, Lloyd Bridges, Julie Hagerty, Peter Graves, and Kareem Abdul Jabbar, this film becomes legendary. There is truly too many great lines to even begin picking favorites. Now, is Airplane my favorite comedy? No. I'm not going to sit here and say I love it to death. Don't get me wrong, I do love it and I do think it is one of the greatest comedies ever made, but at the same time, as far as comedies go, I wont call it one of my favorites unless I can watch over and over again. It does stay funny even after multiple viewings but they need to be pretty separated viewings, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just the only thing that keeps me from loving it a little more. Still genius. If you haven't yet seen Airplane! You have made a mistake. It is a must see by everyone. Make sure you are in the mood for a comedy though.

Why is this important? Well, I was learning to count when this movie was having acne. Even then I could get a good account for the jokes. The job in this movie is astounding for its time. Even the effects are good for its time. The script was simple but effective. The music was fitting most of the time (except the disco part) and the actors were having the time of their life: They gave everything they had for a laugh and they got it.Some of the verbal jokes (I can remember the one with Reagan and the married girl one) are totally outdated nowadays, but it holds as a whole. Some of the jokes are such a classic (Stop calling me Shirley, the sweaty arrival, the taking of pictures, the 'This was a bad week to stop X', the calming lady) that they could not be ever forgotten. Even the disco section was funny, although i feel it overly long. It has something for everyone: dark jokes, physical comedy, white jokes, puns, effect comedy...

Rivaled only by Harold Ramis (""Caddy Shack"", [writer: ""Animal House""]), and the team of Ivan Reitman, Janis Allen, and Len Blum (""Meatballs""), ""Airplane"" was by far the most consistent effort by the duo and stands today as the standard by which all such films will be compared.

What follows is that he must pilot the plane when the pilot falls ill to cooked fish! Again, this film is a gag-fest. Nothing but laughs all the way to the end.

253,Oggz,Uncontrollable flatulence,10,20 February 2007,"Basically, this can be described as ""Monthy Python's dimmer younger brother in a coke-induced frenzy"", and teaches the likes of Mel Brooks what a proper riotous comedy spoof should look like. The Zukko Bros & Son's affectionate tribute to British-rooted brand of absurdist, literal, surrealist, cretinous comedy which borders on subversive is, indeed, a one note affair but forces us into comic submission primarily due to some fine calibration of the rudeness in humour - unadulterated, smutty, subtle, gross, vulgar, as well as the sheer volume of it - and it still remains a milestone in comedy all these years later. The fact that the film is often recently being accused of losing topicality and being ""dated"" doesn't particularly bother me - this film has already made so many generations laugh their guts out so why worry whether or not future ones will know who Anita Bryant was. The truth remains that this is arguably the funniest movie ever made.It's also worth remembering that ""Airplane!"" was filmed and released in 1980, effectively still in the late seventies (disco gets sent up not once but twice in the course of the film), generally a very liberal period where few taboos were exempt from scrutiny - therefore we can roar with dark delight as we learn that the wife of a paedophile pilot does one better and sleeps with a horse, little white girls fancy big black men, spinsters snort coke, respectable older ladies talk jive in ""chimp"" terms or lay eggs orally, outrageous queens rule the flight control tower where glue is also sniffed and so on. The comedy spares no one (blacks, wasps, jews, gays) and, as many users correctly pointed out, the gags are riotous but not offensive. On a tamer note, you can see genuine affection in the way the ZAZ team parody and even quote source material, amongst which ""Airport 75"" and ""Zero Hour!"" end up studiously lampooned to perfection. Besides, the performances are spot-on (Julie Hagerty is just fab-u-lous, especially in her scenes with Otto), the music is knowingly and hilariously blown out of all proportions (listen to the shrieking amorous vocal trio at the end, as Hays and Hagerty embrace) and, contrary to mathematic possibilities, the soundtrack comes up with an even MORE idiotic in-flight guitar tune than Helen Reddy's ""Best Friend"" ever was. I watch this avalanche of gags every once in a while, just to get me a giggle detox - it never fails.

The fact that some people call it dated is a crime. It's just the time it was made. Besides a few obscure references to old commercials, and various pop culture, the majority of the movie's jokes are still as fresh and hysterical as they were back in 1980.An airline crew falls victim to food poisoning (fish), and the only one who can save the flight is Ted Stryker, a war vet, who is haunted by the past, and therefore is afraid of flying. Not that the plot really matters. The movie's goal is to pump out as many jokes per minute as possible, and there are always at least 5 per minute. From the opening Jaws parody (the Jaws music playing, with an airplane's wing popping out of the clouds), it lets you know that it will not stop with the absurdity. It never does. I didn't even know this kind of comedy existed until I saw Airplane. The plot didn't sound funny, and the only reason I saw it was because the AFI ranked this as the funniest movie of all time. I still slap myself every time I watch it for not seeing it sooner. That's probably 50 re-watches that I'll never have in my life.

The movie follows Ted Striker who must get his love back called Elaine, when she goes to a plane he goes on the plane to take her back. But when finding that almost everyone except them and a doctor, the others ate fish that had poison, the steak was normal, then when the co-pilot and two more pilots ate the fish, then Elaine and Ted must control the plane with help by a doctor and a dummy. When Kramer helps him out, he lands safely and returns home and luckily the dummy took over the plane, and a taxi-customer must wait over hours as post-credits.This movie inspired me for watching the movie, the movie's humor, jokes and gags are the best parts of this Movie, love the Oral Sex part, funny.

265,stuprince,Understand the time and you will get the film.,9,12 December 2006,"I read some of the comments that people have made claiming this film is dated, and maybe there is some truth to that, but it is still one of the funniest films I have ever seen and began a genre of film that still continues today. Honestly, the sequel was bad (not a ZAZ film, by the way), but don't hold that against this film, without Airplane we would never have gotten the Naked Gun films, or Hot Shots.This film is even more funny if you understand the pop-culture references of the period. Few young people today understand that the ""Jive Lady"" was Beaver Cleaver's mom, the ultimate white suburban Mom. References to Anita Bryant, ""From Here to Eternity,"" Ethel Merman, and, most of all, understanding that almost NONE of the actors in the film were comedians, they were the foundation of 1960s and 70s dramatic films and TV. Only AFTER Airplane do they go on to do comedic roles. Imagine current actors such as Russell Crowe doing a parody film today and you might begin to understand why seeing and listening to these actors do these parts was so damned funny. Leslie Nielson had been the prototype handsome dramatic actor until the film, only then did he become a comedic star.So, time has made it hard for people watching it for the first time today to understand all the humor, but still, watching the ""shit hit the fan"" has to be good for a few laughs.",Airplane!

Reading the summary, I didn't think it was good, but when I read the name of the directors and writers, I decided to give it a chance. After all, they were the guys who brought us The Naked Gun, the funniest movie I've ever seen. And I don't regret the decision. I've watched - and loved it!This one is obviously set on an Airplane, and when the crew gets ill, it's up to ex-pilot Ted Striker to save the day and land the plane. This very basic plot gives room to ZAZ (Zucker, Abraham and Zucker) to write lots of funny jokes. They throw one joke after another, and they are all really funny, except in the beginning. The movie didn't start so well, but as soon as the plane takes off, it gets awesome. You get to meet lots of eccentric and extremely funny characters, with a nice overall acting. But the one who steals the show here is Leslie Nielsen. He is hilarious on the role of the Doctor on board.This movie is also wrongly credited as the first spoof film, since the Mel Brooks' movies came first. But it isn't a bad thing. I found this one funnier then Mel Brooks' Young Frankestein, but less funnier then The Naked Gun series. It's definitely on my list of the ten funniest movies ever made.

268,the-jerk,the greatest comedy of all time,10,30 March 2005,"Airplane is simply the funniest movie of all time. It handles the broad range of parody, satire, and plain silliness expertly, and has some of the greatest one-liners and sight gags ever put in a movie. Sure some of the jokes are dated, but great comedies (especially parodies) exist in the moment, and you have to expect that. The fact is, enough jokes hit the bullseye that it really is one of those rare movies where you are laughing constantly. I am, at least. This movie launched Leslie Nielsen's career as a comedy actor, although he still hasn't made anything this good (Naked Gun comes closest, but it's still light years away from this). Do any movies come close to hitting the zenith that this one does? ""Young Frankenstein"" comes close, but even the best Mel Brooks film doesn't top this. There has simply never been a funnier movie than ""Airplane!"" and for that, it deserves to be considered one of the greatest MOVIES of all time (I know for many people that's a stretch, but I stand by it; I've been watching it my whole life and there's still nothing I flat-out enjoy watching more).",Airplane!

The last two decades have been packed with spoof-a-minute parody films which borrow heavily from the timing and nutty sense of humor in ""Airplane"". But none have ever topped the original.  After 20 years, it is still a very, very funny movie.  It's a maelstrom of puns, sight gags, random cultural references, and an overarching parody of the melodramatic ""Airport"" films...  the sort of comedy that when the occasional joke falls flat, two seconds later there's something else to laugh at.

271,rh86,Prepare for your sides to be split,10,24 October 2006,"Quite simply one of the funniest movies of all time. When released in 1980, Airplane came after a decade of ever worse disaster movies (anyone remember Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, and the car crash that was Airport 79: The Concorde) and blew them all out of the water. The basic storyline came from a 1950s TV piece called Zero Hour where a passenger plane is crippled after the pilots fall ill. Airplane sticks pretty close to the plot, although a few passengers from Airport 75 also make it on board and then adds a massive dose of hilarity.Some of the jokes in Airplane simply come by taking things very literally (excrement and desk fans comes to mind) while others are just comic genius. Absolutely nothing is sacred in Airplane, Nuns, sick children, sports stars, airport staff and even the airport announcers all prove to be sources of humour. But the jokes always work by having the actors play it completely serious despite the hilarity thrown at them, from deflating automatic pilots, thieving press ('OK boys, let's get some pictures) and passenger riots.I could go on but to be honest, the best way to understand just how funny Airplane is, is to watch it.

272,lornloxor,Dated and formulaic - not the funniest movie of all time!,2,11 September 2012,"I decided to watch this movie because there was a story on the Telegraph that described a study where this movie generated the most laughs per minute out of all the comedies tested. Boy, I was going to have a good time I thought. Instead, I just sat there staring at the screen wondering how this movie could be considered one of the funniest comedies of all time. Once you figure out all the humor is based on the characters misunderstanding which part of a sentence the other person was referring to, the movie and the jokes become too predictable and obvious. Then there's the physical gags e.g. where a stewardess loans a guitar and proceeds to bang everyone's head as she moves through the aisle. And those eggs just continue to come from her mouth! Oh and black people have basketball in their genes, am I right guys? They just learn that thing when you give them a basketball. I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with racist jokes but goddamn, they have to be funny! I don't know, maybe this movie was funnier during a more naive and innocent time, like when it came out. But I'm not a movie historian and I think the movie should work even now if it's that great (like 12 Angry Men, for example). These jokes are just so tired and lame. I was even a bit drunk while watching this and only had a few chuckles during the entire movie. It's not that I didn't understand the jokes or where they were going with them but I just didn't find them funny at all. It's just too silly and dumb. I even tried to watch a few funny scenes from my favorite comedies (Tucker & Dale vs. Evil, Death at a Funeral, Sex Drive, Office Space) to make sure that I just wasn't in a non-comedic mood.

If for no other reason, this film should hold an honored place in movie history for introducing us to the comic abilities of Leslie Nielsen, who steals the show and completely redirects his career to become the prototype for modern movie deadpan humor.This isn't so much a movie as it is a series of loosely connected satires and cameos populated by recognizable faces, but boy, are they memorable ones:  Barbara Billingsley as the elderly lady who translates jive. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the co-pilot, harassed by a kid who recognizes him and says his old man think Kareem dogs it on the hardwood.  Peter Graves as the pilot who asks the same kid whether he's ever seen Turkish prison movies.  Lloyd Bridges as an air traffic controller, who picked the wrong week to give up a lot of bad habits.  And of course Leslie Nielsen's doctor, who delivers his ridiculous lines so straight-faced that you can't help but laugh, so that by the end of the film, you're laughing as soon as he appears onscreen.This film should be a required piece of every Americans' video library, the perfect antidote to a world that has become dark and frightening.

The film is probably the first ever spoof, which paved the way for the scary movie films and others like not another teen movie, but this was the first and you can tell. Robert Hayes and especially Julie Haggerty's characters make me roll with laughter - so does Lorna Patterson's character Randy, who in the singing scene with the sick child makes me laugh so hard i cry. Lloyd Bridges and Leslie Nielson's performances though i think will go down in history as being some of the best comic performances EVER!

This movie is the grand daddy of all spoof movies made in the the past several years, It has lost little of its freshness after being mimicked by countless other movies. Casting is great with Robert Hayes in the lead as Ted Stryket and Julie Hagerty as his love interest.The plot is taken right from Zero Hour a 1950's era airplane disaster movie and spoofs many of the disaster movies popular in the 1970's. The basic plot is Ted and Eileen break up, Ted follows her onto the flight the crew with most of the passengers get sick and Ted has to land the plane, Robert Stack, Peter Graves, Lloyd Bridges, and Leslie Nielson are perfectly cast to spoof their former serious characters.

278,tuhin94,"Quotes, quotes, so many quotes!",10,23 July 2014,"I recently re-watched this classic as a refresher in order to watch the sequel. It never gets old! The best thing about Airplane! is how the comedy (dirty, clean, intelligent, it has it all!) never stops. Even if they were jokes that made me think and say, ""Aaaahhh,"" and not necessarily laugh out loud, there was never a moment where I was waiting for something funny.Like the title suggests, the movie has tons of memorable and intelligent quotes. One of the ones earlier on prominent in my mind: ""Alright, give me Hamm on 5, hold the Mayo."" Another, ""No, I've been nervous lots of times."" Rumack: ""You can't tell me for another two hours?"" The sequel has a lot more of the, ""It's a *blank*. But, that's not important right now,"" lines. I loved the pilot's names and the dialog that was written specifically to match up with the names and cause confusion. Additionally, there was Ted's ""drinking problem"" which parodied Gatorade and gave me a good laugh every time. Among all this, there are all the small things the viewer needs to keep looking out for that happen in the background or are very subtle. For example, one of the titles in the newspaper read, ""Meteorite lands near baby."" The one glaring mistake was in the bar scene during the flashback. I could clearly see the wires holding up Ted at certain times for his dance scene. However, that is probably due to the tech limitations of the day.Some extremely intelligent and creative writers made this story and a large cast of profoundly talented actors brought it to life.

Whilst there are certainly plenty of funny moments, and some classic lines that haven't lost their impact, the film feels like an extended set of hammy sketches thrown together like one of those shapeless pieces of knitting beloved of a certain generation of grandmothers. I know this is partly because of its nature as a spoof, but it meant that a lot of the jokes either came across as forced or extremely predictable. None of this would matter if the film as a whole could be said to be genuinely funny, but I fear that, whilst it may have been hilarious and innovative when it came out, the years have not been kind to the style, the editing, or rather a lot of the humour.

It's as though before filming every scene, they went over as many ways as possible to make a joke and chose the funniest way. From the Saturday Night Fever spoof, to Ted's drinking problem, to the subtitled Ebonics, to the inflatable auto pilot, the laughs kept on coming.

Never attempts to take itself seriously and that's why it succeeds!,9,28 February 2016,"Released in 1980, Airplane! is often seen as the original and by some the best spoof comedy film of all time. Starring Robert Hays, Julie Hagerty and Leslie Nielsen. Airplane! sees a group of colourful characters take a routine flight from Los Angeles to Chicago which goes horribly wrong after a unknown sickness spreads, forcing a PTSD stricken war hero into the cockpit to land the plane and save the lives of all on board. Airplane! is known for its use of fast-paced slapstick humour, both visual and verbal gags and puns as well as its over the top, surreal humour. Airplane! never attempts to take itself seriously and thats why it succeeds so well, this film will have your eyes-watering and sides-splitting from laughing so hard. Airplane! is a hugely funny movie and has a surprising amount of character depth and back story (this often being the highlight of much of the humour). A few flaws with the film could really depend on the viewers style of comedy, the slap-stick humour can at times go a bit too far and come off as more stupid than funny. There are also a few times (although not many) where some jokes fail and leave you cringing more than laughing.

289,Idolprincess,Very funny,8,14 July 2004,"It's strange how types of stories that touch people change according to the era we live in. I think the same thing can be said about comedies. What was funny in the 1980's wasn't what is considered funny now, and vice versa. Airplane! is a good example of this phenomenon. This is a movie that used to please everyone back in the 80's, but today only people with a certain sense of humor would find it funny. This proves again that many different types of humor exist. What is so special about ""Airplane!"" is that it defines a genre, a type of humor created by David Zucker. This type of brainless, completely absurd and sometimes unpolitically correct without being offensive humor is something you won't find anywhere else now. This type of parody was also something new at the time. It also clearly wasn't influenced by the other popular comedy movies of the late 70's and of 1980 such as Caddyshack. It's a very different type of humor, and that's why I think it's so great. In my opinion, it's not stupid to call it a historical movie for that reason.
This is one of my favorite movies ever, because I love this type of humor. I didn't stop laughing through the whole movie, and I can honestly say that I believe this is one of the greatest comedies of all time. Maybe it created a genre that is sometimes seen as stupid or repetitive, but it's still a movie that's worth seeing in my opinion.

298,avsroxbronxfan,"Not bad, but overrated",6,12 October 2012,"People often think this is one of the funniest movies ever made. My best friend says this is one of his all time favorite movies. I sat down to watch this today, and I do not agree. It has some good jokes, however. I like the part where this little boy on board goes up to a little girl and offers her coffee, and she has him sit next to her. He asks if she wants cream and she says ""No thanks. I take my coffee black, like my men."" That is GENIUS. But there's a lot of gags in the movie, for the most part, in my opinion, aren't funny. For example, like the other people that Striker talked to, this one Asian guy covered himself with gasoline and nearly lit himself on fire after talking to him. There's also this one older lady who hung herself after talking to Striker. To me, that's not very funny. The movie is full of gags and other things trying to be funny. Some parts of it work, but others (to me) don't. This isn't a bad movie, but I think it's very overrated. It's not one of my favorite comedies. Sorry guys, that's just my opinion.",Airplane!

300,pvilleguy,sterling spoof,8,5 May 2006,"I don't want to add just another cheerleader comment about how well done this movie is. Following on the heels of all the high-budget, star-studded disaster epics of the 1970's (""Airport"" and its sequels, ""Earthquake,"" ""The Towering Inferno,"" etc.), the time was ripe for a spoof. The cast of ""Airplane!"" is itself star-studded, but in an off-beat kind of way. Lloyd Bridges and Robert Stack were at the time the film was made, character actors best known for TV roles, as was Leslie Nielsen (who seemed to be an almost weekly TV villain in ""Hawaii 5-0,"" ""Cannon"" and the other detective shows of the 70's). Bridges, Stack and Nielsen all played the stereotypical heroic roles in disaster movies with a great flair for the melodramatic and with a perfect deadpan solemnity that made the ridiculous things they said and did all the more funny. None of the jokes here have to be explained; that helps make the movie a comedic masterpiece. Of course ""Airplane!"" spawned a sequel and other films attempting similar humor. Of those imitators, the ""Naked Gun"" films, starring Nielsen as Lt. Frank Drebbin, come close to matching the layers of humor that permeate ""Airplane!"", but ""Airplane!"" is the original, still funny after all these years, all the imitations and all the attempts to quote it around the water cooler notwithstanding.",Airplane!

But one of the two meals served on board is infected, and soon half of the passengers  and all pilots, fall severely sick. Only one person can land the plane  a passenger, who used to pilot a jet fighter during the war and was so traumatized by the experience that he had refused to even approach a plane until that night. Interesting situations arise, both on board and in the control tower. An ironical mixture of 'Airport' and '727 calls Vancouver', with bits and pieces of classics just to make fun of them, this movie is just hilarious.

Truly the zenith of the genre.The film comes off so funny because at no point do the actors let themselves in on the joke.  It takes the plot of ""Flight Into Danger"" and plays it straight for laughs, punching holes in all of the plot gaps and cliched dialogue that have plagued the suspense movie and the disaster movie for decades before it.  It probably killed the ""Airport"" series outright, a feat that had only been accomplished by ""Blazing Saddles"" (which killed the Western) before it.  However, where ""Saddles"" went for the laughs big time and suffers from overacting, all the gags of ""Airplane!"" are throwaways and the actors, although caught in a melodrama of epic proportions, keep their emotions tightly in check.  Those who don't got slapped silly.  Perfectly cast is Julie Haggerty whose anxious manner and tiny voice keep a check on lines that any other actress would play to the hilt (""By the way, does anyone back there know how to fly a plane?"").Unfortunately, the sequel deliberately went for laughs and fell a little flat.  Moreover, the remainder of the Abrhams Abrhams Zucker films, although great in their way, forgot the formula that made the first such a classic. The only thing that comes close is the original ""Police Squad"" television series with Peter Lupus in the role O.J. Simpson practiced his acting skills on.",Airplane!

EVERYBODY did their part... like, study the scene in the night club (Saturday Night Fever parody) - when I look at it now - that had to be so well rehearsed and EVERYBODY did their thing. Also, the fact that most of the cast had been known for dramas up to that point like Julie Hagerty, Leslie Nielsen, Peter Graves, Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges all will make you bust a gut at some point in the film. For one, I don't know how anyone could keep a straight face around Leslie Nielsen. I would love to see the outtakes. Truly a gem.

Personal favorite scenes include the rowdy bar -with fighting girlscouts- in which Ted sees Elaine for the first time, notably the bit where Ted takes of his Travolta jacket and throws it away before striking the famous pose, only to see his jacket being thrown back into his face makes me laugh again and again, even when typing this.And that other great scene, maybe the funniest of ANY movie, the one where the kid gets a look into the cockpit and subsequently gets bombarded with the most bizarre questions by Captain Clarence Oveur.

319,MrBallroom,A Modern American Classsic for the Ages!!!,10,22 August 2005,"The first time I saw this was at a sneak peek with my fiancée in 1980. I laughed so hard that it drove Deseret News film critic Christopher Hicks nuts; I believe he had to come back a second night  as did most of us  in order to catch most of the gags, they were flying at us so fast and furious.The genius in this film existed in multiple places and at multiple levels: The Zucker Brothers were able to sell Paramount Pictures on the script of spoofing disaster movies  that was their first big sell  and then, they were able to stand up to studio pressure and not place comedic actors in the roles, but rather, long known dramatic actors who had never before done comedy, thus launching a few new careers, most notably Leslie Nielsen  who before then had best been for his role in the television series of the 1960's The Bold Ones.What we got is the stuff of which legends were made: Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack, Peter Graves, and Kareem Abdul-Jabaar of the Los Angeles Lakers. Even Jill Whelan of The Love Boat was able to get in on the act by playing a pediatric patient in need of surgery across the country. This movie took non-stop slapstick to a new level never before traveled to. It made fun of so many films  both disaster and non-disaster flicks  which you needed a scorecard in order to keep track of how many.Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty were simply brilliant in their roles as the star-crossed (or should I say star cross-eyed) lovers who just weren't quite the right fit for one another. Look for cameo appearances by Barbara Billingsley in a role that will surprise you, Jimmie Walker (CBS'Good Times in the 1970's); and for Ethel Merman. I won't tell you where he appears in the film. They will simply crack you up! This is a film that you will want to check out for a week on DVD rental for at least a week in order to catch all the gags and full subtleties and not-so-subtleties of the humor involved. After rental, you will want to BUY a copy of the DVD to keep.Already honored by the American Film Institute as one of the Top 100 films of all time, this truly is a modern American classic! On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this film an 11/10. ***",Airplane!

It was recommended to us as ""the best comedy ever"", but after watching first 20 minutes of it, neither of us (other than opening credits with mocking ""Jaws"") laughed at all (more of a nervous grins if anything). I kind of felt I was meant to be laughing from people rather than with them, which I typically don't like to do. I switched the movie off after the scene in witch little girl declared: "" I like my coffee just like my men, black"", was the joke inappropriate yes, but was it funny?Long story short, we decided to watch ""Jaws"" instead and to be honest we found it way more humorous than ""Airplane!"". Looks like killer shark horror story aged way better than its counterpart, even in comedy department.To summarize: I find "" Airplane!"" a very dated movie, which quite often what it feels like, forces you to laugh at even intervals, which ends up being a similar feeling to getItng your picture taken when photographer says ""Cheese!"".

Obviously, neither one reaches ""daddy"", that matches exactly in the disaster-films scenario that crowded the late 70's. Leslie Nielsen probably has the part of a lifetime (I guess he is even better than on ""Police Squad""), as a doctor aboard the plane. There's also Lloyd Bridges, as a freaky air traffic controller, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as one of the airplane crew members, and Robert Hays as a psycho war veteran who is drafted in the middle of the flight to replace the orginal pilot.Jim Abrahams and David Zucker made, in this film, a masterpiece. ""Airplane!"" inspires comedy films until today, almost 20 years after its release. Some great sequences: the wife of the pilot sleeping with a horse, Robert Hays spoofing John Travolta in ""Saturday Night Fever"", Leslie Nielsen and several others passengers, including a nun, a Hare Krishna and a boxing fighter, trying to calm down a hysterical passenger by hitting her, Lloyd Bridges sniffing glue and ""getting high"", Julie Hagerty trying to fill the automatic pilot with air by blowing it, and Robert Hayes sweating during the landing.If you never had a good hour and a half of non-stop laughing, and is curious about the feelings of it, ""Airplane!"" is my hint.",Airplane!

338,entertheratking,40 years later...,9,7 July 2020,"And this movie is still clever, relevant, and laugh out loud funny. Considering how slapstick, simple, and elementary much of the humor is, combined with the numerous references to 70s pop culture that many might miss today, this is an extremely impressive feat. One of the best parody movies of all time, if not THE best, and I will argue that all the way until this plane lands.",Airplane!
339,pharmhog,Don't call me Shirleys,9,4 February 2006,"I remember seeing this film when it came to the theaters. I must've been 12 or 13 years old. It was one of the first movies I ever saw with my mother. It was the late show and mom was hoping she could keep her eyes open. From the get go, this was hilarious. Mom did not complain about sleepiness at all from that point forward.There are just so many memorable lines in this film: from ""don't call me Shirley"" to ""looks like I picked a bad week to stop smoking"". The gags just keep coming. Not to mention, there are films which are spoofed upon like Saturday Night Fever, From Here to Eternity, and Jaws are just a few of the sight gags in Airplane!.If you like parodies, you'll love this film. Although it's been 25 years since it was first released, you still hear people quoting lines from the movie. They may not know where it came from, but it has become ingrained in the American psyche.Airplane! was originally rated PG. By today's standards, it would probably garner a PG-13 rating.www.firsttakepodcast.com",Airplane!
340,jte6451,Airplane! Review,9,4 March 2019,"""Surely you cant be serious."" - Ted Striker
""I am serious... and don't call me Shirley."" - Dr. RumackIt has been years since I last saw Airplane!, but after seeing it again as an adult, I believe that it's not only a great movie, but it's probably one of the funniest comedies ever made. I can't tell you how many times that I laughed at all the funny jokes and quoting memorable lines.In a parody of the airplane-focused disaster movies from the 70s, namely the Airport series, the plot follows Ted Striker, an ex-military pilot who suffers from fear of flying due to his experience in the war, is having relationship problems with his girlfriend Elaine, who wants Ted to move on from the past, but leaves him when he refuses to let go of the past. Determined to win her back, Ted boards a flight where Elaine now works as a flight attendant. However, a bad case of food poisoning from one of the flight's meals causes half of the people on board, including the flight crew, to fall into illness. As a result, it's now up to Ted, being the only one on board with flight experience, to overcome his fears in order to safely land the plane and save the passengers.The comedy is what really makes this movie shine, and the jokes still holds up to this day nearly 40 years later. Most of the jokes still gets me laughing every time; they're witty, hilarious, satirical, charming, even a bit of dark humor. It takes a genre that is known for being serious and makes light of it in a humorous way that only directors Jim Abrahams & David & Jerry Zucker can pull off.I've also noticed some visual humor that I've never noticed before first time watching, but now I've noticed new gags and humor, both visual and verbal, each time that I watch it. It's also amazing how a PG rated movie from 1980 can get away with one boob shot in it and still be PG, whereas nowadays one simple boob shot in a movie would almost instantly be R rated.The cast gives their performances surprisingly well, in particular Leslie Nielsen. It's pretty amazing how they managed to place these actors in a ridiculously silly scenario and somehow manages to deliver funny lines while keeping a straight face on. Speaking of which, the lines themselves are both funny and memorable.""Joey, have you ever been in a Turkish prison?""""This woman has to be gotten to a hospital."" ""A hospital? What is it?"" ""It's a big building with patients, but that's not important right now.""""Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.""""Captain, how soon can you land?"" ""I can't tell."" ""You can tell me. I'm a doctor."" ""No. I mean I'm just not sure."" ""Well, can't you take a guess?"" ""Well, not for another two hours."" ""You can't take a guess for another two hours?""Overall, while it may be kinda dated now and a few jokes may seem cringeworthy, Airplane! still manages to hold up as one of the all time classic comedies. The parody film genre may seem dead now, but I hope future comedies can be this cleverly written and smartly constructed as this one was 4 decades ago.Final Verdict: 9/10 with an Epic Seal of Awesomeness",Airplane!

There are sooo many famous lines, scenes without lines, in this movie!My favorite character is the crazy airport worker named Johnny. My most favorite quote of his is ""Just Kidding"" as he gives a bright smile while re-plugging in the runway lights! LOL! Hilarious!

The cast is fantastic, the jokes hilarious and almost constant.One of the best things about Airplane that I have found is that the jokes are not all obvious, and because of this it has far more re-watchability than most comedies, as every time you watch it you pick up on more of the subtler jokes and background sight gags.It is a film that manages to cater for almost all tastes in humour, from dry wit to slapstick via spoofery and dark humour. If you haven't seen this film you MUST watch it. This is one of those few films that everybody can enjoy. It's fairly rare to find a comedy the whole family can enjoy, most are either unsuitable for children or too childish for adults, but Airplane manages to find that balance where all ages can enjoy it.In conclusion, if you have yet to see this film, watch it. If you have seen it, watch it again.",Airplane!

356,doodygray,Shirley one of the best comedies ever made,10,19 January 2007,"'Airplane!' is rightly regarded as the being the pinnacle of all comedy films. It is, in my opinion, even better than any of the 4 Python films, and that's coming from a big Python fan.There is nothing dislikeable about this - of course the humour is not always hugely intelligent, but as long as it's funny who cares? And 'Airplane!' is very, very funny. The sheer amount of gags is incredible - I could watch it over and over again and still find something new every time. For instance, during the fourth time of watching it, I noticed that there was a very short clip of the captain sitting with a giant eagle right next to his head. Probably loses a bit in translation, but it's just these little things that you may not notice the first time. And of you don't like one joke, you don't have to wait long for the next one to come along.There's every type of comedy in this film: slapstick, wordplay, physical comedy, melodrama - I could go on (Dont worry, I won't). I can't see how anyone with at least some sense of humour can fail to find it funny, and there's not a lot of films that you can say that about.All of the performances are wonderful - particularly Leslie Nielsen being delightfully deadpan as Dr. Rumack and Stephen Stucker as the slightly deranged Johnny. The great thing about this film is that it never tries to be anything other than what it is - a comedy film. You often get films that try to bridge so many genres they seem to lose all point. But this one doesn't. It is, and always will be, a comedy classic.",Airplane!
357,mikeslant,Truly a masterpiece of off the wall comedy!,10,27 January 2002,"Just about the funniest comedy ever, ""Airplane!"" makes you laugh till it hurts as it spoofs religous zealots, t.v. commercials, and plenty of movies, from ""Casablanca"" to ""The Poseidon Adventure"". From the great ZAZ team (David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, Jerry Zucker) who gave us every spoof from ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" and ""Top Secret!"" to the ""Naked Gun"" series.And ""Airplane!"" is the best of them all. Its hard to find a movie that you can see 4 or 5 times in a short period of time and is still quite funny. The film is over 20 years old, and hasn't aged much at all. It still packs the laughs, as well as great sight gags and one-liners. From the great 'Dont call me Shirley' and 'Co-Pilot' gags, to the hilarious spoof of ""Saturday Night Fever"", the movie is flat out hilarious.In my mind, the sequel, whil e still funny, was a disappointment because it just didnt pack what the original did.I guess no movie ever will. The actors are great too, from the start of Leslie Neilson's stupid/funny movie career, to the start of Lloyd Bridges in the genre. The only film that even comes close to being as funny as the great ""Airplane!"" is another ZAZ masterpiece, ""Top Secret!"". Other notibles are the first ""Naked Gun"" and Pat Proft's and Jim Abrahams' ""Hot Shots!:Part Duex"". Surely ""Airplane!"" will go down as just about the funniest movie of all time, but dont call me Shirley!.",Airplane!

360,abralive,"Airplane (1980) Peter Graves, Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack",6,10 February 2005,"To say that ""Airplane"" is a whacked-out, goofy, non-sensical and hilarious motion picture is a gross understatement. These terms cannot even come close to describing it. You'll just have to see it for yourself. Every time you might try to find a sequence even remotely resembling a serious moment, forget it. It just won't happen.This movie is a psychological revelation. You have four of the most talented, serious character actors performing roles that, traditionally in their careers, would have been unheard of and unthought of early on. But here you have them, Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack, Leslie Nielsen and Peter Graves in reciprocally roles so polarized you wouldn't have recognized them twenty years ago. In other words, having acted out so many serious roles all of those years, these veterans couldn't wait to act goofy, irreverent and downright rude. Lloyd Bridges sniffing glue as his hair flairs out then jumping out a window, Peter Graves releasing gas and throwing up on his control console and Leslie Nielsen witnessing Julie Haggerty doing something with a balloon auto-pilot that...well, shouldn't be done.There is no point in my trying to review plots and scripts because there simply aren't any. Just suffice it to say that if you have a couple of spare hours to do absolutely nothing than to absorb yourself in total hilarious nonsense, you should have a great time.(Warning: Although the Motion Picture Association Of America rated this motion picture PG (Parental Guidance)rather than PG-13, some material may be unsuitable for younger children.

Films like Scary Movie and the 90's Lesile Neilson films were the spawns of these and many more. Anyone not seeing the film should be shot. With some of the funniest stuff I have ever seen Airplane! just makes me cry laughing whenever I see it. Surly it can't do that every time right? It can and you will not call me Shirly. With Strikers drinking problem and the two Jive talking guys this is the trip of a lifetime because all the normal people on that plane could have died. If anyone was normal.

Perhaps I had heard the name Zero Hour associated with it, but since I had never seen that, I never gave it much thought. Today I saw Zero Hour for the first time. Airplane is a carbon copy of the plot, and very close to the dialog, as well. If anything, the Airport series must have been a reboot of Zero Hour, No Highway in the Sky, and perhaps other similar 1950's movies.I'll enjoy Airplane! even more the next time I watch it based on having seen Zero Hour.

It's much more than just a disaster movie parody - there are other targets for spoofing (perhaps most notably, Saturday Night Fever) but there is also some great slapstick, satire, visual humour and wordplay. The actors are brilliant, most of them playing their characters with straight faces. I particularly like Robert Stack as the deadly serious Captain Kramer.

383,alexkoriakin,Thank God it's Only a Motion Picture!,7,1 October 2015,"As rightly noted by the authors of the previous reviews, this film is a debut of the great American trio Zucker — Abrahams — Zucker. In it, they tried to make fun of all the old movies about aviation, such as ""Airport"" 1975 and 1977.Movies links one, exactly one — the original Author Arthur Hailey, who wrote the piece ""Runway 08"". This is a wonderful novel about a plane in which pilots, flight engineer and some passengers fainted. However, there is a doctor and a military pilot trying to save the doomed ship. And if the work is intended for Haley's empathy with the characters, the film attempts to entertain the audience. Moreover, this attempt is made in the style of absurd humor that is in harmony with puns and political pranks, later to become the ""visiting card"" of the Director's trio.Director of satire showed that even a plane crash might not seem so awful, if you add a little bit of props makes this film one of the best movies-parodies of the 20th century. But the Director of the jokes are not so funny if it's not acting. It makes me smile. But the highlight of this movie is Leslie Nielsen. This role solidified his status as a comic double after the series ""Police squad!"". Yes, he's naive, Yes, it's a little silly, but it perfectly complements the film. Looking a bit ahead, I will say that after ""flight"" three ""naked gun"" film Directors who have become Zucker and Abrahams.Personally I liked the movie Director humor on the world aviation of those times.This film I would put at 6.9 out of 10, but since IMDb it is impossible to put these estimates give 7 out of 10",Airplane!

It's also nice to see how small details are used. Like thunders that sound each time when doctor says some dramatic line. And what I admire are scenes and lines that are completely irrelevant and stupid and yet very funny, it reminds me of Monty Python's.

393,darkmarshall,In A Word: Amazing!,9,13 February 2015,"I saw this movie for the first time today. I know, I know. The rock I was under was pretty enormous...I feel sorry for the old me. The ""me"" that had existed before seeing the movie Airplane! I thought I knew what ""funny"" was. I had no idea what-so-ever...First off all: I generally HATE spoof movies. They tend to be so ridiculous that I can't find something to care about. Don't get wrong, there are very funny spoofs out there (Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles, Kung Fu Hustle, Monty Python's ""fill in the blank""... just to name a few), but the vast majority of the recent spoof movies tend to... well... suck. They suck as much as that sentence sucks. As for the Cornetto films; I put them in the same ballpark as Airplane! Not the same league, but they're definitely playing the same sport.Airplane! has pretty much everything going for it. The main film they are making fun of is Airport (which felt like a soap-opera film to me...), which had a plot that was very flexible. When spoofing a film, a flexible plot is very helpful. While most people agree that Airplane! has a weak story, I disagree. Airplane! has a simple story with amazing characters in it.In a film like this the story is always less important than the jokes, but unlike other spoofs, they don't abandon the story. The story moves along, the characters learn (granted, from absurd situations), and great jokes are played out. The mood of the film never changes despite the crazy s**t that occurs in the film. No matter how many times Leslie Nielsen says, ""Good luck. We're all counting on you"", the mood stays grounded in some semblance of reality. Sure, we're all laughing our asses off, but the reason we KEEP laughing our asses off is that we have become invested in the simple story.My ONLY gripe is the autopilot scene at the very end. It seemed out of place. Every other joke, no matter how over-the-top, was rooted in a sense of reality except for that one scene. Even when Julie Hagerty had to... um... ""blow"" up the autopilot, the film merely suggested the autopilot enjoyed it by putting a lit cigarette in its mouth. Ultimately, it was still ""inanimate"" at that point; all that could be proved was that Julie Hagerty was pretty kinky.That nit-pick aside, the film is flat out hilarious. Some jokes are dated, but the film itself is almost, by design, dated. Even if you never saw the movie Airport, the film still works. Most of the pop culture references are pretty subtle, while the word play and slapstick take center stage.If you're an idiot like me and have not seen this film: treat yourself immediately. Without a film like Airplane!, disco might've lived forever.",Airplane!

And I am not wearing any nostalgia goggles, I watched this movie a little over four years back and I rewatched it today and it was still hilarious. I just don't understand why everybody writing a comedy these days feel the need to make it either a dramedy or a rom com. Newsflash guys, your movie taking itself seriously doesn't equate it to a well written movie or an intelligent comedy by any measure. People need to understand that are different types of comedy and the the general perception about any single one of those sub genres is dictated by the percentage that were put in the right hands. I can't even imagine something like Monty Python being created these days. Nobody seems to appreciate movies for what they are. Everything has to be a crime-drama to even qualify for the eligibility to be called a masterpiece no matter the effort or the originality. Anything close to this we get to see today is either a cheap parody movie or a ton of uninspired, unfunny and formulaic parody videos on YouTube with little to no effort or talent behind them. This is a slapstick comedy and it fully embraces it. I have watched hundreds of comedies and the fact that this decades old movie still feels fresh really says something about it.

This most recent time I noticed the jars of mayonnaise behind the doctor at the Mayo clinic. Some comedies are ""a laugh a minute"", but Airplane is more accurately described as ""a laugh every 10 seconds"". Most everyone born in the last 20 years or so will not understand all the cultural references so I doubt it will have the same effect on them as is does on us old-timers. Nevertheless, this film was the high point of the Zucker/Abrams/Zucker comic triumvirate, topping their brilliant, ground-breaking ""Kentucky Fried Movie (1977)"" - all their subsequent films, ""Police Squad!

The film's dialogue is spectacular, and deliveries from seasoned actors such as Leslie Nielsen and Lloyd Bridges make the movie that much better. On top of that, the seriousness with which Leslie Nielsen portrays his character is wonderful. The subtle jokes, the background scenery, the silliness of the spoof, that's what sets this movie apart from almost all others.

400,lteag,The Quintessential spoof movie incorporating several popular films and the history of the times into its comedy. Unique and Original,9,19 November 2009,"Airplane was hilarious and (in 1980) original in how it simply created spoofs of contemporary movies and situations. The Zucker Brothers are masters of the visual pun. (Spoiler Alert) The ""Hi, Jack;"" ""S*** will hit the fan;"" ""Drinking problem;"" and ""Let's pour some lights on the runway"" gags are typical examples of this. Although this is not the first time this has ever been seen -- remember Kentucky Fried Movie by the Zucker Bros. came out years earlier -- it is the first time it has been seen in the mainstream. The first time I saw the movie, I was 8 yrs. old and laughed my head off for its immature humor. I still enjoy this movie today (also because of its immature humor) because things that were way over my head at that age, I laugh at now. (Although I saw it in the theater at age 8, it is not recommended entirely for that audience). This movie has become a part of our popular culture. This movie has a staying power that is measured in quotability, kind of like The Big Lebowski or Saturday Night Live skits are. Think of how many times you can slip ""Surely, you can't be serious"" into conversations and have somebody know enough to answer ""Stop calling me Shirley."" It entertains every time you see it, because you might catch a detail that you missed or didn't remember from the time before. Excellent comedy that launched the genre that is hit or miss with several other filmmakers. Also permanently typecast Leslie Nielsen as a goof ball, slapstick comic actor.

In the 26 years since, I have been to more movies than I can count, and I have not heard a theater full of people laugh like they did during Airplane. At the time, it was the funniest thing on the screen. And an added plus is that we gained two of the most gifted comedy actors as a result of that movie...Leslie Nielsen and Lloyd Bridges. Robert stack was a riot as well, but he didn't do as much afterward as Bridges and Nielsen.The main thing I see in negative reviews here seems to point out that most people who don't like it don't get it. That is because there is nothing to get. You don't 'get' it, you just watch it. Of they complain about Leslie Nielsen doing his same old comedy style. In Airplane, that wasn't his same comedy style. Until that time he had never done any comedy so it was all new.Airplane is a true classic. At its release it was the number 1 comedy film going, and 26 years later it is still one of the top ten comedy movies ever made. I can't imagine anybody not having seen it, at least in part on TV, but if you haven't, watch it the next chance you get.

I was at the local YMCA today and I think it must have been ""naked man day"" in the men's locker room. I walked in to change clothes and everywhere I turned there was a naked man. I burst into laughter because the first thing that came to my mind was Peter Graves saying to Joey, ""You ever seen a grown man naked?"" I still tell people, ""and don't call me Shirley"" and every time I hear someone say, ""the blank's gonna hit the fan"" I think of that scene and laugh. This movie is unforgettable.I think it's interesting that two of the all time biggest movie surprises in history were from two films made in the same year. 1980 saw ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and it's totally shocking, surprising Darth Vader line of ""No. I am your father."" I rank that as the biggest movie surprise of all time. And then of course there was June Cleaver/Barbara Billingsley walking up and saying, ""Oh stewardess, I speak jive."" I don't care who you are, if you were in a movie theater back in 1980 when this movie first came out and you hadn't heard about this scene yet then you fell out of your chair laughing because back then there was no one more unlikely on the planet Earth to walk up and speak jive than June Cleaver. We had no VCR's or DVD's. You went to the show or you watched TV. All of us spending money at the movie theaters were kids growing up in the 60's and 70's watching ""Leave It To Beaver"". That was one of the most shocking, surprising brilliant pieces of comedy ever done in movie history.I just love this movie. It's one of those where every time you watch it you catch something else. When you're having a bad day put this movie on and laugh until you cry. I would have loved to have been at the table with the writers of this movie when they were making all of this up. I don't know if they sat around drinking coffee, beers, whiskey or whatever but they sure must have had fun writing this.

Sometimes comedy is about timing; the well timed line can be devastatingly funny and when a trio of skilled comics are playing off one another the consequent synergy can be electric. This happens more than once in Airplane, in fact, it happens so often that there is comic relief from the non-stop comedy. Brilliant! All of the disaster movies of the 60's and 70's are parodied here, and pokes are made at sports figures, popular causes and all manner of popular stereotypes of the day.

It's absurd, hilarious, and remains just as funny with every watch. The movie shows the story of Ted Striker, a former war pilot, and his mission to win back the love of Elaine, a flight attendant. While on the flight, disaster strikes and the pilots on the flight become extremely ill and it's up to Ted to overcome his fear of flying and save the day.The plot is just one part of the movie, though. The rest of the hour and twenty eight minute film is filled to the brim with various forms of humor. Personally, ""Airplane!"" stands out to me as one of the silliest and most enjoyable comedy movies I've ever watched. While the humor might not be to everyone's taste, those who can appreciate it will be heavily rewarded with many laughs. The dialogue and visual jokes fly by one after another, keeping up this fast paced comedy the whole time. Whether it's slapstick, witty one- liners, puns, unexpected twists, or anything else, it's hard to find too many jokes in this movie that fall short of greatness.The movie is essentially a spoof of the 1957 film ""Zero Hour!"". While this is true, ""Airplane!"" provides to be more than just a spoof of one movie. It has various parodies, references, and recurring jokes that give it a unique charm.Overall, ""Airplane!"" is a goofy, reliable, and proves itself to be one of the funniest movies of its type. No other movie I've seen quite compares to the humor and mood that this film presents. ""The Naked Gun"" comes close, but it just doesn't quite reach the same level of rewatchability that this movie achieves. This is a memorable,extremely quotable, and near-perfectly executed spoof movie that I would recommend everyone watch at least once in their lifetime.",Airplane!
410,Reel_Time_Reviews,"Reel Time Reviews ""Airplane! (1980)""",7,27 January 2016,"Airplane! is an absurdist comedy from 1980"" A man afraid to fly must ensure that a plane lands safely after the pilots become sick.""What makes a comedy good? The answer differs from person to person but if you asked me what makes a comedy good, I would probably just reply with Monty Python. Although Airplane! is not Monty Python, they both follow the same style of comedy by focusing on absurd and random events and bringing humour into each scene. Airplane! followed the same structure as what I would define makes a comedy good and this particular style is the reason I enjoyed it so much.The plot was easy to follow and the characters were not complex, which allows for a smooth following of the movie. The downside to its age is that some jokes can be confusing due to the irrelevance of what era we live in today, which did cause some confusion at times. Otherwise most jokes were employed through action rather than dialogue, although the very common pun was noticeable quite often throughout majority of the film. What seemed like a sappy romance story at the start quickly changed into a suspenseful flight full of racist stereotypes, suicide and poisonous fish. The protagonist, Ted Stiker, must overcome his fear of flying and land a plane while trying to persuade ""the girl of his dreams"" to stay with him. However it's a bit hard to do any of that when most of the passengers (and crew members) get sick after eating infected fish. We watch as Ted tells his dramatic, long and emotional story of his days back in the Air Force, which leads to some rather dark humorous takes at suicide.Aside from the occasional joke that makes very little sense to this current generation, there are times when the movie did become rather slow and I just wanted it to end. The finale of the movie involves an intense landing sequence of the plane, but for me I found the last 20 minutes to be rather boring. There were still jokes in the last 20 minutes, but they were either recycled jokes from earlier in the movie or they just failed to make me laugh. The very final scene in the movie shows a flawless character, who only played a very minor role throughout the film, fly the crashed plane into the sky with his ""girlfriend"". While Ted stays on the ground with ""the girl of his dreams"" we watch as the inflatable auto-pilot flies the plane into the sky before giving a quick wink to the people down below.The movie was full of jokes and absurd material that I thoroughly enjoyed, however for me it is not a movie that I would watch again and again. The characters were not particularly interesting and it was, sadly, only the jokes that kept me watching. The last 20 minutes dragged on and introduced characters that I felt were unnecessary. I did enjoy it for the most part and it really does capture the absurdist nature of comedy.7.1/10~Reel Time Reviews",Airplane!
411,snowflakebound,"Some funny moments, but surprisingly dirty.",4,26 April 2009,"I was not impressed with this film in any way. The slapstick humor seemed overly done and there were many dirty jokes that I felt did not belong in the story. Honestly, I was bored after about twenty minutes of watching this film and could not wait for it to end. Although there are a few truly amusing jokes, the story itself is boring. If anyone is looking for a better comedy watch ""What's Up Doc?"" with Barbara Streisand and Ryan O'Neal. There are no offensive jokes and the story is actually engaging. Or better yet, watch the Marx Brothers films, they are true slapstick without the filth that you get in this film. On the whole, this movie is forgettable, I doubt that I'll ever waste time watching it again.",Airplane!

The 1st time we saw this movie, on cable, not long after it came out, we were rolling with laughter! This movie was one of the all-time best, with Lloyd Bridges, and that crazy air traffic controllers' scenes were the funniest. With every line of the movie having a comeback, and another meaning--this movie ranks up there with the pool scene in Caddyshack as one of the best--you're rolling with laughter! With Lloyd Bridges slowly going insane throughout the movie, with an all-star cast including Robert Hayes,very funny, they even had Ethel Merman doing a cameo, (not long before her death), it was hilarious.

Having recently watched it again, it doesn't stand the test of time as much as I might have liked. It's not the fault of the film, it's just that time has moved on and what was funny then isn't funny now.Having said that, it has its moments that still have me laughing out loud, and the sight and dialogue gags come so thick and fast that you have to watch the film more than once as you won't get them all the first time round.The main characters are very likable, and it's a joy to see some normally straight actors sending themselves up. Lloyd Bridges is particularly funny, constantly giving up various bad habits. I do wish they'd scrapped Johnny from the ground crew though, as he was extremely unfunny and annoying.Some of the highlights for me were the ""Saturday Night Fever"" take off, the taxi driver at the beginning and the end, and Ted's flashbacks.I watched this recently with my teenage children, who are not much younger than I was when I first saw it, and they both fell asleep.

It was very original and fresh at the time when it came out.

The numerous cameos by famous people of the day is just such a treat to see! The comedy works by introducing small motifs that are repeated to increasingly hilarious effect, although i can imagine how it could become tiresome if you aren't in the mood - although for me never. The surreal touches work a treat too, like seeing the captain's wife in bed with a horse, and the footage when whoever it is is driving to the airport while being attacked by stampedes. The acting and comic timing is an absolute treat, and the merciless attitude to political correctness is razor sharp.They just don't make em like this anymore.",Airplane!
436,deannab92,Utilizing media literacy skills to construct a reflection of the film,8,1 October 2012,"On the hunt for a nonsensical, comedic adventure? Airplane fits the bill. Its literal depictions and interpretations keep the laughter rolling. Frantic Ted purchases a plane ticket and the woman behind the counter asks whether he would like smoking or nonsmoking- he replies with the preference of smoking. The woman behind the desk proceeds to hand him a ticket with smoke rolling out of every crack as if this occurrence was as natural as waking up in the morning. Taking an everyday saying and communicating it literally through the actors and the acting effectively translates into comical media; this has enlightened me to the various phrases I often use but never really stop to think why I say them. This realization can help me develop better understandings of the world and my interactions with others.People often enjoy laughing at their life situation or habits. It can translate to the awareness of the waste of the way people live. A scene from the film even depicts people as cargo as they slide down the automatic luggage shoot and around the monotonous conveyor belt to search for their bags. The ridiculous English to Spanish translations, drug-addicted chief, and overblown stereotypes reveal the thematic element of the deconstruction of modernity. Society incessantly thrusts towards automatism and electronic functions. The film pokes fun of social realities, but effectively transforms them into comedy; the comedic qualities elicit genuine confusion yet hilarity, sort of like The Three Stooges. Society seems to progress, but not as quickly as most believe it to. Evidence of cultural tensions emerges, but Airplane executes this in a way that nearly no one would take offense. Social prejudice continually presents itself as an issue, just as the film presents the Air Israel plane as it sports a beard, scarf, and yarmulke, or the two dark-skinned men talking in Jive. Awkward moments happen, but comedy abounds as the tension relief. Comedies often utilize the technique of irony, and accordingly evidence of this bursts throughout Airplane. For example, when Ted falls madly in love with Elaine at the dance, the song ""Stayin' Alive"" breaks out of the jukebox, but people around them drop dead like flies. Also, Kareem Abdul Jabar's character's name (Roger) relates a radio conversational term, hence creating zoo-like confusion over the pilot chatter. ""Do you roger, Roger?"" The film uses flashback sequences to delineate Elaine and Ted's tale of love, but mostly when not in a flashback scene, Elaine avoids Ted. Their relationship rekindles as the story ensues. The way Ted gawks at Elaine and reminisces to the unfortunate folks nearby about his and Elaine's relationship relates that he still has feelings for her.The airplane setting presents a confined area for the action to occur, in return creating the potential for conflict. Absurdity bounces off every wall as characters act unpredictably; the situation of a disaster feels realistic but the hyperbolized actions make it jocular. What other movie would have a jumping heart ready for transplanting, an inflatable copilot, or arguing instructors at the loading zone?",Airplane!

It goes by taking too much a literal sense which results in rather humorous results. There's also quite a bit of adult humor that just might go over the kiddies's heads that adults no doubt will get a kick out of. The most hilarious comedy of the 80's. Every actor makes this a watchable film with all kinds of hilarious and memorable performances.

Koch, then President of Paramount and President of the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences. Howard was one of three screenwriters of the movie Casablanca, and had produced and directed over 40 major motion pictures at that time. Howard was also a former President of Fox Studios. I was discussing the movie industry as a business. Howard laughed and said that the movie industry was not a business, but was about as much a business as playing roulette in Las Vegas. I then asked him what was the most profitable movie that he had ever made. He roared laughing and said, ""the movie Airplane!"" He said, ""John, the first thing you have to understand is that the average movie produced at Paramount costs forty million dollars. There came a time about 1979 or 80 that no movies were being made here for a six week period. I hated having all this overhead cost and no movie being made. I checked our budget and we only had four and half million dollars not earmarked for another movie that year. I called my key people to my office and told them that whatever actors were on the studio lot that day were going to start shooting a movie the next day. I told my writers that they had to have the script for the first day of shooting the next morning and then had to keep one day ahead of the filming for the next six weeks. I said I didn't care what the movie as about.At the end of our first studio screening of the finished movie, every member of my family begged me not to release the movie. My wife said the movie was disgusting and an embarrassment. She said that if I released this movie she would never be able to show her face in public again.We normally spend as much in advertising and promotion on a single movie as we spent to make Airplane! With no available funds left over, Airplane! was the only movie ever released by Paramount without one dollar of advertising or promotion money ever being spent. The movie was released in 1980 and at this time (1994) the movie has grossed over $440 million dollars. It is the most profitable movie ever released by Paramount or made by me.""

This at least has to be the best comedy of all time, if not the best movie period.  Yes I'm serious...and stop calling me shirley.The gag jokes were funny too.  Like the ""S**t hitting the fan"" or the down safe. great stuff.",Airplane!
461,anwindbigler,Airplane,10,1 October 2012,"This movie is the definition of funny. This movie to me depicts everything that you hope does not happen when you get on a plane. With this movie taking place in the airport and on the plane I think the director based this movie solely so that if you were already afraid to get on a plane you now will do anything in your power to stay off of them.This movie is one of the greatest comedy/spoof movies I have ever watched. I had never even heard of it before I had to watch it for class and now I can not stop talking about it! No, it doesn't have the sad love story or the crazy action scenes, but it keeps you laughing all the way through. The one liners and spoofs do not stop from the time the opening credits begin till the movie ends. I really give credit to the writers because I feel that this is what made other movies come to existence. Without this movie I doubt we would have ever watched movies like Scary Movie and Not Another Teen Movie.The main character in this film is a man by the name of Ted Striker. Mr. Striker is a man that you see cry over and over again to people, which shows he is weak, but it all had to do with the love of his life and in the end he will do anything for her! It really shows us how strong love can be. The man does have some major problems though, and like already stated they all start when he doesn't want his relationship with his love to end. He not only tries to save his love life by getting a ticket on her plane that she is the steward on, but he ends up being the only one that can fly the plane when the problem arises. This movie is pure comedy, but the directors do show us what happens if you do not give up and get over your fears. I think this is the one real life thing you can get out of this movie.Airplane really showed the craziness and diversity that hops on planes everyday. I have flown many times myself and the diversity you find on a plane is crazy. In the movie there were a mom and her sick daughter, two African-American males that jived, a couple of old ladies, and the stewards. Like I've already said this movie was hilarious and without these people we wouldn't have had all of the laughs. I also like the scene changes from the cockpit to the control room at the airport. This gave us part of the storyline, while also giving us an insight of the craziness going on in both of them we would not have seen otherwise. It really cracked me up to hear one of the men talking about it being a bad day to quit smoking cigarettes, while the other man has to take amphetamines to get through the night.This film has definitely taught me to not be so eager to jump on a plane. Yes, this film is so far fetched, but I guess you never know when your pilots will eat bad fish! I'm also not so sure there could be so many problems going on in a plane and it actually land without everyone dying! I guess when you have a man that overcomes his fear and is determined to save every ones life miracles can happen! Overall, I love this movie because these are all real life scenarios that could occur, but with a little added spice to make you laugh all the way through! OK, Maybe they are not all real life scenarios!",Airplane!
462,gmills3-530-545604,High (Altitude) Brow Comedy,10,15 November 2012,"Airplane! is a must-watch. Actually, it is a must-watch-multiple-times. The jokes fly at you at such an unreal pace that it is very difficult to pick up on everything the first time. Airplane! seamlessly blends all types of humor from mundane slap-stick to cultural satire that might fly (no pun intended) right over one's head if he or she is not careful. While the primary purpose of this movie was to entertain, and very successful at doing so, on a slightly deeper level it displays the directors' opinions on late 1970's culture and media by poking fun at it. I remember the first time I watched Airplane!, I was thoroughly impressed by much of the word play and enjoyed the movie, but it was not until I had watched the movie a second time that I caught some of the cultural references and fully understood the movie. Since I did not grow up in the 1970's, some of the jokes were not funny to me personally, although I cannot hold this against the movie since I was not their intended audience. However, at the same time, some cultural satire is timeless, such as when Joey recognizes Kareem Abdul Jabbar who then denies that he is Kareem Abdul Jabbar. On paper, me explaining the jokes makes the movie sound dull and lifeless, but I promise that you will be laughing all the way through the movie. Once you have seen the movie, you will not be able to stop quoting it and you will ask not to be called Shirley. While some of the language and content might be out of today's PG rating, kids and adults can enjoy this movie together because it has the non sequitur humor kids love combined with the cultural references that adults adore. Various types of humor abound in this movie, such as an airplane tail-fin swooping back and forth through the clouds to emulate the 1975 thriller Jaws, Striker's ""drinking problem"", and the lady translating Jive for the stewardess is sure to have everybody's laugh box hurting. If you were to go back and examine popular media from the mid-1970s, you would find the disaster films that Airplane! is directly satirizing. I can only assume that these movies were like today's teen paranormal romance novels are: extremely overused and tired out. Therefore, Airplane! contains an aspect I cannot judge since I never got to experience the movie in its original context.Airplane! is perhaps my favorite movie I have ever seen. I am not a film buff by any means, but that does not disqualify from being able to judge a comedy since the true merit of the movie lie not in the cinematography or the 'stunning' performance of an actor, but in the material presented. That is not to say the acting in Airplane! was sub- par, because it was not, only that the brilliant comical material presented far exceeds the importance of the actors. Actually, writing this review is reminding me how great of a movie Airplane! is, so I might just go watch it right now!",Airplane!
463,Chris-moffat,My Favourite Comedy Film,10,6 September 2015,"Years ago when I was pretty young (too young to be watching this film in fact) my parents showed me Airplane! because it was a ""classic"" according to my dad. Watching this film at an young age I knew it was funny, but not as utterly hilarious as my parents seemed to find it. I think I liked it due to some of the adult humour in it that my parents were letting me see for some reason. Since then, I've watched this film many times, finding it funnier and funnier every time due to my age increasing. I turned 18 a couple of weeks ago and have just finished watching it for maybe the 20th time. I can honestly say it is my favourite comedy movie to watch and to recommend to people after all these years. From laughing for the sake of laughing when I was a child, to now bragging to my friends about how amazing this movie is at 18 years old, it is indeed a timeless classic.I love this film for many reasons, mainly due to the story of how it became one of my favourite movies. Not only is it amazingly funny with it's silly one liners and the presence of legend Leslie Nielsen, but it is an exciting, edge of your seat kind of movie that I cannot recommend more. If you haven't seen this movie already, do yourself a favour and get it watched! And when you do go to watch, I just want to wish you good luck... we're all counting on you.",Airplane!
464,physalium,Possibly the best movie I have ever watched.,10,29 January 2014,"I'm a sucker for comedy movies, and this is one of few I can watch over and over again and still laugh as hard throughout the entire movie. The jokes are great and very silly. The plot may not be very deep, but the hole is filled with great acting and very well-timed jokes. Lots of the humour is based on words or context, such as plays on common expressions or messing with perspective. There are also many ""unexpected"" jokes, where the movie suddenly switches scenario or theme entirely, or made characters seem completely different from how they act. This all caused me much confusion and many laughs.In short, this movie has a joke for anyone. As many other reviewers have mentioned, it was also the movie that made Leslie Nielsen big in comedy, and for great reason.If I meet people who have yet to see Airplane!, I do my best to change that.",Airplane!
465,gabenator123,"""No, the yellow line is for passengers only""",10,19 May 2014,"It baffles me to see a classic of the likes of Airplane! get only a 7.8. We live in truly dark times. I wish that people would start to write good reviews for comedies on meta critic, that are based on what the movies set out to do, rather than how artsy they are. Seriously, meta critic is a terrible place. As for the movie itself, amazing. It has laughs a mile per minute, and is still funny no matter how many times I watch it. This movie has made my day on too many occasions, and is almost too good to be true. ""Ever seen a grown man naked?"" ""And don't call me Shirley!"" ""Roger Roger, over Over."" Some of the best things in life are indeed free. (If you have a local library)",Airplane!
466,cathyholmes,The funniest film I have ever seen,10,16 April 2015,"Airplane! was called Flying High here in Australia, yes Flying High is extremely funny, the seen where the stewardess plays the guitar and accidenlty hits some of the passengers on the head and accidentally knocks out the saline drip is excellently funny. But the main star here is Leslie Neilsen, his deadpan acting delivery is just hilliarious as it nicely supports the silly things he says in the script. Robert Hays, Julie Hagerty, Robert Stack, Llyod Bridges and Peter Graves all put in hilliariously funny performances, complete with great deadpan acting, and that Johnny guy in the control room played by the late Stephen Stucker is also hiliraiously funny, even though I think some of his lines have aged very badly. I also found the dialogue between the pilots as the plane was taking off to be very funny as was the jive talking by the African American actors in this funny movie, the most memorable quote from this movie is in the cockpit when Ted Striker says ""Surely you can't be serious' to which Dr Rummick replies with ' I am serious and don't call me Shirley'. That is very funny.",Airplane!
467,autumn_shade_reptilia,...and don't call me Shirley,9,13 July 2005,"With the crudeness of Kentucky Fried Movie creating apprehension in me, I took a chance on this movie. I was surprised to see such a classy film for a comedy made by Z-A-Z.I have a huge respect for parodies because it's very hard to take a serious movie and make it comedic. I think Airplane! is the perfect definition and example of a parody. It blends the Z-A-Z sense of humor with the plot of Zero Hour! in such a fantastic manner. The crudeness is tuned down a little, which makes the movie enjoyable for all audiences.However, if you're looking for a lesson to be learned through this movie, then here it is: don't eat fish.",Airplane!

469,deerudd1,a really obscure reference,10,19 July 2005,"Every time I watch this, I seem to see something new going on in the background. There's a scene in the Control Room where Steven Stucker mentions Barbara Stanwyck. A few seconds later he is on the phone shouting to someone about ""the barn is on fire"". Just figured out the names mentioned were Stanwyck's sons in the Big Valley TV show. Yeah, I'm that old. Speaking of Stucker, unlike seemingly everyone else, I really disliked his character. Whilst the other actors were delivery line with deadpan sincerity, Stucker is flitting around with complete non-sequiters. I understand he was the only one allowed to ad-lib...it shows. I also agree with previous comment that there is a lot of ""High and the Mighty"" being spoofed. Especially John Wayne's flashbacks and the trucks on the flight line",Airplane!
470,rdidvet,"Great movie, but NOT FOR KIDS!!!",7,19 February 2016,"I love this movie and miss the comedy of a few decades ago. The cast is terrific. A great line-up of wonderful actors and actresses from years gone by. The plot is pretty entertaining. I'm a pilot myself, so that makes it all the more entertaining for me to watch.HOWEVER!!! This movie is NOT FOR CHILDREN!! NUDITY!!! And a fair amount of colorful language. Parents be warned! The rating does not fit the movie. This should absolutely be ""R"" rated!!!The MPAA feels that this is a PG movie. There is someone somewhere that believe a brief nudity warning is sufficient, combined with a PG rating for a parent to sit down with their kids and be shocked when a naked woman runs across the screen or a stewardess ""blows"" up an inflatable autopilot dummy with a straw located at it's belt. Hilarious to an adult. Confusing, shocking, and frankly harmful to a child.",Airplane!

472,highlordkrishna,A letter to the Institute,10,1 January 2006,"American Film Institute Hollywood, CaliforniaTo Whom It May Concern:Throughout my life, I have been an aficionado of classic cinema. I was raised on Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, Katherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart. Not only have I developed an appreciation for the great American films, I have been dedicated enough to force-feed my peers the likes of Casablanca, Dr. Zhivago, The Godfather and On the Waterfront in an attempt to keep alive interest in these landmark movies. As one might imagine, I was very excited to find that your organization was releasing a ranking of the greatest films of the 20th century, and I waited intently to see the results. Upon reading them, however, I realized that you must have made a typo in the ""number four"" slot, and I waited for several months to see if you would make the alteration, but every time I logged into your website, the list still read ""4) Gone With the Wind"" and not ""4) Airplane!""I realize everyone at the institute is very busy, what with the Oscars in the somewhat near future and plenty of fine movies out that need reviewing, but I'm sure the change would only take a few minutes, and I think the general public would appreciate the clarification.

473,nashjack,Endlessly Quotable,10,16 May 2017,"If you're looking for a movie that's endlessly quotable, this is it. With jokes at every turn, spoofs in every scene, and more wordplay than you can handle, Airplane! is the comedy to watch if you're looking for a way to escape from any sort of vestige of reality.Directed by David Zucker, Jerry Zucker, and Jim Abrahams, this comedy is about anything but the actors themselves. It stars Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty, but notably Leslie Nielsen, in a movie about, well, an airplane. As the plane flies through the air, and the pilots get sick, the passengers have to take matters into their own hands, leading to a story doesn't really matter. In the end, this movie isn't about making a point, but about poking fun at those who try to. Nothing can be taken seriously in this movie, and everything can and will be made a joke at one point or another.It's only 90 minutes long, but every minute of it was captivating, leading to a great movie for most ages.",Airplane!
474,pirosonico,I want to write a review. What is it?,10,14 February 2018,"It's a piece of text made to give some insight and critics to a movie, but that's not very important right now.What makes this movie the so-called greatest nonsense/comedy film of all time? Undoubtely, I don't know. Perhaps it's the jokes, funny and unexpected, or maybe the brilliant performances, geniously directed by Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker - not the law firm - or even the soundtrack. Even the low budget special fx, the mistakes, the pieces of tape holding the set, all of that contribute to a very rewarding experience as a viewer, but I'm sure those guys laughed their socks off making this movie.What stands apart is, surely, the freshness of it all. Silly like Monty Python, nonsensical like Peter Sellers, but in a completely different way, even some traces of Mel Brooks are, surely, there - and stop calling me Shirley.""Kentucky Fried Movie"" was a try-out for this one, and if you worship this movie like you should, maybe it would be nice to check it out.I wonder what the comedy genre would be like without a movie like this one. Much poorer, for sure, and probably worse. Like my drinking problem.",Airplane!
475,wgailmard,Not Top 25??,10,4 October 2006,"Airplane not only created or at least validated the material viability of the type-movie spoof, it did so by cramming more jokes per minute into its 88 minutes than anything else you can rent. I love many of the movies in the IMDb to 25, but even in a TV version, Airplane is a reason to take an hour and a half off from whatever else you were doing. If you have seen any of the later Zucker and/or Abrahams films, but have never seen this one, get right on it. Sublimely ridiculous, all comedy should be this memorable. See it until you can recite it word for word. You will be a better person for it. The world may not judge you on your ability to recognize ""Me John, big tree,"" but perhaps it should.",Airplane!
