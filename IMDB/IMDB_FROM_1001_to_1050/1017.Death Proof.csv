0,Leofwine_draca,Tarantino's colossal misfire,4,10 August 2012,"You know, I consider myself a Tarantino fan. I've seen all of his movies now, and I loved most of them; okay, so one of them was only so-so (KILL BILL VOLUME 2) but the rest kicked ass. Copious amounts of originality, quick-fire scripts, extreme violencethere's little not to love about Tarantino's output. Being a huge film fan myself, I also appreciate the work of others so clearly in love with cinema as myself.Which leads me onto DEATH PROOF, undoubtedly Tarantino's worst film and a hulking colossal misfire of a movie. Originally conceived as part of GRINDHOUSE, a '70s-throwback collaboration that saw this film paired with Rodriguez's PLANET TERROR, a genuinely fun and outrageously OTT zombie movie, DEATH PROOF is a disaster. Tarantino tries out his quick-witted dialogue on a series of increasingly young 'n' dim female protagonists except his dialogue isn't good anymore, it's atrocious. And repetitive. Long sequences stretch out as the women in this film trade insults and talk (about various sexual situations, mostly) and it's completely and utterly dull.You know how horror films have a tradition of introducing their villains in the first ten minutes or so, showing them offing a bunch of quickly-introduced characters before starting the story proper? Well, Tarantino has that idea here, except the first HOUR is a set-up for the bad guy. Then there's another hour that gets on with telling the story, except there's no story here, just a car chase finale that involves a stuntwoman who I hope got paid a LOT of money. The rest, inbetween, is just treading water.Thank God then for Kurt Russell, the only decent performer in the entire movie. Russell is excellent in this movie, giving a great performance, not just as the bad guy but overall. The scene in which he convinces one of the girls to give him a lap dance is my favourite in the whole movie, purely because of Russell's abilities as actor. A shame, then, that's he's wasted in an overall dumb movie that seems to get more and more stupid as it goes on; the last scene, in which Tarantino tries to film a cartoonish sequence via live action, is particularly dumb and trivial. What a shame when PLANET TERROR turned out to be such a hoot",Death Proof
1,SnoopyStyle,great stunt,8,12 December 2015,"Jungle Julia (Sydney Tamiia Poitier) is a local radio DJ star in Austin, Texas. She's out with her friends Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito), Shanna (Jordan Ladd) and others. Arlene sees a mysterious car outside. Stuntman Mike McKay (Kurt Russell) gives bar customer Pam (Rose McGowan) a ride. Then he tells her that the car is death-proof but only on the driver side. Fourteen months later, Abernathy (Rosario Dawson), Zoë (Zoë Bell), Lee (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Kim (Tracie Thoms) are driving through Tennessee stalked by Stuntman Mike.The previews are great. The repetitive ""Don't"" gets a little annoying but I love the sound cues. It reminds me of good times with old movie showings at the theaters. Death-Proof is a little bit problematic. There's a reason why those movies are considered B-level. They weren't good. Tarantino copying the style actually made it at the B-level. It's a lot of hot chicks in a meandering story with inane dialog. Then there are the amazing car sequences. It brings the movie up to another level. There are no words to describe the sequence with Zoë Bell. It elevates an interesting exercise to something really good.",Death Proof
2,claudio_carvalho,"A B-Movie Style Full of Action, Violence and Nice Girls",7,31 October 2010,"In the City of Austin, Texas, the girlfriends Jungle Julia Lucai (Sydney Tamiia Poitier), Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito), Shanna (Jordan Ladd) and Lanna Frank (Monica Staggs) reunite in a bar to drink booze, smoke pot and make out with their boyfriends before traveling alone to Lake LBJ to spend the weekend together. They meet the former Hollywood stunt Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) that gives a ride to Pam (Rose McGowan) in his ""death-proof"" stunt car. Sooner Pam discovers that Stuntman Mike is a psychopath and he kills the girls provoking a deadly accident with his car. Fourteen months later, the infamous Stuntman Mike appears in Lebanon, Tennessee, stalking a group of women that works in cinema industry. Abernathy ""Abbie"" (Rosario Dawson) that works with make-up; the stuntwomen Zoë Bell and Kim (Tracie Thoms) and B-actress and model Lee (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) are chased by the maniac, but the girls are tough and decide to fight back. ""Death Proof"" is an entertaining film of Quentin Tarantino that follows the style of B-movies and is full of action, violence and nice girls. There are references to many other movies, through dialogs, posters and billboards, but the greatest one is to ""Vanishing Point"". The choreography of the car races and accidents are amazing and the stuntwoman Zoë Bell is stunning. I was expecting to see what has happened to Lee that was left alone with the owner of the white car and his reaction after seeing the car totally wrecked, but the films has an abrupt end and forgets these characters. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""À Prova de Morte"" (""Death Proof"")",Death Proof
3,kosmasp,Bump'N'Grind,8,22 July 2007,"Just watched the international version and of course as I thought, there were no ""fake"" trailers before the movie. Even if the movie was shown in Germany as (""Grindhouse"") double bill with Planet Terror, it would be highly unlikely that a trailer called ""Werewolf Women of the S.S."" would've been shown before the movie! But back to the movie and it's actors/story.Kurt Russell is a great actor and he shows it here one more time. I think he could be more on screen, especially during the second half of the movie, his performance is so mesmerizing! Story-wise there's not so much here, of course because it's all about the characters ... and the dialog of course. For some it might be too much dialog and too little action, but I thought it was a good mix ... plus when the action is on screen, then it's ON! And even if a major stunt/car scene is highly illogical, it's more than great fun to watch! Especially as it was shot on film/location and not CGI-ed later!",Death Proof
4,gavin6942,A Slower-Paced But Suspenseful Thrill Ride,8,27 September 2007,"It's ladies night and the feeling's right... for Stuntman Mike. After encountering a group of girls at the local tavern, he decides to have his way with them. And not in the way you might think. The second half repeats the event with another group of girls, only this time things go decidedly different.I loved this film. I didn't see it in the theater, but I saw the extended cut on DVD. So I can't speak for the differences other than that I know the lap dance scene is longer and they added in the toe-licking scene, both of which are great. Many people, including my horror buddy Jason, told me this film was slow and Tarantino had lost his edge. And yeah, it was slow, but I think this worked -- it probably seemed worse in theater because it followed the non-stop bull ride of ""Planet Terror"".The dialog is not Tarantino's best, but it's not bad. There's no quotables like the ""royale with cheese"" or pretty much the entire script of ""Reservoir Dogs"". But he makes the mundane, everyday conversation seem like something worth watching. And he knows how to write them. Compare this conversation (the one by the first group of girls) to conversations in other films, and you can't tell me that this wasn't more realistic. So, that's a pretty good job.For those who wanted gore, thinking this was a horror film, you probably were disappointed. Sure, there's some really good blood in the car crash scene (and even a face getting ripped off by a tire) but it happens in under 30 seconds, so you really have to keep your expectations low if you want gore. Me, I didn't mind. The suspense of the story was all I needed to keep me waiting to see what Mike was going to do next. He was a weird guy, both maniacal and calculated.Tarantino, or whoever did the casting, knew what hey were doing. The first group of girls was just alright, but since we wanted them to die it was okay we didn't find them as attractive. But in the second group, we have Rosario Dawson (whom I don't generally like, but was okay here) and the love of my life, Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Actually, the love of my life is Mandy Moore, but Winstead is the best horror has to offer. That cheerleader outfit was divine.Also, I loved the soundtrack. Tarantino is great at exposing viewers to 1970s music they've long since forgotten or never even heard of. The Coasters ""Down in Mexico"", April March's ""Chick Habit"" and the thumping ""Hold Tight"" are just stellar. Sure ,he could throw in some modern pop or rock songs, get a soundtrack that sells millions. But why? He's mining gold right here. Just as he's done on ""Kill Bill"" and all films before. He made ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" a bigger hit than it ever was the first time out.Some have complained it's too self-referential, with the subtle in-jokes about the other movies, including Texas Ranger McGraw, the Vipers outfit, the ""tasty beverage"" and more. Screw the critics. Self-referencing, or any referencing at all, makes a solid film. It's that subtlety that pays off for the alert and insightful that really drives a film home. Kevin Smith, who I think has a lot in common with Tarantino, is very self-referential. And you know what? It makes his films gold because you won't catch all the connections your first time.Let's list off the amazing cast: Kurt Russell (Stuntman Mike), Rosario Dawson, Jordan Ladd, Rose McGowan (who is much hotter as a brunette and a former love of mine, but I'll take her as a blonde), Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Zoe Bell (Uma Thurman's real-life stunt double, and Quentin Tarantino as Warren the Bartender. Priceless.If this film bored you in theater, give it another chance. I think the extended edition really adds some missing flavor. Sure ,you're not getting the sex and gore and non-stop thrills, but there's something about this film that really captures the style it was shooting for (the style of ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry"") in a Tarantino vein. I think it kicks a llama's butt.",Death Proof
5,jboothmillard,Death Proof,5,7 February 2008,"I had heard about something by producer, writer and director Quentin Tarantino called Grindhouse, and then I had heard that along with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror, this film originally joined it at US cinemas as a double-bill/feature. Basically the story sees two sets of friends, aka two acts, and both bunches hunted by a psychotic murderous serial killer called Stuntman Mike (a really good Kurt Russell). Act 1: radio DJ and model Jungle Julia (Sydney Tamiia Poitier), model Arlene aka Butterfly (Vanessa Ferlito), bad-girl Shanna (Jordan Ladd) and hippie Pam (Scream's Rose McGowan) are hanging out in a bar, Mike recognises them, and after chatting to a couple of them, he takes Pam in his ""death proof"" car, but he lied about the death proof part, so she is obviously slaughtered from a crash, and the other girls are victims when he crashes the car into them. He survives. Act 2: Seventeen months later, make-up and stand-in girl Abernathy (Men in Black II's Rosario Dawson), naive B-movie actress Lee (Final Destination 3 and Die Hard 4.0's Mary Elizabeth Winstead), tough-minded stunt woman Kim (Tracie Thoms) and real stunt woman Zoë Bell (as herself, she also did stunts in Kill Bill) are travelling somewhere, and they see an advert for a guy selling a 1970 Dodge Challenger, the one from the film Vanishing Point, and they persuade him to let them have a test drive. That is when Mike shows up, with Zoë gripping some belts on the car bonnet (for real), he comes along and starts bashing into them. After he gets away with only a gunshot to the arm, which he didn't expect, they soon decide to follow and get their revenge on him, so the predator becomes the prey, and they do eventually stop him, and punch him to death. Also starring Michael Parks as Texas Ranger Earl McGraw, Tarantino himself as Warren, Eli Roth (director of Cabin Fever and Hostel) as Dov, James Parks as Edgar McGraw, Marley Shelton as Dr. Dakota Block and Monica Staggs as Lanna Frank. It may be very chatty, but some of the dialogue (written by Tarantino of course) is quite witty, there's even one bit round a table (kind of like the beginning of Reservoir Dogs) that doesn't cut for about ten minutes. Anyway, chatting aside, the deliberate tiny glitches in editing and picture in the first half is an interesting choice for Tarantino, the violence is good, Russell is good as the scar faced villain, all the girls are fit, and I agree the final car chase is worth the wait. Tarantino was nominated the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. Worth watching!",Death Proof
6,Tweekums,A deliberately trashy homage to '70s exploitation films,7,10 June 2017,"This is a film of two halves; each with a similar setup but a different outcome. In the first three girls in Texas stop off at a bar where they meet up with a friend before intending to set off for a weekend at a lakeside house. In the bar they chat and flirt and are approached by a man who introduces himself as Stuntman Mike. Eventually they leave, Mike leaves as well, along with a girl he offered a lift to. It immediately becomes obvious that something is wrong; he is in a sealed compartment in his 'death proof' stunt car and she is thrown around. He then overtakes the other girls, turns round and crashes into them killing them all instantly.He survives and fourteen months later he is stalking another three girls in Tennessee who are also meeting up with a friend; in this case New Zealand Stuntwoman Zoë Bell. She has something she wants to do while she is in America; drive a 1970 Dodge Challenger one of which is for sale nearby. They take it for a test drive during which she wants to do a stunt; ride on the bonnet holding on to belts attached to the wing mirrors. As she does this Stuntman Mike attacks and a terrifying chase takes place; these girls are tough though; they turn the tables and soon Mike is fleeing for his life.This film does have some impressive moments; mostly during the chase in the second half however there is far too much talking. Tarantino has created some great dialogue in his previous films but here there is too much talking mostly from the girls who's dialogue may be snappy but isn't all that realistic. The first half is dedicated to introducing characters who will mostly end up dead; only Mike appears in both halves and his character isn't that interesting; he is just nasty. The second half is much better as the characters are more interesting, the confrontation between them and Mike is sustained and features some genuinely impressive stunts featuring Zoë Bell playing herself. The cast do a decent enough job although given that it is meant to feel like a trashy, low budget film it is hard to judge as there is some deliberate bad acting at times. Overall this is okay for Tarantino fans but is could have done with losing twenty minutes or so in the first half.",Death Proof
7,ma-cortes,Two separate sets of voluptuous girls are pursued by a former Hollywood stuntman,4,4 July 2012,"City of Austin, Texas , a group of beautiful women named Julia Lucai (Sydney Tamiia Poitier), Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito), Shanna (Jordan Ladd) and Lanna Frank (Monica Staggs) get together in a bar to drink when are stalked by a scarred stuntman named Mike (Kurt Russell) .They meet that gives a ride to Pam (Rose McGowan) and the events go wrong . The other group of girls (Zoe Bell , Rosario Dawson , Tracie Thoms , Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is in Tenessee ; both of them are connected only by the fact that they cruise their cars and are pursued at diverse times by the former Hollywood stunt Stuntman , Motor Madman Mike who uses his ""death proof"" cars (they are a 1970 Chevy Nova and a 1969 Dodge Charger) to carry out his killer schemes .This action movie contains thrills , chills , interminable dialogs , talky and tacky scenes , including spectacular car races ; however resulting to be pretty boring . As the dialog is as silly and wandering as you'd expect from Quentin but lacks much of the intelligence and freshness of former films as ¨Reservoir dogs¨ or ¨Pulp Fiction¨ . ¨Death proof¨ belong as one half of a double by Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez that was conceived , mounted and filmed to imitate the 1970's ¨Grindhouse¨ from which the project took its title . In fact , the restaurant on the cup is the same Mexican restaurant (Acuna Boys) that is advertised during the transition between Planet Terror and Death Proof in the original Grindhouse. The highlights of the movie are the car races , crashes , chases and Zoe Bell does all her own stunts she was the stunt double for Uma Thurman in the ""Kill Bill"" series, which was also directed by Quentin Tarantino . Good cinematography by the same Tarantino , though the film was physically scratched to achieve its dirty look, rather than digitally scratch the film footage . The picture is pretty violent , thrilling and plenty of profanities , as in the extended cut of the film, the word 'fuck' is used 148 times , it reached Europe alone with 27 minutes added to the original running time . The motion picture was regularly directed by Tarantino , it seems to be all the fun and wit appears to have been had behind the camera . It's his only movie that takes place completely in chronological order and was a commercial failure in the USA , lacking the sparkle and intensity of earlier times . Rating : Average , 4,5 , only for Tarantino's hardcore fans .",Death Proof
8,BA_Harrison,"Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. Crash. Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. Chase.",4,25 October 2007,"One half of the Rodriguez/Tarantino collaboration Grindhouse, kindly padded out to feature length for us non-American viewers, Death Proof features Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike, a deranged driver who likes to deliberately cause fatal crashes. But when he picks on a car which just happens to include a couple of Hollywood stunt women amongst its passengers, the tables are turned and poor old Mike gets a taste of his own medicine. An homage to the violent, gritty, un-PC action flicks of the 70s, Death Proof comes complete with dodgy editing and scratchy film stock, in an attempt to deliver that authentic 'grindhouse' vibe.Okay Quentin, I get it! You're a cool bloke. You like cool music, cool films and cool people. But why do you feel like you have to constantly prove to us how cool you are by repeatedly referencing all your cool cinematic influences in unrealistic conversations between unrealistic characters, whilst your cool soundtrack endlessly plays in the background (which is always littered with visual references from your goddamn favourite cool films)?The experience is so bloody boring: 45 minutes of nothing but chit-chat (complete with your oh-so tiresome references to Kahuna burgers and Red Apple cigarettes), followed by a decent car crash (that shows what you are capable of when you're not trying so hard to be cool), then more chin-wagging (mention foot massage one more time, Quentin. I dare you. No, I double dare you!), even more movie references (don't you understand that when you have your actresses wax lyrical about B-movies and fast cars, thus creating a fantasy world where gorgeous women actually share YOUR passions, it comes across as rather sad?), and, finally, a well executed car chase capped with an extremely crap ending.I have a sneaking suspicion that, as part of the original Grindhouse double bill (with Rodriguez's Planet Terror and some faux trailers for other trashy movies), a shorter version of Death Proof (with less jibber jabber) would have worked slightly better. But since the rest of the world (outside of the U.S.) has been denied the chance of seeing this version, all I can do is judge the cut I have seen. And it is not good.",Death Proof
9,moonspinner55,The requisite sass is overrun by nasty flash in this Tarantino grinder...,6,8 November 2010,"Emulating the popular car-smashups that littered drive-in movie theaters in the 1970s, writer-director Quentin Tarantino's entry in the ""Grindhouse"" double-feature extravaganza (in tandem with the Robert Rodriguez opener, ""Planet Terror"") digs about as deep psychologically as those films he favors. His budget, however, far outweighs the vintage B-pictures he's replicating in sight and sound, and so comparisons to ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"", ""White Line Fever"", ""Duel"", or ""Vanishing Point"" are really irrelevant. No filmmaker in the '70s ever made movies like Tarantino makes them now--his craftsmanship behind the camera is singular, though he cherry-picks movie (and movie-music) references for his enjoyment as well as ours. A former television stuntman in a black Dodge Charger stalks and taunts women--and just about seems above the law and retribution until he picks on the wrong group of girls. Utilizing a few of the actors and characters from ""Planet Terror"", Tarantino has just as high a time profiling the people within his film as he does dispatching them via his resident psychotic. His dialogue crackles with a keenly precise ear, although his lack of sympathy can be jarring (there are one or two flashes of beauty, although how honest they are is up for debate). The bloody finale is a slug-fest celebration, yet ""Death Proof"", for the most part, isn't really enjoyable; it's edgy and mean, with a dirty streak that coats the picture with unpleasantness. Some may say that is just Tarantino doing his job, but I found it to be a gut-cruncher. **1/2 from ****",Death Proof
10,Quinoa1984,extended and uncut: a near perfect B-movie made into just a very good one,7,23 October 2007,"Like Apocalypse Now Redux- with the exception being that it's in this case the Weinsteins and not the director himself, despite Tarantino saying that he prefers this new cut- the re-cut of Death Proof has been puffed up with extra scenes meant to fill up gaps and give fans some scenes that have been talked about but never seen. But also like Apocalypse Now (and this goes without saying that AP is the greater movie), they're ultimately unnecessary, and despite the scintillating bits and the odd moments of humor and intriguing moments of dialog, it doesn't fare well to what was already spot-on on arrival in US theaters. It's a slight tragedy that the original 90-something minute cut won't be available to most countries, nevermind the US, for quite a while. Tarantino and editor Sally Menke have expanded certain moments (a little extra bit of dialog outside of the bar, and Stuntman Mike putting in eye-drops), and inserted in much longer ones, like the draggy scene outside the convenience store where we see an unsubtle touch of QT's foot obsession. It's not that even these moments are unwatchable, or even poorly written or acted, and on its own the actual lap-dance as finally revealed is entertaining (in and of itself anyway).But QT and Menke also throw off the pacing of the film that was already ""too-talky"" by some critics accounts, at least in comparison to it's brother Grindhouse flick Planet Terror, and the only people who might not notice that it's off will be those who never saw the original cut of the film, in all it's sleazy glory. It almost defeats the whole purpose of Grindhouse making a little 90 minute serial-killer-with-a-car flick into a two-hour movie. Now, these criticisms said, Death Proof is still THE Death Proof most of the time, which is one of the best B-movie endeavors in recent memory. No matter what's been added, even the fat to chew can't be enough to ignore the fact that it's one of Tarantino's most audacious efforts in a career with them going back to back.It's got those wonderful actresses (Zoe Bell, Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd), the as-a-given cool dialog and script turns from Tarantino, and probably one of the best movie soundtracks of the decade. And the car chases are still intact without much change, and they're as exciting as they can be- relative to how they were on the big screen of course- with the heart-stopping beats like Rose McGowan's scene in the car (""In order to get the benefit, honey..."") and the long chase through the backwoods of Tennessee.And, through thick and thin of the longer cut, we still have Kurt Russell in one of his most memorable turns. Stuntman Mike is a quintessentially Tarantinian creation (to make alliterations), self-aware in the writing of the character as he's an ex-stunt man who worked on shows most girls in a bar would never know, and who has a dark side that comes out in the strangest moments. He's also slick as hell, recites a line of classic poetry better than anyone, and is totally hilarious after getting shot. Now to make a cheesy critic sentence: maybe the 114-minute cut isn't Death Proof, but Kurt Russell is (till, you know, his actual death)!",Death Proof
11,BandSAboutMovies,"Sadly, a waste of time",4,24 July 2019,"When it came time to create his part of Grindhouse, Quentin Tarantino had to figure out a genre. He said, ""I realized I couldn't do a straight slasher film, because with the exception of women-in-prison films, there is no other genre quite as rigid."" What he ended up with is a movie about a killer who uses his death proof stunt car - another obsession of his - to kill beautiful women.I love that the movie starts with a title card calling the movie Quentin Tarantino's Thunderbolt before the Death Proof name is quickly inserted over that. The film was purposefully edited down for Grindhouse, as if it was bought by a distributor and hacked to bits so it could play shorter running times in drive-ins and rough theater houses on 42nd Street. However, an extended, 127-minute version of Death Proof was screened in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 60th Cannes Film Festival.Arlene, Shanna and radio DJ ""Jungle"" Julia Lucai (Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd - who appeared in Embrace of the Vampire, a 1990's video favorite - and Sydney Poitier) are on their way to the bar to celebrate Julie's birthday. Julie had mentioned that Arlene would give a lap dance to anyone who finds her, calls her by the name Butterfly and reads a poem to her - the same poem that alerts the sleeper agents in Telefon. Stuntman Mike McKay (Kurt Russell) takes her up on this dare, getting one hell of a dance before everyone leaves the bar.Stuntman Mike gives Pam (Rose McGowan) a ride, but soon reveals his sinister nature, murdering her inside his car by smashing her head against the windshield. He then hunts down the other women and kills them too, but since it looks like the girls were driving drunk, he gets away. Texas Rangers Earl and Edgar McGraw (Michael and James Parks) tell him to get the hell out of Texas.One year later and Mike is hunting a whole new set of girls n Tennessee - Abernathy Ross, Kim Mathis, Lee Montgomery and Zoe Bell (Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and, yes, Zoe Bell). This time, it doesn't go so well for Mike, who gets obliterated by the women.Marley Shelton shows up as Dr. Dakota Block, reprising her role from the Planet Terror section of Grindhouse, plus Tarantino and Eli Roth show up at the bar as love interests for the first set of women.

12,Coventry,The Road to Hell is paved with awesome QT dialogs!,8,3 September 2007,"For the first time in my life, I actually regret not being an American citizen. Why? Because only in the U.S of A. you could see ""Death Proof"" as it was initially intended by the genius filmmaker Quentin Tarantino; namely as a more or less short (+/- 75 min.) segment in a double-feature tribute to the long-lost days of Grindhouse house cinema. Over here in Europe - Belgium to be more specific -, distributors feared that the audiences would not understand the concept and therefore they opted to release both segments separately and, to my biggest regret, without the fake trailers in between. At least, that's the official version. It's also possible they wanted to make double the money on the same film, because the films were released with a period of two months in between. Of course, a running time of barely 75 minutes isn't satisfying anymore in this day and age of expensive cinema tickets, so both segments had to be expanded with additional footage in order to attract people. Now, naturally, the padding is exactly what ruins the concept & basic idea of ""Death Proof"", as gritty 70's-type exploitation movies are supposed to be short and to the point! Without even having seen ""Grindhouse"", I could perfectly point out the footage and dialogs that were added to ""Death Proof"" as these are the exact same sequences that bring down the overall atmosphere of the story.That pretty much concludes my rant, because I nonetheless still very much enjoyed the extended version of ""Death Proof"", despite the fact that it obviously robbed Quentin Tarantino of his initial intentions. The majority of dialogs may be unnecessary and overlong, but they still remain brilliant examples of QT's writing talent. This basically means that every line spoken is exciting, stimulating and always smoothly refers to another highlight of the 70's pop culture. There isn't a single line or detail in the screenplay that doesn't bring homage to another movie. Some of the references are obvious, whereas other ones are subtler and a true joy for the exploitation connoisseurs to discover. The actual plot is rudimentary, like it should. For reasons that remain unmotivated, the psychopathic Stuntman Mike terrorizes groups of young & luscious women, using only his menacing ""Death Proof"" car. He hangs around lurid bars and shops, where he extendedly observes their behavior and overhears their conversations before stalking them in his diabolical vehicle. The first clique of girls (among them the gorgeous Jordan Ladd, Rose McGowan and Vanessa Ferlito) forms a fairly easy target, but the second group (Rosario Dawson, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Zoe Bell) is much tougher and fights back, resulting in a head spinning and masterfully staged chase across the forsaken countryside. Kurt Russell is tremendous as the utterly deranged Stuntman Mike and he clearly hasn't had this much fun playing a character since ""Escape from New York"", back in 1981. The girls are all terrific and damn sexy, with the exception of Jungle Julia who exaggerates too much with her rough-black-chick-from-the-hood act. Also, awesome soundtrack (courtesy of numerous older films), delightful editing & sound effects and remarkably cool cameos, including QT himself and fellow director mate Eli Roth. Brilliant film-making, whether or not in its original form.",Death Proof

14,hitchcockthelegend,There are few things as fetching as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel.,9,26 September 2010,"Death Proof is directed and written by Quentin Tarantino. It's part of a double feature production that Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez released as Grindhouse. With Rodriguez contributing Planet Terror. Death Proof tells of a psychopathic stunt man played by Kurt Russell who stalks pretty young ladies and then murders them by way of road accidents caused by his ""death proofed"" stunt car. Joining Russell in the cast are Zoë Bell, Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Rose McGowan.Many trials and tribulations followed the release of the Grindhouse project; poor opening weekend, two film's meant to be together ultimately separated on disc, with different cuts etc etc. It's all rather boorish in truth and really both Death Proof and Planet Terror stand up on their own two feet even if the whole ""Grindhouse"" homage"" is somewhat lost in home viewing. So on to Death Proof, a film that finds Tarantino on deliciously agreeable form. Delivering a chicksploitation psycho killer piece that bubbles nicely under the surface to then explode into one of the most thrilling finales in recent times.Now in its longer cut, Death Proof is split into two parts. The first part has one group of girls (Poitier, Ladd & Ferlito) out in Austin, Texas, celebrating the birthday of one of them. It's here we are introduced to Stuntman Mike (a terrific Russell), who is stalking them. For this first half there's lots of talk and relationship posers plotting away. It's a slow build, and in light of QT's pre release promise of 200mph thrills, it may lose some viewers hungry for action and murder death kill from the off. But hang in there, listen to the dialogue, get to know the characters, particularly the girls (how often do we get to know victims in slashers eh?), and then bang! Pay off number one as carnage is unleashed in multi-angles and action replays. A memorable blood show played out to the awesome drum beats of Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Titch's pop classic Hold Tight.Part two. And our second group of girls, an aesthetically pleasing bunch that contains Zoë Bell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Tracie Thoms & Rosario Dawson. Again there's much talk, but oh what talk. These are girls I could sit and listen to for ever. This may not be QT's most quotable movie, but it isn't shy of coolness in the writing. Just sample the whole gun conversation as the camera revolves around the table, a sharp sharp moment in the film; all that's missing is a Madonna story, you know? Some may argue it's indulgent from the director, I say it's finding a director very relaxed and at one with his protect. Besides, it's a critical passage of play that's setting us up for the exhilarating climax as Bell (real life stunt-woman) straps herself to the bonnet of a speeding Dodge Challenger. What follows is ripping cinema, free of CGI and string work, not only does QT homage those car movies of the 70s he loves so much (Vanishing Point, Dirty Mary Crazy Larry et al), but he's also patting the back of the stunt-men and women who bring so many action moments to life. And as this long car chasing sequence raises the pulses, it starts to unravel that Death Proof is subverting the norm. Bravo boys and girls.Hilarious, riotous, troubling, sexy and sleazy, Death Proof is unsurprisingly proving divisive. But I for one wouldn't be at all surprised if in ten years time it is regarded as being one of his best movies. The Grindhouse project may not have worked as a whole, but this portion on its own provides thrills and cheek in equal measure as Tarantino gets behind the wheel and takes us on one hell of a ride. Kicking soundtrack too! 9/10",Death Proof
15,Scarecrow-88,Death Proof,7,7 May 2010,"Yep, Death Proof is dialogue-heavy, with certain emphasis, camera-wise, on feet and ass. Not that I have a problem with feet and ass, but after a while I was growing tired of hearing and seeing girlfriends chatter, drink, smoke, and eat. Mundane activities like smoking cigarettes, downing shots of liquor, ranting on about sleeping with dudes, going on and one about their lives for seemingly limitless amounts of time. And I agree with this critique some Internet user mentioned regarding how Tarantino lives vicariously through the girls with the dialogue.I remember feeling so disgusted, it's funny really in retrospect, at how DP makes Kurt Russell's serial killer/stalking predator a real bitch..I also remember another Interner user proclaim, kudos to him, that Stuntman Mike isn't Snake Plisskin. And, that couldn't be more accurate. Mike gets his jollies killing pretty young things with his vehicle, the muscle car which substitutes what he is lacking physically and psychologically in the sexual department. You know, back to the whole point about the ""Tarantino talking vicariously through the girls"", even though it's recognized that when the actress' characters talk we know it's the writer/director's voice, those involved really take to the dialogue and seem to embrace what is being said throughout the movie. Of course, there are plenty of ""fcks"" and ""shts"", but the girls involved seem to be having quite a lot of fun with QT's script as written. I'm open and honest in my worthless user comments I write for genre movies on this site, and I admit that a movie can often win me over with specifics even if the entire whole does little for me(well, dialogue wise, and, to be honest, these kinds of girls, even as written by QT, do nothing for me personally). The showstopping car crash where the first segments girls get obliterated through a nightmarish head on collision with Stuntman Mike certainly had me out of seat, applauding such efforts for how it is presented in several different angles(QT shows each girls' fate, such as one girl being thrown out of the car, the tire of Mike's car driving right across one victim's face, and the ultimate ""shazaam"", a leg pulled clean off a girl landing with a flop on the deserted highway!). All was forgiven when QT gobsmacked us with that beauty of grisly destruction as far as I was concerned.Then QT segues into a second set of girls(except, I was a bit more lenient since one of the group was the foxy and fine Mary Elizabeth Winstead in a cheerleader uniform)and hear comes more endlessly talky banter, in their car and inside a diner(included in the film's solo effort, excluded from it's original Grindhouse origin, there's also a lengthly sequence where three of the girls, before picking up Zoe Bell, stop at a gas station). Then, QT extends the olive branch to us who were dying for something other than chit-chat for minutes and minutes on end between the principles, and stages one of the most breathtaking action stunt set pieces I've ever seen. This, a loving ode to those awesome 70's car race movies, will forever cement Bell's cult status with us genre nerds forever. Hanging for dear life on the hood of a 1970 White Dodge Charger as Stuntman Mike rams the car repeatedly, authentic and dangerous, Bell immortalizes herself in the hearts of action junkies forever..we heart you Zoe, you have contributed to our ever-growing desire to see the seemingly impossible presented right before our eyes in all your glory. When I mentioned that I'm open and honest when writing my meaningless user comments, I make mention that if a director can drop a few bombs on me, I can be forgiving; I'm easy prey, I guess. You can bore me to tears with the words and activities of girls as the camera adores them from various body parts(feet and ass), but if the director has a way of grabbing my collar, shaking me out of my daze, with something worthwhile, I can be brought into the fold.And, bottom line, QT can turn Russell into a bitch, whining and crying, but being the KR fanatic that I am(and there are many of us out there), I was able to find a way to remain calm this go-around(I admit, I was fuming in the theater)and giggle at what transpires.Despite being such a crazy fan of exploitation movies, QT's movies aren't misogynistic..if anything, his movies empower women, and their strength is quite on display, full of attitude and guts, who can dish out just as much as the men across from them.",Death Proof
16,LeonLouisRicci,Trash-Talk-Fest,7,20 October 2013,"The Director's Self-Indulgence is His Major Weakness. Here He seems to Exploit it or Maybe it just seems that way. It's hard to tell.

17,poolandrews,I am amazed at how much I disliked it.,2,18 January 2008,"Death Proof starts in Austin Texas where radio show host Jungle Julia Lacai (Sydney Poitier) & two of her friends stop off at a bar where they meet a guy who calls himself Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) who turns out to be a mad psycho who uses his 'death proof' car to murder young girls & he intends for the three friends to be his latest victims...Written, photographed, co-produced & directed by Quentin Tarintino who also has a small role in it as the bar owner Warren I am amazed at how much I disliked Death Proof, I usually love grindhouse, exploitation, horror, action & cult trash along with being a fan of Tarintino's other films Kill Bill: Vol 1 (2003) especially but I really didn't like Death Proof at all. First of all it has to be said that Death Proof was released edited together with Planet Terror (2007) as Grindhouse (2007) which bombed in theatres so Mirimax decided to cut their loses & release both films separately with Death Proof getting the 'director's cut' treatment which adds nearly thirty minutes of extra material & it's this extended director's cut that I am basing my comment on. My main problem with this version of Death Proof is that it's so slow & boring, virtually nothing & I mean nothing happens for the first forty minutes. You can switch Death Proof on forty odd minutes in & still basically pick up what's going on because almost everything that came before consists of annoying, mundane & very forced dialogue by pompous, unlikable self loving girls. I hate the way the character's in this speak, I suppose it's all very self referential & cool that feels very self conscious. The fact that Stuntman Mike only gets about five minutes of screen time doesn't help, his character is never developed & when the film finishes we know nothing more about him when it started. The other thing of note is that the second half of the film practically repeats the first half as it introduces a whole group of new character's after the first group have been killed off at the halfway mark & it also has a slightly different climax.Director Tarintino does a decent job here & he obviously pays loads of homages & rips-off the exploitation flicks that inspired Death Proof. From introducing scratches, pops, sparkle, repeated frames, skipped frames in the picture to abrupt cuts & there's even a portion of the film totally in black and white for reasons I can't figure out. To be honest these little exploitation touches don't work as they feel very deliberate whereas on genuine 70's exploitation it was down to technical limitations of the medium. Anyway who wants to see a film with scratches & poor edits? Don't all the exploitation classics on DVD that have been remastered & cleaned up look better, are more enjoyable to watch & are popular because they look so good on new technology? I admit there are some decent car stunts at the end but they are too little too late. I think Death Proof proves that Tarintino has a foot fetish, there are many, many shots of young girls feet throughout the film. There's not much gore or violence here, a severed leg, a couple of crushed faces, a bit of blood & that's it. No nudity either.Technically the film is good apart from those deliberate sound glitches, jump edits & print damage which sometimes makes it look like either your DVD player is broken or the disc is scratched! It's well made & has that big budget look about it anyway although the use of loud annoying songs irritated me. The acting is alright although most of the girls really annoyed me, they all seem to have these horrible attitudes that just rubbed me up the wrong way.Death Proof was a huge disappointment for me, I went into it hoping to like it but after the first forty minutes which nearly put me to sleep I was just waiting for it to finish. An OK end but everything else is horrible, I honestly expected so much more.",Death Proof
18,dbborroughs,emperor has no clothes. This film isn't much of anything,1,28 December 2008,"This started as part of the double feature feature Grindhouse and it has now been released as a single film. I didn't like it in Grindhouse and seeing it alone I think this is a pretty poor film.The dialog is exactly like rejected dialog from Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction. The most of the dialog serves no real purpose. Granted Tarantino is using it to blur whats going on, but its really just a series of discussions that lead, ultimately, nowhere. There is no deeper meaning to anything thats said. Since there is no ""action"" for the better part of an hour the dialog has to define the characters, however everyone speaks with the typical Tarantino cadence,think Travolta and Jackson in Pulp fiction on their vocal rhythms, with the result that most of the characters are not well defined The women in the first group all blend together with the exception of Rose McGowan and the ""New Yorker"" who seems out of place in Austin. Mostly the women stand out because of their hair and skin color.The car crash that takes these women out is spectacular, but only because we see it graphically three or so times with the severed limbs flopping about. Whats worse is that the accident ultimately makes no sense in any level at all, why do it? There is no reason- even if the ineffectual sheriff tells you why he can't do anything is a scene that belongs in another film. For me I always lose interest in the film after that(I've seen this and Grindhouse at least 4 times each), partly because the film starts over- sort of- with a bunch of kick ass girls- but also Stuntman Mike ceases to be a character that makes sense. There are no revelations about him- not that there needs to be- but his actions, by the car crash and the sheriff's speech implying more, leap so far out of believability that he stopped being menacing but became a joke.The next group of girls-all movie people are clearly outside Mike's league. Their dialog is slightly better than the first group of women but often comes off as shrill because its shouted. Their final confrontation with Mike is, to say the least disappointing. Okay they won't take Mike's nonsense and go after once he messes with them. So what? There is no real fear on their part when Mike starts up his games so you don't feel any tension. Worse they seem to be enjoying the idea of pay back more than Mike enjoys killing women. I'm not saying this because I feel emasculated, rather because it changes the rules, it changes what we feel into a joke. Worse, he's beaten so easily as to be a paper threat, how can you cheer when Mike was ultimately impotent? What's worse is the action is poor. The car chase is badly shot and really unexciting. I don't think I've ever seen such a dull chase in an exploitation movie (and I've seen hundreds). I've seen bad chases, stupid chases, every other kind of chase-but nothing this dull. My reaction when I got to the end was well that added up to nothing. Its like bad sex thats stopped before you orgasm, it kind of ruins the whole idea of sex.I don't think Tarantino was making a real movie as much he was making what he thought a film like this should be. Clearly he doesn't know films as well as he thinks he does. (I mean that literally as well as figuratively since there are times in the Grindhouse version when the film gets splicey and dialog repeats exactly the way a film wouldn't if you chopped out frames. and then repaired it.) If it was anyone other than Tarantino the film would have been hidden away or burned. Worse, if the film had been made in the 1970's when the films he mentions were made this film would have ended up lost, probably never going to home video-or if not lost then boxed in those 50 movie DVD sets that contain a great deal of crap because no one would ever put the films out except as filler.While I will say that Tarantino borrows too much from old movies, he is a good film maker most of the time. That said, it becoming painfully clear as time goes on that his bag of tricks and his ""encyclopedic"" film knowledge is beginning to fail him more rapidly. I would say something about him looking too tan and well fed in this film but there are other ways to imply he's lost touch with the hunger he once felt and fed the movies he made. His fans will love him no matter what- but some of us- some who may have even seen more films than him- maybe finding the emperor has no clothes.I'm curious what the future will bring.",Death Proof
19,lastliberal,"Ladies, we're gonna have some fun.",7,9 March 2008,"This film was supposed to be some kind of homage to the grind house flicks of the past. If so, I am glad that i missed them because it was really a bore with three exceptions.First, Vanessa Ferlito, who I would watch sitting in a chair for an hour anytime. hey, that what I did here, except for one fantastic lap dance. The whole first half of the movie was four girls talking. That's it. Then the lap dance and a short highway incident with the psycho Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell). To give him top billing was a travesty as Ferlito was clearly the star of this film.What kept me interested in the second half was, of course, Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson. I could watch them ride around in a car for an hour. hey, that's what they did! But I was happy.Finally, we get to the action in the last third of the film.

Then, one day, he picks on the wrong group of women...Good drama and fun, with some good action scenes. Has the depth of character and amusing conversations and diversions that make Tarantino movies so special.However, not as multi-faceted as any of his other movies, and a deliberate attempt to make a B-grade movie, this is Tarantino's worst movie yet.

Just look at Jackie Brown, Kill Bill Vols 1 & 2, Sin City to a certain extent, and this latest one: Grindhouse Deathproof. By the trailers I thought this movie would be absurd. I mean: a guy killing people with his car?? I figured it was Christine with an actual person behind the wheel doing the damage. It was surprisingly a lot better than what it seemed. There was plenty of character development being that there was not all killing all the time. The movie could have been considered slow, but Tarantino usually has a vivacious script with very little drab banter.I was rooting hard for the chicks. These girls I didn't mind rooting for either.

Then he made Death Proof.I understand the grindhouse conceit and I discount the grindhouse elements as far as I can.This just simply isn't a very good film. The story, even within the grindhouse genre, makes no sense. Tarantino's flair for character and dialogue seems to have deserted him - peppering the script with four letter words just for the sake of it does not make a good script. The dreadlocked lady in the second half of the movie spouts caricatured profanity to such a ludicrous extent that it becomes both tiresome and offensive (and, for what it's worth, the DVD's subtitles insert extra F-bombs which aren't even spoken). And, putting the bad language to one side, there are a number of stupefyingly banal and boring conversations between these groups of women, none of which has any plot relevance whatsoever, and all of which go on for what seems like hours.Over the top is fine - insulting the audience by selling them your private joke as if it's decent quality movie entertainment isn't.Here's hoping that the 6th film by Quentin Tarantino is better than the 5th - it would have to go some to be worse.",Death Proof
23,morrison-dylan-fan,Proving death.,4,18 November 2019,"Gathering up titles for a ""Auteurs in 2007"" week of viewing, I realised that I never caught the original presentation of Grindhouse (it never came out in the UK.) Picking up Grindhouse and the solo version,I decided to drive into both of them at one go.View on the film:Introduced in the Grindhouse cut with fake trailers far more inventive, funnier than the actual film, Writer/cinematographer/directing auteur Quentin Tarantino (QT) opens his segment with a foot waving in the air, a fitting image for the repetitive stamping on the same spot nature of the film.Attempting to pay tribute to the Grindhouse, the screenplay by QT completely misses the mark in being either a kitsch tribute or a actual Grindhouse flick, with each member of the girl gangs given little to distinguish themselves from each other, as each of them pour out QT's usual hip dialogue, which in this case comes out as clunky, due to a focus in the dialogue of forcing mention of the same two or three films over and over again, no matter how out of place it is.Utterly missing the leanness of real Grindhouse cinema, QT offers a glimpse of hope with the arrival of Stuntman Mike, but throws it all away, by having Mike not being the silent and deadly type in Grindhouse flicks, or the QT baddie with the winning one-liner, as Mike miss-timed stunts land him with the same colourless, bone-dry dialogue as the rest of the cast. The first time he has worked as a cinematographer on his own work, QT displays a shocking lack of attention to consistency on the aesthetic.Setting two girl gangs up against Stuntman Mike over a 14 month period, QT rubs the first gang down with a grating bag of tricks of fake spots, flickering lines and blobs on the print in a attempt to dig into the Grindhouse spirit, which get shoved aside for a modern, crisp digital sheen glossing between the cars in a enjoyable swift final battle with long crane shots that sure were not the type done in the Grindhouse era. The start of their collaboration, Kurt Russell steals the film as Stuntman Mike, thanks to Russell bringing out a laid-out coolness in Mike which tips at a psycho under the Death Proof hood.",Death Proof

It takes a humorous aim at luck in the form of Stuntman Mike. He charms a woman into his stunt car before running her and her friends to their deaths. After emerging from the hospital he targets four more women who are out for a joy ride but the event takes a very different turn. Quentin Tarantino has fun with the 1970's style exploitation and seems to be quoting greatly from films of Russ Meyers. This does not rank up with his work in Pulp Fiction but the action is fast and plenty painful. As trademarked there are numerous great sequences of long dialogue passages that bring sharp wit to perfect Tarantino's style. Kurt Russell brings charm, charisma and crazed energy as a stuntman whose two sets of victims bring two very different results. Rosario Dawson, Zoe Bell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Rose McGowan play targeted females. Bell plays herself taking a risk riding on the hood of a car, impressing viewers with her stunt work. McGowan plays an ill fated hitchhiker who encounters Mike at a roadside bar. Strong theme regarding risks that go too far towards the edge of death itself. Score: 9 / 10",Death Proof
25,Wuchakk,A soured stuntman (Kurt Russell) targets young women with his death-proof cars,6,15 October 2018,"Created by writer/director Quentin Tarantino, ""Death Proof"" was originally the second part of the double feature called ""Grindhouse,"" released in 2007. The other movie was ""Planet Terror"" by Robert Rodriguez. Both were standalone stories, although vaguely connected. They were a deliberate attempt to recreate the experience of a double feature at a B movie house in the mid/late 60s-70s with the prints intentionally marred by scratches and blemishes, etc. Trailers for fake movies, like ""Machete,"" were part of the package.The plot of ""Death Proof"" involves an embittered stuntman (Kurt Russell) and his psycho obsession with murdering young women of dubious character with his death proof stunt cars (but only the driver's side). It's like a melding of ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" (1965), ""Village of the Giants"" (1965) and ""Vanishing Point"" (1971), but with a more modern vibe and Tarantino's unique brand of moviemaking.The first half is very good, opening with the excellent ""The Last Race"" by Jack Nitzsche, which was the theme song for ""Village of the Giants,"" an instrumental. But the movie's hindered by the inane chatter of the girls. The dull drivel goes into overdrive in the second half, particularly that involving Zoe Bell, Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson. Yet viewers are eventually rewarded by a thrilling car chase in the country that's supposedly Tennessee, but obviously Southern Cal.Russell's character is perversely charismatic and the movie perks up whenever he's on screen. There are no less than eight female co-stars playing mostly classless types (thankfully, not all of them) and, depending on your tastes, four of them are quite alluring: Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rose McGowan, Vanessa Ferlito and Sydney Tamiia Poitier (yes, Sidney's daughter).The film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes and was shot in Austin, Texas, and Buellton, California.GRADE: C+/B-",Death Proof
26,The_Void,A well done homage to seventies Grindhouse cinema,7,24 September 2007,"Well, I have to say that I wasn't at all impressed when I found out that the Weinstein's had decided to chop 'Grindhouse' in half for the UK release, and at one point I wasn't even going to make a trip to the cinema to see each individual part...but then Death Proof got it's release and I ended up having to be there. It's always been clear that Tarantino is a fan of seventies Grindhouse, and he does an excellent job here of setting the scene and putting the movie squarely in the seventies...well, he would have done if it wasn't for the mobile phones shots and characters who mention the internet and CGI (what the HELL??). Anyway, the plot is typical seventies B-movie trash, and focuses on a stuntman named Mike (or 'Stuntman Mike') who gets his kicks by meeting and chatting up hot young women, before brutally smashing them to pieces in his specialised 'death proof' stunt car. We are introduced to a trio of hot young ladies early on in the film, and it's not long before Stuntman Mike sets his sights on the group and has his fun with them...One of the major problems with the extended cut that I saw is the fact that it's too long! Quentin Tarantino obviously values dialogue, but there's just too much of it and it's not as interesting as the chit chat in the likes of Reservoir Dogs. However, I did find out after seeing the film that the 'missing reel' in the American release was actually the lap dance scene in this version - and since it's the best part of the movie, I think I can stand a bit of boring dialogue! Tarantino lovingly implements many of the problems with cheap seventies exploitation flicks - stuff like bad editing and glitches, as well as a scene that suddenly switches into black and white...it's well done. Death Proof is a film of two halves, the first half being the far better of the two, though it never completely grinds to a halt and the second half of the film features an excellent car chase. The cast is one of the most interesting things about the film - I was extremely excited to see Kurt Russell back on the big screen after far too long, and he makes the best of his role as the deranged psycho at the centre of the film. There's no shortage of eye candy either - with ladies including Vanessa Ferlito, Rose McGowan and Sydney Poitier (that's Sydney with a 'y'!) providing the film with enough highlights! (Oddly, no nudity though). Overall, this is not a film without problems - but it's highly entertaining stuff, and fans of seventies Grindhouse flicks will no doubt enjoy it!

27,zetes,"The European/DVD cut is just as good as the Grindhouse cut, if not better",8,23 December 2007,"I honestly don't get the hate here. Tarantino is a smug bastard, to be sure, but he makes fairly entertaining movies. People complain about the endless dialogue, but I quite enjoy it here. I like the bad, B-movie dialogue of the first half of the film, as well as the more Tarantino-esquire stuff of the second half. They're all interesting characters and fine actresses, and I certainly don't mind listening to them talk. And that last half hour is so much fun that I'd still have a positive view of it, even if I had been bored by most of the rest of it. I had also heard a lot of bad things about this longer cut, but I do not agree with them. I'm not sure I'd say the film gets better  and definitely I wouldn't say it's a lot better. But I don't think it's worse, that's for sure. This version, after all, does contain the lap dance, which was infamously ""missing"" from the Grindhouse cut. And it's HOT (and has a great song playing). There's also a stronger connection between the two halves. It still feels like two different films, but it makes more sense now. It's been reported that the conversation scenes are all extended. I don't think they are at all. Certainly not in the second half, the conversation in the restaurant. It's the same as it was in the Grindhouse cut. There are a couple of brief bits in the first half that are extended, but nothing over which to get angry. The second half contains a pretty good sequence where the new chicks are introduced. I don't see anything at all to object to, and I was glued to the screen for the entire film. I had thrown it in thinking I would fall asleep. The adrenaline that was pumping in my system would not allow for that.",Death Proof
28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Death Proof,8,21 June 2007,"After the relative success of his homage to kung fu with his Kill Bill movies, Quentin Tarantino turned his sights to the 70s exploitation movies with Grindhouse: Death Proof. However, for us outside the US, we do not get the Grindhouse double bill with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror and a host of easter egg styled trailers, but rather we get the longer cut of both movies. Many have said that Planet Terror proved to be superior to Death Proof, but without watching the other, I thought Tarantino's offering was pretty decent stuff.Perhaps his detractors loathed how he made references to and probably paid homage to his own movies and signature style. This spelt E-G-O, and doesn't go down well, with its plenty of foot fetish shots, reminiscent of foot massages, and if you pay attention enough, you'd spot and hear about the Big Kahuna burgers, familiar tunes over the ringtones, yellow and black striped colour schemes, the alpha female type chicks, and loads and loads of vulgarity laced dialogue just about everything under the sun, with characters mouthing off in cars or around a dining table. That about sums up stuff from Reservoir Dogs all the way to Kill Bill.But Death Proof is a different animal altogether. Being his own cinematographer, QT has full control over the shots that he makes, and injects plenty of sleaze into his story - buxomy, leggy girls in tight tees and perky butts peeking out of hot pants, flaunting their power of sexuality in alpha-female styled attitudes. It's actually two different segments in one movie, each being quite different from the other in terms of themes, and style.The first half introduced us to characters like Arlene (Venessa Ferlito), Shanna (Jordan Ladd), Jungle Julia (Syndey Poitier) and Pam (Rose McGowan), who end up in a bar doing their own thing (read: plenty of dialogue and flirting with the camera). We get introduced quite slowly to the psycho Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell, with Snake Plissken styled scar), who while on one hand befriends the girls, but on the other hand, we are just waiting for the action to begin. Being a stuntman, his car is ""death proof"", meaning it's rigged like stunt cars that provide protection for its driver, and nothing else. And if you're twiddling your thumbs for some action to take over, then be prepared to wait a bit.You see, despite what you think Death Proof might be, it's nothing about the action, not at least until the driver takes the wheel. And when QT lets it rip, out comes the blood and gore, exploitation style. Given the fake jump cuts, bad editing and scratchy film stock, it becomes near impossible to find out just which parts were censored for the local M18 version. It does seem to make sense still and flow well, but you can probably bet your last dollar that some bits were removed. On the other hand, we have stuff like the lap dance kept intact, which was omitted from the double bill Grindhouse. Win some and lose some.The second half of the movie is a different story altogether. For the most parts, the 70s style gets junked, maybe because it got tiring, or it's too tedious to replicate the cheesy special effects over to this story arc, where the hunter becomes the hunted. There's plenty of action, but could I say it's somewhat repetitive and lacks that oomph, until the final moments where you probably might go ""that's awesomely cool"". Other than that, it's more of the same, with more eye candy courtesy of Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Sky High, Final Destination 3), Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thorns and Zoe Bell, with plenty more QT styled dialogue of pop irrelevance.While stylistically the movie might want to try and resemble low budgeted 70s exploitation movie, Death Proof juxtaposes certain current day elements into itself, making it somewhat messy with gizmos like cell phones and portable music players. What put a smile on my face though (besides the beautiful ladies of course), is Kurt Russell's two-faced Stuntman Mike performance. He can be nonchalant one minute, oozing indifference, and in the next, he can be so silently deranged you'd rather choose to leap from the vehicle, if you had a means to that is. Or he can be the classic road rage driver, before realizing he has bitten off more than he could chew. It's been some time having Russell on the big screen, and I thought he did fine, despite not being QT's first choice for the role.Ultimately, just one warning about the movie - expect plenty of dialogue, and I mean plenty, with characters talking about sexuality and about people who never appear on screen, and if you can't stand irrelevance, then steer clear. The action comes on in limited spurts, so if that's what you're after, then savour every moment when the gear shifts into overdrive. The loopy soundtrack too is a bonus, and adds some authentic exploitative flavour. QT did not manage to outdo himself, but still managed to capture the correct spirit in those films he wants to emulate. If Rodriguez's installment is as they say far superior than QT's , then I'd say bring on Planet Terror already!",Death Proof
29,Mr-Fusion,Too many talkie scenes make this a slow ride to Grandma's house,4,24 February 2014,"I really liked the pre-show '70s bumpers and the scratched film. Tarantino really knows how to set the vibe. But ""Death Proof"" is terrible. For far too long, this thing just moves at a snail's pace. Even Kurt Russell and his show-stopping (über-violent) big scene just gets lost in the neverending parade of dialogue scenes. Ladies talking about nothing. They converse in and out of cars, dive bars, on-and-on. Wouldn't mind it so much if there was substance - but these conversations are nothing like Tarantino's usual writing. The opening scene in 'Reservoir Dogs"" (Madonna, tipping your waitress) was maybe a few minutes, but there was much more to that scene than we ever learn about these girls in the first half of ""Death Proof"". This was a major chore to sit through. 4/10",Death Proof

31,Smells_Like_Cheese,Some of the most exciting car chase scenes since The French Connection,9,1 November 2007,"The other day when I was looking for a movie to rent I came across Death Proof, I wasn't interested in seeing it, but my boyfriend got excited because it was Quentin Tarrentino, and he's a huge fan. So we rented it and while I was expecting to hate it, it turned out to be the complete opposite; my boyfriend hated it but I loved it. I thought it was one of the most unique movies I have seen in a while. While the beginning was typical Tarrentino where we have pointless dialog and trying to get into characters that are hard to understand why we are supposed to like them, the film then picks up when Kurt Russell enters the scene as one of the scariest and most realistic villains, Stuntman Mike. He is one of Hollywood's best secrets, he always manages to bring in a great performance and makes the story turn into something incredibly interesting.We start off with a few girls who seem to be famous, they do billboard covers and are just spending their evening at a bar with some close friends. We then are introduce to Stuntman Mike who is creepy, but comes off as very charming and pretty safe, he gives one of the girls a ride home, but kills her in his ""death proof"" car and then kills the other girls in a horrible car accident. Since it seems like a typical accident, he is let go after killing all the girls. But he doesn't know what is coming to him when he messes with the wrong group of girls.I have to say that the last car chase scene between the three girls and Mike was a classic and will not be forgotten in my book. Despite how strangely this movie was shot, we start it off as looking like a bad 70's movie, then into black and white, then into color, and then into a modern looking film, the story was fantastic. I'm looking forward to renting Planet Terror. I heard that it was better than Death Proof, so that's gotta be good, right? Well, hopefully, I don't want to be disappointed, but Death Proof was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.9/10",Death Proof
32,Red-Barracuda,"Well, I for one liked it...",9,18 August 2007,"In Death Proof Tarantino pays homage to 70's exploitation movies. This is very much a movie about movies. From the numerous references to 70's low-budget classics to the blatant lifts from other films - the sequence showing the girls being photographed by the maniac is a complete re-staging of the opening scene from Dario Argento's The Bird with the Crystal Plumage accompanied by the original Ennio Morricone score! But such cheek is forgivable with Tarantino as he plagiarises in the best way and with such loving care. Great care, too, has been taken to make the film look suitably scuzzy, with sudden jumps and scratchy film. This is a movie where the viewer is actively encouraged to celebrate the fakeness. It's exploitation as art.The story is so throwaway that it's really not worth recounting. Like in the 70's movies Death Proof emulates, it's not that important. Instead, we get great dialogue, well-chosen music and some kicking action. Like in Jackie Brown and Kill Bill, the leading players are the ladies. Particularly impressive is Vanessa Ferlito who plays Butterfly, she has such a magnetic presence. Hiring stunt-woman Zoe Bell was a stroke of genius. Her presence allows for Tarantino to maximise the car chase scene, as there is no need to worry about hiding the face of a stunt double. The shots of Zoe on the bonnet of the car were outstanding. That girl is nails. One of the best action scenes I've seen in a long while and so refreshing to have no CGI here!After the relatively sparse dialogue of the Kill Bill films, QT delivers some sparkling stuff here. And it is nice to see him produce a self-contained movie - his first in 10 years! I reckon this is a goodie. The time flew in and I knew that I would want to catch this movie again. Tarantino has added yet another to his impressive body of work.",Death Proof

34,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,The title is something Tarantino arrogantly seemed to think his own career was...,2,29 September 2007,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) is a failed film set member who travels from state to state looking for young women to brutally murder. Until he pushes his luck too far and crosses paths with some girls who won't take any sh!t...Tarantino/Rodriguez got too far up their own arses. Too smart arsey, too self referentializing, too post modern, too...whatever. The first half of their 'Grindhouse' double feature, is Tarantino's contribution. Trying to re-create the experience of watching a 'Grindhouse' movie from the 70s, grainy, low-budget films with bad editing and production values, this is a vanity project that's backfired, failing spectacularly at the US box office and subsequently forced to have separate releases over here.Mr T has got carried away with himself here, saturating the screenplay with characters quipping off his trademark cool dialogue for lengthy periods (note a scene at the end with a group of girls sitting talking around a coffee table that'll have your head spinning around the auditorium.) The trouble is, nothing exciting happens in between. Quentin's known just as much for his love of outrageous violence as great dialogue, but you have to wonder where the 18 certificate actually popped up from, as the only really unsettling bit involves a girl slamming into the front of the passenger side of a car. There's some stylish, memorable stuff going on at the beginning, but by the end it's all just become such an over-whelmingly boring experience that you just don't care about it anymore. I did see a trailer for the next film, Planet Terror, before seeing the film and that does look like it has the potential to be fun. Lets hope so, so it can save this joint venture from being a complete failure. *",Death Proof
35,ElMaruecan82,"""Death Proof"" or the pornographic appeal of graphic violence ...",8,15 October 2011,"""Death Proof"" is the living proof that Tarantino is the real thing in terms of directing, editing, writing, you name them  yet it's not the film I would recommend to someone who's not familiar with his work. Seriously, it's filled with so much meta-referential humor it's just as if Hitchcock waved at the camera during a cameo. The film even starts with the beautiful sight of women's feet on a fast-speed driving car's window, and I admit that out of all Tarantino's signatures, it's the one I can't wait to see in any of his films; if only for that, the movie is guaranteed with at least 5 points in my book. But again, I insist that I wouldn't recommend this as a first Tarantino film. The whole experience would be pointless if you were not familiar with his recurrent trademarks and this is 100% pure Tarantino juice. And this is the film's both strength and weakness, as normally a movie should stand on its own but I know no Tarantino fan would care about what this 'normally' would do. ""Death Proof"" is made by a director so confident about his talent and proud of his work that it almost flirts with a narcissistic self-homage while it succeeds on being an exhilarating experience exploiting the sex appeal of violence. I loved the 'Tarantino' touch more than anything else, but although the film was not ""all flash and no substance"", it's just that the substance somewhat betrayed Tarantino's ego and sinned by pretension... a little bit.But ""Death Proof"" is all about exploitation when you think of it. On the surface, it's a spectacular homage to old exploitations film and on that department, you won't be disappointed; it has the feel of 70's slashers 'slash' pornographic B-movies with that grainy aspect, lousy editing, trashy dialogs, and abundance of sex and gory violence. These movies exploited our lowest manly instincts, to assault us with orgies of blood and sex, awakening our most repressed lusty impulses. It's only fitting that Tarantino paid tribute to films that are some sort of 'cinematic' pulp fictions, literally. And on that level, Tarantino exploited sex and violence in an extremely thought-provoking approach.So what is so thought-provoking in Tarantino's sixth film? First, it less exploits sex and violence than Tarantino's vision of them. And well, if it works in the first part of the film, the second part is so inferior that even a spectacular action chase sequence, doesn't redeem it and its feminist undertones make it only worse for me. And this is a problem, because the second act was still important to close the main character's arc. But as much as I'm impressed by the extraordinary build-up of the first act, the second just repeated the same scheme with other characters. I give an extra point though for the sight of Rosario Dawson's beautiful feet, that probably inspired me the same hypnotized reaction than Kurt Russel as Mike the Stuntman.But despite Kurt Russel's amazing performance as the charismatic villain and the impressive ""Death Proof"" killing-machine car, you can't exploit sex and violence, drugs and rock'n'roll, without expecting an overdose. The first act, that composed most of the trailer, worked as an extraordinary love scene with an orgasmic climax, and I mean it, it lasts only 30 seconds, but this only part justified the apparent slow pacing of the previous chain of events. The second part simply failed to maintain the same quality, I couldn't even feel engaged by the new chicks. I don't know if it was the script, the acting, the characters, but since they were stronger, their victory wasn't surprising, and it had to be women, to contradict the eternal pretty-chicks-as-eternal-victims label. Not bad in fine, but when you expect originality from Tarantino, predictability ought to be judged with more severity, that's only a credit to his talentThe film is supposed to be enjoyed by exploiting our lowest instincts, our fascination for violence to a pornographic level with the subtle intelligence that reveals our twisted delight to see sometimes upsetting, likr chicks getting brutally killed, as if it was a sort of divine punishment to their 'uselessness', not them as human beings, but as woman models. And if I were wrong, why aren't there more ugly women dying in slasher films? It's the same all mental process as for pornographic films where the film raises its climax with the man assessing his domination through a degrading act. Most male viewers are less excited by the sight of a sexual climax than the way it puts all the feminist model to trash. The targeted audience of ""Death Proof"" would be less likely to enjoy the second act for the same reason they loved the first. And this is Tarantino's thought-provoking approach I was mentioning earlier. The film is not just ""Tarantino for the sake of Tarantino"" or 'first, guy wins then chicks win"". Violence for the sake of violence is justified in the same specific cases than sex of the sake of sex, where they're not mixed in some subjects that are so real and sensitive that there can be a danger of glamorization, and this why, what works with ""Death Proof"" becomes bad taste in the case of the next film ""Inglourious Basterds"". ""Death Proof"" is entertaining material, with as usual, dialogs, sex, lust, violence, and a unique use of  music. There's one thing I admire in Tarantino is his soundtrack's choices and""Chick Habit"" is one of my favorite, and if only for that concluding song, the movie gets a final 8 So, to conclude, ""Death Proof"" is another complex case showing Tarantino's talent to create cruel dilemmas, I loved it for the wrong reasons, and what I didn't like is what makes the film good. Great, now I'm F-tortured",Death Proof

The two-half approach in 'Death Proof (2007)' kills the pacing, too. None of the characters have any development, perhaps because of the structure or maybe because of the writing. The film is made to look like a bad 70s transfer, with grunge effects and skipped reels. These are just plain distracting and actually disappear just over halfway through because even Tarantino must have found them annoying and useless. Overall, the flick is a joyless experience that didn't keep me engaged at all. Easily the acclaimed director's worst attempt. 4/10",Death Proof
37,dromasca,purest trash,8,11 April 2013,"Death Proof may be the most typical Quentin Tarantino product since Pulp Fiction. Those who love Tarantino will love the film and love him more, those who hate him will have at least one more item to add to the list of cinematic infamies they believe he is guilty of. While other pictures made by him in the last decade deal with bigger stories, or re-write episodes of history (WWII and the Holocaust, slavery and fight for emancipation) from the Tarantino perspective, Death Proof is almost a cinematographic alternative to Pulp Fiction, taking its inspiration from the low cost B-movies genres – horror thrillers and slashers.The film comes in two packages and I must mention that I have seen and I am writing here about the standalone Tarantino-only version. It lasts almost two hours and is symmetrically divided into two stories of equal duration. The common (and BAD) hero is Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) who is using his large and iron-strong car as a terror and murder weapon. In the first part he is set on killing a group of young and brainless girls he meets in a bar some place in Texas. In the second part he tries to do a similar act in Tennessee, but he runs out of luck. One of the girls happens to be a stunt-woman, another one seems to know what world she lives in and carries a gun. Not only that his murder plan fails, but the girls will respond with a vengeance. Almost like in Kill Bill. All things considered, Tarantino must be a feminist of some sorts.Some of the 70s movies techniques, starting with titles, ending with credits, colors and quality of the film give to Death Proof the air of authenticity and credibility. Beyond Russell and Tarantino himself who as in most of his movies takes a small role in the good tradition of Hitchcock, there is fine acting worth mentioning by Zoe Bell (a stunt woman herself, with the looks of a muscled Jodie Foster) who steps ahead of the crowd of beautiful women and leads their transformation from preys to hunters. The film is violent as any movie by Tarantino, but I must observe again that Tarantino's violence is so exaggerated and so cinematic that you can feel his smile (actually rather a grin) telling us – 'this is just entertainment'. Trash? certainly, but this trash is so pure that it's gold.",Death Proof
38,gbill-74877,Flawed but still exciting,8,5 September 2020,"Tarantino's love of pulp/grind house cinema comes through as always, and I liked the distressed look he gave this film. He plays with his audience and pays attention to all aspects - the soundtrack, the Austin-specific décor in that bar, the creation of singular characters like Mike the Stuntman (Kurt Russell), and doing some of the cool  he saw on the screen when younger, often much better. He plays with the audience gleefully, including doing little things like putting a ""missing reel"" card up instead of showing Vanessa Ferlito's lap dance in the theater (I still remember that), and then inserting it when the film was released. The female characters are objectified probably a little more than usual here, and yet they're also empowered. I loved Zoë Bell's moves towards the end - the big stunt of course, but just how dynamic she is in the pursuit sequences (damn!) - and Rosario Dawson can do no wrong. I've enjoyed this film each time I've seen it and this time was no exception, but its flaws were apparent. The characters engage in lengthy conversations which is not necessarily a bad thing, but in this case the writing is not quite as strong as it should be, and it also occurred to me that they often sound like they're channeling Tarantino himself in the way they speak. Even when he's not perfect though, there is something exciting about his films.",Death Proof
39,The-Sarkologist,Tarantino shines once again - in his own peculiar way,9,23 December 2011,"This is the first of two movies that were released as a double feature (the other being Planet Terror by Robert Rodreguez) that is supposed to bring back memories of the old Grindhouse Exploitation movies. Granted I have never been to New York, particularly during the 1970s when such movies were popular, but unlike many movies this is not supposed to be your average glamorous Hollywood movie. In fact it is anything but.The first thing one notices is that the film that appears to be used seems to be old and cheap. This is done on purpose to create the appearance of an old, low budget, 70's movie. In fact, this movie appears to be quite low budget, despite a couple of big name actors (including Kirt Russell, who plays Stuntman Mike). Further, like many of Tarantino's movies there is a lot of dialogue about nothing in particular and movement in the movie that does not seem to be going anywhere. This movie is also divided into two sections, set 14 months apart. Both sections deal with a group of young voluptuous women who are being stalked by a psychotic killer. The first group are simply innocent women on their way up to a lake for a girl's weekend away, while the second group appear to be like the first, except one is a secret service agent and another is a stunt woman.As mentioned, like many of Tarantino movies, there is a lot of ordinary dialogue between the female characters. These are ordinary people living ordinary lives, doing ordinary things. Okay, one is a radio DJ, and every time they see her billboard they cheer, but a lot of the action takes place in a bar where there are waiting for their dealers to arrive with their marijuana. They drink, they talk, and they play jokes on each other. However, lurking in the back is Stuntman Mike. He is an ugly man with a scar and drives a black muscle car. He is noticeable, and he is also manipulative, though he is also quite charming as he manages to charm a lonely girl in the bar, and also manages to get a lap dance out of one of the main characters.However there is much more to this character than meets the eyes. Granted, Tarantino never cuts corners when he develops his characters, and Stuntman Mike is no exception. His car is a stunt car which he describes as being 'death proof' (thus the title of the film). That is because it is designed so that the driver can drive at high speeds into a brick wall and not worry about being killed. However it is only the driver of the car that is death proof.Stuntman Mike appears to be a man who has a hang up about beautiful women. While he manages to give a young lady a lift home, she makes it very clear that it is only a lift home. As such he is powerless. Despite all of his charm (and his ability to get a lap dance) he is unable to persuade them into his bed. It is once they are alone that his real character comes to light. If he can't have them, nobody can, and while he does kill them, with Malice Aforethought, the law is unable to prosecute him.This is where the second part of the film comes in. Once again he is stalking a group of attractive women, and once again he decides to use his car to kill them. If he can't have them, nobody can. Thus he believes that he is exercising his power over them. It is like rape. Rape is not simply to force somebody to have sex with you but to exercise power over them – that is to create a dominant relationship over somebody. However these girls are different, they fight back, and this is where we see Tarantino's brilliance come to light. Stuntman Mike is visibly scared. In fact, he is so scared that he begins to cry. The tables have been turned and he is now powerless. Further, these girls will not give up, they will not let him get away. Despite his pleading and his remorse, he has met his match and he knows it. Now he must face the consequences of his actions, and they are not pretty.",Death Proof

42,johnnyboyz,"A really bad film, bordering on the embarrassing for Tarantino.",4,10 December 2008,"If, like me, you didn't like Death Proof then about an hour into the film you'll start rubbing the bridge of your nose or maybe twitching your right index finger over your left eyebrow and squinting down at the floor, repeating in your head (or aloud) every five minutes of so: 'I can't believe Quentin Tarantino made this, I can't believe Quentin Tarantino made this'. It is sad but equally as surprising just how low Tarantino has sunk with Death Proof, one half of an experiment (nothing more) he did with Robert Rodriguez called 'Grindhouse' which was supposed to recreate a 1970s, exploitation style experience in a Grindhouse cinema in which you'd see low-rent horror/sci-fi in all its gloriously gritty and patchy glory.While I haven't seen Rodriguez' half of the deal and I had to search the Internet for access to the fake trailers, Death Proof as a stand alone film is rubbish. Death Proof is more of a post-modern experience complete with deliberately dodgy picture quality and missing reels that force the film to 'jump' forward or backward momentarily than an out and out film. Although as a film, it is Tarantino merely recreating what he's done in the past; he has become someone that produces pastiches out of the work he has already made, which in simpler terms means he's either going backwards as a director or he's just simply run out of ideas. Unlike villain of the piece Stuntman Mike's tearaway car, the bandwagon may well be coming to a crashing halt.So what is Death Proof? Do you remember Bridget Fonda's character in Jackie Brown? The one that sat around all day getting high whilst wearing a bikini and presenting her toes to the camera and any character around her? Imagine a film in which there are half a dozen Bridget Fonda's from Jackie Brown as the lead characters. Witness them prating about, presenting their feet, visiting stores and talking about generally nothing for about a hour before being pursued by Michael Myers minus a mask and a knife substituted for a car.For my money, Tarantino and Rodriguez have already worked on a film of two halves; a film that begins as one thing before quite literally crossing a border and becoming something else  it was From Dusk Till Dawn, eleven years prior to this and even that didn't go down too brilliantly in the wider spectrum of things. The general approach to the film enables Tarantino to get away with most things. The idea we're watching something that has been put together poorly or was made on an ultra low budget means continuity can be ignored, and not for creative reasons. But other than that, what do we really have on show here? A couple of girls doing absolutely nothing until their time to become potential cannon fodder for Kurt Russell's Stuntman Mike arrives.Initially, Arlene (Ferlito), Shanna (Ladd) and radio disc jockey ""Jungle Julia"" Lucai (Poitier) are the focus. They're the sort of people who squeal excitably as they pass a billboard displaying one of them as the disk jockey they are. They dress in ridiculously revealing clothes and visit grimy, dangerous, run down bars to drink lots of booze with the owner Warren, played cringe-inducingly by the director himself. They send text messages to their boyfriends; we get to see in extreme close up fashion the texts they send; they get to talk about absolutely nothing for about half an hour  and for what? Is it just me or was this actually quite fun in the past with Tarantino? Has he copped out and moved along with the times, thus aiming his new films at the audience he is focusing on in these three girls? I feel really sorry for the people who will watch this as their first Tarantino film.The film isn't Tarantino, it's clichés. People drive for large amounts of time in cars talking about nothing in particular. In Reservoir Dogs, the guys spoke about Pam Grier et al; in Pulp Fiction they spoke about hamburgers and it worked but here it just doesn't come off at all. Tarantino even pastiches the opening shot of Reservoir Dogs as he spins round a table housing Lee Montgomery (Winstead), Abernathy Ross (Dawson), Kim Mathis (Thoms) and Zoe Bell playing herself talking about one thing or another. Even Tarantino himself rips off the 'That is a tasty burger(!)' line from Pulp Fiction  an iconic line in an iconic scene in an iconic passage of dialogue from an iconic performance in the contemporary era, rendered humorless and pointless when Tarantino sits there and says 'That is a tasty beverage(!)' having downed a shot. They are petty and daft references emphasising what I said earlier about the man either going backwards or having run out of ideas.The film's tour-de-force finale (at least it's supposed to be that) is a chase through the middle of nowhere between Stuntman Mike and the three girls. To say it's anti-climatic is as much as an understatement as it is disappointing to say so in the first place. Why it should work is because there is a girl hanging on for dear life on the bonnet thus something is clearly at stake  all that needs to be done is for the car to stop so she can get back in and given the girls have a gun in the first place, it's not like they're defenceless. I only hope Tarantino is able to come back from this.",Death Proof
43,TheMovieDiorama,Death Proof evidently illustrates that Tarantino's thirst for blood will never run out of fuel.,7,14 January 2020,"The second feature of Rodriguez/Tarantino's homage to the ""Grindhouse"" exploitation genre, is one that reeks of petroleum. Emphasising the raucous vehicular mayhem of muscle car extravaganzas that plagued cinemas in the 70s. But, this isn't just an exploration into ""death-proof"" automobiles, commonly driven by stuntmen. Oh no no! This is a Tarantino exploration, and if we know that deranged genius by now, expect prolonged conversational scenes from his taut screenplay, authentic scenes of violence and feet. Lots of feet.A stunt driver hunts down young women. That's it! It's as simple as one jaded stunt double, driving recklessly across America, crashing into women at ridiculously high speeds. This is Tarantino's interpretation of a slasher. Instead of a machete or other bladed utensil, it's a burning tyre to the face or body flying through the windscreen. He intelligently displays all aspects of a car and fully utilised each component as a tool or limitation for the characters. Whether it be clinging onto the bonnet at maximum velocity or imprisoned in the passenger side of a roll cage. The vehicles, much like the characters, are constantly at the forefront of Tarantino's screenplay.Unfortunately though, and this is his most common tendency, his script is anchored by overlong expository conversations that diminish the roaring entertainment. For example, Abernathy and her group of gal pals rest and chat about Bell's yearning for test-driving a Dodge Challenger. Whilst the elongated take, with Tarantino rotating the camera round the table beautifully for a whole ten minutes, was exceptional directing, it detracted from the blazing car crash that occurred just moments ago. And the reason for this was due to the courageous decision in change of characters halfway through the feature. The initial four girls were not exactly lap dancing their way out of that crash. Yet the principal commitment in altering characters, whilst narratively jarring, had significant purpose in defying audience expectations.Initially, we're led to believe that ""Stuntman Mike"" is about to produce the same exhilarating ""accident"" again. But Tarantino knows what you're thinking. He isn't stupid (except when choosing to act in his films...). And so he changed the structure by flipping it upside down. The hunter becomes the hunted. And it worked, effortlessly! Staring at real stuntwoman Bell as she plays ""Ship's Mast"" on the Challenger, whilst the antagonistic Russell continually bulldozes his car into theirs. Tarantino glides the camera across the landscape, exhibiting one of the most exhilarating car chases in quite some time. It's fun, energetic and a major contribution to air pollution. And then concluding on a freeze frame? Genius.Death Proof is the resurrection of a bygone sub-genre through the healing qualities of Tarantino's frivolous vitality. It rarely took detours and drifted excitedly round tight corners, albeit with limited exploitative violence and prolonged conversational scenes. Death Proof really is Tarantino-proof.",Death Proof
44,Tweetienator,Trash Deluxe,7,5 July 2021,"Death Proof is a fine stylish piece - I almost sold my DVD special edition some years ago and I'm happy I didn't - the soundtrack, the cam work, the girls and cars, everything just works well together and gives us a fine (technical better made) homage on all those trash classics of the 60/70s (Satan's Sadists, Hell's Bloody Devils, Duel, Russ Meyer movies and many more comes to mind). I guess, Death Proof disappointed me back then, because I compared it automatically to Pulp Fiction, which is such an outstanding and excellent masterpiece, and in my opinion still Tarantino's best work. Anyway, like Jackie Brown, Death Proof is a well-made and entertaining trip back in time, and as such, I would call it a fine piece on its own.",Death Proof

There are too many to choose from when it comes to his duds. ""Death Proof"" might actually be the worst of the worst. This movie has nothing going for it. It actually seems like QT has never seen any of the genre films that he's supposed to admire. The ""famous"" QT dialogue is no where to be found. With the exception of Kurt Russell, the cast is weak and uninteresting. ""Death Proof"" is a movie that fails at everything it was attempting to do.",Death Proof
46,southdavid,Crash Test Dummies.,8,5 October 2020,"After neglecting our Tarantino reappraisal for a few weeks, we got back behind the wheel with ""Death Proof"", Quentin's half of the Grindhouse double bill, to partner Robert Rodrigues' ""Planet Terror"". Though even Tarantino himself has labelled it his worst film, personally I enjoy it more than some of the others.Two sets of young women, each out for separate nights of fun attract the unwanted attention of Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), an outwardly charming, if perhaps intimidating, character. Mike's cars have been customised to severely reduce the risk of permanent damage to their driver, in the event of an accident, but not to anyone in a passenger seat or the receiving end of his violent psycho-sexual collisions. His cars are lethal weapons and he's not afraid to use them.I understand, and would agree with anyone who argues that ""Death Proof"" is at the very least Tarantino's least consequential film. I think it benefits enormously when it's not your first time seeing it, as when you understand that there's very little in the way of plot to worry about, you can just settled in to the characters and the dialogue, which is often Tarantino's strength. This is, probably, his most playful film. Always eager to bring back Red Apple cigarettes or Big Kahuna burger, here characters crossover with other films, such as Michael and James Parks returning as the Detectives' McGraw.The film is distinctly 70's in style. The stock scratched and choppily edited, the women objectified, the muscle cars, diners and outfits all designed to homage the ""Grindhouse"" exploitation cinema that Tarantino was forged in . . and provided you're in on that joke then it's a lot of fun. This might be for subsequent reviews, but I do think - from here, the grindhouse violence of the finale's of his next few films work against them - but here it's perfectly placed gory fun.",Death Proof

And so did Tarantino himself since he doesnt look upon it as one of his feature films.,3,12 October 2019,"When this movie was released it wasnt an official Tarantino release. It was more of a fun experiment. A throwaway. It was suppose to be a double feature, (with director Rodriguez: Planet Terror) but of course the cinemas expected us viewers to pay for 2 separate films anyway and rarely ever showed them together.I expected a lot from this movie, when it was first released, but it was so terrible that I had totally forgotten about it. And so did Tarantino, since he himself does not regard this movie as an official feature film of his, because he labels his latest film ""Once upon a time..."" as his ninth movie, which means he doesnt count Deathproof as a serious feature movie. (He has promised to only make 10 movies in total, his last one probably being a Star Trek movie?)Tarantino, being a lover of violent pulp movies as a kid, decided to go full pulp with this one. He forgot though that most pulp movies are actually really pulp for a reason: they s**k. And so does Death Proof, in which he became arrogant and thought he could release anything and it would instantly become a hit. It didnt, it became his biggest flop, commercially and critically it was a disaster. Only suited for cult fans of the pulp and gore genre.",Death Proof
48,Vartiainen,"Way too talky, even for a Tarantino",7,11 March 2019,"Death Proof, directed by Quentin Tarantino, is the other half of the Grindhouse double exploitation experience. The other half being Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror. In it an aged stunt driver, played by Kurt Russel, stalks different groups of women in his souped-up muscle car, getting sick kicks out of their terror.And, as stated, it is an intentional, old school exploitation film, so expect a lot of stereotypes, gore scenes, sexualization of women, drinking and smoking, and just all around extreme tastes. Think of what Tarantino usually does and then remove the slightest of filters he usually utilizes. And, if you like the style, this is definitely a film worth checking out.That being said, it is curiously slow for an exploitation film. Tarantino is known for his lengthy, bizarre dialogue scenes, and nowhere is that more apparent than here. Granted, they are very good dialogues and these are all interesting characters, played by talented actors, but they're still as long as hunger years. Tone it down a bit, Quentin. We don't necessarily have to know the whole life story of every single character on the screen. Just saying.But, it's not like I was bored. More morbidly fascinated by their length. And luckily the few action scenes the film has are really good. They're just as over the top, practically made and beautiful in their goriness as we've come to expect from Tarantino. No complaints there.Death Proof is most probably the weakest film Quentin Tarantino has ever made. But, to paraphrase his own words, if this is the worst he's ever made, he's good. He's very good.",Death Proof

And the thing that irritates me the most is that it doesn't have to be bad quality, they made it bad quality on purpose. This movie is a bit creepy, just because I hate picturing Kurt Russell a deranged serial killer.This movie is about a man and his car. Mike was a stunt man in Los Angeles and now, in Austin, Texas, he picks up chicks in his creepy stunt car, drives it super fast, crashes it or steps on the breaks, and he's okay because his side is meant for stunt people, but the girl in the passenger seat gets a nasty head-crashing-into-the-windshield moment. Mike does this a few times as well as just crashing into other people's cars, but eventually some girls track him down and kill him. It's awesome.Overall, I give this movie a 6 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Good.",Death Proof
50,Bezenby,Absolute Knob Cheese - and you all took a bite,1,12 February 2016,"Despite what people 'think' this film is about or what Tarantino's intentions were with this film, all I experienced as a human with sensory input was a flatulent deluge of words from a chug-nut so in love with his own dialogue that he forgot what a true 'grindhouse' offering was. This guy owns the negative of Polk Country Pot Plane. Has he actually watched it? Death Proof, and I say this as someone who has reviewed nearly 500 films on the IMDb, is the worst film I have ever sat through. Honestly, why would Quentin think that anyone would want to sit through hours of folks talking about nothing for no reason that had nothing to do with the plot? The mind boggles. This film involves hours of girl talk while Kurt Russell waits about to kill folks in his stunt car. I have suffered through Killjoy, Museum of the Dead and the Stink of Flesh, and this is much worse than those films. I mean it. An hour of Tarantino's 'pish' dialogue passes before anything interesting happens, and once it does, it's another hour before anything else happens.Why does the world think this guy is any good? He has about three films that are enjoyable (Dogs, Pulp, Django) - Anyone with an interest in the genres he exploits would already know films from that era that can't be replicated. This KUNT thinks he can rip off Bird with the Crystal Plumage and High Crime and no one will notice.Thanks for wasting Kurt Russell, ya tosser",Death Proof
51,thinker1691,"""A Little More Information, than I needed""",8,23 June 2008,"Kurt Russell is an exceptional actor in motion. When we first took notice of this up and coming thespian, we saw him evolve from a good-looking young teen in many of his Early Disney's films, to his first adult roles. Many critics believed and still do, he never did grow out of his early cocoon characters and thus do not take Russell seriously. I and many of his loyal fans disagree. He is a remarkable individual who does well to establish his own mature persona in many landmark films like ""Escape From New York and ""Soldier."" In this current offering, ""Death Proof"" Russell plays 'Stuntman Mike' a cool, calculating, but extremely diabolical character who seems gratified to seek out, temporally engage, then destroy beautiful, unsuspecting women, just for the fun of it. Throughout the film, one wonders ""WHY"" as no real reason is ever given. The director ( Quentin Tarantino ) is much like his film persona as he lets' Mike all but dominate the action-packed film only to reverse all that he created. A first for Russell as we see what forty years of movie roles have done to this once great actor at the hands of directors. Nevertheless, a good and interesting film, despite the disappointing last sequences. ***",Death Proof
52,freemantle_uk,A QT B-Movie Homage,8,21 May 2010,"In 2007 Quentin Tarantino and his friend Robert Rodriguez attempted to play homage to the grindhouse films of their childhood: cheaply made double-features that were often exploitation flicks. They released their films, Death Proof and Planet Terror as a double feature in America as Grindhouse, and had fake trailers directed by directors like Eli Roth and Edgar Wright. But Grindhouse flopped in America, so to recoup its money Death Proof and Planet Terror were released as two separate films.Death Proof follows the victims of Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), a psychopathic ex-stuntman who stalks young women and uses his specially reconstructed car to do this. He is a menace in Texas and Tennessee. He uses his skills as a driver and willing to put his own life at risk, but he is no plain psycho, he is a intelligent and articulate. His targets include a group of friends in Austin, who want to spend a night drinking before going to a lake-side retreat and a members of a film crew who have a few days off.The plot is thin, but that was work some of these B-Movie were like. What Tarantino does as a writer and director is turn these B-Movie ideas into higher quality films. He shows his skill with witty and clever dialogue throughout. He sets out to make his character interesting and well rounded, but leaves enough mystery with Stuntman Mike to make him an effective villain. The smarter thing to do is not say why someone becomes a serial killer in these type of movies. Tarantino shows his skill with some expertly crafted chase scenes, using good old techniques giving them a more real edge. It shows his love for these type of movies. Tarantino also references some of his own films in Death Proof, such as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, making out there live in the same universe. It's debatable if they really are though. Tarantino also shows a few different styles of filming, a scratchy style like it was on cheap 70s film where it cuts in random places, a small scene in black-and-white and more standard filming. The scratchy is a nice homage but the black-and-white was a little random. There was also a good soundtrack, a common trait in Tarantino's films.Kurt Russell was good choice to play the villain: he was a star in the B-Movie circuit, being in many John Carpenter films. His age and physical prowess was perfect for the role and he had the acting chops with the chance to use some excellent dialogue. There was a good cast of tough women in the film, Rosario Dawson, Zoe Bell (in her first real role), Vanessa Ferlito and Sydney Tamiia Poitier are just a few examples. Tarantino knows how to get a good performance out his actors. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was also wonderfully native and she was hot in a cheerleader's outfit. But there seems to be a more voyeuristic nature to this film, with Tarantino more willing to sexualise his female characters. He allows the camera to oggle at some of the women and Tarantino seem to have great fun filming Ferlito's lap-dance. It seems to be a step backwards for Tarantino considering Kill Bill had such as strong female lead.Whilst the film is good for the most part, it is the weakest film in Tarantino's filmography. It does not have quiet the same quality to his other films. Some scenes were too long and the film could have been cut by about 10 minutes. Death Proof could have been a really fun 90 minute experience. It also seemed a bit ill-fitting to have modern technology like iPods and mobile phones when the film was shot in a 70s style and the fashion and cars also seeming to be from that period.This is an enjoyable homage to films of Tarantino's youth.",Death Proof
53,dfranzen70,Slightly anachronistic but still good trash,8,31 October 2007,"Grindhouse was originally released in theaters as one big movie comprising two feature-length parts, complete with fake trailers, that evoked the cheap and cheesy cinematic experience of low-budget movies in the olden days. However, each of the features was instead released separately on DVD, also in keeping with grindhouse theater tradition.Death Proof, from Quentin Tarantino, relates the story of one Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), a movie stunt dude who's tricked out his kick-ass muscle car to be, well, death proof, meaning that it could be used as an actual stunt car, able to withstand high-velocity crashes without its driver sustaining much in the way of injuries. But see, Stuntman Mike isn't just some guy with a mean-looking car, he's also a sicko who gets off on killing young women. This is the kind of theme you'd see frequently in low-budget films of yesteryear - the sexy damsel in distress who's mowed down by a some psychopath with no greater motivation than sheer lunacy. Mike's a scary-looking fella, too - he has a long vertical scar that begins above his eye and travels down to his chin. He's gritty, slimy, grizzled. Heck, he kind of looks like Snake Plissken, come to think of it; all he's missing is that eyepatch.In the first half of the movie, Mike stalks a group of young women, following them to a honkytonk bar. The women are luscious and oversexed, another theme of cheapo trash movies; eventually, Mike offers a lift to Pam (Rose McGowan), who's not even in the group he's been following. Do you think Pam will make it home in one piece? Yeah, I'm gonna go with ""no"" on that one, Johnny. Mike's car is death proof, indeed, but as he accurately notes, you get the full effect only if you're in the driver's seat. Hey-o! Anyway, death happens. There is a huge, wildly violent crash, as Mike uses his car as the ultimate murder weapon.Once you accept the concept of the movie - that it's really supposed to be reminiscent of those crappy drive-in films of the past, complete with poor cinematography and editing - then you can somewhat enjoy the movie. I qualify that statement because there's one big problem I had with the movie, and that's while it should remind you of, say, a 1977 hot-rod/sexploitation movie, there are such curious anachronisms as cell phones and some late-model cars. There must be a logical explanation for this, but if we're supposed to think of those older movies and the primary vehicles in the movie are from the 1970s, then why have modern gadgets? Doesn't that sort of defeat the purpose a little? Russell is awesome as the diseased creep - he reminds me not only of Plissken but of Rondo Hatten, who played many seamy and seedy monsters back in the 1930s and 1940s. Stuntman Mike is a typical tough, hard-ass Tarantino character who can also use words to knock down an opponent - or win a lady. With a squint and a glint, Mike is instantly a mysterious rascal with an agenda, although the exact nature of that agenda isn't known until deeper into the film.The rest of the cast is pretty good, although I do wish the entire atmosphere of the 1970s had been preserved; there was just too much modernity to the sets and the characters' mannerisms to suit me. The women we see in the latter half of the movie outshine those in the first half, particularly real-life stuntwoman Zoe Bell (playing herself, natch) and Rosario Dawson. Not faring as well were Vanessa Ferlito and Jordan Ladd.Beyond that little head-scratcher, though, the movie's not half bad. Were it not released as a big budget movie to such fanfare, it might even qualify for cult-movie status. Heck, it still might. The crash scenes are wonderful, pulse-quickening shots born of angst and revenge; you can almost feel the glass splintering, the metal bending, the rubber leaving a mile-long skidmark. This, along with pepper-hot dialog, is Tarantino's calling card - recall the crash scene in Pulp Fiction with Butch's car. Tarantino, typically, writes himself a good part as Warren the Bartender, although he didn't give himself a witty monologue like he did in Sleep with Me or even Pulp Fiction.",Death Proof
54,kevin_robbins,There is not one part of this movie I'd complain about and this is easily a 10/10.,10,14 June 2021,"Death Proof (2007) is a movie I originally saw in theatres, have in my DVD collection and recently watched on Tubi. The storyline focuses on a stuntman serial killer who hunts down attractive females he can kill with his car. This may be the first time you've seen a car used as a weapon by a serial killer...at least used as a weapon like this. This movie was directed by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) and stars Rosario Dawson (Kids), Kurt Russell (Escape from New York), Rose McGowan (Planet Terror), Eli Roth (Inglorious Bastards) and Zoe Bell (Once upon a Time in Hollywood). This movie is absolutely awesome. The female dialogue and perceptions are so well written and delivered. Every single cast member is perfectly selected, from main to minor characters. The car scenes and intensity is perfect; and in no surprise, the soundtrack is epically brilliant. There is not one part of this movie I'd complain about and this is easily a 10/10.",Death Proof
55,Chris_Docker,Minor masterpiece,10,17 September 2007,"Before anyone thinks that my 10/10 rating is to suggest everyone should like this film, let me correct any misapprehension: I predict it will divide even Tarantino fans more than any of his earlier films.Death Proof has the dubious distinction of appearing to be a real low-brainer. But apart from the clever use of 'retro' cinema techniques it also boasts insightful dialogue and a storyline that resounds on multiple levels. This becomes more apparent with repeated viewing.Here's some of the things I like about it:-As a straightforward adrenalin rush, it hits all the right spots. Stunts are (very pointedly) real, not faked or CGI'd. One of the main stars is a real-life stuntwoman and skilled in martial arts. Car chases are really at 90mph. A head-on smash is replayed from several angles. Performances are gutsy.The dialogue has many fascinating sections where I want to hear it again and again for the sheer enjoyment. DJ Jungle Julia engineers a clever word-game for which her friend 'Butterfly' is the recipient, complete with get-out options if she doesn't fancy the guys who might play it. Even the description of a man she might fancy has a hip repeatability that makes you strain to catch the exact wording (it is repeated later, but again at breakneck speed). The first time I saw Death Proof I found the all-girl bitching/scheming tiresome. It can make the first half hour seem never-ending. I almost felt Tarantino had lost it. But this had the effect of lulling me into a state where the sudden terror in Act Two (as Stuntman Mike gives a girl a lift in his Death Proof car) was all the more scary. In retrospect, the girl-talk is fascinating. And on second viewing I listened carefully to every word. There were shades of meaning that added to the story. Something else I like about Death Proof is the cinephile references. These go far beyond the simplistic I Spy of films like Scream (a car, at one point, drives through a noticeboard for Scary Movie 4). They are complex allusions that encourage study of cinema and, in return, enhance our enjoyment of Death Proof. I had never seen Vanishing Point until I caught Tarantino's enthusiasm for it in this film. Zoe Bell frequently talks about it. Kowalski (from Vanishing Point) is her hero. She has gone to great lengths to find an original 1970 white Dodge Challenger, as used in Vanishing Point, to test drive. (This car, and the earlier film, feature very prominently.) Car chases in the two films have striking parallels. Both can be unashamedly symbolic, but the heroine of Death Proof (unlike Kowalski) refuses to be beaten.Perhaps more convincing to me than the highbrow/lowbrow analysis of why I liked the movie is the fact that I watched it four times in as many weeks. There are few films I can enjoy like that. Even classics that I re-watch every year would bore me if I saw them several times in quick succession.Death Proof is the story of a serial killer who uses a stunt car to murder women. There have been accusations of misogyny. If Death Proof encourages misogynist attitudes that would be a serious issue which needs to be addressed.Women in peril is a long-running theme in cinema. Feminists may rightly complain about the one-sidedness of female stereotypes. But filmmakers may claim that they simply present stories based on popular culture. And many women I know still enjoy the idea of a knight in shining armour who comes to the rescue. It is an idea deeply embedded in society. Death Proof, on the other hand, has a woman (Bell) 'rescuing' both herself and her female companions. From a psycho male. She even takes the symbolic George and the Dragon posture near the end, straddling an open window with a raised, lance-like iron pipe in her hand. The squealing of the trapped girl in the first half of the film is mirrored by the squealing of a trapped man in the second half. Film academic Susan Hayward comments on the 'vicious normalising of misogyny' in films like Psycho and later slasher movies. (Tarantino has compared Death Proof to a slasher film.) A psychological analysis compares these movies to vampire films originating in a bourgeois society that has become aware of a concealed dependency on the working class. It is the dependence of the stronger on the weaker. In gender terms, it is male dependency on the female for his subjectivity (the Death Proof psycho-killer relies on his victims for sexual fantasy). In an irrational response to fear, the stronger (man/vampire/ruling class) then tries to kill the weaker, before that dependency is uncovered. In Freudian terms, the phallic substitutes (traditionally knives, but in this case a car) are used to 're-castrate' the phallic woman.One viewer said she 'felt raped' after seeing the film. But it begs the question: should you go to see a scary movie if you do not want to be scared?I hope I have given you some idea of the richness of a movie that will attract both praise and scorn. It is not an easy film. It re-creates the look of flea-pit, B-movie grindhouse films, referencing their stereotypes and paying homage without being a grindhouse film itself. The timeline can be more difficult than some audiences will be comfortable with. It has a surface vacuity. But a vast amount of detail is crammed in visually and within the dialogue and repays repeated viewing amply. Its minimalist storyline, and its excellence in portraying realistic car chases and smashes, make it a temptingly iconic benchmark as well as a cult movie. It just might not be the kind of cult movie you expect.",Death Proof
56,MaxBorg89,Tarantino's B-movie: a spectacular ride!,8,7 June 2007,"It all started as an homage to old exploitation cinema and double feature screenings. It was meant to be one of the most shamelessly entertaining films of the year. Sadly, after flopping in the US, Grindhouse has been chopped in two, with Quentin Tarantino's segment, Death Proof, being the first to be released on its own after competing at the Cannes Film Festival. It is not presented in its Grindhouse version, which included scratches, dirt, missing reels and other visual aging techniques; instead, we get the full cut, containing additional information regarding certain plot points and a few ""juicy"" bits that were left out first time around (a hot lap dance being the best new scene). And while it certainly would be fun to see the entire double-bill in all its glory (hopefully it will get a worldwide DVD release), I must say I really enjoyed QT's half as a separate picture.As this is intended to be Tarantino's answer to '60s and '70s B-movies, the plot of Death Proof is extremely simple: there is a psychopath, named Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), who enjoys killing women with his car, a virtually indestructible vehicle (""This car is 100% death proof. Only to get the benefit of it, honey, you REALLY need to be sitting in my seat!""). Whenever he arrives in a new town he selects a group of girls and sets his perverse plan into motion. And unless he runs into someone who is as crazy or drives as well as him, there is no way to stop him.Those expecting QT's usual stream of film references will be disappointed: apart from a hilarious restaurant scene that sort of spoofs the opening of Reservoir Dogs and a couple of nods to similarly themed horror flicks (and, of course, the casting of Russell, which is a deliberate homage to John Carpenter), the director is not interested in exposing his absolute knowledge of this kind of cinema. This time, he delivers a straightforward genre movie, albeit with his trademark tough women at the center. The trailer promised a wildly fun B-movie, and that's exactly what Death Proof is: a movie like they don't make anymore, old-fashioned, irony-free and exciting as hell.However, this does not mean Tarantino has set his visual or verbal obsessions aside: the dialogue is as imaginative and surreal as it has always been, and there are enough shots of bare female feet to keep fans happy. Naturally, being this a QT flick, those feet belong to a quality cast: the only real star in the film (apart from the villain, that is) is Rosario Dawson, but she is part of a talented ensemble, which includes Vanessa Ferlito (CSI: NY), Rose McGowan (Scream) and stunt-woman Zoe Bell (who doubled for Uma Thurman in Kill Bill). The mention of honor, though, goes to Russell, who finally has the opportunity to go all bad again, and boy, does he go bad: even when he is pretending to be a friendly chap who offers you a ride home, he exudes a sense of menace that doesn't leave until the end of the picture. Also worth praise are Michael Parks, reprising his role of foul-mouthed sheriff Earl McGraw (of From Dusk till Dawn and Kill Bill fame) and tying the two halves of the film together, and Tarantino himself, popping up as smug, ridiculously likable bartender Warren. The latter is particularly charming because, unlike other times (From Dusk's Richie Gekko is a good example), QT does not try to prove he can act (although he pulled off a remarkable job in Alias). He's just there for the sheer fun, like everyone else.Pure, unadulterated fun and excitement: that's the key to appreciating Death Proof. Do not expect a smart, unusual take on an overused genre, like the director has done in the past: this time around, he sticks to the rules, delivering a loud, silly, sexy, violent piece of Entertainment with a capital ""e"". It may not be the best film of 2007, but it sure as hell is one of the most purely enjoyable.",Death Proof
57,JasparLamarCrabb,A quarter of a great movie,5,7 September 2008,"This second half of the GRINDHOUSE double bill is directed by Quentin Tarantino and benefits greatly from his now famous encyclopedic knowledge of all things cult movie...this is his ode to VANISHING POINT combined with any number of serial killer movies. Kurt Russell is a stunt man (who doubled for Robert Urich[!], a typical oddball Tarantinoism) and is now a deranged serial killer who uses his souped up car to stalk his prey. Unfortunately, Tarantino spends an inordinate amount of time developing his characters (both Russell and his eventual victims) that it bogs the movie down to point of being nearly sleep-inducing.

58,yusufpiskin,Grindhouse v2 (Extended Cut Dvd Versiyon),8,12 December 2020,"I understand the disregard for this movie, even including Tarantino himself, but for me the combination of a slasher, car and low budget ""grindhouse"" movie work perfectly together, and the ending sequence is really second to none, for me this one just works on every level. also this halfway through the movie transition just works wonders for me, don't know why really, it's perfect in its imperfection I guess...there's a lot of contrasting elements of this film that balance everything out to create a true gestalt of Tarantino's favorite stylistic/formalistic trappings; i absolutely loved the slasher grindhouse first half, plodding around in a Friday the 13th-esque meandering pace with Tarantino's signature slice of life elements, a long fuse that explodes into a breathtaking explosion of vehicular and bodily carnage.more than that i love how the second half is pure catharsis, winding the clock back to 0 with another long fuse of meandering slice of life antics before the film turns into one of the best final climaxes i've ever seen.seeing the second batch of would-be slasher victims lash back in a vitriolic fury was just as breathtaking as the impeccable stunts and balls-to-the-wall high octane chase sequence. the final girls turn slasher, the hunted become the hunters.there's pure delight from start to finish here, with Tarantino completely leaning into his influences with characters straight up quoting films in their dialogue. it definitely feels like a proto Once Upon a Time in Hollywood in that sense as the film still operates under the genre trappings of a slasher film.",Death Proof
59,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Not Tarantino's best, but still a blast",7,2 August 2016,"Death Proof is... not the best flick in Quentin Tarantino's career so far, but an entertaining little ride through the B movie corn nonetheless. It's Quentin playing in the sandbox, and although he tends to fling it about too energetically in spots, and dawdle around listlessly in others, one can forgive such pacing issues when you consider how much fun it is for the most part. It also helps that his Grindhouse effort is heaps better than his pal Robert Rodriguez's painfully lame Planet Terror, but that's a whole other chestnut. Death Proof works mostly thanks to the bubbly, endlessly sexy performances from an extensive roster of irresistible cbicks, and one gleefully evil bit of work from genre legend Kurt Russell, having a devilish blast as Stuntman Mike, a psychopath who batters helpless chicks to death as he rattles them around in his specially rigged vintage muscle car, primed for murder and ready to burn rubber straight to the ER. A fair chunk of the film is spent simply observing these girls talking, bickering, socializing and indulging in idiosyncratic pop culture banter that's a facet of the Q Man himself. He loves to project his own affinities onto the written page and use them as backbones for his characters, and although that may be one of the core elements of screen writing in itself, it's always a little more pronounced with QT. Writers are books, but he is a popup book, always a tad more garish than the rest of the kids on the playground. I don't wanna say that such lengthy swaths of running time spent on girls chilling out isn't fun (it's captivating, especially with this bunch), but it is essential to the Grindhouse vibe they set out to emulate? A minor quibble, but a quibble all the same. To their credit, the girls are simply terrific. The first bunch include Rose McGowan's angelic and short lived Pam, Sydney Poitier's spunky radio DJ Jungle Julia, and Vanessa Ferlito's wiseass Latina. The first act sees them run into Stuntman Mike in a roadhouse bar owned by Tarantino himself, who just can't resist casting himself in his own stuff lol. Oh well, at least he didn't try an Australian accent this time around. The second time act we meet Rosario Dawson, stunt woman Zoe Bell and cutesy pie Mary Elizabeth Winstead, all in the cross hairs of Mike's radar, but this time he may be in way over his greaser hairdo-ed head. The vehicular mayhem is traditionalist and non CGI, and quite honestly a spectacular firework show of blood, glass, metal and scorched asphalt. I just wish there was more of it, man. Sure, the character building with the gals is awesome, but it eclipses the action in gross proportion. A little balance between talky talky and vroom vroom would have been appreciated. Russell is a hoot in a role that was originally going to be played by Mickey Rourke. He just has that knowing gleam in his eye and good ol' boy charm that makes it work so well, especially in a naughty little fourth wall break that shows you just how much Mike enjoys his sick little game of bumper cars. There's characters that bleed in from Rodriguez's side of the fence, including Michael Parks as the seemingly immortal Texas Ranger Earl Mcgraw, and Marley Shelton as his daughter. It's a valiant effort, with plenty of Mad Max style merit and a seriously smoking lineup of luscious ladies. I just feel like he over fed certain ingredients to the pot when cooking this one up, and neglected others in areas. Still though, even average Tarantino is brilliant, and this one glows, if for a few dull spots.",Death Proof
60,hu675,"This is a review of the Extended, Unrated Version of ""Death Proof"".",9,29 September 2007,"I was lucky this year to seen ""Grindhouse"" in theaters before it's wasn't playing anymore. ""Grindhouse"" was unfortunately one of the biggest box office disappointment of 2007, despite it was well received by the critics. Sure, there was some critics did love ""Planet Terror"" more than ""Death Proof"" or it was the other way around. Which both movies were extremely entertaining. Which did recaptured the feel of a Grindhouse movie with an bad looking print, crappy sounding audio at times and occasionally missing reels of the movie. Which it was great but unfortunately movie audiences of today were not ready to see that kind of movie. Only those, who seen those kinds of films in the 1970's or those who are fans of Robert Rodriguez's and Quentin Tarantino's work will certainly get the idea.""Death Proof"" is the second half of ""Grindhouse"" and those who enjoy Tarantino's movies will expected the smart dialogue, great characters, excellent music, his trademark and a tribute to other films. Which they could be well respected, cult favorites and lesser known movies as well.Three different attractive ladies (Vanessa Ferlito, Sydney Poitier and Jordan Ladd) are good friends and they are hoping to get drunk with their boyfriends (Eli Roth, Omar Doom and Michael Bacall) in a obscure bar in Austin, Texas. Then an mysterious stranger by the name of Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), who seems to be charming middle-aged man. Who does stunts for a living but this Stuntman Mike isn't what he seems to be. He's actually a stalker and he kills people by using his stunt car as a lethal weapon. When he has enough with the ladies he admired, they are going to get it. Which he seems ordinary by the woman, he meets. Then months has passed, he has his eyes on a group of actress and stunt woman's (Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms, Zoe Bell and Mary Elizabeth Winstead) as his next target. But Stuntman Mike isn't prepared of what these woman are capable of doing.Written and Directed by Quentin Tarantino (Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs) made an entertaining character-driven thriller with plenty of thrills and laughs. Tarantino is giving an homage to the car-chase movies of the 1970's. This movie does have a lot of interesting Chick-Power Chatting. Tarantino's woman in the picture are well-cast, including Rose McGowan in a memorable small role. Bell, who's a stunt woman in real life. She does terrific stunt work during the last 20 minutes of the movie and she certainly earns her paycheck. Russell's role in the picture is actually one of his best in years, his character is slightly mysteriously and you could feel his character in the whole movie (You could see him in the background in certain key scenes of the film). Tarantino appears in a bit part as a Bartender, Tarantino certainly tributes himself during the second half of the movie. Tarantino is also credited for doing the fine widescreen cinematography of this stylish movie.This is the unrated, extended version of ""Death Proof"". Which it adds more than 20 minutes of additional footage. The missing reels are back into the movie, which Tarantino's fans will be happy to see Ferlito's tasteful lap-dance sequence and as well for a never seen before 10 minute opening sequence in the second half of the story. Which it expands their characters in the second half of the movie. But don't worry, the film still has its scratchy looking feel in the first half with the occasional bad soundtrack and the jump cuts as well.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Disc 1 also has an juke-box music option, an featurette and previews. Disc 2 has over an hour of fascinating featurettes and more. Although this DVD edition (sadly) doesn't have the three awesome, funny fake trailers before ""Death Proof"" started. Like Eli Roth's ""Thanksgiving"", Edgar Wright's ""Don't"" and Rob Zombie's ""Werewolf Woman of the S.S."". Many fans are wondering if the full ""Grindhouse"" experience will arrive on DVD one day. I doubt, if it will soon. ""Grindhouse"" experience was certainly one of the best times, i had in a theater. Seeing the full intended version of ""Grindhouse"" on DVD one day. It won't be the same kind of fun, once it arrives on DVD and it make perfect sense in theaters. Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" will arrived on DVD in a couple of weeks. Which it will be extended and unrated as well. I would love to see more ""Grindhouse"" movies in the near future but the disappointing box office run, it had. It will probably never happen again. It was a one life-time experience for the audiences for those, who loved it or even hated it. Until then... enjoy the Extended, Unrated Version of ""Death Proof"". Panavision.

61,jfgibson73,Homage to 70s B-movies,7,7 September 2021,"I enjoyed this movie. I don't mind all the dialog. I'm not really into car chases, but the stunts were impressive. Most of the movie is girls hanging out. The first half of the movie, they hang out in a bar. The second part, they are driving around. Kurt Russell plays a murderer who kills people by driving into them with his special car. He kills the first group of girls, but the second group beat him down.",Death Proof
62,JoeKarlosi,Death Proof (Extended Cut) (2007) **1/2,6,30 September 2007,"I've already written about Quentin Tarantino's DEATH PROOF as part of the second half of the GRINDHOUSE double feature shared with Robert Rodriguez' PLANET TERROR. Having just watched the new solo DVD release of the ""extended"" cut of DP, I would have to conclude that longer does not always mean better! The extended DEATH PROOF is just a little more than okay, and I wouldn't place it among what I'd call Tarantino's ""greatest"" works. I thought Quentin's choice of Kurt Russell in this picture (after he originally wanted Mickey Rourke) worked out wonderfully. Russell plays a has-been stunt driver from past TV days who calls himself ""Stuntman Mike"", and he drives an old car that has been souped up to sustain all types of abuse and is virtually ""death proof"". He hangs around the bars to try and schmooze with young girls, but once he gets them into his deadly car for a ride, that's when his dark and psychopathic tendencies erupt. It was a lot of fun to see Russell in this part which he seemed perfectly suited for. He's terrific in the movie and it's an asset to have him in it. Every time Russell is on camera the movie is interesting. When he is not, interest wanes. (But at least it may be said that Tarantino's sluggish pacing at least works to give the first grisly sequence of the film a very powerful impact). As a Tarantino fan I always look forward to his clever dialogue (the PULP FICTION musings were classic), but I have to say he came up empty in that department this time; I wouldn't call the uninteresting conversations here between his female characters anywhere near his best, and these dull blabbering scenes go on waayyyyyy too long. On top of this, the foul-mouthed female characters aren't very interesting and sometimes one or two of them can even be downright annoying. While Quentin's taste and placement of vintage music in his movies has always been damn good, it's just hard for me to believe that these young girls here could actually be as clued in to these outdated oldies to the extent of knowing all the words to ""Baby It's You"" or eagerly quoting the names of yesteryear's ""Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Titch""! This just smacks of Tarantino's own self-indulgence, and doesn't seem genuine coming from today's youth. It's like self-masturbation for Quentin where he gets to live his fantasy of having attractive young beauties say whatever he'd like them to say. As it turns out, the Extended DEATH PROOF adds insult to injury if you, like me, feel the dialogue in this movie is unexciting and just drags on. Because what we get here is just more of that pointless padding, and it makes what should have been a quick and breezy70 minute flick into pretty near two hours, which is just too much. As minor compensation, we do get to finally see Vanessa Ferlito give Kurt Russell his lap dance which was only hinted at in the theatrical version. **1/2 out of ****",Death Proof
63,kairingler,Death Proof,8,8 March 2008,"Quentin Tarantino i think is like a fine whine,, keeps getting better with age.

65,slokes,Riding With The Girls,5,24 June 2016,"""Death Proof"" celebrates women as only Quentin Tarantino can celebrate them, as hyperliterate movie buffs transformed by a highway predator into whooping killing machines. Just be warned: You have a lot of waiting before anything happens.Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) is a throwback to the 1970s in a lot of ways. He dresses like ""Smokey And The Bandit""-era Burt Reynolds in a gaudy silver jacket and wears his hair in an Elvis pompadour. Stuntman Mike has other baggage, namely a killer chick habit that involves terrorizing and butchering pretty young women. There's also his car, all black with a duck ornament and a skull painted on the hood. ""I wanted it to be impressive, and scary tends to impress,"" is how he amiably explains it to a woman (Rose McGowan) who unwisely allows him to take her for a ride. Then he grins at the camera, and the movie finally switches into a higher gear, forty minutes in.I used to think it would be fun to watch a Quentin Tarantino movie where the violence and terror was put away in favor of just hearing his characters talk for a while. Then I got to see him do it in ""Death Proof."" I won't think that again.Designed to hail back to exploitation thrillers of the early 1970s, and originally part of a double feature that was released under the ""Grindhouse"" title, Tarantino provides his fans with some knowing chuckles while testing the patience of everyone else. ""Death Proof"" works, as well as it does, as a kind of double feature of its own, with two sets of women who have to deal with Stuntman Mike.These women can be distinguished by the trivia they discuss. Group #1 is heading for a lake house, and talk about sex with guys, how girls named Shanna hate being called ""Shauna,"" and the 1960s pop band Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich. Then Stuntman Mike makes his play, and we move on to Group #2, working on a movie in Tennessee. They talk about sex with guys, Italian Vogue, and the 1971 movie ""Vanishing Point.""These conversations have their moments, but after a while you wonder when Stuntman Mike will appear. A charitable viewer can mark this all as the price of admission for a set piece involving fantastic stunt work which occupies the last 20 minutes of the movie. Zoë Bell, a professional stunt woman who plays herself, has a breakout role riding a Dodge Challenger on the hood, and negotiating the spiky temper of her fellow stunt woman, Kim (Tracie Thoms). Thoms and Bell are at least believable in their Tarantinean back-and- forth, as movies are their characters' lives. The others seem less like people and more like snarky, swearing repositories of Quentin Tarantino wit.Russell makes the most of a minor role, underplaying the menace most of the way. He's especially good in the first half, which needs him to carry a long scene set in a bar with Tarantino himself playing the bartender. Asked about his weird car, he jokes that it's his Mom's, then registers genuine dismay when no one recognizes the names of television shows he worked on in the 1960s and 1970s. He has a sweet moment when he tries to charm a leery woman into giving him a lap dance, which in an extended version we actually get to see.But Stuntman Mike is not a character but a plot mechanism; in the second half of the movie he's a different kind of guy entirely. Like everything else in this movie, he flips on a dime. In the end, this unmoored quality comes to define ""Death Proof,"" for better or worse. It's the sort of film that entertains more the less one thinks about it, not exactly brainless, just careless to a fault.",Death Proof
66,ptb-8,Fool Proof,3,26 April 2008,"A boring 45 minutes of ridiculous dialog is no excuse to then show more female mutilation, but guess what... in this boring violence fest it apparently is....DEATH PROOF is another film of pervert violence aimed at showing beautiful women with their body parts slashed bloodied and degraded. Gee isn't Quentin clever.... not. This film is a disgrace and does not even homage the original genre it pretends to copy.... I saw VANISHING POINT and DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY in first release in the 70s unlike the playstation zombies in the audience today.... I even ran them as a double feature in my own cinema as both were Fox releases and could be teamed... even sometimes with MOVING VIOLATION..... so how does this new drivel match it with this genuinely cult drive in fun of the 70s? well obviously it does not, and you would also agree if you saw the originals this drivel steals from. Both DMCL and VP are 99 minutes of entire movie running time of exciting car chase as opposed to the ten minutes in Death Proof... also those films do not rely on bashings, and cruel blood scenes involving women to excite its pervert audience. DEATH PROOF is awful and a huge con to dumbed down DVD drones who gawp at QT like he knows something original. DEATH PROOF is proof that the only death on show is the career of Mr Tarantino.

67,dworldeater,"Not crap proof, a waste of Kurt Russell's talents",3,7 March 2015,"This was originally released as a double feature Grindhouse, with Planet Terror as the first film and this as the other one. I actually really like Robert Rodriguez's film Planet Terror, but in my opinion Death Proof is garbage. This film is an attempted homage to the exploitation muscle car movies of the 60's and 70's. To be frank, a lot of those films are bad. But the people who made those movies did the best they could on small budgets, limited time and limited talent. Quentin Tarantino however, does not have the same problems as these up and coming film makers. In fact, he often works with excellent actors, has large budgets and most of the time his films are still terrible. Death Proof is a perfect example to prove my point. I know this is supposed to be campy, but Tarantino takes his self indulgent crap too far with this film. It would be a miracle if Tarantino can take anything serious for longer than 2 minutes. There are is abundance of pointless, stupid dialouge, silly scenes with no payoff and a lot of style over substance. The first 20 minutes of the film are boring, pointless and just inept, self indulgent attempt at telling a story. This was a complete waste of Kurt Russell and his talents as an actor. He did deliver a great performance anyways with minimal character development. Kurt is great as Stuntman Mike, an old school cowboy stuntman that gets his rocks off running down pretty girls. Tarantino dropped the ball on this big time by having Stuntman Mike getting punked off by the girls in end. He also adding insult to injury made Stuntman Mike a crybaby coward. Why would you cast one of the most talented, rugged action icons and use him this way? The pseudo intellectual jerkoffs that shower Tarantino with praise need to wake up and get off his nuts.",Death Proof
68,TOMNEL,"It delivers in the end, but it's just too wordy.",7,21 August 2009,"Quentin Tarantino is one of my personal favorite directors and screenwriters. He knows how to write for people (albeit through his way of speaking), and he knows how to write clever and interesting dialogue, and he knows how to make a great ending. This film has a great ending, and occasionally it has some great dialogue, but unfortunately all too often there is just too much dialogue and not enough going on. This movie could be condensed into an hour, but instead lasts at around 105. It's just too much.The film is really split into two separate films. The first half introduces us for a very long time to some young women who are about to meet Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), a killer driver. The second half features some tough women who don't get picked on by anyone.The climax of this film is what will be remembered, not the long scenes of chitter chatter. This is an excellent climax with a great car chase scene and an ending that is very satisfying. It's the time in the middle that is just way too much. Girls chitter chatter about this and that, and none of it adds up to anything, and unlike some of the great dialogue Tarantino has written for films like Pulp Fiction or the second Kill Bill, this is just drab. There are a few good conversations however, and Stuntman Mike is actually given some really good dialogue, and the scene between him and Rose McGowan is actually quite entertaining. Nonetheless it's too little too late.The performances are very good. The girls know how to be innocent and ""funny"", and also tough. Kurt Russell manages to squeeze likability into his role, and is funny, menacing and quite likable.Overall, this movie has moments of greatness with too much monotony stuck in the middle. For those who can withstand boredom, or find entertainment in long stretches of mundane dialogue, this might be a treat. For everyone else, at least it pays off in the end.My rating: *** out of ****. 111 mins. R for strong language and violence.",Death Proof
69,jaybob,Another winner from Quentin Tarantino,10,3 November 2007,"Most of my reader know that I do not appreciate an excessive amount of foul,gutter type language.As you notice I gave this film a rating of 10, even though the dialog in DEATH PROOF is overloaded with this language; Mr.Tarantino writes so humorously his language never seems that foul.This version is extended & re-edited from the 91 minute film that played together with PLANET TERROR under the title GRINDHOUSE.The film is in 2 parts, The first part is set in a dusty saloon in Texas, concentrating on a group of (not so reputable) young ladies talking about themselves & there men folk. In this bar there is also a Movie Stuntman excellently played by Kurt Russell, He is old looking, scarred & battered. He is also--SPOILER ALERT-a serial killer.I WILL NOT SAY WHAT HAPPENS.The next part is some time later now in Tennessee. We have 4 girls talking (these ladies are stunt women).. For some reason they take after Kurt Russell ( same character) & a fantastic long car chase scene follows. It is very exciting. This part has a different conclusion than the first.Quentin Tarantino fans will connect easily with all the movie clues he uses.Everything about this film is first rate,its nearly 2 hrs long & pure fun, Violent yes, but not terribly so.There also is an excellent modern song score (from a juke box) that even I ( who does not like current music) enjoyed.Ratings: **** (out of 4) 97 points (out of 100) IMDb 10 (out of 10)",Death Proof
70,aidanratesmovies,I Love this FIlm,10,5 March 2021,"Although it's not necessarily his usual form of storytelling, Tarantino's B Movie antics are incredibly nostalgic and fun- while also packing a punch in terms of his signature commentary and entertaining extreme violence. There are many haters of this film, and on some level I understand their concerns, but personally I think it's one of Tarantino's best films. Now is it up there with the likes of Pulp Fiction and Django? Probably not, but it matches my love for the underrated Hateful 8 and I certainly found a grand amount of enjoyment from every single minute of it. My only problem with the film is that it feels a bit abrupt shifting tones through stories, with almost little to no warning. I enjoyed both stories throughout the film very much, although I think I have to give a slight edge off to the first half of the film. All the actors throughout the film are great, I obviously enjoyed the amazing Kurt Russell's performance as stuntman Mike, but actresses Vanessa Ferlito, Rose McGowan, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Rosario Dawson, and Zoe Bell are just some of the phenomenal standouts this film possesses. I adore the look of this film, Tarantino went for a grainer 70's vibe, and I feel a lot of the film just physically is truly art- the cinematography and everything with it. The soundtrack is phenomenal as always, and the film is loads of fun, packing a punch with almost biting satire at times, and a violent but as always entertaining sequence of events. In the end, Death Proof may not be for everyone, but it certainly pleased this Tarantino fan.

71,ShootingShark,Psycho Stuntman Vs Groovy Girlies Drunken Petrolhead Action,6,27 September 2007,"Stuntman Mike is a sick guy, who stalks young women and then kills them by crashing his reinforced death-proof Chevy Nova into them. But one day, when he takes on Kim, Abernathy and Zoe, he meets his comeuppance.As with all Tarantino's work, this film is both crazy and tremendous fun, but it's also weaker than his previous movies. The notion of directing a deliberately bad film is funky but flawed (the only other example I can think of is Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive which has similar good and bad points); bad films that are fun are usually fun because they weren't intended that way. What spoils it for me is simply that it's all talk and no action - if Tarantino really were making this for Roger Corman in 1973, Corman would never allowed him to have all these long, long dialogue scenes, which are well-acted and well-written, but go nowhere and bog it down. Only in the last twenty minutes does it finally come alive with a great chase sequence, as the girls pursue Mike in their Dodge Challenger. That said, there is lots to enjoy here, especially all the deliberately faked cheapness - jump cuts, film breaks, mismatched sound, scratches and hair-threads - and the director's flair for vinyl classics, cult film references and in-jokes (e.g. Parks reprises his character from Kill Bill: Vol 1). Russell is wonderful as the grizzled, disturbing, eloquent Stuntman Mike (Roth perfectly describes him as having cut himself falling out of his time machine), and all the women are great, particularly Ferlito in the first half and New Zealand stuntwoman/actress Bell in the second. Tarantino plays his customary bit-part as the bartender and was also the cinematographer. I'm a bit ambivalent about this movie; it's fun, but it's probably twice as much fun if you're drunk when you see it, and I'm not sure that's an endorsement. It's still pretty much a one-of-a-kind though, but Jackie Brown has just as much style and much more substance. Shot in Austin, Texas and originally released in the US as Grindhouse, a double-feature with Robert Rodriguez' Planet Terror, but shown here in the UK in a slightly extended version on its own.",Death Proof
72,valleyjohn,Proof Tarantino doesnt make a bad movie.,8,6 August 2020,"As a parent , one of the hardest questions to answer is ""which of your children do you like most"". Even harder is ""which do you dislike the most ""and to me , picking a Tarantino film i dislike the most is nearly as hard , as i love everything he has done but if i had a gun to my head Death Proof would be the one i would pick .This is the story Stuntman Mike who is a professional body double who likes to take unsuspecting women for deadly drives in his free time. He has doctored his car for maximum impact; when Mike purposely causes wrecks, the bodies pile up while he walks away with barely a scratch.I'm not crazy about the way Tarantino made the first half of this film. He physically scratched the film to make it look like a 70s Z movie but it did nothing for me. Thankfully you do get used to it and somewhere in the movie he ditches it completely .It's a slow burner to start with . It's not until we get to know Stuntman Mike and his motives that it really becomes exciting.
I saw this when it first came out but i forgot how extreme the car crash scene was and it really is a powerful piece of cinema .
After that , you are just waiting for Mike to get what is coming to him as this is a staple of most Tarantino films.I love the car chases and the stunts by Zoe Bell and as usual the choice of music is inspired.I definitely enjoyed this a lot more second time around because i've really become a QT fan boy and i really hope he reneges on the statement he made when he said he was going to make ten films then retire.

73,TheFearmakers,Vanessa Ferlito shines; Zoe Bell STINKS,5,20 November 2018,"The device of DEATH PROOF and Robert Rodriquez's co-feature, PLANET TERROR, are an abundance of deliberate aesthetic flaws: a tribute to b-movies that played so many times in low-rent ""grindhouse"" theaters, they wound up tarnished and with entire reels missing. In the two-parts of DEATH PROOF it's one man, Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike, who connects each...As does Quentin Tarantino's dialogue, spoken by the two groups of pretty young girls: the first with local billboard-famous leader, Sydney Poitier as the Austin, Texas morning disc jockey, Jungle Julia...And while Tarantino's no stranger at placing characters inside a contained, often claustrophobic setting, from RESERVOIR DOGS to FROM DUSK TILL DAWN to THE HATEFUL EIGHT, there were reasons to be there, and basically, no way out as opposed to merely harboring spontaneous, incessant chatter. Meanwhile, the buried lead and most interesting overall, is sexy, full-lipped Vanessa Ferlito as Butterfly, who Jungle Julia sets up on what can only be described as a ""blind date lap-dance...""The usual Tarantino cult pop culture product placement
Which is just about the only thing resembling an actual plot-point or plot-driven device, and the significance involves who eventually gets that dance...Enter Kurt Russell's weathered and leathery, facially-scarred stalker, who's somehow intriguing to these hot young girls, especially lone ""skinny hippie"" fox Rose McGowan, who fatefully needs a ride home. The fact she'd trust an old man with a DEATH PROOF vehicle that includes a working driver's side while the passenger area, separated by Plexiglas, has only a removable metallic bicycle seat, is farfetched and ludicrous...But horror/slasher victims are usually way too gullible; here resulting in the only truly nightmarish death as the following ""four birds with one stone"" slaying occurs much too quick, and after the amount of time spent with these girls, is downright anti-climatic...Leading to the second story headed by real life Uma Thurman KILL BILL stand-in Zoë Bell, who, while doing her own stunts, isn't very interesting, attractive or talented as an actress/character. Then again, her more legitimately trained on-screen cohorts, including Rosario Dawson, are equally dull and forgettable...So to really get off on what's intended as a b-movie exploitation tour-de-force, the first story is terribly flawed but after several viewings can be extremely addictive, and effective...With layers thinly disguised and partially revealed at the primary rainy-night location: a BBQ tavern where Tarantino himself plays Warren, a movie-geek owner and bartender: as director and especially as cinematographer, some of the best shots are of what's actually his own jukebox that, as usual in QT cinema, plays awesomely obscure, vintage tracks...As other subtle and ultimately futile plot-points include Julia's desperate and lonely attempts to connect with a famous filmmaker on her cell phone, when she's not trying to score pot with a dealer/friend as the otherwise annoying, parenthetical stoner chick camaraderie becomes more worthwhile and edgy once Kurt Russell is introduced, in the flesh and outside his formidably foreboding car: an example of Alfred Hitchcock's theory of how an otherwise mundane, superfluous dinner conversation becomes genuinely suspenseful when a time bomb's revealed under the table: shown only to the audience. And this guy's definitely ticking...Alas, while Russell's potentially iconic Stuntman Mike becomes one of cinema's most pathetic horror movie antagonists by the atrociously obvious, politically-correct ""Girl Power"" finale, he starts out an effectively mysterious, Neo Western loner... a hybrid of Burt Reynolds (including a 4th wall-breaking grin) and Norman Bates... and he may or may not even be an actual stuntman...Strangely enough, an 11th hour rural Daylight car chase (with a strap-grabbing roof-ride ala TEEN WOLF) pales to the Nighttime group of empty souls drinking, smoking pot and otherwise doing and discussing absolutely nothing. As if Quentin Tarantino's meantime vices/hobbies were put on camera but with girls: Along with the usual pop culture references, he's writing what he knows, and in other films is beyond capable of writing females...But in the beginning of part two, a girl talks about how she loves when a dude kisses with ""mushy lips."" Ugh!!! Whether that's a chick thing or not, it's downright banal and embarrassing dialogue, intentional or otherwise...Thankfully, Quentin didn't give that line to movie-stealer Vanessa Ferlito (who reluctantly allowed her own kisses to one of several barroom losers, all the while seeming to harbor an interest/attraction for Rose McGowan's Pam). Arlene aka Butterfly was the one and only girl who really called the shots. Unfortunately, her only mistake was simply going along for the ride.",Death Proof
74,truemythmedia,The Feminist Tarantino,8,26 July 2019,"Overall Death Proof isn't one of Tarantino's classics, but that's not to say it's not a bad film, on the contrary it's quite a good film, but one that suffers from some deliberate pacing that really only serves as a throwback to the 70s slasher flicks that this film represents, and not so much on character building. If this wasn't just a GrindHouse throwback film, and had just a little more intrigue rather than memorabilia, this very easily could've been one of Tarantino's greats. The characters that we spend the most time with just aren't nearly as compelling as many other characters that Tarantino has created, but with one exception being Stuntman Mike who is a very menacing villain and one played perfectly by Kurt Russell, he steals the show and is an absolute blast to watch. The film takes its time to build up to the the explosive finish, but when the action finally arrives, Tarantino delivers his best and then some, making one of the greatest car chases in cinematic history. So while Death Proof isn't nearly one of Quentin Tarantino's greatest films, it still has enough flare and action to stay true to his always inspiring aesthetic, and also making a decent movie honoring those nostalgic films of the 70s.

75,a_chinn,Tarantino's weakest film is still pretty damn cool,7,21 October 2017,"As a complete film, I'm not sure this one quite comes off, but in terms of being a love letter to grindhouse cinema, it's filled with wonderful touches throughout that make it an absolute treat for fans of 1970s exploitation flicks (which I came to love in the 80s on VHS). Touches that I loved in ""Death Proof"" were the faux scratched up print, the costumes that looked both contemporary and period, the missing scenes, the film's title change (""Quentin Tarantino's Thunder Bolt"" that appears on screen for a split second), bad rack focusing, the film title font choice, the subtle reference to other classics like ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" in the film's opening title sequence or references to cheerleader and muscle car movies or to voyeuristic giallo films or even dialogue references to classics like ""Vanishing Point"" or ""Big Wednesday,"" and then there's the casting of Kurt Russell, which that in and of itself is enough to evoke nostalgia from 80s Gen-Xers who should be thrilled to see Russell getting to play a badass once again. The story is one of the film's weak points, which is unusual for a Tarantino film. The story follows two separate sets of beautiful women being stalked by serial killer Stuntman Mike (Russell) and his Death Proof car, but maybe the implausible story and gaps in logic are part of Tarantino's homage to exploitation cinema. Another complaint is that some of the dialogue, particularly in the first half of the film, although entertaining didn't seem to serve either the story or character development, which Tarantino usually does so well. But again, Tarantino may just have been riffing and having fun with this freewheeling film. But for all it's flaws, this is still a highly entertaining film and it's impossible not to enjoy the badass showdown between Stuntman Mike and the second set of women, who happen to include amazing stuntwoman Zoe Bell. This film should have made Zoe Bell an action star, but that may not have happened since there are so few female action roles in Hollywood. Tarantino really knocks it out of the park with the film's final chase and action sequences, which are greatly aided by Tarantino's excellent choice of music (though the music choices throughout the film are great). If you had any misguided belief that this was a throwaway film on Tarantino's part, he again proves himself as a true ""cinema guy"" and does deliver some moments of pure cinema (moments that could not be captured in books, animation, comics, or any medium outside of film). Besides any scene with Russell, I think my favorite moment of the film is was when Zoe Bell is on the hood of the Dodge Charger and Tarantino has the camera go into close-up on Rosario Dawson's face, who is at first terrified by Bell on the hood and then slowly comes to the realization that Bell is loving it, as Dawson breaks out into a smile. It's a great performance by Dawson, but Tarantino's slow zoom and patience to hold on Dawson are just brilliant. Like most Tarantino films, this one features a deliciously eclectic cast, that besides Russell and Bell includes Rosario Dawson, Rose McGowan, Jordan Ladd, the underrated Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Eli Roth, Michael Parks as Earl McGraw and James Parks as Edgar McGraw, Marley Shelton, and Nicky Katt. Although this film is likely Tarantino's weakest film, it's still a solid film and well worth watching.",Death Proof
76,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Flawed, but Interesting Semi-Slasher",7,25 July 2019,"This was a film that I was bummed that I missed the Grindhouse double feature when it first hit theaters, but I did make up for that by seeing it soon after it hit DVD. I will admit that I really didn't care for this one, but respected it as a film. I was really curious after hearing podcasts about it to come back to see if my thoughts have changed on it. I did luckily finally get to see the double feature as it was showing at my theater with a many of other Tarantino's films ahead of Once Upon Time in Hollywood. The synopsis here is two separate sets of voluptuous women are stalked at different times by a scarred stuntman who uses his 'death proof' cars to execute his murderous plans.Now to lead off here, this is Quentin Tarantino's side of the Grindhouse double feature and this definitely feels like a film he made. We start here with a group of girls in a car. It is driven by Shanna (Jordan Ladd) and she is with Arlene (Tracie Thomas) and in the back is Jungle Julia (Sydney Tamiia Poitier). They're in Austin, Texas and Jungle Julia is a local radio host. Arlene is only visiting. It is revealed by Jungle Julia and through a friend, that Arlene learns that on the radio that morning, a deal was set up that if anyone comes up to her, calls her Butterfly, buys her a drink and recites a poem, she has to give a lap dance to them.They go a local bar to drink and they encounter Stuntman Mike McKay (Kurt Russell). He's an older man who as his name implies, is a former stuntman. He is keeping an eye the group of girls as they're drinking and having a good time. He is distracted though when Pam (Rose McGowan) needs a ride home and he agrees to do so. Stuntman Mike approaches Arlene later in the night and does what he's supposed to for a lap dance. She declines, but he convinces her to changes her mind. The night takes a turn though as he uses his vehicle for a nefarious plan with Pam and the other women.The film then shifts to Tennessee where we follow another group of women who work in the film industry. Here we have Zoë Bell (as herself), Abernathy Ross (Rosario Dawson), Lee Montgomery (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Kim Mathias (Tracie Thoms). They don't realize that Stuntman Mike has turned his attention on them as well.Much like I did with my review of Planet Terror, I wanted to go a little bit vague with the recap here, as this film doesn't have the most complex story either. I could contend that this film has even less going on from the other film, as there are fewer characters here. I will say that this one definitely feels like a Tarantino film as it is really character and dialogue driven and that aspect is really good.I did find it interesting that in keeping with the grindhouse feel, he decided to make a slasher film that is not traditional. I don't necessarily agree that is how it plays out, but I do like Tarantino is all about empowering women. The first group of women doesn't really embody this aside from Arlene. Stuntman Mike does know how to push her buttons. I most definitely think that Tarantino writes very strong characters in Zoë and Kim. I did enjoy this aspect, as we are really seeing an issue in real life with toxic masculinity being called out and women fighting for their equality even more.Even though he feels that it's a slasher, I don't think that it really is that though. We do get Stuntman Mike stalking his victims. It's not even the weapon he uses, his car, but what he does to the first group doesn't really fit that. You don't normally get that many dying at once in the sub-genre is really the issue that I contend against him. Something else I have issue with is this film doesn't feel as much like a grindhouse film either. We do get the title was changed early on, which was common in the era and we are missing a reel. This film just feels more polished and I would have liked more of the issues with the film like Planet Terror had.As much as it pains me to say, I do feel that this film is somewhat boring. It works in Tarantino's other films where he can have long conversations. I think he wrote the dialogue just fine and the depth of the characters is great. I just feel that for a horror movie, we needed it do more to keep the interest. I've heard many people contend that this isn't actually a horror movie and I can concede that it really doesn't always feel like it. This is really more of an exploitation film. I do have to say that I like how the film ends for sure. It was just a bit of a struggle for me to get there if I'm going to be honest.Something that I can't say anything bad about is the acting. Russell is great as the villain here. He doesn't really lie about anything, but there is just an aura about him. I do like the change in character with him at the end of the film. It is quite drastic and different from things you get. Bell is solid, even though she is playing herself as a female stuntwoman. I do like the lines that are written for her and how the character is developed. Dawson is solid in her performance. She isn't the strongest, but I like her at the end. Ferlito is solid and I see her as a mirror of Thoms who is also good. I thought the cameos by Poitier, McGowan, Ladd, Winstead, Eli Roth and Tarantino himself. The performances are all solid across the board.Another thing I can't talk down on is the effects. Greg Nicotero worked on this one along with another member from KNB. This one has less in the way of effects and even though there was some CGI, the practical effects look amazing. There is really only one scene of CGI and I had no issues there what they did. The sequence with Bell outside of her car is absolutely amazing. I would have like more effects on the film for that grindhouse feel, but it is shot great and looks amazing.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film. This is something that I do have to give it credit for. The songs used are necessarily ones that I would go back to, but they really do fit the scenes for what are needed. The scenes in the car at the climax really do get your heart racing and it definitely helps there for sure.Now with that said, this film I still don't really love, but I feel like my appreciation for it has come up on it. I think that it has an interesting concept and the villain is reminiscent of The Hitcher. I just think that this plays too much like a Tarantino film and it does bog itself down. The tension does pick up though during the climax for what is happening and the score there really helps as well. The acting does carry the film for sure and I think that even though there are limited effects, they do look good in my opinion. Overall I'd say that this film is slightly above average for me, but still worth a watch I would say.",Death Proof
77,Samiam3,"Less talk, more drive",6,5 August 2009,"In a way, Death Proof feels like two movies, one for the first hour and another for the second. This is one of Tarantino's trademarks, he likes to tell as many stories as possible in one movie. The first half of Death Proof is fairly engaging. Four happy girls in Texas are taking a driving trip, to lake LBJ (don't know if that's a real place or not). They spend the evening at a club, where Tarantino in razzie acting mode casts himself as the barkeep, and we meet Stuntman Mike. (no points for guessing what his career is). Mike has a fairly unusual hobby, he kills girls with his car. Tarantino takes time to set things up. A lot of the dialogue is mundane, and a direct throwback to Pulp Fiction. All that is missing is talk about big macs in France. Kurt Russell is pretty slick, and does some quirky things too, like a John Wayne impersonation. He is the perfect actor to bring color to an all-American killer. Just when things are starting to look good however, Tarantino chooses to relocate to another location with another handful of girls with five times less IQ. This is why I say that Death Proof is two movies, but if you consider it one continuous story, then you'll find that the last act is not only anti climactic, but it is dull and unsatisfying. There is too much dialogue and not enough direction. Tarantino has a nifty trick up his sleeve, which is turning the 'damel in distress' thing on end, making for a fairly clever but not very exciting last scene to conclude this eccentric movie.He and Robert Rodriguez had the idea to shoot this and Planet Terror like a 1950's drive in kind of picture. The color quality is grainy, the editing is deliberately choppy here and there, and the sound sub-par. There is also some intentional continuity, to make it look as if the whole thing was cut together in an hour, without careful inspection of Mise en Scene.I didn't expect great film making when I watched Death Proof, but as it unfolded slowly, it proved to be better than I expected, and then that spark went out, before it could amount to anything great, leaving me somewhat disappointed.",Death Proof
78,lastliberal-853-253708,"Hold on, I gotta come up! I gotta take the world's biggest f*ckin' p*ss!""",7,10 November 2013,"This film was an homage to the grind house flicks of the past. It's crowning achievement was the inclusion of some of the baddest gals on film, and one of the hottest.Vanessa Ferlito as Arlene, who I would watch sitting in a chair for an hour anytime. It was well worth it to see that lap dance. Ferlito was clearly the star of this film.Then there were the badass girls: Tracie Thoms as Kim and Rosario Dawson as Abernathy. I could watch them ride around in a car for an hour anytime.It was the last third of the film where the action was ramped with some fantastic stunt work by badass Zoe Bell and, of course, the coup de grâce, Abernathy's boot in Stuntman Mike's (Kurt Russell) face. Heavenly.",Death Proof
79,davidmvining,Tarantino's weakest work,7,25 November 2019,"Instead of making a grindhouse movie, Tarantino made a Tarantino slasher movie. It mostly works.The structure of the film is defined by its two halves. The first half, follows a group of four young women as they have an evening out in Austin, Texas. Because they are in a Tarantino movie, they talk about this and that, building up strong and defined characters for the audience to latch onto. There's Jungle Julia, the DJ with dreams of owning her own record label, and Butterfly, her friend from out of town. There are a couple of others, but they mostly just don't matter.As the evening goes on, they're getting close to getting picked up when a new figure enters the scene. He's an older man in a leather jacket covered in ads named Stuntman Mike. He interacts with them, but there's always this underlying threat about how he talks to them. He's a dangerous man, and it becomes obvious when he approaches Butterfly and recites a promised poem to her that the danger has an appeal to these women. It's a scene rife with sexual tension, but the secret is that Stuntman Mike isn't getting off on it. It's some sort of build up for him to get him to the place where he finds real gratification.Taking a lone girl in his car that he describes as ""death proof"", he ends up slamming her around the cab since it's only his seat that's proofed. The passenger seat is a recipe for danger. She dies, and then he goes on a search for the four other girls, slamming into them head first on a country road and killing all four.The second half begins in much the same way as before. There are four women who talk about their lives and their problems with men. We see Stuntman Mike in the background, so there's the hint of defined danger that we don't feel in the first half. The girls are taking a day off from shooting a movie in the middle of Tennessee and are looking to test drive in a muscle car for sale nearby. Leaving one of the three girls behind as a sort of collateral, the other three take the car and begin to play dangerous games on top as a source of fun. That fun gets cut short when Stuntman Mike shows up and starts ramming it with one of them (the stuntwoman Zoe Bell) hanging onto the hood with nothing but belts secured to the doors. They give a good chase, scared for their lives the whole time, until Stuntman Mike has his fill. Both cars come to a stop and Mike pops out with a big smile calling it a good time. Just as he's about to drive away, one of the girls shoots him in the arm before Mike cries in pain and, in a panic, peels off.So, this is something that I have a problem with in the movie. From the perspective of these three girls, Stuntman Mike is a guy who tried to drive them off the road and nothing else. He was dangerous, and possibly tried to kill them, but that's far from what they know for certain. When they shoot him (which I don't have a problem with), he's actually saying goodbye. He's going to leave them alone after that point. It is at that point where the girls completely turn the tables and start to drive Mike off the road. It's no longer self-protection, it's pure revenge, but revenge for what? The self-righteousness of their actions and emotions can be shared by the audience since we know what happened to the first group of girls, but the second group doesn't know that. There's a disconnect between the characters, their actions, their motives, and the intended result on the audience that puts me off a bit. It's not that Stuntman Mike didn't deserve to get punched 37 times in 30 seconds before a roundhouse kick, it's that the girls doing it arguably over-reacted considering the specific information and situation they were in.One simple change would have kept me from feeling that, though. Instead of Stuntman Mike saying goodbye when he's at his emotional high, he says, ""Ready to go again?"" Then I'm totally okay with the girls turning the tables so enthusiastically.Anyway, past the reasons for the final leg of the great car chase, I love how Stuntman Mike gets so completely emasculated by the girls fighting back. It fits so perfectly with the choice of putting him in a death proof car. He wants to hurt other people without putting himself in danger, and the second that bubble of protection gets punctured, he doesn't know what to do. He cries, he tries to manfully treat his bullet wound with bourbon but he writhes about like a child in response to the pain. It's quite effective.Overall, I like the dual structure of the film. It creates a sense of both foreboding and unpredictability around the resolution of the second half of the film. If Tarantino was willing to let the first group of girls die so horribly what is he willing to do with the second group? Their ultimate victory is done in a fantastic car chase and has some, limited, emotional impact. It's probably his least movie, but it's an entertaining ride, if a bit shaky.",Death Proof
80,RainDogJr,Our Feature Presentation: Quentin Tarantino's ThunDeath Proof,10,14 June 2008,"Back in April 2007 I could not wait to see Grindhouse, definitely the film in what I have the biggest expectations last year, and since it's release doesn't seemed very closer, first in it's original presentation and later as two films, I decided to watch it on a bootleg (Just to let you know, Death Proof was released on theaters about two weeks ago and now is out meanwhile Planet Terror was released just yesterday 13 June 2008). I loved it but it was kind of funny not to know what damage was the one made on purpose and what damage was because of the disc. Yet I still think that to watch Grindhouse on a bootleg was a really odd and funny ""experience"", with the shadow of the audience on the screen (yes it was recorded from a theater) or hearing their reactions. I write that also to let you know that I haven't seen the original cut of the Tarantino's segment since April 2007 but now after watching the extended and unrated version I do recognize the ""new"" things but I didn't have any different sensation with this new cut because is still the film that entertains and that I liked a lot.Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof is divided in two parts that are very similar and kind of repetitive but at the same time are very different from each other in matter of style and in matter of damage footage. They are like two different films and it seems that we see first the original and latter its sequel. In the ""original"" the victims of our protagonist (Kurt Russell) will be Arlene (Ferlito), Shanna (Ladd) and Jungle Julia (Poitier), three friends whose plans are to go to a bar, hang out with boys to finally end the night at the lake house of Shanna's dad. There some good dialogs but the fun of this part really begins at the bar of Warren (QT) where we finally meet Stuntman Mike, the classic actor/stuntman that nobody can tell you exactly where he has work so for the people of the bar he is just a dated guy. A really entertaining part, really good tracks and dialogs but the lap dance ""down in Mexico"" (great track by The Coasters) is like the climax of this part to end with the only sequence in this part where we can see Stuntman Mike in real action with his ""death proof""; a terrific last scene, with Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich, leaving 5 dead women in total. The ""sequel"" happens 14 months later and now with Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms and Zoë Bell as Lee, Abernathy, Kim and herself, respectively. Before for what is for me the best part of the entire film we have pure conversations in the entertaining way that Tarantino writes with the usual references to movies. But when finally the 1970 Dodge Challenge is on screen and Zoë begins with her mad game is when the most exiting and amazing part of Death Proof really begin. I loved that scene and damn Zoë Bell is amazing just like Buddy Joe Hooker and Tracy Keehn-Dashnaw; both cars are amazing too and some of the shots are basically impressive and memorable. The conclusion is kind of satisfactory because of these crazy girls, the very last scene is hilarious and I really like the track Chick Habit.Cast: Kurt Russell steals the film with a terrific performance for a memorable character. All the girls made a really good work but Zoë Bell stands out making her own stunts for her first stellar appearance. During the first part there are brief performances by Tarantino and Eli Roth; we haven't seen QT in one of his films since Pulp Fiction and here as Warren is not that memorable as in Pulp and R. Dogs or as in Sukiyaki Western Django (Takashi Miike, 2007). Conclusion: I hope soon we can get the DVD of Grindhouse, of course to can watch again the complete Grindhouse ""experience"" with the original cuts, the fake trailers and all the stuff that looks so damn cool and that makes you think ""damn Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2 should have been looking like that"". Meanwhile the extended Death Proof is just an entertaining and amazing picture but more in the traditional QT style than in the Grindhouse feel.DVD special features: Death Proof trailer, poster gallery, sneak peeks of Planet Terror, 1408, Black Sheep and Feast, ""Stunts on Wheels: The Legendary Drivers of Death Proof"", ""Introducing Zoë Beel"", ""Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike"", ""Finding Quentin's Gals"", ""The Guys of Death Proof"", ""Editor Sally Menke"" and Double Dare trailer. A terrific second disc; with kind of tributes to the stunt drivers, Zoë Bell but especially to Sally Menke, great footage of the work behind the camera and a funny part with Eli Roth and ""Snake Plissken"".",Death Proof
81,raulfaust,What a feeling,7,25 February 2014,"Well, I've just finished watching this and all I can say is what a fun movie it is. In the first half, some tough girls are heading to one of them's vacation home, and before going there, they stop by in a bar. Being there, there are lots of conversations that show, at times, that they are arrogant and self-seeking girls. There isn't anything remarkable for me to mention, other than the strip dancing scene, which turned out to be very sexy and ""cool"". The film's photography began with a 90's vibe, later changing to black and white and, in the second half, becoming a modern scenario in almost all aspects. That just shows how Quentin Tarantino is creative as a photography director-- and that is great. The cast is good for most of the time, with some exceptions in the bar scene, since I could easily notice some occasional overacting. ""Death Proof"" wasn't made to have a message, a point or anything for you to analyze after seeing it; it basically tells a fun (and violent) road trip story that entertains and makes you remember that there a lot of crazy people out there. Stuntman Mike is an example of that, and I really wondered if it's possible to build a death proof car. I also wondered why the girls just didn't slow down when Mike was chasing them, but I realized there is no answer for that question, so I won't point that as a plot hole, considering the movie's overall objective-- violence and fun. Tarantino surely has made worse, but also made better.",Death Proof
82,eric262003,Just a Fun Horror Flick,9,24 January 2012,"""Death Proof"" is a very compelling flick overall. Whether Quintin Tarantino put a lot or little thought into this movie is beyond my knowledge, but one thing for sure,this movie came out a winner in my honest opinion. This is the story of a stuntman and his continuous sexual fixation for cars and the story is divided into two opposing but well connected story The first half centers around four young drunk and horny ladies sitting in tavern, where they are greeted by the devious Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) By the second half, we see our strange leading man Mike in hot pursuit with four other hot ladies (Rosario Dawson, Mary-Elizabeth Winstead, Zoe Bell and Tracy Thoms) In both collaborates, Mike utilizes his impressive death-proof car to terrorize the ladies and to get his jollies on full mast.Some of the bigger flaws about ""Death Proof"" is that the camera shots have the feel of a B movie, while the soundtrack is badly out of whack. The scenes itself at times looks padded on all the while it backed up by the infamous shaky camera. The idea is quite innovative and very original, but the delivery is at times pedestrian you would think that a college film student was shooting this movie. By the time you get to the second, the amazing Technicolor camera shots and the acting and cinematography takes a turn for the better. Tarantino uses his expertise circulating is camera shots on the four girls for the whole seven minutes without any hesitation. But we must ask ourselves should we look at this as a grind house movie or shouldn't we? Any form of inconsistency is not an option.Though he continually panders over B-movie directors like Roger Corman, ""Death Proof"" stands on it merits as a traditional Quintin Tarantino, much to the tradition of such classics like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"". The characters seen to encounter what appears to be an endless discussion of issues relating to pop culture, characters come in all of the sudden, themes start to manifest within itself and the continual foot shot is a Tarantino trademark especially during the opening scenes. Kurt Russell is brilliant in all his evil ways. I mean just totally dominates over his female co-stars who appear at times to be out-shined by Russell's performance.If you could be passive about the flaws and just accept the movie for what it is, then ""Death Proof"" is really a nice little film to watch. Granted at times it feels like an eternity when Stuntman Mike makes his grand entrance, but once he steals the show, that's when the party begins. The crash in the early stages in the movie is one of Tarantino's more brilliant set-pieces (it's a treat they repeat the scenes four times). and the methodical stunt work from Zoe Bell is quite gripping and engaging to watch, you'll likely never want to leave your seat after this. For the persnickety types who want something that's life-changing or inspiring, then look the other direction. This movie is customized to be entertained But it stands in the rightful place of annals of classic horror films. If you ignore this movie as a Grindhouse movie, ""Death Proof"" could qualify as a vanity project for Tarantino towards his fellow worshipers who have followed him throughout the years. Let's hope Planet Terror is just as poignant as ""Death Proof"".",Death Proof
83,gangstahippie,Pretty boring but the ending is great,6,8 March 2008,"Rated R for Language,Sexual Dialogue,Drug Use and Some Strong Violence Now I did not like Death Proof all that much.I usually love Tarintino films such as Pulp Fiction,Kill Bill,Reservoir Dogs.I have seen them all except for Jackie Brown.Death Proof wasn't all that bad, it was just fairly boring.Most of the film just shows women talking about random things while a mysterious man named Stuntman Mike and his ""Death Proof"" car try to kill them.Most of the film is fairly dialogue ridden, which I don't usually mind.I mean I enjoy dialogue-ridden films such as Zodiac,The Godfather,Gone With The Wind etc.But Death Proof was for the most part boring.There were some funny parts but the real highlight of the film is the ending.The ending is basically some four girls plotting revenge on stuntman mike and the scene where they get revenge on him is very interesting and entertaining.Overall Death Proof was mediocre but the ending was excellent.",Death Proof
84,brando647,Tarantino's GRINDHOUSE!!!,8,10 July 2008,"While Quentin Tarantino's half of 2007's Grindhouse double-feature is a great film, I would consider it the weaker film of the two. Tarantino attempts to invoke the feel of the slasher and car chase exploitation films of the 70s. The film revolves around Stuntman Mike, a demented individual who gets his kicks from stalking women and killing them with his ""death-proof"" stunt cars. The film boasts an awesome cast, the usual hip Tarantino dialogue, and one of the best car chases I've ever seen but it suffers a bit from slow pacing and an inconstant feeling between the two halves of the movie.Two of my favorite aspects of any Tarantino film are the casting and the dialogue, and he continues to please with his latest film. To start, Kurt Russell was AWESOME as Stuntman Mike. He starts with the creepy vibe of a deliberate, calculated stalker with deranged tendencies and we eventually see him evolve into, well, something else COMPLETELY; I won't go into too much detail because I'd hate to ruin it for those who haven't seen it. I don't think any other actor would have fit as well into this role as Russell does.The stuntman's prey were just as vital to the film and we get some great performances from the women. All-in-all, there are eight women that cross Mike's path through the course of this film. Syndey Poitier was fun to hate (well, I hated her...) as the arrogant Jungle Julia; despite having seen her ""tender"" side in a minor subplot (that goes by so fast you'll miss it if you blink), I was hoping she'd get what was coming to her. Vanessa Ferlito was probably the best of the first four girls, as she was the most relatable, and I think most of the audience will find themselves hoping she pulls through until the end. Jordan Ladd's character of Shanna...well, she's there; there isn't too much development for her so she always seemed to sink into the background of scenes she was in. Finally, the first group of girls to encounter Mike includes Rose McGowan who injects her usual brand of sexiness and sarcastic humor into the first act. The second group of girls is way more fun to watch. We get great performances from Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson while it appears Mary Elizabeth Winstead's only reason for being there is to look good in a cheerleader uniform. The most impressive performance from the ""victims"" came from newcomer Zoe Bell; Bell has worked as a stuntwoman in movies for a couple years and met Tarantino while acting as Uma Thurman's stunt double in his Kill Bill saga. This movie is Bell's first attempt at acting and she has enough charisma to make the audience love her and, later, keeps them on the edge of their seat when she's strapped to the hood of a speeding 1970 Dodge Challenger.Which brings me to the best reason to see this movie: the final car chase. It completely blew me away when I first saw it in theaters. We are treated to an intense car chase with some gorgeous classics...a 1969 Dodge Charger and a 1970 Dodge Challenger. The scene had to be nearly 20 minutes long and it includes some of the most intense car-based stunts I've seen on film. Once again, I've got to say that Bell was incredible and she has got some serious nerve to do what she does in this movie. Any problems I had with this film while watching were completely erased by the time the final chase had come to an end.I didn't really have many complaints about Tarantino's Grindhouse feature but there were a couple things that grated on me. I felt that there was a bit too much character development in between the two great action scenes. After about 10 minutes, I had a good feel for the characters. I knew who I liked or disliked and why, and I was eager to get to the real action but there were points where it felt like it took forever. I love Tarantino's dialogue, but I felt there was a little more talking than necessary this time around. My only other problem with the film was that the two acts felt like two different movies. The first act held true to the gritty, Grindhouse-feel while the second half seemed more cleaned-up and modern. For instance, in the second half of the film, it seemed as if Tarantino and editor Sally Menke gave up on the scratched, worn film reel look as I don't remember seeing much of it after we introduced to the new girls. As a result, it gave the movie an inconstant feel.Fortunately, the pros outweigh the cons by quite a bit and, though it may stall a bit at times, Tarantino's movie still manages to rock from start to finish. It may not have been as entertaining as Robert Rodriguez's portion but it was still a great film and one that I'd recommend (ESPECIALLY if you can watch the complete Grindhouse double-feature with trailers...that had to be my absolute favorite movie of 2007).",Death Proof
85,Sergeant_Tibbs,Meh,5,9 November 2008,"Pretty lame. I disliked everything and constantly wished for the focus to drift away from the girls. Kurt Russell was brilliant and I just had to savour every goddamn delicious second when he's on screen. Loved him. Also loved the references to Death Race 2000 which looks unbelievably awesome. I thought it was very unbalanced and rather unnecessarily set into two halves with loosely wound characters - further enhancing my belief that Tarantino doesn't care if what's on screen makes sense just if it looks good. Calling it a ""joke"" or a ""homage"" is no excuse. It does feature his infamous dialogue which kept me hooked in whether I cared or not - or is they were coming out of undeveloped character (who were all slut whores). Otherwise Death Proof sets out to look like trash and just becomes trash. Well done.5/10",Death Proof
86,intelearts,Weakest Tarantino to date,3,16 November 2007,"what I loved about Reservoir Dogs was the beautiful plot lines, the singularity of the dialogue to character, the exposition, and the camera.Death Proof for my money fails on all these aspects. I liked the splicing, and scratching effects enough, but I felt the dialogue and general mise en scene were weak; and the crashes were just OTT.Not dumb enough to praise it's own premise, or clever enough to rise above it - it just left a bad taste - I felt I was the one being exploited here - and I just didn't buy any of the premises. The only good thing to be said was that I did find it very disturbing - and that is not a good thing - I went to be entertained and came out feeling immensely depressed that Tarantino is failing to invent his own film genres and is now reduced to satirizing and homaging - please can we see something more than the rehashing of ideas and soundtracks that sound as though they are the product of Saturday's spent finding the obscurest tracks possible - and get to the heart of film again?Lacks vision.",Death Proof

88,sme_no_densetsu,"Accomplishes what it set out to do, meaning that it's trash",6,5 June 2008,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" is a loving homage to the exploitative 'B' movies of a bygone era. He is able to channel some of the charm of those pictures but you are unlikely to enjoy the film unless you share his affinity for those pictures which, to put it bluntly, are not very good to begin with.The film has trademark Tarantino touches in the direction and writing, so fans will likely not be disappointed on that front. The 'aging' of the film to heighten the sense of authenticity is well done also, though it seems that the latter half went mostly untouched, unfortunately lessening the effect.The acting isn't too bad for a film of this sort, especially Kurt Russell as the murderous stuntman. Tarantino's dialogue shines in the first half of the film but for some reason I thought that the second half didn't live up to the first. That is probably at least partially due to the new set of actresses.Overall, the underlying excuse for a story is utterly forgettable garbage. The second half of the story in particular I found to be incredibly tiresome. It does feel authentic for the most part but I would rather have had quality than authenticity.If you like the kind of cult films that Tarantino emulates here then you will probably enjoy this movie. If you don't, do yourself a favour and skip this movie, even if you're a Tarantino fan.",Death Proof
89,michaeltrivedi,Bad Ass At It's Best,8,6 July 2017,"Death Proof is a great movie. Kurt Russell's character is so bad ass, that it basically makes the movie. Forget about Planet Terror. Death Proof is where it's at.The movie is about a group of girls that are stunt women. They meet Kurt Russell's character at a bar, and he ends up trying to kill them. It backfires, and he soon becomes the prey. And these stunt women definitely have some tricks up their sleeves.The movie runs slow, and the suspense builds. There are lots of scenes where the characters are merely talking, and we just get a sense of regular life and how people deal with each other. It's very slow, and that makes the action and violence much better suited. And there's definitely a lot of that.8 Stars, not bad at all",Death Proof
90,Screen_Blitz,Tarantino's Grindhouse actioner is the least entertaining of his works,4,19 December 2015,"Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino collaborate to direct a exploitation double feature 'Grindhouse'. Tarantino's half 'Death Proof' is an action flick following the story of three Texas girls (played by Vanessa Ferlito, Sydney Poitier, and Jordan Ladd) who go out to a local bar, hoping to have the night of their lives. They meet a Hollywood stunt driver named Mike (played by Kurt Russell), who seems like a sweet guy, though a bit of a party animal. After a night of drinking and provocative dancing, Mike reveals to be a psychopath when he kidnaps a friend one of the girls in this stunt car which is says is ""death proof"" (but only for the driver), and takes her for a ride that leads to deadly consequences. A year passes and Mike recovers from the hospital, only to stalk a group of tough girls including, actress Lee Montgomery (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead), make-up artist Abernathy (played by Rosario Dawson), stuntwoman Kim Mathis (played by Tracie Thoms), and real- life Zoe Bell who served as a stuntwoman for Uma Thurman in Tarantino's 'Kill Bill Volume 1 & 2'. This movie is shot with vintage style cinematography to give the film a look of an old 1970s movie, and pays homages to classic exploitation actions film from the 70s. Quentin Tarantino also makes an appearance as a bartender during the early scenes.As a Tarantino, I really wanted to enjoy this film. This critically acclaimed director has brought spectacular filmmaking to the big screen since his first film 'Reservoir Dogs' and his career-defining film 'Pulp Fiction', which is held one of the greatest films of cinema history. Unfortunately, this film turns out to be far less entertaining than his other films. While this film starts off strong with the vintage 70s music and characters sporting a 1970 Dodge Challenger, the rest of the film is left depraved of Tarantino's usual fare. None of the characters are very memorable, nor are they well written. Kurt Russell's character may be appealing some viewers, but the rest of the characters are feel rather wooden, and the same can be said about the dialogue. Tarantino is known for some of the most clever dialogue , especially in 'Pulp Fiction'. But here, the dialogue is pretty weak, and at times, very awkward. The only redeeming value about these film maybe the tense and violent car chases that often end in gruesome results. The whole car chasing scene at the end is somewhat entertaining and climatic. Everything else was a bit disappointing.Death Proof is by far Quentin Tarantino's weakest film. Despite my disappointment in this film, I still consider Tarantino one of my all-time favorite directors, and it comes to show even the greatest film directors have or will have a hiccup or two in their filmography.",Death Proof
91,KUAlum26,"The Second half of ""Grindhouse"" Possible Spoilers!!!",7,19 April 2008,"Having re-reviewed the first half of the ambitious,two-part collaboration film of directors Robert Rodriguez and Qunetin Tarrantino,""Planet Terror"",I figured it was only appropriate to cover the other half.In stark contrast to the vivid,pulsating and florid ""Planet"",""Death Proof"" moves casually--VERY casually--as it slowly brings us in to the what appears to be the lives of Austin,Texas locals,but in fact is a peek into the persona of one Stuntman Mike(Kurt Russell,quite good here),a seemingly charming one-time A-list stuntman whose rakish appeal hides a very dark and sinister purpose. His own designs on inflicting death upon upon unsuspecting victims--and they all appear to be attractive young and carefree females--will come to be his undoing,in a most appropriate way.Featuring real-life stunt-woman extraordinaire Zoe Bell as herself and mixing in the performances of such young up-and-comers as Rosario Dawson,Tracie Thoms,MAry Elizabeth Winstead,TAmila Sydney Porter and Rose McGowan(borrowed from ""PLanet""),this film may SEEM more relaxed and less frenetic than previous QT movies,but it picks up eventually,and if watched carefully does possess plenty of the director's signatures(i.e. pop-cultural references,foot fetishes,retro cars,non-name brand products).I have not seen this yet by itself,so I have no idea if the DVD version of ""Death Proof"" or ""Planet Terror"" have added on the brilliantly campy and sharp fake movie trailers and intentional film distresses that were piled into the original release,but they should be. They add flavor to the films,flavor that was probably the intended purpose of both films,which were nods to trashy '70s cinema. My rating gives away my bias of the two. The casual pace is almost distracting in this one,and the climax,once it comes,seems to be almost overkill. But the general construct of this movie is still compelling and smart,so I'm not about to tear this offering down. Maybe not Tarrantino's best work,but one of his more interesting.",Death Proof
92,xredgarnetx,Half-baked thriller,5,5 April 2008,"Tarantino's DEATH PROOF stars a badly scarred Kurt Russell (""I cut myself shaving"") as a killer of young women, especially voluptuous, scantily clad young women. He kills them with his car. Most of the very attractive gals in this homage to drive-in flicks are not known to us, but they sure are purty. And they have great feet, a passion of the director's. The ones we did recognize: Rose McGowan hidden under a blonde wig longer than she, plus Rosario Dawson and Jordan Ladd. A fetching young thang named Vanessa Ferlito does a credible lap dance on Mr. Russell shortly before he pursues her and her friends as they head out of town to spend the weekend at a relative's cabin. The gore, what there is of it, is over the top, in drive-in fashion. But there really isn't much to be said for this trifle. It's a throwaway, like most of the drive-in fare on which it is based. Nice to see Russell as a villain, though, and Michael Parks reprises his sheriff role from KILL BILL. But in the end, who cares? One odd note: the second pursuit, which involves Ms. Dawson, suddenly drops all pretense of being a scratchy drive-in film. It is shot in standard film mode, with the exception of a small section that is in B&W. Odd indeed.",Death Proof
93,Sirus_the_Virus,Works in many ways.,10,15 September 2009,"The Grindhouse double feature had two films, of course. I only was interested in one because the other looked retarded. I wanted to see Death Proof with Kurt Russel. Let me just say, if you haven't seen it, then you really should. Quentin Tarentino's sixth film is fantastic, like all of his others. Death Proof sounds far more interesting than Planet terror. Kurt Russel stars as Stuntman Mike, a guy who owns a car from a movie. Apparently he was a stuntman in films and TV shows. But nobody knows what. Stuntman Mike meets women, follows them around and kills them. He either rams into them or, in one scene, he kills a chick by smashing her face into the glass constantly. That chick was Rose Magowan. As Mike says in the film""The car is 100 percent Death proof. But to get the full benefit, you really have to be sitting in my seat"". Kurt Russel is an evil bastard in this film. Might I say that he is brilliantly evil. Oh yeah, i'm not finished with the plot. There is one group of women that are on a road trip. Stunman Mike tries to kill them off also. But these women get really annoyed. Death Proof, like some of Tarentino's films, is so crazy that I laugh. I laughed at quite a few scenes in this film. I call that dark humor. I give Death Proof a high rating because it's awesome and though he may not be trying hard with this film(maybe he is), Tarentino's Death Proof kicks ass.

94,bobsgrock,Tarantino delivers... again.,9,10 May 2008,"To be honest, when this film first starts out, you can't really predict at all what it will be like. Of course it is made to look old, cheesy and corny. Still, as a piece of film-making, Tarantino has real class and this movie has plenty of good sequences in it. The plot is a strange one, but just sit back and enjoy the immensely satisfying dialogue and hilarious character interactions. Kurt Russell is perfectly cast as a sociopathic hit-man who attempts to kill people with is car that he says is ""death-proof."" What makes this film different from any other like it, such as Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror, is that Tarantino would rather pay homage to grindhouse features and make his own version. Like Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, it is full of colorful characters, wonderful interactions, and some of the best dialogue humans can write down, filled with endless pop culture references. Also wonderful is Tarantino's directing, especially the breakfast scene in the second half, which is an almost duplicate of the scene in Reservoir Dogs. Simply put, Tarantino delivers one of the most entertaining, adrenaline-pumped films ever made. He really is a cinematic genius.",Death Proof
95,hnt_dnl,"Women talking, eating, drinking, swearing...THAT'S IT!",2,8 September 2009,"Early in the first half of DEATH PROOF (2007), we get to see 4 females talk in a car, then talk, drink, and smoke in a bar. Later, we get to see them TALK, DRINK, and SMOKE in ANOTHER BAR! In the second half, we get to see 4 NEW girls TALK in a CAR, then see them TALK and eat in a diner, then TALK in ANOTHER CAR! Oh, and both sets of characters swear ad infinitum. This is the whole movie! So in DEATH PROOF, we get to watch a bunch of shiftless, annoying females perform some of the most basic human acts for TWO FREAKIN HOURS! Quentin Tarantino has lost it as far as I'm concerned.DEATH PROOF was originally one half of a two-feature GRINDHOUSE film release in 2007. The other half, PLANET TERROR, was Tarantino collaborator Robert Rodriguez' offering. Having bombed in it's initial U.S. release (no kidding!), each film has been released separately on DVD to recoup the losses. I've actually already reviewed the GRINDHOUSE pair on this site. Quite simply, neither film is any good.DEATH PROOF is about...I don't really know! Usually, a film has to move something within in me for me to like it, even in films like this that pay homage to other films. Tarantino succeeded on that front with his masterpieces PULP FICTION and KILL BILL VOL1, films that offer the audience interesting characters and interactions, great dialogue, and superb finales/resolutions. But DEATH PROOF is the opposite of all this. It has a LOT of dialogue, but NONE of it amounts to anything. Also, the female characters here are monumentally annoying. Even though this is some sort of homage to 70s exploitation flicks, I think that DEATH PROOF debases and degrades women even worse than the films it pays tribute to, and I think that was diametrically opposite of Tarantino's intent!DEATH PROOF is basically two stories with a common character that ties them together: Stuntman Mike, a serial killer who uses his ""death proof"" movie stunt car to kill young girls. Kurt Russell (the reason I give this 2 stars instead of just 1) plays Mike and I actually liked his character in the first half, but he came in way too late for my taste. Russell brilliantly performs a great self-parody in his early scenes. Then Tarantino went off the rails and screwed him up later on. So, Mike essentially goes away and we are introduced to another group of boring characters we have to endure just like the first group until Mike shows up, but this time, the payoff is not nearly as good. The first set of females Jungle Julia, Shanna, Arlene (played by Sydney Tamii Poitier, Jordan Ladd, and Vanessa Ferlito) are a trio of twenty-something ne'er do wells who basically hang around in bars all day long! They talk smack to each other, about each other, about other people, yadda yadda yadda. If I have to watch these chicks ramble and satiate themselves ad nauseum, then at least make their convos interesting. I can't recall what the hell they were discussing! After a 4th female joins them Mike shows up, thankfully, and injects the film with real character depth and sets an ominous tone, then goes away for a while. But not before we get a completely unnecessary explanation of Mike's motives from none other than Earl McGraw (Michael Parks) to his #1 son, both from KILL BILL VOL1...a truly tepid, sad gimmick.Second set of females Zoe, Abernathy, Kim, Lee (played by Zoe Bell, Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead) are all in the movie industry and are a lot more lively and peppy than the first set, but are actually even MORE annoying! I didn't think this was possible. My big problem with ALL these characters is that it is all just line-quoting. Even in an homage, it is still a FILM. You have to believe in the characters and their motivations, even in the presence of the silliness. Also, I really didn't find any of these females to be attractive, ESPECIALLY this second set! The first set were at least attractive in appearance (up to a point), but this second set were not good- looking at all (esp. Zoe and Kim, whose interactions were excruciatingly annoying to listen to). DEATH PROOF is the definition of a self-indulgent film. One extra star for Kurt Russell's all-too-brief early contribution. Scary this thing is even rated as high as it is on this site. Guess Tarantino's got a lot of pull!",Death Proof
96,hall895,Not really sure what to make of this,7,23 April 2008,"How to judge this movie? Obviously Quentin Tarantino was trying to do something rather different here. And yes, this movie certainly is different. But should we give the movie credit for being different even if the whole thing seems a little disappointing? If you set out to make an homage to B-movies does that mean you should be spared criticism when your movie at times has the feel of a really bad B-movie? I really wanted to like this movie. But after watching it I'm still not sure if I did. I didn't hate it but I certainly didn't love it either. It's a movie that has a lot going for it but it is also a movie with plenty of obvious flaws as well. I can certainly call this movie interesting, I'm just not sure I can call it good.For everything that's different about Death Proof in the end it is still a Quentin Tarantino movie with everything that entails. And maybe that's why this is somewhat disappointing. It's a movie with so many of the Tarantino trademarks we've come to know. But rather than presenting a fresh, exciting film it too often seems like Tarantino is just doing an imitation of himself. And not a particularly good imitation either. The sharp, witty Tarantino dialogue we've come to know and love is sorely missing here. Yes, he still has his characters sit around and talk. But in this movie they're talking about nothing. So much of this movie is absolutely pointless dialogue. Not sharp, not witty, not interesting. The whole first half of the movie consists of boring characters sitting around talking about boring things. The movie just keeps plodding along and nothing ever happens. Then after a brief jolt of action we spend the second half of the movie with some new, slightly less boring characters talking about boring things. And then there's another action sequence and the movie's over. And you may well be left shaking your head wondering what exactly was this all about?So now I've made it sound as if this is a really bad movie but I don't think it is. It's not as good as I may have hoped but in the end I think I liked it just enough to give it a very begrudging recommendation. You know Tarantino can do better. But he did create something rather unique here and he deserves some credit for that. And for all that's bad about the movie there are plenty of good things to balance things out. The soundtrack, as you'd expect from Tarantino, is brilliant with a number of obscure songs which fit the movie perfectly. There's a car chase scene which is simply terrific. There are a couple of standout performances in the cast, most notably Kurt Russell as the menacing Stuntman Mike whose actions are at the center of what little actual story this movie has. Whenever Russell is on the screen this movie has some life. Too bad we spend so much time with a collection of blabbering, boring women and never really get to know who the heck Stuntman Mike is and what drives him to do the things he does. As for those women the most memorable performance comes from Zoe Bell, who's not even really an actress but rather a stuntwoman who here is playing herself. Bell's got spunk and energy and personality which is more than can be said for some of the other women we see. Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms are OK and Rose McGowan has a few nice moments but the other female leads are truly unremarkable. That doesn't necessarily mean they give bad performances, the blame really should go to Tarantino for giving them a script which provides them with nothing to do. In the end this is a movie which is reasonably decent but will leave you wanting more.Oh, and Quentin? One last thing. Enough already with the feet. Seriously.",Death Proof
97,sharky_55,He's a stuntman.,5,3 August 2016,"Death Proof represents everything that Quentin Tarantino is known and loved for, all neatly packaged for one of his unintentionally (or so you would think) favoured demographics, fourteen year olds. The problem is that it is no longer the 60s, and Hollywood has long since unironically embraced the very thing that exploitation films existed to parade: guns, gore, explosions, nudity and cool looking cars. Surprisingly, Tarantino doesn't even deliver on that front. The film contains one painfully PG-13 lap dance, deliberately refocuses on each of the girl's various demises in the head-on collision, and is solely lacking almost anywhere else. For something that should be unashamedly putting the spotlight on its selling points, it actually spends less time on them than the typical lingering shots of feet. It seems unthinkable that a director of his sensibility would be accused of being tame, but here he is guilty of it.So if there's none of that, what else is there on for show? Tarantino has always had the ability to get away with more than anyone else, because of his fiercely loyal cult audience. So because he frames Death Proof as a homage (like how he 'homaged' the entire plot of Reservoir Dogs from City on Fire), even the slightest transgression is treated as a deliberate and stylistic flourish - all over the internet there are people vehemently arguing that it's meant to be bad, it's meant to be boring, and so on. Which is the point, but it very conveniently closes off any sort of criticism levelled at the film. Tarantino absolutely indulges himself in setting the scene and tone; the characters have hicky, played on accents and names like Shanna and Arrrrrlene. The film stock is scratchy, visibly aged, and skips and jumps around like a broken record. Russell knowingly looks and grins into the camera right before he takes Pam for her last ride, and if to signal what we have been waiting for all along. And when the white 1970 Dodge Challenger re- appears after he mistakenly believes he has escaped on the cliff above, ready to pounce, the soundtrack chimes in like a final boss fight in an old-school video game. But does it really matter? In his best films Tarantino uses his trademarks to drive characterisation and action, but here it is just a burden. His penchant for long-winded, extraneous conversations clashes with the genre horribly - these characters are about to be dead in a second anyway, and gorily at that. The final beatdown plays like an unnecessary feminist power fantasy, with each girl throwing punches like championship boxers and freeze frames lingering and boldly underlining. It's relentless, and not in a good way.",Death Proof
98,fmarkland32,Excessive Force...,3,4 September 2010,"Kurt Russell stars as geriatric serial killer who uses his ""death proof"" car to mow down women who reject him. Such targets include Sydney Poitier (daughter of Sidney),Jordan Ladd, Vanessa Ferlito, Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Zoe Bell. That's pretty much it for plot. The problem with Death Proof is that it doesn't utilize the only bright spots it has. Mainly Kurt Russell and the action sequences. When Russell is on screen, Death Proof comes alive and the chases are truly thrilling, indeed the finale even features Russell in a hilarious change of character that brings a welcome sense of humor. The only problem is this is 20% of the movie. Most of it is taken up with women talking about 70s movies like Vanishing Point as well as men. What this lacks is any sense of reality. Very few women talk about movies from the 70s, indeed very few men do as well, ergo the idea that women could go on about such for that long doesn't work. Also the women aren't very likable. The final women in particular leave their friend alone with a country bumpkin rapist (see Kill Bill Volume 1) and we are apparently supposed to root for them by default. What bothered me most though was that it just feels too self indulgent, Tarantino obviously loves 70s cinema and he often times invites us to enjoy his passion, but with Death Proof he assumes his passion is enough and that we will be sold on his name alone. He is wrong. Death Proof then only comes to life in short spurts and that isn't enough.*1/2 out of 4-(Poor)",Death Proof
99,one9eighty,"Two tons of metal, 200 miles an hour, flesh and bone and plain old Newton... they all princess died.",6,9 February 2021,"This film represents Tarantino's fifth full-length feature film. He is credited with more against his name as a director, but I have discounted guest appearances and shorts from the list. Like it or lump it, my argument is that this is his fifth.""Death Proof"" is one part of a double feature called ""Grindhouse"" that Tarantino worked on with Robert Rodriguez, Eli Roth, Edgar Wright, and Rob Zombie. ""Grindhouse"" was not meant to be two films by all accounts; from interviews I am led to believe that there would be a massive single film with ""Death Proof"" as one of two main films interwoven between shorts and vignettes. But after the full ""Grindhouse"" project failed to meet expectations at pre-release screenings in the US market, the film was halved, and ""Death Proof"" was given its own life.The other part of the grindhouse double feature was ""Planet Terror"", which, as well as a retaining a small segment for ""Death Proof"", brought segments such as ""Machete"" (which went on to be a standalone feature), ""Werewolf Women of the S.S."", ""Don't"", ""Thanksgiving"", and ""Hobo with a Shotgun"" (which also went on to be a standalone too).The idea behind the whole ""Grindhouse"" project was to make something that paid homage to and used the style of 1970's exploitation films. The initial poor reception meant that although it is not a single film anymore, a drive-in double feature could still be achieved - so still working within the parameters of the project to some extent. The two titles, ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"" were eventually released two months apart and kind of referenced each other too.So, what is it then? Well, ""Death Proof"" is an exploitation slasher film starring Kurt Russell as a psychotic stuntman who murders young women in car accidents using his ""death-proof"" stunt car. He stalks some women early on, who he manages to dispatch with minimum effort, but cannot be charged by the law despite them thinking he is responsible. Later, he stalks some more women, but he is up against meaner opposition this time as one of them herself is a stunt person too.Kurt Russell plays the stuntman, Mike McKay. Before being cast, Tarantino attempted to get John Travolta, Willem Defoe, John Malkovich, Mickey Rourke, Ron Pearlman, Bruce Willis, Kal Penn, Ving Rhames, John Jarrett, or Sylvester Stallone. That is not to say that Russell was not in the running, by all accounts, he was on a shortlist, the others just had prior commitments which meant Tarantino was able to go with him. Again, from interviews, Tarantino thought that Russell had been away from bad-ass roles for too long, playing more conventional nicey-nicey roles.Russell's performance offers plenty of aestheticism and he plays the gritty and weary killer stuntman with aplomb. His performance felt like his Snake Plissken character from ""Escape from New York"" (1981) has taken a wrong turn somewhere on his path of life and ended up here, old, dirty, and unhinged.Starring opposite Russell is a formidable mix of talent including Kiwi stuntwoman Zoë Bell as herself, Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferlito, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Tracie Thoms, Rose McGowan, Jordan Ladd, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Keep an eye open for Tarantino making his regular cameo, and fellow ""Grindhouse"" director Eli Roth features along the way too.Zoë Bell did not realise she would be cast as a leading lady when she initially got the call. Tarantino was that impressed with her as Uma Thurman's stunt double in ""Kill Bill"" that he wanted her in the film, and furthermore, he wanted her to play a version of herself too. It was her first on-screen acting role, and she does herself proud as a bad-a55 foe to Russell's psychotic stuntman. In fact there is a lot of bad-assery on show from the other female leads too. In this, despite the stuntman thinking he's in a mans world, (to quote James Brown), ""it wouldn't be nothing, nothing, without a woman or a girl"".In trying to make ""Death Proof"" fit in with the grindhouse ethos, lots of techniques were used to make the film look, feel, and sound like an ultra-low-budget B-Movie. There are times were the picture looks washed out, and other times where it looks like bad editing has stitched the film together. These were all intentional techniques and it really gives the film a dirty and seedy feel. The music used also adds to this, the soundtrack is comprised of non-original music, with other film scores used rather than making something new for this. The constructs used help to make the film look fitting of the era it is paying homage too. One thing I noticed though from watching ""Planet Terror"" as well as this - in that the ""Death Proof"" segment looks even more ultra-low-budget. The standalone version of ""Death Proof"" is more polished, and in fact, towards the end of ""Death Proof"" there is a noticeable shift from what the first two acts brought in terms of style.I have gone this far without explaining the meaning behind the title of ""Death Proof"" so allow me a moment for that. Stunt people and film production teams would make a stunt car ""death-proof"" so it could be smashed and hammered without killing the person driving it. Rollbars and reinforced body work were added under the shell of the vehicle that the audience could not see, thus making the stunt professionals safer than if they were using a commercially bought car which would probably crumple (I like writing that word - ""ccccrumple"") after impact. With a fascination for this concept, Tarantino wondered if this could be combined and used in a slasher film context, and hey-presto - the film was almost writing itself. There are at least two top muscle cars on show in the film, a souped up 1970 Chevy Nova SS which the stuntman has at the start of the film, and a reinforced 1969 Dodge Charger later on. Please don't send me questions about the cars - I'm the furthest person from a 'petrol head' that you could find.Having read a lot of reviews about this film there seems to be mixed feeling about it. Where some people have said it was an over-glamourisation of exploitation films which serve no purpose in today's modern film market I can see their point. I would argue that there is a market for all types of films though, and while humans are such unique and different creatures there will always be somebody that likes what a director pumps out. This might not be a film in the traditional mould of styles that Tarantino has used before, or what audiences expect from him - there are not any random flashbacks for one, but that does not mean it is any less of a Tarantino film. The power that the author of a piece of work has, is the ability to change things up occasionally, unfortunately not everybody handles change well. In imitating a style that is not as fashionable as it once was in its heyday, this low-budget style film is still plenty of fun for hardcore film fans. This is more of a straightforward genre movie than Tarantino's usual homage laden films provide, it's free from irony, very old-fashioned - but it still has a place in film and is a success on its own terms.With its 113-minute runtime, some audience members might think the film drags on a little in places, and I happen to agree. I cannot concede though that I did not enjoy the film. It still provided lots of fun and excitement for me to watch, but in my opinion, I preferred Tarantino's last feature film outing with ""Kill Bill"", and I also preferred the ""Planet Terror"" film which only featured a small segment for ""Death Proof"". Still, there are a lot worse films out there and I'd happily sit in front of this one again.",Death Proof
100,aciessi,Start your engines.,9,21 May 2021,"Holy hell is Death Proof a great movie. 1/2 of the Rodriguez/Tarantino experimental theatrical experience ""Grindhouse"", Quentin Tarantino is tasked with making a film in the genre of the very kind that he used to watch with his mother in the early 70's. A dirty, sleazy, scummy midnight flick. This is his wheelhouse. He's right where he wants to be here. These movies were exploding off the screen with extreme violence and steaming sexuality. How can Quentin go wrong? He honestly doesn't. In a sense, this is a precursor to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. The first half of Death Proof is virtually perfect. We get well established with Stuntman Mike and the girls that he targets to kill with his stunt car. It's a red hot hangout movie. Kurt Russel arguably gives his best performance as Stuntman Mike. He's charming and seductive, while at the same time, terrifying. When the film moves over to Lebanon, Tennessee, we meet Stuntman Mike's match. That is, a group of badass stunt women, on loan from Hollywood. This is where the film enters shaky territory. The grimy, 16mm patina that dominated the first half disappears, and looks more in line with Tarantino in his post-Kill Bill era. I wish, stylistically, it wasn't that inconsistent. Also, the scene in the diner goes on for way too long. But all of that is forgiven when we are treated to the epic car chase sequence that closes out the film. Whatever faults that the second half has, forget about it. This scene takes you for a brutal ride. I didn't want it to end. For that matter, neither did I want the film to end.",Death Proof
101,fwomp,May Be Only For Tarantion Fans...,6,20 October 2007,"Quentin Tarantino and bloodshed. The two seem to go hand-in-hand. From RESERVOIR DOGS, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, the KILL BILL duet (One and Two), and now the GRINDHOUSE couplet (DEATH PROOF and PLANET TERROR), Mr. Tarantino likes to play with crimson. And he sometimes does it very well.What makes Death Proof watchable is its homage to the drive-in days of early Technicolor when scratchy editing and concession stand intermissions were commonplace. The story itself is fairly unremarkable (with the exception of Kurt Russell's performance as Stuntman Mike, a psychotic, out-of-work, stuntman who has girl issues for no apparent reason). His mood swings from depression to exhilaration are done well and mark him as the crux that holds Death Proof together.The ""Tarantino Girls"" are sure to be eye-candy for most male watchers, their languorously long legs and tight Daisy-Duke shorts being a bit overly focused upon. Although this is what makes Tarantino films appealing, especially when hearkening back to the 70's when big hair and revealing clothing were making their way into the mainstream.And what Tarantino flick would be complete without some cool cars. Souped-up Nova's and Dodge Challengers are indicative of the times (the 70s), a time we're supposed to find ourselves reminiscing about. But Tarantino fails to continue on the right path and veers out of control.Cell phones pop up in the second act of Death Proof and pull us away from the first (the second act takes place less than two years after the first). I had to ask myself exactly ""when"" we were. Confusing us further, the Dodge Challenger that the girls go check out is designated ""a classic,"" yet, again, the second act (which is where this happens) takes place only 14 months after the first.Kurt Russell's Stuntman Mike is creepy and funny, and it is his hysterically frightening performance that pulls Death Proof up a notch. His stalking of the pretty girls is spooky, while his later encounters with them are laughable ...and sometimes sexy.The car crash scenes involving the classic Dodges is sure to make MOPAR owners cringe, each crunch of metal on metal eliciting a screeching quality from the cars themselves and those who love these rare vehicles.The girls in both episodes are great looking gals: Zoe Bell, Rosario Dawson (A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS), Vanessa Ferlito (24), Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Tracie Toms (THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA), Rose McGowan, Jordan Ladd, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (BOBBY) round out the leggy women whom Kurt Russell's character harasses ...but not the way he intended in the end.This is a modestly entertaining film, if only for its sentimental value for those who spent time at the drive-in a few decades ago, or for Kurt Russell fans. If you're a die-hard Tarantino-ite, you might find it enjoyable as well. But for mainstream audiences, this one might crash and burn.(NOTE: This is only a review of half of the GRINDHOUSE film, which, for some reason, was divided into two separate DVDs when released. A review of PLANET TERROR will be forthcoming soon)",Death Proof
102,DarthBill,Quentin Tarantino owes Kurt Russell an apology,1,7 November 2007,"The 2nd half of the ""Grindhouse"" film feature by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, respectively. ""Death Proof"" is specifically Tarantino's contribution, whereas Rodriguez's contribution was the small town redneck community VS. zombies feature ""Planet Terror"".The result? Well, ""Planet Terror"" was fairly entertaining as it embraced its trashiness and provided fairly engaging action sequences. ""Death Proof"", however, does not live up to the hype. Now, I admit right now I've never really been a fan of Quentin Tarantino's work. I admire the reckless kinetic energy his films usually exhibit and at times I even briefly embrace his bizarre sense of humor, and hey, even I laughed a few times at his obscure pop culture references (as I'm an unabashed pop culture junkie myself), but at the same time his films come off to me as extremely repugnant, unpleasant, and even a tad repetitive. Thus I can only be a curious observer of his organized chaos on film and never a true fan while the rest of the world praises his ""genius"" and tries to silence the few who don't care for his work (people like me). But even by trashy action film crime movie standards, ""Death Proof"" is an insult to human intelligence in a vein similar to George Lucas's awful Star Wars prequels and the lackluster Spider-Man 3, the difference being that those films at least featured engaging action sequences to pad out the banality of the overall product. No such luck with ""Death Proof"".The story - or lack thereof - concerns Stuntman Mike McKay (Kurt Russell, an old pro at both trashy action films and well made action films, having cut his tough guy teeth on John Carpenter's beloved cult epic 'Escape From New York') and his 'death proof' car. A veteran stunt man and stone cold psychopath, Mike has an obsession with using his car to kill people, specifically beautiful but shallow, vapid and, above all else, annoying, obnoxious, unlikable and unsympathetic women. The film revolves around his encounters with two sets of beautiful but - you guessed it - shallow, vapid, annoying, obnoxious, unlikable women. The first set of said women (led by screen legend Sidney Poitier's actress daughter), open the film by heading out to score weed, possibly have some wild unprotected sex, submit another to a potentially humiliating yet erotic lap dance, and prepare for a lake house get away they have planned. They spend most of their time driving around and sitting in the bar, talking, or rather droning on and on about nothing with an uninspired blandness worthy of Uma Thurman's Bride in ""Kill Bill""; they encounter Stuntman Mike at the bar, and, well, long story short, after even more lackluster dialogue, they get run over by Stuntman Mike, who is hospitalized but lives to see and destroy another day while they die rather horribly.Cut to 14 months later, we encounter yet another group of beautiful but unlikable and unsympathetic women (including but not limited to Rosario Dawson, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and real life stunt woman Zoe Bell ""playing"" herself - she doubled for Lucy Lawless on TV's Xena Warrior Princess and Uma Thurman in the Kill Bill films) who happen to be working on a movie in the south. Guess what? They also spend most of their time droning on and on with the most uninspired and un-engaging dialogue this side of the coast, and they're just as annoying, obnoxious and unlikable as the first group of women - if not more so (they actually leave Winstead stranded with a Southern lunatic). Well, while out for their aimless drive, with Zoe performing a stunt on the roof of the car, they cross paths with Stuntman Mike, who decides to go after them for no better reason than the fact that they happen to be there and are making asses of themselves on the road. In the midst of this, Mike gets shot and his tough guy persona falls apart and he is reduced to a cowering weakling; the women then turn the tables and chase after him, taunting him with possibly even more venom than he tossed at them, and the film ends with the women basically beating Mike to death in the middle of the road.What can I say other than this film is overlong, self-indulgent, boring and lacking focus? Stuntman Mike was a potentially interesting anti-hero/villain and Kurt Russell, fine actor that he is, made the most of his role - for the few minutes he's on screen he's the only actor who seems to exhibit anything resembling a personality or feeling - but he is woefully underused and under-developed, and reducing him to a whimpering fool at the end in an apparent attempt to parody the old alpha male tough guy image (which Russell himself wore in earlier, better films) was far from endearing or even funny. As I stated before, the women who appear in the film are among the most repulsive and disgusting characters I've ever seen. It doesn't matter if they're meant to embody ""girl power"", these women were simply not likable characters, and their absurd dialogue (probably meant to be funny due to its absurd content) only adds insult to injury, and the finale of the film, where the 2nd group of women essentially clobber Mike to death only demonstrates that deep down these women were just as psychotic and despicable as Mike himself. And Zoe Bell, who spends most of her screen time smirking, is no actress; a fine stunt performer yes, but she's no actress. Even worse, ""Death Proof"" lacks the reckless kinetic energy that defined Tarantino's other films, making his obscenely bad dialogue and repugnant characters all the more unbearable. The car chases are fine, but the film doesn't have enough going for it to justify its absurd running time and unpleasant atmosphere. It was inevitable that after all that praise Tarantino would make a mistake, and this is probably it.",Death Proof
103,sjanders-86430,My new favorite Tarantino,10,13 April 2021,"Kill Bill's were my favorites now Death Proof. Tarantino wrote, directed and did the photography. Kurt Russell is a retired stuntman who kills girls in his car without hurting himself. Then he comes across a group of young women who give him a shocking run for his money. The star is Zoe Bell the stunt double for Thurman in Kill Bill. She does some amazing stunts here. She jumps into a moving car after hanging onto the hood for the most treacherous ride ever. Vanessa Felito does an unforgettable dance. Jordan Ladd looks like her grandfather Alan Ladd. The genius of Tarantino is the mix of music, physical, car, and bullet movements. His vital force is this uniquely American mixture. He could only have happened here in America where his characters are alive with a killer energy. Zoe Bell is a New Zealander who encapsulates Tarantino's vision.",Death Proof
104,Maziun,Disappointing movie from Quentin Tarantino,4,16 November 2013,"This is Tarantino's weakest movie yet (not counting The four rooms"" where he was one of the 4 directors). A tribute to his teenage fascination with really cheap movies . One could expect from Tarantino that he will use that fascination to turn crap into gold , just like he usually does. Unfortunately , while ""Death proof"" is definitely better than average grind house movie it isn't a good movie.""DP"" is 25 % of fun with 75% of boredom. This movie is heavy on dialogue . It wouldn't be a problem if the dialogues were interesting. They not. If I didn't knew that this is Tarantino's movie , I could swear that the dialogues were written by some talentless Tarantino-wannabe . Do you remember how memorable and quotable were ""Reservoir dogs"" and ""Pulp fiction"" ? Don't expect anything from ""Death proof"" . The dialogues are forced and utterly forgettable. The another problem is that the girls in this movie are completely bland . None of them has got interesting personalities. I felt like they were one and the same uninteresting dumb young girl character. And the actresses don't offer anything special in terms of acting . You could hire any actresses to play in this movie and the effect would be the same.Most of fun arrives in the last 20 minutes of the movie . Before that there is a 5 minutes of fun (the lap dance and first killings). Kurt Russell gives a great performance as the killer and it's sad that he doesn't have too much screen time . The movie lives when he appears. In my opinion Tarantino should make this movie from the point of view of Russell. It would be much more interesting . This character had potential to be iconic.Even the soundtrack here is strangely forgettable. Do you remember how memorable soundtracks played a huge part in ""Reservoir dogs"" and ""Pulp fiction"" ? Here I remember only one song after watching this movie – The Coasters ""Down in Mexico"".Overall a big disappointment . It's better than Rodriguez's ""Planet terror"" , but really it isn't an accomplishment. I give it 4/10.",Death Proof
105,mario_c,Tarantino is back!,7,22 November 2007,"Tarantino is back, with all his potential as a director. This movie, DEATH PROOF is the proof of that! The entire film is totally in his ""style"" as we can see by the dialogs, the characters, the soundtrack and many other things. As an example, who won't notice the ""foot massage"" thing or the quotation to other previous movies (classic or not) and even the ""review"" of those movies (""60 SECONDS, but the original, not the one with Angelina Jolie!"" LOL!) Well, that's definitely a Tarantino film!About the plot, it's interesting and kind of original, because it's not every day that we can see a ""car psychopath"" (a guy that use a car to kill his victims), but also, on the other hand, a so ""little chicken poor psycho"" that run away from his victims! We can clearly say that the ""spell turned against the wizard!"" My God, how he ran away from his victims to get escaped, but for nothing, since they got him in the end! What ""poor little devil"" of a psycho!...The girls are excellent! The characters are great and the acting too. I was just expecting that Rose McGowan had a more significant role, as she has in PLANET TERROR (the second part of GRINDHOUSE, which I've watched first). On the opposite side, I didn't appreciate too much the character played by Kurt Russell. What kind of psycho is that?!Globally, I think this movie is a little better than PLANET TERROR, but that's probably because I prefer Tarantino's kind of cinema rather than Rodriguez's",Death Proof

107,witster18,If you didn't like this movie..one question...why did you see it?,8,20 October 2007,"You knew what you were gonna get. If you didn't want to see Tarantino's 'b' movie...or should we say 'c' movie homage to the action/exploitation/drive-in films of the 70's.. then why did you see it? This is a VERY GOOD film. Forget all the 'just became a Tarantino fan after Kill Bill reviewers' who literally have no frame of reference. ..and take it from a movie buff...'Deathproof' is a wild soup of scantily clad women, both strong and vulnerable... it spills out of the sewers with its rough film stock look and its clichéd 'b' movie sound editing and leaves us with a successfully funny/stupid/scary if not wickedly entertaining ride. Kurt Russell's' Stuntman Mike is less of a central character and more like a speedbump in the lives of these interesting females. The dialogue is funny and the soundtrack is flat-out exceptional. Unlike many of the reviewers here...I found the two hour running time went by too fast. I see what Tarantino was trying to achieve here....homage....entertainment...cgi-less action.....witty dialogue.....colorful characters.....and the more I think about it.... the more I realize how successful this film really is.. Highly recommended for the 'Old school' Tarantino fans. I go back and look at all these terrible reviews.....and quite frankly, I'm dumbfounded.

108,EijnarAmadeus,Could'a been a killer...,6,3 February 2010,"Quentin Tarantino homages exploitation film of the 70s adding his own touch mostly through snappy dialog, and great music. The film's bad-shape quality and frequently disorienting jump-cuts are made deliberately to look like a weary Grindhouse tape. Obviously, story isn't something to dwell upon - a psychotic stuntman named Mike (played by Kurt Russell) stalks sexy young women before he murders them brutally with his 'death proof' vehicle - that's it. The film is one dimensional, and although Tarantino does add tiny little details about the characters for the viewer to pick up, they're mostly inefficient and drowns in all the nonsensical chatter. And it's a lot of chatter in DEATH PROOF, girl-power chatter to be more precise, and though it's well written (as expected from Tarantino), it goes on for too long and squeezes Kurt Russell's character out of the picture. This is especially sorry, when he's the best thing in the whole film. Luckily, the climactic car chase is on fire, and pays a fine tribute to 'carsploitation' films and the Aussie directors of the 'ozploitation' era that immortalized exhilarating and authentic car chase scenes. With that fueling end, you're left feeling the entire film should have kept that pace, and so it should have been released at 50+ minutes, chopping a lot of the useless meat away.",Death Proof
109,deatman9,I actually enjoyed it,6,20 October 2012,This was definitely my favorite of Tarantinos Grindhouse bundle thats really not saying much because I did not really care for Planet Terror it was a little too silly for me. I know that was the intended style but I did not like it all the same.This movie however was quite the fun little ride. The acting from the beginning group of girls was better then the second but other then that everyone did a good job and the story line was new and exciting. It could have had a better ending though.This movie is about a man named stuntman Mike(Russel) who goes around in his stunt car stalking women and eventually using his suped up car to kill them.This movie was pretty good it was nothing special though. Like all grindhouse movies it was kind of silly and a little over the top but it was not bad. It could have used some nudity to make it a true grindhouse film.,Death Proof
110,Superunknovvn,"God bless you, Quentin!",6,19 August 2007,"Since ""Grindhouse"" was such a flop in the U.S., and Europeans wouldn't have gotten the whole ""double feature"" thing, anyway, ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"" were split for continental releases. That means that we got slightly longer versions of the individual movies, but had to watch the excellent in between faux-trailers on youtube.However, having seen ""Death Proof"" I wonder how much of a difference the separation of the movies will make commercially. This motion picture is so not made for the masses. Only a Quentin Tarantino could get away with a non-plot like that, and boy, do I love him for that.""Death Proof"" isn't a masterpiece. It's more or less a high quality throw away movie. The good thing is that it isn't as excessive in its references and storyline as the ""Kill Bill"" flicks were. On the other hand, Quentin pretty much failed to come up with a proper set up. Instead we get 40 minutes of blabbering, then there's a car crash and then the whole thing repeats, as if this was actually two movies. Sure, no one can make people's superficial conversations as entertaining as this director does, but it was definitely too much this time.Tarantino redeems himself with the final action sequence, however. Rarely have I seen a car chase this exciting. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and when the movie comes to its abrupt ending you just feel the need to applause because it's so ridiculously cool.So far Tarantino managed to intrigue me with every movie he has made. I only hope that the commercial failure of ""Grindhouse""/""Death Proof"" doesn't mean he'll have to restrict himself with future projects. If Tarantino couldn't let himself go anymore, that would be a huge loss for cinema.",Death Proof
111,qormi,A Little Less Conversation,2,12 May 2009,"First of all, Kurt Russell was great. He portrayed the sick sociopath perfectly; charming the ladies and then going in for the kill. His emotions in the second half of the film, when the tables are turned on him, seem genuine and frantic. Without Kurt Russell, this film would have been pure garbage. He saved it. Period. We have two distinct sections to this movie, with Russell in a hospital bed serving as the bridge. What connects both parts is two groups of young ladies; groups of four, who yak and yak and yak...in banal dialogue. In part two, the word,""mother---ker"" is completely worn out. The profanity-filled dialogue is right up there with ""White Men Can't Jump"". In the beginning of Part Two of this flick, you feel the film is getting away from the director. The dialogue between the women is so lengthy and so unauthentic that I pressed the mute button during my second viewing. A curious blend of bad acting and dumb ""witty"" to ""wittier"" dialogue made me ill. The car scenes in part one were terrifying. The car chase scenes in part two were great, too. One of the best car smash-up chases ever put on film. I'd recommend seeing this film; just know where the ""mute"" button is.",Death Proof
112,DonFishies,"Corrects a few problems, leaves others, and genuinely does not feel as fun the second time around",8,19 September 2007,"Chances are, if you saw Grindhouse or are a big Tarantino fan, the release of an extended version of Death Proof will sound like an intriguing idea. Even without the promise of the coveted missing reel, it still sounded like a great idea to see an already independent movie become even more independent from its double-feature status. But whether it is the fun, the madcap madness or just the whole big picture itself, there is definitely something missing from the experience in watching this extended cut.As everyone should know by now, Death Proof revolves around Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), who has a certain fondness for good-looking women, and an even greater fondness for his creepy ""death proof"" car.Even though it has been quite a while since the release of Grindhouse, I still find it a little bizarre to say anything more about the film. The first time I saw it, I had very little knowledge of what I was going to see, other than it being about a homicidal maniac who stalks women in his car. And while that basically is what happens in the film, there was so much more than just hits you like a ton of bricks if you do not know it is coming. I found on second watching, it still proved to be quite shocking, but lost a little bit of its edge because I knew what was coming already. While I know this is a problem for almost every movie, it just seemed a little bit more of a disappointment here than it does for other films.And on that same token, I found that the extended version of the film is a whole lot more long-winded and pedantic. Yes, the clever Tarantinoian dialogue is prevalent from the start right up until the very last frame, and yes, the film is vulgar just like every other member of the Tarantino catalogue. But when it comes down to it, some of the conversations were far too lengthy in the original cut as it was. Why would anyone feel that an extended version should have long conversations cut to being even longer? And why add even more homaging movie reference-laden dialogue that much of the audience had trouble understand to start with? It seemed a little eccentric in a way to see the film stretched out as far as it is here. Surely Tarantino has learned the difference between subtle brilliance and overt excess. Hasn't he? What also is a little disheartening is that a lot of the original mistakes, have not been corrected here. Chief amongst all of these problems is the absolutely wacky character trait changes that occur near the end of the film. I understand why they were used and what purpose they serve, but that still does not make up for the fact that it ends up making a ridiculously great movie even more ridiculous.What does work in this extended out version is a bit of substance for some of the characters. We get a deeper sense of who the otherwise ditsy two-note joke Lee (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is, and we get a whole lot more on the pathos-laden Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito). Both of these characters were sadly underused in the original version (despite the importance of Arlene's character), and I liked seeing both of them having a whole lot more to do here. The much longed for lap dance scene is also something meaningful, as it works as a bit of dry humour, character development and just genuine hotness all in one. I was disappointed to hear it was cut in the original version, but very pleased to see it in its entirety here. The sly wit is still very much intact throughout the film, as is the customary pitch black humour of Tarantino we have all come to expect. The small additional moments for characters all add a great deal to these oft hilarious moments, and they help make the film not seem nearly as boring as some may make it out to be. The finale car chase scene is also still very pulse-poundingly brilliant. Very happy to see there were no changes there.All of the actors seem to be having a great time in their roles. Even with limited screen time, all eight of the main ladies get their moment to shine and use it to the best of their abilities. Whether they are playing helpless victim, saddened drunk or a sex gossipist, all of the roles are pulled off with a grace and finesse that only a Tarantino movie can bring. Russell on the other hand, completely knocks his role out of the park. He is deliciously evil from the moment he passes Arlene in the restaurant, and he continues to deliver as the movie goes on. I had my reservations about him playing such a delinquent of a character originally, but after seeing it again, I am very impressed with the subtle creepiness and genuinely gleeful expression Russell shows off whether he is looking straight at the camera, or just talking to one of the actors.But, even with the film still being great, there is a certain amount of fun missing. Seeing the film as a double-feature with Planet Terror was an experience I can talk about for years, but it was also a great marketing move. Both feature characters and plots that fly off of each other. Seeing it separately, and never getting the chance to watch its companion just feels awkward, and only made me wish that Terror was either coming up or had just passed.I am not sure if it is because I had such a great time when I first saw it, or I have just begun to outgrow the brilliant dialogue Tarantino has been constructing, but Death Proof extended only delivered half the punch the theatrical version did. I can only hope for a double-feature DVD.8/10.",Death Proof
113,gigan-92,"""Hey shots first, questions later.""",10,7 December 2011,"Death Proof (2007) is one of Quentin Tarantino's over-looked works, in the same light as Jackie Brown (1997). Though seemingly very different, the films have quite a bit in common actually. Namely, both are homages to the whole genre of exploitation films, which in itself branches out to many, many sub genres. Jackie Brown specifically lives up to the Blaxploitation sub-genre, even so far as to star Pam Grier in the lead role. Death Proof aims for many things, but to sum it up it is a tribute to classic cinema; a time long forgotten but that is rearing its infamous head again to the delight of many.It plays to many of the grindhouse film characteristics, all with far less subtly than Jackie Brown. Grindhouse itself is a product of the French New wave film-making style, so naturally there are several attributes of it that can be off-putting to contemporary audiences. One thing in particular is that the print has a grainy look to it in the first half, giving it that vintage feel. The movie even skips from time to time with deliberately placed jump cuts. These can be seen as a revealing error in the editing and cinematography, but Tarantino wanted this to have the full-on classic look of grindhouse cinema. These were the real-life 'mistakes' or artistic tactics of the time in the 70s, where even the finished film could be subject to post-production editing by the theaters themselves. It definitely appeals to a strong cult-fan base than to mainstream audiences.There is definitely homage to the use of lovely ladies in the film, akin to exploitation movies back in their heyday. How many shots of Vanessa Ferlito's or Sydney Tamiia Poitier's ass and voluptuous legs can one need in a movie? To our director, the answer in this elaborate pastiche is simply ""why not""? Even more akin to Tarantino, the camera always happens to settle on the feet of the actresses. Pam Grier, Rosario Dawson or Uma Thurman, it doesn't really matter, there is always a shot of just the feet. The camera isn't shy about it either, but it totters between playful and sensuous. Another very enjoyable aspect has got to be the use of awesome muscle cars. The roar of the engine, the high-speed chases, which this movie obviously excels in and of course the use of practical and all-real stunts. It's not just about the action; it's about the way it's carried out. With the advent of garbage such as G.I. Joe; The Rise of Cobra (Stephen Sommers, 2009), CGI has often become over-used and in my opinion redundant. The film definitely touches on this with a scene between Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) and Pam (Rose McGowan) when speaking about his ""death-proof"" stunt car. To say the film pays respect to how it's traditionally done is beyond an understatement. There is few a film that have made my adrenaline pump so effectively as this one did. It builds up with classic 70s-80s stalker-slasher POV, which one has to love, playing Kurt Russell as an effective psychopath. The first car-action scene, with the all-out ultra-violence that is expected of both exploitation films and Tarantino himself, completely catches you off guard. All those pretty bodies are maimed indiscriminately, and without a second glance we will never see them again. If one loved Kill Bill Vol. 1-2 (2003-2004), with its colorful tribute to Lady Snowblood (Toshiya Fujita, 1973), then you will love this film. I haven't seen Vanishing Point (Richard C. Sarafian, 1971) or any of the other classic cult films the movie references to, but you don't necessarily have to. Its style of bringing to life what is considered old and dead is itself more than enough to intrigue a film goer and how the film beautifully expands on those classics with dazzling characters is quite incredible.",Death Proof
114,ctomvelu-1,Crazy stuff,7,31 May 2008,"I may have commented on this on another name recently. Kurt Russell stars as a killer who drives the backroads of the southwest in a souped-up junkmobile. He encounters a gaggle of gals at a bar and pursues them to what should be their doom. Unfortunately for Russell, these girls have other plans. Among the ladies in the cast are Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferelitto and Rose McGowan. The ending is hysterical and horrendous at the same time. I'm not sure what possessed Russell to do this nutty flick, but so be it. He makes a very convincing villain. DEATH PROOF is one-half of GRINDHOUSE, and played as a separate movie in some countries.",Death Proof
115,Maniac-9,"For QT's weakest film, still not half bad",7,3 February 2013,"Even though this might be the weakest movie, that's actually kind of a compliment towards Quentin. When your worst movie that you've done is still a good and solid movie that shows just how great your better movies are.This isn't a very long movie since it's only half of what was the Grindhouse double teaming of Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez but it's an entertaining movie for the time that it gives you. It's then split in half thematically with the first half taking place in Texas where Stuntman Mike and Jungle Julia and her friends all hanging out in a bar then they all leave the bar where Mike then runs them all down in his ""Death Proof"" car.The other half of the movie takes place in Tennessee where a couple of women on their day off from working on a movie decide to go test driving a Dodge Challenger muscle car and one of the girls played by Zoe Bell who's a real stunt woman go a little too far by playing a game where Zoe rides on the hood of the car while the car is going really fast. Which you have to cast a real stunt person to do a stunt like this since a regular actor couldn't do this stunt and because of the way they film this you can't just simply film it with a stunt double and use the normal actor in closeups without it getting lame. Really well done stunt.",Death Proof
116,rajdoctor,Death Proof,8,16 June 2007,"I was a bit in two minds about how the movie would be, but Quentine Tarantino always leaves me gasping for more. Every movie of his  he makes sure that he presents stuff that we have never seen before. He has a superb technique of building up a story with obscure details of characters ranting about something. Death Proof is no different.The story is about a psycho Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) who stalks women and gets innate pleasure in hurting and killing them. The movie is divided into clearly two parts  the former part showcases the build-up of the first bunch of girls on road, who are targeted by Mike and killed in a deadly car crash; whereas the latter part brings Mike face to face with his fears  when he unknowingly encounters another bunch of girls (who are themselves stuntwomen). What happens in the end is a long chase  one of the most beautifully filmed chases  especially when the balance turns against Mike. I did not accept such type of ending but I lapped it.All the actors and actresses act superbly, but when Quentine Tarantino is there  the movie belongs solely to him. He breathes his own life into the movie.Quentine likes to present a B-grade style of movie making. I observed that he has left severe editing goof  ups in the movie. The language is sour and pornographic. The color suddenly becomes black and white, as if someone forgot to process it correctly and suddenly at a point in time, without and turn of events the screen comes back to color. The thoughts and moves of characters are unseen before. All these, I think Quentine does intentionally. No doubt why his movie attain cult status; because they become icons to people on how one do things in a different genre.I tried so hard to hate the obscene language of the movie and the behavior of girls. But in the end  I loved the movie. It was good.One particular SINGLE shot with the camera revolving around the table when the second bunch of girls are talking about their life in a restaurant was excellent  both in terms of the acting and single shot footage. Brilliant. Just a trivia - this movie was a segment of another movie - Grindhouse.Thumbs up to these B-grade looking A class movie.(Stars 8 out of 10)",Death Proof
117,PeterMitchell-506-564364,A film with so many wrong turns. How dare you Quentin.,3,25 February 2013,"This movie got me so mad, but not as mad as Jackie Brown. I thought I was about to sit down to this some seventy film noir hip car movie filled with action and pretty girls. Only I was half right. Quentin has got caught in a 70's blackploitation phase it seemed. And it was a shame here, cause we really had a good concept which in one one way was abused at Quentin's story talents. Deathproof is the worst film, Quentin's ever done. Kurt Russell, making a great return to the big screen, is great, like he is at playing Elvis. Here he plays a scarred faced stuntman, who kills his prey with his car, even by having little hotties sit in the passenger seat. The end where he got bitch slapped, and kicked to death by the second trio of hotties was only a couple of things I liked, which was a shame as this was really effective and original stuff, Russell pleading like a pathetic wretch, underestimating these chicks. This was followed by a great pumping more score, ending the film, where we see stock footage of woman's faces who we have no idea of. The other pumping music score I liked was in the demise of the first score of chicks to buy it, one accepting death, in the last seconds of life, before taking head on impact from Kurt's fancy stunt car. One effective shot, is that of a decapitated leg flying out the window. What ruins this movie, is talk, and a lot of it, and nowhere near as much action as there should be in it's 113 minute duration. We aren't interested in the first set of chicks car conversation or the other chicks spiel in a cafe, making references to John Hughes films, it's like watching an actual conversation. But I did like watching Kurt scarf down a plate of nachos.",Death Proof
118,asda-man,Top Gear with murderers and sexy people,8,6 February 2015,"Death Proof was the only Quentin film I had left to see. I suppose I was putting it off because of all the awful reviews I had read, with Quentin himself even calling it the worst film he's ever done. However, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised with what I received and I have to disagree with the majority of the negative remarks. In fact, I would put both Jackie Brown and Reservoir Dogs behind Death Proof, although I appreciate that I am definitely in the minority who rates Reservoir Dogs averagely.I think half the problem is that people are trying to Death Proof as a serious film. If you look at the frequently asked questions on IMDb, you'll find questions such as, ""Why was Stuntman Mike so inconsistent at the end?"" and ""What does the character Stuntman Mike symbolise?"" I think the people asking these questions are missing the point. Quentin is pretty much the king of pastiche and here he's pretty much creating a parody of sleazy 70's Grindhouse films. It isn't supposed to be taken seriously, it's meant to be a fun love letter to a lost genre, and for me it works.It's a lovingly crafted film right from the authentic opening credits. If you were an alien who had no idea who Quentin Tarantino was, then you could easily mistake the first half for being a genuine 70's Grindhouse film! The look of the film is brilliant with dirty marks popping up on every frame and strange continuity errors. It adds a unique atmosphere to the film which matches the film's sleazy antagonist, Stuntman Mike. He's your run-of-the-mill nutter who enjoys mutilating sexy girls with his car. Luckily Quentin manages to take away the film's uncomfortable themes of misogyny by creating a fun 'girl power' second-half.The film actually took me by surprise as it takes a massive detour in the middle which I didn't see coming, so I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen it yet. I'm not sure if it entirely worked, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I loved the long, hypnotic first-half which kind of reminded me of something David Lynch would do. It has long takes in a Twin Peaks-style bar with dreamy music playing in the background and dancing. It feels long, but it's never boring and always engaging. There's a lot of great dialogue in this half too.Unfortunately the dialogue didn't work so well for me in the second-half. Some of it felt like a parody of a Quentin Tarantino film and conversations dragged on for far too long. Thankfully, Quentin manages to snatch back our attention with a thrilling finale which features a seemingly never-ending car duel. It's a lot of fun to watch and is almost up there with other great Quentin action scenes such as the Bride vs. the Crazy 88 and the shootout at Candy Land.Most of all though, Death Proof is just plain fun. It may be overlong but it's full of brilliant dialogue and memorable characters. It also has a fantastic soundtrack which is almost like another character. The action scenes are also sensational. I enjoyed it a lot.",Death Proof
119,LazySod,Another director bites the dust,3,11 June 2007,"Stunt man Mike drives a car and runs stunts in it. He's got at least one screw loose, as proved by the fact he uses the car to stalk women so that he can kill them in one way or the other. Stunt man Mike is therefore not a wholly friendly man.This first part in the double film Grindhouse is supposed to be an homage to films in the cinema in the early 70s, and is therefore ridden with the flaws that film had back in those days - sudden color and sound changes, imagery missing here and there and that kind of thing. IMO, it doesn't make a very good homage. It looked worse than most of the films of these days and too synthetically changed to make it look like that.Story-wise the film is an absolute bore. The characters are worked out well enough but the few active bits of film are short and far apart and there is no real reason to care anything for the people that are going to perish.In short: about 20 minutes of good fun film and a lot of bad stuff that should have been burned straight after filming it.

In the two-parts of DEATH PROOF... which can be broken up into Nighttime since story one's in Texas, indoors at night, and the second, Daylight, occurs under a bright and rural Tennessee sun... it's one man, Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike, who connects each...As does Quentin Tarantino's dialogue, spoken by the two groups of pretty young girls: the first with a local billboard-famous leader (while the next group actually work in show biz)...Especially pop culture savvy is this self-promoting Sydney Poitier as the Austin, Texas morning disc jockey, Jungle Julia. And while Tarantino's no stranger at placing characters inside a contained, often claustrophobic setting, from RESERVOIR DOGS to FROM DUSK TILL DAWN to THE HATEFUL EIGHT, there were reasons to be there, and basically, no way out as opposed to merely harboring spontaneous, incessant chatter. Meanwhile, the buried lead and most interesting overall, is sexy, full-lipped Vanessa Ferlito as Butterfly, who Jungle Julia sets up on what can only be described as a ""blind date lap-dance...""Which is just about the only thing resembling an actual plot-point or plot-driven device, and the significance involves who eventually gets that dance...Enter Kurt Russell's weathered and leathery, facially-scarred stalker, who's somehow intriguing to these hot young girls, especially lone ""skinny hippie"" fox Rose McGowan, who fatefully needs a ride home. The fact she'd trust an old man with a DEATH PROOF vehicle that includes a working driver's side while the passenger area, separated by Plexiglas, has only a removable metallic bicycle seat, is farfetched and ludicrous...But horror/slasher victims are usually way too gullible; here resulting in the only truly nightmarish death as the following ""four birds with one stone"" slaying occurs much too quick, and after the amount of time spent with these girls, is downright anti-climatic...Leading to the second story headed by real life Uma Thurman KILL BILL stand-in Zoë Bell, who, while doing her own stunts, isn't very interesting, attractive or talented as an actress/character. Then again, her more legitimately trained on-screen cohorts, including Rosario Dawson, are equally dull and forgettable...So to really get off on what's intended as a b-movie exploitation tour-de-force, the first story is terribly flawed but after several viewings can be extremely addictive, and effective...With layers thinly disguised and partially revealed at the primary rainy-night location: a BBQ tavern where Tarantino himself plays Warren, a movie-geek owner and bartender: as director and especially as cinematographer, some of the best shots are of what's actually his own jukebox that, as usual in QT cinema, plays awesomely obscure, vintage tracks...As other subtle and ultimately futile plot-points include Julia's desperate and lonely attempts to connect with a famous filmmaker on her cell phone, when she's not trying to score pot with a dealer/friend as the otherwise annoying, parenthetical stoner chick camaraderie becomes more worthwhile and edgy once Kurt Russell is introduced, in the flesh and outside his formidably foreboding car: an example of Alfred Hitchcock's theory of how an otherwise mundane, superfluous dinner conversation becomes genuinely suspenseful when a time bomb's revealed under the table: shown only to the audience. And this guy's definitely ticking...Alas, while Russell's potentially iconic Stuntman Mike becomes one of cinema's most pathetic horror movie antagonists by the atrociously obvious, politically-correct ""Girl Power"" finale, he starts out an effectively mysterious, Neo Western loner... a hybrid of Burt Reynolds (including a 4th wall-breaking grin) and Norman Bates... and he may or may not even be an actual stuntman...Strangely enough, an 11th hour rural Daylight car chase (with a strap-grabbing roof-ride ala TEEN WOLF) pales to the Nighttime group of empty souls drinking, smoking pot and otherwise doing and discussing absolutely nothing. As if Quentin Tarantino's meantime vices/hobbies were put on camera but with girls: Along with the usual pop culture references, he's writing what he knows, and in other films is beyond capable of writing females...But in the beginning of part two, a girl talks about how she loves when a dude kisses with ""mushy lips."" Ugh!!! Whether that's a chick thing or not, it's downright banal and embarrassing dialogue, intentional or otherwise...Thankfully, Quentin didn't give that line to movie-stealer Vanessa Ferlito (who reluctantly allowed her own kisses to one of several barroom losers, all the while seeming to harbor an interest/attraction for Rose McGowan's Pam). Arlene aka Butterfly was the one and only girl who really called the shots. Unfortunately, her only mistake was simply going along for the ride.",Death Proof

125,baileycrawly,It's Okay,6,18 March 2020,"On par with Jackie Brown (which is far from my favorite Tarantino film), although this one fares out a little better than Jackie Brown in my book.
Quentin Tarantino makes a loving tribute in this film, but film does not live on tribute alone. It's great that he wanted to showcase his love for different styles of film - and that he executed those tributes successfully - but the plot feels a little too thin to be a truly good Tarantino movie.
Perhaps separate from the Tarantino name and brand it would be okay, but with his name attached to the project I can't help but feel that it's not up to his typical standards, either creatively or narratively. Granted, it's a car chase movie (for all intents and purposes) and there's only so much you can do with that. It has tension where it needs it, and it's entertaining in places. All in all, however, it just wasn't a very memorable film, and certainly not something I would go back to re-watch again anytime soon.",Death Proof
126,Al_The_Strange,It's okay in my book.,7,20 October 2013,"In 2007, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez joined forces to create the Grindhouse film experience: a double feature intended to emulate the thrilling grittiness and distinctive roughness of 1970s exploitation cinema.Tarantino's contribution to the Grindhouse project is Death Proof: a weird combination of car-chase action and serial-killer terror. If nothing else, Death Proof does everything that Tarantino loves doing. It has characters who act really cool, always talking with sharp wit and dirty language. It has wild camera work, including some slick black-and-white shots and shots intentionally damaged to give everything a rough, old-fashioned texture. It has an abundance of oldies rock 'n roll, it has oodles of references to other films (including some references to Tarantino's own Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill). It even has dozens of foot-fetish shots, with barefoot characters strutting around, shoving their feet into the camera. And, of course, there's also plenty of pulpy blood and violence to satisfy.The film has its share of cool parts and sharp dialogue. The last act is most worthwhile for its phenomenal car chase scene. It lasts for a good twenty minutes or so, featuring a pair of great muscle cars, ripping up the roads before ripping each other up. It's all intended to replicate the look, feel, and excitement of old-fashioned car chase films, such as Vanishing Point (which is referenced in the film, and the film even uses the same car).The problem is, however, is that when the film isn't cool, it's totally uncool. In between the big standout scenes, the film drags a lot. A lot of time is spent on the characters hanging out at bars and restaurants, chatting inanely, and often times without progressing the plot all that much. These scenes still have a few standout scenes (such as the saucy lapdance scene), but a lot of it comes off as pointless.The story is also pretty weird and mixed. It's essentially split in half, with some scenes set in the past and some set in the present. It's all intended to focus on the main villain stalking two different sets of victims, and the film takes its (damn) time to set things up for the big car wreck scenes. It also takes its time to dive deeply into the characters. Unfortunately, the pacing takes a huge hit in doing so, and the film overall feels uneven.Fortunately, the film remains cool and slick, with fantastic photography and editing. Scenes set in the past have been scratched-up and damaged on purpose to replicate that old-fashioned 1970s film look, and it is pretty wild that way. Acting is quite appealing from the cast; especially from Kurt Russell, playing the bad guy for a change, and he is strikingly effective as Stuntman Mike. Writing is very sharp and witty, although not always effective. This production uses some very cool and distinctive sets, props, costumes, and cars. Music is really neat too.The film is pure Tarantino, and I can't help but to think that the man must have had too much fun making this picture, because it encompasses all of his signature trademarks. Unfortunately, it's also quite a mixed experience that's not always palatable. Fans should check it out and see what they think, and it's recommended as part of the Grindhouse double-feature experience, but otherwise it's best left as a rental if you're interested.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)",Death Proof

I think Planet Terror was a little better as a whole but Death Proof had better single scenes and a better story.Every time Kurt Russell is on the screen it's good. But the overtly long scenes of girls talking some nonsensical babbling about their sex lives and whatever, that was just annoying and boring. I don't mind talking in movies if it's good dialogue that carries the story but here it felt unnecessary and tiresome. I would have written the talk scenes a lot shorter, and then perhaps get more room for Stuntman Mike (Russell) to stalk more victims. But then it would have been an ordinary serial killer thriller, and that was not Tarantino's point. So we have to settle for what we have here.I know the movie is a homage to 70's camp exploitation movies. But the thing is, I don't like that style. I remember seeing ""Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" on tv a long time ago but I didn't get it and it was annoying. So I guess I'm not in the target audience.The whole Grindhouse thing is like...conceptual art to me.

The 2nd group was good, but the 1st I couldn't wait until they died. But thats how Tarantino wanted it.

Yeah, it did take a little TOO long, but thats not a big deal. The second group were much better.

And that's a good thing that Tarantino makes artful use of. The last time I laughed at a level of carnage this brutal was ""Haute Tension""(A better movie than this one,even if totally unrelated other than being gory).There's a very nice lapdance (with clothes on) scene and lots of footage of muscle cars going full tilt with a continuing worship of the movie ""Vanishing Point"" throughout the script. For these plot elements alone I give it a thumbs up- but you have to be in the right mood for this to hit you right ---think - senseless 70s style movie that is going to be brutal and funny at the same time, but in a sick 70s B-movie kinda way.PLOT: A very rough looking Kurt Russell has a habit of targeting young women for death by vehicle.

Great dialogue as expected but it's the performances that really make it work. On a technical level, editor Sally Menke really embarks on making the grungiest exploitation flick out there providing plenty of reel scratches and clips missing to make you feel as though you're in a dingy smoke filled cinema about to witness something twisted.

Barf.When the film first started, I have to say, I had high hopes. The grainy feel of the film quality, though phony, was a pretty nice touch. The dialog starts out in typical Tarantino fashion. It sounds witty and it moves relatively fast, but soon you find that it's just this: lots of F-bombs from a bunch of dumb broads talking about things that Hollywood losers fantasize about women talking about. And that pretty much sums up the film. Just when you think it's gonna get good...more boring dialog. And the grainy quality of the film disappears and it turns into a typical modern day big Hollywood-style production.This film hardly warrants the above average rating that it has received on here. Kurt Russell (who is absolutely the ONLY thing cool about this movie) starts out as a pretty cool villain, but ends up a cowering pansy at the hands of some girls who, all of the sudden, turn into Kung-Fu masters. It's really sad. At every turn, just when you think this movie might pick up and go, what you get is 15 more minutes of stupid dialog between the women in the film. One of the things I love about other Tarantino films is how he uses music to make the scene more bad ass. The problem with ""Death Proof"" though, is that the scenes are NOT bad ass, and he used music to try to MAKE the scenes more bad ass. When you see it, you'll know what I mean. It's like he abuses it. In short, Tarantino missed HUGE with this one. I guess this was his stab at the car chase action drama. Definitely NOT a horror movie. And the ""Grindhouse"" title??? Well, that's just an insult to a genre that shouldn't be tainted by such a weak, pointless, and ultimately unsatisfying film.2 out of 10, kids.",Death Proof
137,jcbutthead86,An Entertaining Horror/Slasher Film/Car Chase B-movie. Kurt Russell At His Best And Quentin Tarantino At His Worst.,8,11 September 2013,"Death Proof is a very flawed but entertaining Horror Slasher film Car chase film that is filled with wonderful direction,a great cast,a memorable soundtrack,a good script and a exciting car chase. This film is Kurt Russell at his best but Quentin Tarantino at his worst.Death Proof tells the story of Stuntman Mike(Kurt Russell),a former stuntman and stunt car driver who's really a psychopath who is stalking two groups of Women with his car,a car which is 100% Death Proof and can kill anyone in a heartbeat. Now,the two groups of Women have to survive Stuntman Mike and his Death Proof car.Death Proof was the second film of the two Grindhouse Double feature with the other film being Planet Terror and this is a film that I have always had mixed feelings about because while Death Proof is pretty entertaining and interesting it maybe Tarantino's worse film but at the same time there are good things about it. One of the things I like about the Death Proof is the way Quentin Tarantino takes the Horror sub genre of the Slasher Film of the 1980s and combines the genre with the Car chase genre of the 1970s where instead of a psychopath stalking people with a butcher knife the psychopath is stalking his prey with a car and chases after them with cars and tires instead of chasing them on foot. Another I like about DP is the style and look of the film because DP feels like it could've taken place in the 1970s or in a timeless landscape because while the characters dress like they came out of the 1970s the characters have cell phones. The photography in the first half of the film has a scratched and gritty look to it almost like it was filmed on a cheap budget and could've been played at a drive-in. The look of the film adds to the movie and Tarantino knows his B-movies and exploitation films. I like that the film is told in two parts the first part being a Slasher film and the second part being a Car Chase movie making it seem like your watching two different films. The character Stuntman Mike is a great character and villain because he can be charming and cool with his classic haircut with great stories about being a stuntman but as the film goes on he can be scary and menacing using his Death Proof car to hurt and lure his prey. Stuntman Mike isn't a Slasher villain in mask but with slick back hair and gray jacket and is a just a classic invention from Quentin Tarantino. What I like about the film is the car chase towards which is one of the best car chases in movie history and what's great about the car chase scene is that there is no computer generated imagery or special effects but a realistic and intense car chase that is exciting and thrilling. And there is also a car crash that happens in the film and when it happens it's very shocking and disturbing and you will feel the brutality and power of the scene. What I don't like about most of the film is the female characters and the talking. Now,Tarantino has proved that he can write female characters that can be very fascinating and likable(Pulp Fiction,Inglorious Bastards,Kill Bill,Jackie Brown),but in DP the female characters are unlikable so unlikable you will be rooting for Stuntman Mike. The screenplay by Tarantino while good has too much talking and is below Tarantino's best works and at times feels a lot less creative. Thankfully,Tarantino rebounded with two much better films with Inglorious Bastards and Django Unchained which have great screenplays. The ending of Death Proof is fine but makes me angry because I'm such a fan of Kurt Russell and it's hard for to look at the screen at the end. It's a nice ending that could've been handled better. The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Kurt Russell is excellent and at his best as Stuntman Mike,with Russell being cool,charming as well as menacing and intense. First girl group:Vanessa Ferlito is fantastic and sexy as Arlene,a friend of Jungle Julia. Sydney Tamiia Poitier is wonderful as Jungle Julia,a Radio DJ. Jordan Ladd is great as Shanna,Arlene and Jungle Julia's friend. Rose McGowan is terrific as Pam,a woman who goes on a ride with Stuntman Mike. Second girl group:Rosario Dawson is amazing as Abernathy,a make-up artist. Tracie Thomas is fantastic as Kim,a tough talking stunt woman. Zoe Bell is great and funny as Zoe,another stunt woman. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is wonderful as Lee,an actress. Quentin Tarantino(Warren),Eli Roth(Dov),Jonathan Loughran(Jasper),Michael Parks(Earl McGraw),Marley Shelton(Dr. Dakota Block),Michael Bacall(Omar)Omar Doom(Nate)and Monica Staggs(Lanna Frank)give good performances as well.The direction by Quentin Tarantino is great,with Tarantino always moving the camera with slow and quick movements and wonderful angles and visual style. Tarantino does a fantastic job with the car chase scene. Wonderful job,Tarantino.The film has a fantastic soundtrack with songs by Dave Dee,Dozy,Beaky,Mitch & Titch(Hold Tight),The Coasters(Down In Mexico),Pacific Gas & Electric(Stagoolee),Smith(Baby,It's You),Joe Tex(The Love You Save(May Be Your Own),T-Rex(Jeepster),Eddie Floyd(Good Love,Bad Love),Willy DeVille(It's So Easy),Eddie Beram(Riot In Thunder Alley),April March(Chick Habit)and more. Amazing soundtrack.The special make-up effects by K.N.B. are great,effective,bloody and realistic and are well done. wonderful job,K.N.B.In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,Kurt Russell,Horror films,Slasher Films,Car Chase films or genre films in general,I suggest you see Death Proof,an entertaining film that has it's moments and is Kurt Russell at his best but Quentin Tarantino at his worst. Recommended. 7.5/10.",Death Proof
138,x_manicure_x,Great car chases,6,14 August 2021,"""Deathproof"" might deserve its fame as Quentin Tarantino's worst film, but it's not as bad as everyone says. Almost shot as a joke, it was originally part of a double feature with Rodriguez meant to pay homage to old exploitation films. It might be self-indulgent and too verbose to explore such unlikeable characters, but the action scenes are a real pleasure to watch. The problem is that there is literally no plot, and that we are pretty much asked to the same thing repeated twice with different characters and two opposite outcomes. The first part has a more intriguing atmosphere and its own impactful climax, but the second part's ending is possibly Tarantino's most hilarious and, in its own way, cathartic. Stupid as it might seem, it's still pretty unique for a slasher film. Kurt Russell was great as Stuntman Mike to the point of feeling bad for him once he becomes the prey.",Death Proof
139,freakfire-1,"Gene Kelly is also ""Death Proof""",8,9 March 2008,"What a crazy and weird film. Full of fast cars, fast chases, babes, and violence. Certainly a film somebody could be proud of. Or at least the people involved in the project.Focused around a crazy stuntman with no real name, Stuntman Mike is a twisted man with a fetish. He likes sexy women, but likes to see them hurt. And so he hunts down women in the movie, taking a toll on several of them in Texas and Tennesse.There are some wild chases and wild crashes. The ""death proof"" car was a cool thing that was added in the movie. But it came back to haunt him later in the film. Nice effects, some of them cheesy, like in some older films, good action, and a descent enough plot.But Misser Superman no here. ""A-""",Death Proof
140,patches89,I WANTED TO BE IMPRESSIVE AND SCARY TENDS TO IMPRESS!!,8,21 February 2021,"It says alot about the genius of Quentin Tarantino when a film can be a joyous ride and still probably be the weakest film hes had a hand in. I absolutely loved Jurt Russell as Stuntman Mike, he gave off a creepy vibe and ran with it as a guy who stalked 2 sets of women to get off on his dark side, until he bit off more than he could chew. It was reasonably well written but you could tell this was just something QT wanted to make for fun rather than the usual masterclasses. If you're up for just 2 hours of pure fun then this is a perfect friday night movie",Death Proof
141,curtis-8,My Dinner With Andre--with Car Crashes!!,5,6 September 2007,"""Death Proof"" is the talkiest ""action"" flick I've ever seen. In fact, it's really much more of a ""talk"" movie than an ""action"" movie. The problem is that the lengthy conversations, though sometimes amusing on their own, don't add up to anything. Existing only for it's own sake, the dialog in the film doesn't advance plot, theme, character development, or anything else. I like QT's dialog, but maybe he should just write stage plays or something if he wants to explore dialog to this extent again. In a movie with an actual plotand even the simplest action movie or thriller is primarily about the storythe dialog should be the icing on the cake, not the cake itself. Wit is a great addition to a good story and good thrills, and is what often makes a workmanlike actioner into a classic. BUT that wit, that clever dialog, has to advance something or else it can easily become nothing but dead space. I think that if the story and action in Death Proof had been given another working over in the screenplay stage before they started filming, and only the best bits of dialog had been kept, this could easily have been a classic. As it is, it seems like about 20 minutes worth of clips from a movie interspersed with a bunch of behind the scenes footage of the actors bullshitting on the set between takes.",Death Proof
142,ExpendableMan,"Come on now ladies, that was fun!",7,28 January 2008,"Death Proof, the sixth film from Quentin Tarantino, everyone's favourite movie-geek done good is an interesting experience. Originally intended to be part of the 'Grindhouse' project only to be extended and released separately, it's a film that's intentionally designed to be bad. Except it's not, it's really very good. It's the banana-chinned one's homage to 70's road movies and evokes the feel of them exceptionally well while still retaining the director's trademarks; feet, pop culture, strong female characters, witty dialogue packed with one liners and loads of violence. It might not rank with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction but nevertheless, cinema's biggest mouth has again delivered an enjoyable hour and fifty minutes. Plus, it gives Kurt Russell his best role in decades.As Stuntman Mike, Russell practically exudes menace even when he's just sitting in a bar chatting to local girls in a friendly, but effortlessly cool manner. His hairstyle may be old fashioned and his clothing pure redneck trash, but nevertheless you can understand entirely why people would want to hang out with him and even go so far as accepting lifts home. When he finally drops the nice guy shtick and reveals his malicious intentions to a terrified passenger, the film shifts gears from a slow-paced but involving character piece into a brutal slice of auto-mayhem that sees legs being sliced off, heads bashed in, skulls pounded to mush and cars smashed to bits all in the space of a few seconds, Tarantino giving the world what years of government campaigns couldn't; a convincing anti-drink/drive lesson.It's in the second half though that Death Proof really shines as Russell begins stalking a quartet of women working on a movie only for them to turn the tables and go all blaxploitation on him. It's here that Tarantino takes on a pulse-racing car chase that relishes in it's ""no strings, no CGI"" thrills even as it crashes through plot holes the size of a Dodge Challenger's engine. Why don't the police ever show up? Why don't the girls just, you know, stop? Because it's a movie! And people don't obey the laws of common sense here, instead they climb on top of speeding car bonnets and try not to die. Intentional scratches and missing scenes aside the climactic highway duel is the director's most obvious tribute piece to old school exploitation. That and the violently abrupt ending.So why isn't Death Proof worth more than a solid seven stars? Because Tarantino needs a better script editor, anyone other than Tarantino will do. He may have promised us a 200 mph slasher movie in the press releases but Death Proof rarely goes over a steady 55 and there's hardly any slashing to be had. Instead there's talking, masses and masses of talking and for much of the first half, it does feel like we've stumbled in on a group of friends on a night out and are watching them chat endlessly about cars, bar food, lap dances, relationships...anything except high speed slaughter. Plus, a lot of it is delivered in that slow-paced laid-back style where characters repeat a handful of phrases over and over again. Sure they look cool and all, but you'd still like to give them a kick up the backside.That being said, Death Proof is still a solid outing. It's violent, pulpy and quotable fun with a standout acting debut from hard as nails stunt-woman Zoe Bell. It might be somewhat self-satisfied and need a trim here and there, but it's still an icy cool slice of B-movie trash. And even if you've never seen a 70s road movie fret not, most of them get name-checked anyway.",Death Proof
143,Greatornot,This Was a Car Wreck,2,2 December 2008,"What an awful movie. I guess Kurt Russell lost a bet so he had to appear in this Quentin Tarantino movie. There was about 2 minutes of action . It reminded me of watching a baseball game but staring at the hot chicks next to me.. than with the roar of a crowd watched a Home Run. This film was anything but a home run. It was more like taking 3 strikes. Basically it consisted of girl talk. OK I get it Tarantino did not want to make it a typical horror movie. It was a horror movie but not for the reasons Mr. Tarantino wanted. It was horribly boring. I would rather have wanted to have seen how Mike ended up to be so spiteful and so hating of women. At least that would give an insight to the psychology of the guy. Not a big flashback sort of guy in a flick but in this movie it would have been welcome. Obviously , Tarantino was going for a large market, thus no nudity, no foul language and no gore... and I am not talking about Al. Though this movie makes Al Gore the most interesting person in the world. Just an horrendous , unrealistic flick. I mean 'victims' could have just pulled over especially in the last group to get girl off the hood. Save your time and race away from this WRECK asap!",Death Proof
144,Jacques98,Wow. Why all the bad reviews?,8,4 September 2008,"Quentin Tarantino understands grindhouse cinema. Everything about this film is true to the old grindhouse way of film makingI know because I've studied it. As some reviews on here seem to suggest the reason this is getting bad reviews is because it is misunderstood. I disagree. You don't have to be a movie buff to enjoy this movie, at all.The main reason I think people don't like this film is because they find it boring. I'm not going to argue with those people because I could easily see myself hold their opinion if I was in a bad, negative mood when I watched this movie. To say Quentin Tarantino's ability to create interesting dialog is a bit . . . off, or to be blunt, just downright dying out, I also can't disagree. The dialog is a long run from Pulp Fiction, but nowhere near as boring as Robert Rodriguez's dialog in his section of Grindhouse. So, either way, I personally wasn't bored with it, but I can understand why a lot of people are. It is by far his weakest.Also, for an imitation grindhouse film, the level of violence is extremely low. The one scene of blood is pretty graphic, but nothing that couldn't have gotten a PG-13 rating. I was very disappointed with this. There needed to be more blood.However, I'm not going to deny Tarantino's genius of how he did the two segments of girls almost as two different films, each with their own conclusion. I'm also not going to deny the absolutely amazing performance of Stuntman Mike, or the performances of most of the girls. Truly memorable.I do have a problem with the lack of originality: killers who use cars have been done several times that I personally know of, and that is disappointing. But as Tarantino has said on more than one movie, if it isn't original it should be the best of anything that has ever been done, which Death Proof is. The 20-minute car chase is one of the best I've ever seen, if not the best. Stuntman Mike's story unfolds the best I've ever seen from killer movies like this. Tarantino's use of grindhouse effects was purely flawless, and even out-shined Rodriguez's addition.I think this is the better of the two Grindhouse movies, and by far the least boring. I can understand why people would disagree there, however.",Death Proof

Technically this film is good all the way through editing, direction, cinematography etc. The soundtrack is absolute genius and sets the tone perfectly right from the start, as we have come to expect from Quentin Tarantino the dialogue is great and feels real and halarious, the porformences are decent as well, Zoe Bell and Kurt Russell stand out. But where Death proof really shines is during the very climactic and quite frankly perfect car crash/car chase scene's, the practical effects during the first one are really really good and the intensity of the second and final car scene is so great, after a halarious and exciting watch the ending is very satisfying.",Death Proof
147,galileo3,"Tarantino's pulp, scruffy, adrenaline shot of a film",5,3 February 2008,"Death Proof (2007)Part of double feature, separated by fake trailers, Death Proof is the latter of the 'Grindhouse' extravaganza of B-movie excitement (the first one being 'Planet Terror')by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. Unfortunately due to the project being a flop in American cinemas, the two films were split individually for international audiences.Having acquired a taste for the Tarantinian style I was quite eager to watch 'Death Proof', and to be fair I did not expect a masterpiece, so I let go and tried to enjoy the film as much as possible.'Death Proof' is not too bad a film - you have to look at it for what it's for, a film about a crazed stuntman who gets a buzz out of crashing into cars filled with young women.Although this film contains some sick and twisted action and an 18 minute car chase, Tarantino does focus on his irrelevant, often pervasive talk that comes from a solid script (as always) written to entertain, remember after all this is suppose to be a b-movie, based on a low budget having a ridiculous storyline and is ignored by critics.I believe if you stuck with Tarantino up to now, this would be no different to his oddball style and sometimes admirable technique and risk taking to make obscure pictures in an age where all that seems to matter is how many robots or dinosaurs you have in a film and how many hundreds of millions it will gross.If you are one of those people with particular attention (avoiding to use the term film buff) to little details, you will notice references and links to almost every Tarantino film, whether it is a line, camera angle, a fake brand or a name, those little excitements are present.5/10",Death Proof

Kurt Russell merges with his role and never seems out of character. The plot is fantastic - My jaw dropped when the movie *really* began. Don't ruin it for yourself by watching any trailers or by reading spoilers.The only problem is that some dialogues are too pointless for their length. It's nice that the actors didn't forget their text while there's no cut in-between, but that doesn't make the dialogue more interesting.Honestly a cool movie that will stay in my memory for sure.

150,illbebackreviews,How does the director of 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs' end up making this?,4,8 July 2013,"******SPOILERS IN THE REVIEW***** Quentin Tarantino is my all-time favourite film-maker for his brilliant dialogue, his creative stories and his fantastic casting choices which all fuse together to often create a cinematic masterpiece. ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Django Unchained"" hold a spot in my personal top 20 for its incredibly entertaining dialogue, often humorous violence, endearing characters and the brilliant pacing. Going into Death Proof, I knew that this would be my least favourite Tarantino film but what I didn't know was that nothing I loved about Tarantino would be in this film. The film focuses around a stuntman who has a ""death proof"" car that he uses for stunts in films. Going by the name of Stuntman Mike, he comes to the position in which he decides to use this car to chase after drunk and idiotic women and kill them.One of the biggest mistakes made by Tarantino is the idea to kill our supposed protagonists an hour into the film. Unlike in Psycho (1960), in which the second hour picks up from the events of the first, here the story is in almost no way affected by what has happened and we as an audience are forced to take it in. What should've happened was having Zoe Bell and her friends being killed off early in the film and then established our main characters (who we saw in the opening hour of the film) The first hour builds up using various dialogue sequences that unfortunately cannot capture the magic of previous Tarantino scripts. A sequence ensues with our supposed main character and her friends talking to Stuntman Mike but a few minutes later, they are dispatched. This half of the film should've come second, especially seeing how the events of the second half are hardly focused on. Stuntman Mike pops up and chases after another bunch of girls who eventually take him down. The film should've had these group of girls being taken out fairly early in the film, especially seeing how there were roles by Zoe Bell and a few others. This should've been a cameo role in which she and her friends are taken out by Stuntman Mike, who then proceeds to kill another group of girls after meeting them at a restaurant. This would've created a bit more tension seeing how our main character does have any sort of connection to Stuntman Mike. Tarantino's strength has always been his dialogue which is always entertaining. He has created some of my all-time favourite dialogue but here, none of his dialogue is slightly entertaining. In previous films, we are able to follow his dialogue such as when Jules and Vincent are talking about ""royale with cheese"" but here, we are forced to painfully swallow 90 minutes of girls gossiping about sex and boyfriends which is neither humorous nor clever. The group of girls come off as nothing but gossip girls and in that way, doesn't resemble Tarantino's earlier brilliance. The performances itself were very disappointing, especially seeing how Tarantino is able to get the best performances out of his cast such as with Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Christoph Waltz. In fact, the only worthwhile performance is Kurt Russel as Stuntman Mike but the supporting performances are weak. The only positive aspect I could say about the film is the absurd car chase sequences which definitely boost up the overall score of the film. They are long, somewhat funny and surprisingly entertaining. Though some of the most illogical decisions are made, which furiates me, the chase sequences itself were more entertaining than every other aspect of the film combined. The first entertaining scene was about 45 minutes into the film where this girl gets a ride from Mike, who brutally dispatches her. This scene brought the first energetic smile out of me for the whole film. That brought back what Catwoman said in The Dark Knight Rises. ""My mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men!"" As I said something about a possible alteration to the flow of the story earlier, this immediately sums up Tarantino's incredibly poor directing which is simply lazy. When creating Pulp Fiction, Tarantino would've spent much time actively putting together the various story lines so that they indeed combine, to form the one story. In Reservoir Dogs, he actively sought out material to shoot before and after the heist but here, he throws content onto the screen without thinking about it, resulting in a failed product that is Death Proof. Overall, the biggest disappointment of the decade next to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal!",Death Proof
151,mistoppi,An entertaining thriller,9,20 January 2016,"I remember my father showing me a scene from Death Proof years ago. And since the film is made to look like an old movie, I kind of assumed it was at least from the 80's. Later I saw screenshots and started realising that there's no way it's as old as I thought it was. But I love the fact that it looks like that. The slightly grainy shots, how the movie looks like the whole cinematography was done not entirely seriously? All of those make it look like some 80's B-movie, which is definitely a good look for a film.The characters of Death Proof are all very interesting. Firstly, the stuntman Mike. He's really terrifying and creepy, which is exactly why he is the best possible antagonist for the story. Stuntman Mike could be a real person from real life. His background is just made a lot more interesting than it would be in real life.I love all the girls in this film. They are well-written, and there's a lot of them. Both of those are unfortunately rare in films. Tarantino also has written excellent dialogue for the female characters of the film. Tarantino's dialogue is always great and so very real, but seeing that he is capable of writing dialogue between female characters, that isn't exactly alike to men's dialogue, but which isn't the complete opposite either. Those conversations are recognisable - I think I've had several of them in one form or another.The car chase scenes are amazing to watch, and they are very thrilling. Sometimes they just happen to be pretty hard to follow.Death Proof is good thriller. It has interesting plot and even more interesting cast of characters. I just don't know how often I could watch this movie.",Death Proof

Its is a clever blend of Spaeghtti Westerns/exploitation movies of 70's . Its deliberate grainy and worn down affects are what give it that affect along with its funk star and hipster style layout are what make it good . The script is cleverly making references to that era. Kurt Russell is the man who just makes crazy look cool in a car. Unfortuanly unlike most QT movies , the heavy script may sometimes lead to boredom along with the over developed plot line which just drags its heals a lot longer than it should do.

153,daniewhite-1,Dangerous Driving,5,9 March 2020,"Homages to trash, pulp, pop, exploitation cinema of yesteryear is a major occupation of Tarantino, a genuine and sincere devotion to this hinterland seems to characterize his work as completely as any directors filmography has ever been categorized.As such punchy characters, (sometimes distinctively odd or exaggerated.) trash dialogue, grungy aesthetics, pop soundtracks and stylised violence come to the fore.This seems to be the mantra that ""sex sells"" and all that people want is to have fun; at any cost, for as long as they can, and there's nothing as fun as indulgence!! Except extreme indulgence.Explosive, gratuitous practical stunts and effects embellish this effort with aplomb and cheesy relish. Also womens feet make almost as many appearances as tyre chewing rear wheel drive muscle cars. This seems to be more of a particular issue for Tarantino, either a trademark signature visual foreground technique, or the man really liked womens feet.'Death Proof' has plenty of nods to the practical limitations of it's favourite grindhouse movie hinterland: jarring cuts, interludes, degraded film stock, blemishes and badly mixed audio.Over the duration of the film a lot of female bonding over sex and drink and drugs and food, and sex again, sometimes captivates but usually doesn't maintain interest, maybe because it doesn't seem to be linked to any time period, there's no essential period, no real time or place, to the dialogue and it comes across eventually as self-involved and uninteresting if you weren't there hearing it ""first hand"" instead of watching it second hand.I rate a 5/10 and I like as much of the film as I dislike so a half rating seems about equal to me.

Surely its biggest (and only) flaw is that in almost 2 hours, there is simply not much happening besides girl-talk in the not unfamiliar Tarantino style. But there is no poignancy or freshness in the talky and overlong scenes and it simply goes nowhere leaving me thinking ""Get on with it"". Even a few people left in the not too crowded theater where I sat.That said, the movie is incredibly well shot although the deliberate 70s-style editing- and sound flaws came off more silly than was intended.The overall acting was superb and the chase-scenes made up for a lot of the film's yawny moments but simply not enough.

155,mattiasflgrtll6,First Tarantino film I feel missed the mark,6,28 August 2015,"I don't really think it's a terrible movie, as I've seen far worse and I do have SOME positives with it. But he's usually known for movies with diverse, interesting characters, witty dialogue and some very stylistic intense scenes. At the same time, he manages to get the plot (or several plots, as is the case with some of his movies) going. Therefore, you never feel the dialogue is just an excuse to stretch out the time, as it is a way to develop the characters you are following so you can care more about the story.Unfortunately, this was a letdown.So, about the plot... It was paper thin. You might as well say that for the first 45 minutes or so, there wasn't one at all. Only dialogue, and not very good one either. When Stuntman Mike is introduced, there is a (very, very loose) storyline about a psycho who's only joy in life is driving over women with his skull-decorated car. That's not very much, is it?The dialogue is (sadly enough) extremely weak in the first half. Instead of lots of fun different topics about pretty much anything, these women almost only talk about the men they've slept with, make-up and a club one of them is performing at. Are you kidding me? In other Quentin movies, we've had everything from names of fast food products, kung fu films, TV pilots, guns and sometimes even meaningful discussions about humanity and our significance in society. Here, it was pretty much Sex and The City over and over again. In the second half, it's actually kind of better. There is still a very limited amount of topics (Who cares about a stupid beauty magazine????), but there are some wisecracks I laughed to and some decent interactions between characters. However, this is still below what I usually expect from this director. Even when the lines are witty, it never reaches the likes of Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and True Romance for example.The characters... This is probably the biggest problem. There is a serious lack of people you care for or find interesting. The only one out of the women who actually made me laugh more than just a few times was Kim. She may not be the most fascinating character you've ever seen, but she brought comic relief to scenes with otherwise could have fallen flat. All the other women (both from the first and second half, there are two different groups) are shockingly enough forgettable. It's not that they didn't have their moments, but I just can not remember any of their personalities. Thankfully, there luckily IS one character I found great. And that is Stuntman Mike. Almost every single line from him was hilarious and Kurt Russell managed to make a very entertaining and at times even likable, psychopath. In fact, he just about saved the movie for me. Without Mike, I probably would have wound up giving this movie a 4 or a 5. That's how boring it was.Okay, so the movie wasn't all that great, but at least he got the grindhouse feeling right, eh? Yes and no.At first, it did feel like a grindhouse movie, with the cool grainy red cinematography and scratches on the screen. It was like right out of the eighties. But later on, it suddenly went black and white. I thought ""Huh, this is weird but it works I suppose"". Then the black and white was dropped too and we have pretty unimaginative cinematography instead. The grindhouse feel vanished. I don't understand why he didn't keep it the same and switched between 3 styles. It was nothing more than confusing and frankly made me frustrated.The music was pretty good. I always like (or love) the soundtrack in Tarantino's movies.See it if you are a completist and have a desire to see every movie or short a certain director has made. But don't expect too much. This was not a hit.",Death Proof
156,Mr_Censored,Quentin Tarantino Presents: The Adventures of Stuntman Mike,8,8 April 2010,"Quentin Tarantino's half of the ""Grindhouse"" feature film, ""Death Proof,"" finds the director teaming up with 80's action icon Kurt Russell, who plays the mysterious and brutal Stuntman Mike who spends his free-time stalking and mowing down unsuspecting women in his death-proof 1970 Chevy Nova.While Robert Rodriguez's ""Plant Terror"" that precedes it is ultimately more entertaining and action-packed, Tarantino's effort isn't without its merits, either. While the film is, in typical Tarantino fashion, overly heavy on the dialog (the first fifteen minutes alone consist of mindless banter) there are the brilliant moments where it redeems itself. Take for instance, the car crash that occurs half-way through. We get to see this outrageous and gory collision in all its glory, in slow motion and from four different angles. This alone is worth the price of admission, let alone the intense car-chase that fills up most of the third act. This sequence is by far and away one of the most fun and visceral of its kind and in spite of its ridiculous conclusion, packs one Hell of a wallop.Tarantino fans have gotten used to having to endure some self-indulgent dialog to get to the good stuff, and while its not the character piece that ""Jackie Brown"" was or as ground-breaking as ""Pulp Fiction,"" it still earns its rightful place as a Quentin Tarantino classic. Kurt Russell is in top form, the car crash and chase sequences are top-notch and the suspense and atmosphere are in full effect. Sure, a good 20 minutes could have been shaved off the film, but in the end, it will more than hit the spot like a big plate of nachos oozing with cheese.",Death Proof
157,manendra-lodhi,Not a charming story.,6,11 July 2012,"The film is a disappointment for me considering it was from Tarantino. It lacked the most important thing in a film which was a good story. From the starting the film focused too much on the girls and thus the major plot of the film was kept in side. The killer just appears from nowhere every time and kills the people. There was not much focus on the character of the killer, and that was I think the major flaw. I did like the acting of the girls. The stunts were very nice and deserve thumbs up. The storyline was unusual and new being kind of based upon stunt men but it finally finished not more than a physcotic film with some good action sequences. I enjoyed the movie some time but at other times I just felt dejected because of the storyline and considering that it was from Tarantino.""A onetime watch for Tarantino fans.""",Death Proof
158,Ziya90,"A fun ride with a revolutionary narration style, but flawed for presenting the characters",8,28 January 2010,"Many people including some Tarantino fans were disappointed by Tarantino's this work, but other than some flaws, I think it is an enthralling movie experience! Tarantino separates the movie into two parts which was exciting, because it was a revolutionary step as story editing. The first chapter is dark, nasty, dirty, mysterious and intense. The second chapter is colorful, fun, crazy, action packed and a thrill ride and that makes a perfect mixture! I found all the dialogs between the characters interesting and flowing. The time flies by. The lap dance sequence feels too long, but I don't think it is boring. The girls in the first part were like girls pretending to be movie stars and the girls in the second half were bad-ass. There is a tone transition between those two chapters and it feels new and cool. By the way, this is not a chick flick. The main problem here is that while almost all the girls are unlikeable in the movie, the guy who is supposed to be the villain is the star of the movie and he is very cool! Therefore, there is almost no way to root for the girls, but you cannot support the bad guy, because he is evil and sadistic, but also he is like one of those Western anti heroes. Thus, the movie creates a confusion itself. I couldn't decide whether this movie is feminist or a misogynist? The crash scene in the first half was shockingly fantastic, but you just don't care about the female characters like who is gonna die and who is gonna survive? Kurt Russell rocks in this film and he makes his character unforgettable! Another flaw of the movie is that there is no explanation for Stunt Mike's acts. Why does he do that? For revenge? For fun? As for the car chase sequence, Tarantino really delivers! It is not one of the greatest car chases ever maybe, but really a good one. It does not raise the bar, but very exciting and very thrilling!",Death Proof
159,kurciasbezdalas,Typical Quentin Tarantino film,10,8 November 2008,"Many Quentin Tarantino fans were disappointed by this film. Actually I don't understand why. It's a typical Tarantino's film. Like Jackie Brown was an imitation of blaxploitation films, Kill Bill was an imitation of samurai films, this film is an imitation of 70's car chase films. Probably the most known example of these films would be Mad Max, but there were lot's of them, I've seen some on TV channel Movies for Man 2. And yes, it's an imitation not a parody like Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror which was more a parody. The characters of this movie are girls with a very manly characters who hang out with a pretty womanish guys. That's kinda unusual neither in films neither in real life and that's also is very typical for Tarantino films. And of course there is Stuntman Mike a psycho killer, played by Kurt Russell, who was very good in his role. So don't get fulled by bad reviews, this movie is a masterpiece.",Death Proof
160,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Death Proof (2007),7,15 March 2008,"Originally back to back with Planet Terror as a tribute to old drive in double features. Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez made two full length movies and called it Grindhouse. But unfortunately in Australia they released them as two separate DVDs.As a fan of Quentin Tarantino's work in Kill Bill i wanted to see this. So i went down to the video shop and borrowed it. Death Proof had awesome stunts and some smart dialogue but there are some problems.It takes way to long for the story to start. For 45 minutes or so its just a group of girls talking in a bar. Something that makes that even OK is that it had Quentin Tarantino's smart dialogue. Then comes the mysterious Stuntman Mike(Kurt Russell)who targets women and kills them with his 'Death Proof' car. He was a great villain until the ending(you'll know what i am talking about when you see it). There are some more but i will get to the good stuff.The stunts were awesome. Using old school stuff is the way to go instead of stupid CGI. I loved the music. Sounded like songs from the 50's or 60's. I loved the editing. Slow motion that lets us catch the action from every angle. I loved the way they made the film look dated and old. It really feels like you are watching a movie from the 60's or 70's. Some of the good things out shine the bad things.Now i have to say casting Kurt Russell was genius. No one else could have played him except for Russell. He plays Stuntman Mike. Now to the girls. Ladies and Gentleman get ready for the one and only Zoe Bell as herself. She is a stunt woman who has done stunts for Kill Bill and The Kingdom. In this she is herself and comes face to face(or car to car)with our villain Stuntman Mike. All the girls did a wonderful job. I just had to give a mention to Zoe Bell. There are also some cameos in there. We have Quentin Tarantino as Warren. Then we have a cameo from Eli Roth(the guy who made the terrible Hostel). We also have what i call character cameos. We see some characters seen in Kill Bill. We have the trucker who raped a character in Kill Bill. Then we get an appearance from ""son number one"" and his father. It was great to see this guys again.Quentin Tarantino has another success on his name. He done an excellent job. He gives us an great tribute to the old low budget movies and a fun filled thrill ride. Good job.If you want a violent thrill ride then see it. But if you get bored listening to a group of girls talking then i would go see something else. This is a movie to just sit back and watch. But you might find your self on the edge of your seat when we get to the great stunts and car chases.A must for Tarantino and car chase fans. Now i have to see Planet Terror. I hope it is as good as this.7/10",Death Proof
161,pinkliz41,Quentin strikes again!,8,27 January 2008,"Quentin Tarintino is a class director, one that has delivered us a few greats such as Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill and now Death Proof. Unlike the other Grindhouse feature-Planet Terror, which is really quite rubbish. Death Proof offers plenty. From life long quotable lines to the fast, ferocious and undeniably ""legendry"" car action. It's Kurt Russel, who plays a madman known as stuntman Mike who steals the show. With all respects it offers plenty for a Grindhouse product excluding Planet Terror.Quentin, who really had to pull his weight to get a worthy result had to go through hell. The supporting actors/actresses are all very believable and projected in a satisfying manner.

164,blakiepeterson,Subpar Tarantino Is Still Better Than Most,7,18 July 2015,"The idea of making a modern exploitation movie is a novel one — the frowziness of the era's heyday is mockable, but can quasi-specific homage actually work as a feature film? The MADTV Funkenstein and ""Mighty Peking Man""-esque Prehistoric Glamazon Huntresses sketches suggested that periodical skits were good enough; it's easier to turn around and watch ""Switchblade Sisters"" or ""Coffy"" anyway. So it's ballsy to make a new kind of exploitation movie: the 1970s are over, after all, and grindhouse cinemas no longer exist. You've got to have a great deal of intelligence (and filmmaking strength) to pull off such risky reverence.Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino achieved the impossible in 2007, releasing double- feature ""Grindhouse"" worldwide like it was no big deal. Both edited as if they were pieces of sh-t Jack Hill or Russ Meyer spliced together, both cheap looking, both subpar when putting the directors' filmography into perspective, Rodriguez's zombie ridden ""Planet Terror"" provided us with joyous action-horror while Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" voiced a similar spirit to that of ""Vanishing Point"" and ""Two-Lane Backdrop"". Neither film is terrific, but hard to deny is just how successful ""Grindhouse"" is at making, well, a modern exploitation double-feature.""Death Proof"" has always been my favorite of the two, maybe because I've always figured Rodriguez to be Tarantino's less-talented but still-talented brother-from-another-mother or maybe because I have a weakness for exciting car stunts and female characters with the personality of a p-ssed off Tura Satana. Ironic is how ""Planet Terror"" payed homage to the bad and, in the process, seemed bad itself, while ""Death Proof"" went out with the same goal in mind and ended up being a good film — perhaps this is because Tarantino is incapable of making something of pure shoddy quality, or because his screenplays provide nothing except quotable rivers of dialogue.""Death Proof"" involves a psychopathic stunt driver (who goes by the name of Stuntman Mike) who, while not reliving his glory days, cleverly kills women with his car, which has been built specifically to withstand the fatalities of outrageous crashes. For the first half of the film, he sets his sights on radio host Jungle Julia (Sydney Poitier) and her wild pals, who, sooner or later, meet up with him in the worst way possible; the second half finds him stalking stuntwoman Zoë Bell (playing herself) and her posse — a bad decision if their ever was one, considering Bell's belligerence and the ruthlessness of her tough-as-nails friends.Many cite ""Death Proof"" as Tarantino's worst film, and it's understandable, considering the hugely ambitious scopes of his others, the bigger budgets, the more high profile ensembles. ""Death Proof"", cheaply made, girl centric, dialogue driven, straight-forward, hardly has the staying power of ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Inglourious Basterds"" — not because it's average, but because it's low-key, a break from epic exercises in directorial glory. He's having fun, not rewriting history — it's brave for someone as high profile as Tarantino to step down from the high heavens of celluloid fame and make something simple, something most would call an novice's masterpiece. But I shouldn't be calling ""Death Proof"" brave — it's not a stretch, just a gem of small scale values. The nearly all-female assembly is tremendously cast: not a part, with the exception of the inexperienced Bell, does anything besides heighten Tarantino's babes-with-cars vision. The first ensemble, comprised of Poitier, Vanessa Ferlito, and Jordan Ladd, incite big laughs with their low-class values, their unexpected demises hurting because we want to see more of them. The second, however, positively lights up the screen: Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead have remarkably chemistry, with Thoms acting as a fiery, loud-mouthed presence. Russell is persuasive, but the women that eventually avenge his violent attack are what make ""Death Proof"" such an unparalleled treat. The final car chase, which sees Dawson, Thoms, and Bell racing after the madman, is riddled with '70s styled adrenaline: in an age of action aided by CGI, it's a pleasure to see that Tarantino would rather stick to the guns of the past instead of taking the easy way out.Snaky, funny, and bracing, ""Death Proof"" is a minor Tarantino project (the only one, as it turns out) that serves as a reminder as to why Tarantino is such an immortal talent — even when he's taking break from being the best of the best, he's still one of the best.",Death Proof

167,lotus_chief,"An 'L' for Tarantino......no purpose here, not good at all......",3,18 November 2007,"I didn't have the opportunity to watch Grindhouse; and with that said I think it's safe to also say that in Grindhouse, 'Death Proof' was a more concise film. Whereas 'Planet Terror' knew what it was, and got to the point of that and ran with it, 'Death Proof' knows what it is but then wanders everywhere possible.I'm a big fan of Tarantino, his quirky visual eye and usually engaging dialogue. They do tend to be long-winded at times, but in every other case I've seen the dialogue help move characters and plot along. Sure, in about every case, it has NOTHING to do with anything and is just a random conversation that we as the audience just happens to drop in on; and that's the beauty of QT's technique. There's a certain genius in that, it helps you identify with the characters more. To this day I remember the 'tipping waitresses' debate from Reservoir Dogs, and the 'listen vs. wait to talk' banter in Pulp Fiction.... in the past QT had these conversations in there seem totally random, but they were a very creative and ingenious way (I feel) of moving things along. This is NOT the case in Death Proof. Nothing, I repeat......NOTHING happens for the first hour of the film. All we get is endless rambling from the women about a host of meaningless things....two of these instances spliced by only 10 minutes of actual interaction with the character in which the film is based on. In Stuntman Mike's first 'cameo', he's as menacing as anything and puts his mark on the movie; leaving you hyped up for what's to come in the last half of the film. But Stuntman Mike pulls a disappearing act until the last 10 minutes of the film, when the menacing, evil bad guy is reduced to a whiny little b!tch when he faces a little resistance. The little hope I was holding onto in regards to the film being redeemed was drained at that point. I wasn't looking for an explanation for why Stuntman Mike was doing what he was doing. Didn't really care when the second group of females left their friend with a total stranger to test drive a vintage muscle car. Wasn't at all mad at the abrupt 'The End' at the end....got that just fine. The gratuitous gore in what little action actually took place was expected. Loved the grainy film, and error-abundant continuity and edits. It's a homage to B-movies, I got all of that. The LEAST QT could have done was make this an actual MOVIE instead of 2 hours of the audience being a ""fly on the wall"" to pointless dialogue! Throw a LITTLE plot and action in there to get things going! This is the first time I'm saying this about a Tarantino film, but the overlooooong dialogue was complete torture. The central crash scene was great; the ""four POV technique"" was classic. But where this film could've REALLY taken off it sits....no, rather it LAYS down for another 50 minutes and merely stirs for the last 10. 'Death Proof' was a HUGE disappointment, and the first real 'L' for Tarantino since 'Dusk Till Dawn' IMO. In the end its a pointless film that I had to see, as it was one half of the Grindhouse feature. Rodriguez' 'Planet Terror' is FAR superior to this mess.3/10 (1 for Rose McGowan's death, 1 for the music/lapdance, and 1 for the 4 angle car crash)",Death Proof
168,Spaceygirl,B-Grade Fun,7,18 July 2008,"Okay, so its schlock, but then Tarantino told us it would be! Complete with 70's style opening montage and credits, 'Death Proof' is an homage to a seventies horror flick. The script is awesome, the dialogue vintage Tarantino, with sly references to 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Kill Bill'. The acting is good, Kurt Russell has such fun in his role as a villain that at times you actually find yourself rooting for him! Rose McGowan and Rosario Dawson are predictably good but its Sydney Poitier and Zoe Bell that steal the show. Zoe Bell is an instinctive actress and injects her role with enthusiasm. Sydney Poitier is absolutely luminous and flaunts her beautiful curves and gorgeous curls with every opportunity she gets. She ignites the screen in every scene she's in and its impossible to tear your eyes off her. Unfortunately she comes to a sticky end in one of the most graphic and gruesome car wrecks ever seen on screen. The only drawback to the film is that it gets bogged down in dialogue and Tarantino tries to be too clever-clever, but having said that, it doesn't skimp on the gore either, so if you're at all squeamish, I advise you to give it a miss s.",Death Proof
169,vailsy,finally liked this movie after my 3rd viewing!!,8,30 September 2007,"I really didn't enjoy this movie initially and thought the dialogue was dull, the jump-edits were pretentious and distracting and that the film references were below par but then i decided to watch it a third time, this time with my wife, expecting her to hate it. she loved it. afterwards she explained that she enjoyed seeing men get beaten up. badly!?When looked at from a female perspective, there is actually a lot to like about this film. the dull dialogue becomes funny because you can see that Tarantino wanted to make it deliberately girly and rambling, and he plays with this further by contrasting it with similar macho scenes in reservoir dogs etc. the way they take for ever to decide how, and who will test drive the car is also funny. and men are generally treated like b^tches throughout! i do take my hat off to zoe bell, who does ridiculously well with the screen time she is giventhe first crew of gals are all mouth and no trousers. they act tough but when it comes to the crunch, they are whimpering sissies. the next crew initially seem more prude and square but actually turn out to be hard as nails. the movie is more or less divided up into these two halves I stand by my initial view point in saying that Kurt Russell is the best thing about this movie. The lines he delivers throughout are just right on the button and highly amusing at times, esp 'you're gonna have to start getting scared, immediately!', 'suck on this for awhile' and 'get ready to fly, b^tch!'. i also love the part where Kurt looks at the camera. Yes i did feel sore when he became the b*tch at the end, but you can't have it all I paid more attention to the soundtrack on this 3rd viewing, and some of the subtleties like Stuntman Mike's creaky beat up car at the end were very funny. I also liked the 'dopplered' cow moo'sOne thing of note is that I watched the film with subtitles this time, and that seemed to make a lot of difference to the enjoyability. I notice that a lot of international viewers liked the film and wonder if it transfers better to a subtitled format?Part of me still wants to see Tarantino make a good serious movie though, a seriously good car chase, a seriously good western.

172,kevin_crighton,"Sadly, Tarantino has lost it",2,21 September 2007,"When Quinten Tarantino first burst onto the scene with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction he was heralded as some kind of genius. With the Kill Bill movies, his stock dipped slightly as it was all style and little substance. With Death Proof, I'm afraid any respect I had for him as a film maker has gone.The plot, about a stunt driver who kills girls with his car, isn't the problem. What is the problem however, is the way he's written and directed it.I'm not familiar with the whole Grindhouse concept. All I know about it has come from articles and interviews that are tied in with what should have been the full Tarantino/Rodregiuz Grindhouse movie. However when it bombed at the box office in the US, someone somewhere made the decision to split the Grindhouse movie into 2 separate movies. Personally I feel this is ripping off the movie fans by making them pay twice for a movie that was made as part of a double bill, not as single movies.Putting that to one side and getting back to Death Proof, I understand the reasoning for bad editing, scratches on the prints, colour turning to b&w at one point. I've no problem there. HOWEVER, where I do have a problem with the movie is in the script.The opening part of the movie involving the girls in the bar, frankly goes on far too long, and as for the lap-dance sequence...well... words fail me. The whole idea of it in the movie is ridiculous and serves absolutely no purpose except to slowing down an already too long scene.As for the second part of the film, when another group of girls get into the sights of Stuntman Mike, there is a scene where one of the girls is left behind to 'pleasure' the owner of a car they want to go for a drive in. With the lap dance scene and this scene, I feel Tarantino has showing us that the grown-up side to his work, best showing in 'JACKIE BROWN', as in fact a one-off. With the above scenes, he's actually making a teenager's wet dream.As with all his movies, there are a lot of movie references in the script. However even these defeat the purpose. By putting them in, he's telling the audience 'hey look at all these cool movie things I know' BUT, I may not know much about Grindhouse movies, but I bet they were never full of movie references.The performances are all pretty good, with Kurt Russell walking away with the movie as Stuntman Mike. He's clearly enjoying himself. All the female cast have to look sexy all the way through, which they do, but the script doesn't really give them much to work with, just continual movie references through-out, and this does not make a movie script.The action at the movie's climax is done pretty well, with 2 cars tearing up the road and smashing into each other. It is the highlight of the movie.Tarantino, who as I said can do growing-up stuff like JACKIE BROWN, needs to grow-up as a film-maker. I hope with this out now he can finally get back to making more adult movies. He has the skill. Maybe he needs a little inspiration. I hope he finds it.",Death Proof

The only thing 70's here is Stuntman Mike's(Kurt Russel)car. The story is really nothing. It's pretty much a bunch of really annoying chicks chat and chat about nothing for an eternity and then chat some more. Stuntman Mike finally shows up and his character is hardly looked upon. Russel is awesome here and has a great way of becoming charming to chilling in a matter of seconds.Stuntman Mike wants to kill people. For reasons unknown. The kill sequences are pretty cool and is the best scene in the entire movie for more reasons than one. The women here are so boring that I found myself quenched with blood lust and was rooting for Stuntman Mike. Stuntman Mike is easily one of the most cool villains ever, or in this case, a hero.Death Proof wastes more of our time with another set of even more unlikeable chicks with more inane chit-chat. These ones were so bad that they left one of there own to the hands of a drooling lunatic to satisfy their selfish desires. I hated that and wanted Mike to waste them too. This second half of Death Proof was weak. Seeing Mike chase down the unlikeable chicks and taunt them was entertaining, but the revenge chase was unspectacular in epic proportions. I hated seeing the one awesome Stuntman Mike become a whiny little bitch in a split second and the ending was atrocious. The Last Word: A Tarantino ego trip. This was dedicated to himself. Russel should have gotten A lot more screen time and to see him finally play the bad guy would have been a treat, but he is almost nonexistent here. Russel aside, I hated this movie. Despite the many stunts, Death Proof wipes out. This is on my sh*t list. One of 2007's worst. The only way I would ever see this again is if I was forced to do so at gunpoint.",Death Proof

176,film_riot,Death Proof,6,19 December 2007,"So many filmmakers want to make stylish movies. Many of them end up making the one thousandth copy of ""The Matrix"" and that is really going on my nerves. To get to ""Death Proof"" now, if you can be sure about one thing in a movie directed by Quentin Tarantino, it's that it almost always is cooler than the rest of them. I'm talking about style here, because the rest of ""Death Proof"" couldn't convince me. I liked the first four girls, their dialogue was much sharper than from the second quartet. I also think that Kurt Russell was staged pretty well as this motor-psycho. But in the end, the film suffered from a lack of real characters, real dramaturgy. I mean I get it, Tarantino likes his references, but you can't make a movie built on that single column. Maybe there's a group of people who totally ""get"" this film, I'm not part of it. Evidence 1: I couldn't stop wondering during the big car chase, why the girl driving didn't just use the brakes.",Death Proof

I guess I'll always be one of those who cannot grab the greatness of his mastery, because I constantly grow bored through the films I've seen. (sorry!)
I was intrigued by the academic analysis I've read about the grindhouse backdrop and overall visual style of the movie and was very interested in the scratches, unmotivated black and white, missing scenes and overall feeling of making us think we're in the 70s, watching a trash movie in a dirty grindhouse cinema!I understand that Tarantino made fun of a whole era and genre of B-Movie racing films and that this is more a parody than a serious film.Touché to this.Problem here is my personal taste, I guess, because after all, I'd never watch a exploitation film like this nor would be delighted of a parody, even though I intellectually know that it is a good one. And Tarantino is not my favorite, I guess, as well. ... I will always be bored by the long dialogues and slow scenes (I know he writes good dialogue, but it bores me nontheless) and the really overdone violence (I know this is a homage to exploitation cinema, but still...). In this film I especially could not deal well with the stupid racing scenes, the all-day-long dialogues of women trying to get into bed with men and well... a crazy main character who is just out to kill people. Hm.I know this is his style and loved for it, but me... - I'll be the one in the back of the cinema, knowing this is a master, but getting up anyway half through the movie to eat some popcorn outside in the hall and studying other movie posters until my friends finished the movie inside and come out for a burger afterwards.

179,chandean-69762,Death Proof 2007 Review,5,4 February 2021,"I guess i'm really in the opposition here. I really didn't find this film interesting at all until the very very end.Most of the film is talking .. but it just feels like nonsense and doesn't really matter in the long run. Sure character building is good, but this felt totally pointless. It feels like Tarantino just wanted to bang two cars together more than do anything else that he quite literally mastered in his past films like having a compelling story with great and memorable characters.
It's not really a bad film, it just feels pointless and for this being a Tarantino film it's extremely disappointing.(I watched this film solo - with no knowledge of the Grindhouse cut.)",Death Proof
180,Thorsten-Krings,Has its moments,6,1 August 2007,"Okay, I quite liked the idea of producing a homage to 70s/80s sleazy b movies. That part is executed well, some parts of the film have that genuine feel about and it's also okay that he doesn't keep it up throughout the film as it is a modern film. The film has its moments but all in all I thought that a lot of the film was about girls sitting together giggling. That takes up a disproportionate amount of time. Although well filmed, structururally it distracts too much from the main plot. So I'd say all in all the film is moderately entertaining and has its moments. I do have a problem with the way Tarrantino treats violence as a leisure activity. It's all not very serious but depicted realisticaly so I found that disturbing. Tarrantino quotes a lot of films but does so in a very obvious way. He could have done this in a more clever way. Particularly since some of the films he refers to like Vanishing Point are not grindhouse b movies.",Death Proof

182,schroederagustavo,"Not Tarantino's best, but very good",8,18 July 2021,"Death Proof has all of the Tarantino things that you would expect and come to love, but they're not Tarantino things at their best. The type of characters, the style of conversations that the characters have, the direction, it all feels very Tarantino, but it feels like a Tarantino that is trying harder to recreate a genre and pay homage to movie that he clearly loves instead of actually attempting to create something truly original and unique.I will say the car chases in the film are outstanding and the ending is awesome. I think the last, maybe 20 minutes are the strongest parts of the movie. There are parts where the dialogue really does reach Tarantino heights, but it's only for moments at a time, never for a full scene. I wasn't captivated by the humor or characters as much as I would have liked, although they are interesting. The stunts are amazing, too, and I loved that Tarantino chose Zoe Bell, who was the stuntwoman for Uma Thurman in Kill to be one of the main characters of the second half of the movie, at least. It's good. Also, I think the second half is much more interesting than the first.I don't want to make it seem like I'm hating too much on this movie, because I REALLY liked it. But Tarantino is one of my favorite directors and I'm just calling out that this is not his best or strongest film. But it's still very good and very much worth watching.",Death Proof
183,teh_mode,"It's a bit of a mess, but like all car crashes, you can't help but stare at it.",7,14 October 2007,"Clunky editing, grainy filming, laughable stories, ultra-violence and exploitation in the guise of feminism and blacksploitation. Not the most appealing of conventions when it comes to the modern cinema audience. Perhaps this explains, to a certain extent, why the old drive-in formula of watching back-to-back trashy hardcore exploitation films was lost on American audiences. Grindhouse took a paltry $4.2 million on its opening weekend and has thus far failed to make back even half the double movie's budget. This despite most critics who went to see it having nothing but praise for Tarantino and chums. But apparently only seeing the numbers, Quentin and co-director Robert Rodriguez decided it would be best to split their respective stories apart, and release them as two movies in the UK, flying in the face of Grindhouse logic.The first of these films, is Death Proof, Quentin Tarantino's homage to the likes of producer Roger Corman's Deathrace 2000 and director Jack Hill's Switchblade Sisters (1975), with Kurt Russell's Stuntman Mike having an unhealthy obsession with crashing into cars driven by young ladies. An appropriately stupid premise tailor-made for a grindhouse market. Why then does the film seem so incidental when attempting to recreate the vibe of a Corman-style trash fest? The long and short answer is that this isn't really a grindhouse film. It is a Tarantino film with the ghosts of so many bad old movies hovering over it. Yes you get the grainy film footage, and the purposefully poor editing that raise the chuckles they crave. But that quickly fades away, and Tarantino very quickly moves into familiarly talkative territory akin to hit men talking about European hamburgers or bank robbers musing about the veracity of Madonna's hit single ""Like A Virgin"". Although this is not entirely a bad thing, it is not inherently valid for this type of material. Tarantino can't help but overload his scenes with meaningless meandering, almost as if he has reached the point of aimless directorial swaggery. One scene, for instance, involves one of the girls buying a magazine at a gas station. A simple interaction that goes on forever it would seem, failing to tell us anything about the characters or indeed the plot. At least Pulp Fiction had meaning behind the mundanity of its own inhabitants. I did often wonder if much of this was down to Tarantino having to bulk up his film after splitting it from Planet Terror. It has the veneer of a movie in desperate need of a good editor, much in the same way that Kill Bill vol. 2 needed a good spit shine. And then we have the actual car scenes. Well barring the ultra-violent central car crash that splits the film's two female groups, and the climactic car chase (expertly executed) Death Proof is nothing more than a girls gone hiking film. Again, blame the editing, for an awful lot of this movie creates a hugely diverting story of girls pontificating the kind of popular interests that only Tarantino would make them do, such as a love for the film Vanishing Point or Dave, Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Titch. Is it stylish? Absolutely. No Tarantino film could ever bore you aesthetically, or indeed talk you to death with insipid dialogue. Even if it is uneven and ponderous, listening to these characters waffle on about nothing in particular is still executed smoothly and embodies that Tarantino air of coolness. Maybe the inevitable release of Grandhouse as a whole will win over my heart more. It's a bit of a mess, but like all car crashes, you can't help but stare at it.",Death Proof
184,RCWjr,Blah BlahBlah Blah Blah Action Blah Blah Blah Blah Wimp out,7,10 June 2008,"The title of this review pretty much sums up my thoughts on Death Proof. Billed with Rodriquez's ""Plantet Terror"" in theaters, Tarantino totally misses the point of these exploitation films. He gives us literally pages of irrelevant dialog between two sets of women, all that lead to a confrontation with Stunt Man Mike. The first half of the film is actually decent, Kurt Russell eats up the screen. The ladies are no slouch, but know this, the film is Kurt Russell's. Unfortunately, Tarantino sabotages his lead actor with a total wimp out final act.Save for the first act, Tarantino abandon's the worn look that Grindhouse film's are known for, and gives us a VERY clean slate to watch and that alone took me out of the moment. True, if you were lucky and your town got these movies first, you saw a clean film. But everything about this film rings of a polished film. An attempt to throw a bit of b/w in the 2nd act comes off as too calculated. Even when the film does experience issues, they are too contrived to be believable. Rodriquez stuck with a nasty print in his film and the imperfections come off as more plausible. Music is plentiful throughout, as is all Tarantino's films. Yet the music is the same stuff we have heard before in his other films, so it looses that sense of exploitation that Rodriquez's nailed so much better. What is even more unforgiving than the abandoning of the Grindhouse concept, is Tarantino removing the balls from Stuntman Mike in the final act and reducing him to a sniffling wimp. This nullifies the victory the girls have over Mike. It would have been a lot more satisfying to see the girls take Mike down at the top of his game. Instead we have Mike receive a gunshot to the shoulder and totally looses his balls.The first 2 acts of the film do a great job of setting up Mike and Russell chews the scenery up. We can forgive the inane and pointless banter of the girls because we have a lead character that is scary as hell. However, the movie continues with all the blah blah to the point that there is very little time left so instead of an ultimate showdown between evil and bad ass girls, we get the cop out that Tarantino decided to go with. Too bad, I normally enjoy Tarantino's banter coupled with angles and action, but here, he totally forgets the whole point of the Grindhouse experience and talks us to death and delivers nothing.",Death Proof
185,bannonanthony,"'Get ready to fly, b****!'",8,5 November 2007,"I was disappointed to hear of how poorly the GRINDHOUSE project fared in the USA, because the premise of it sounded great to me. What especially had me excited was the prospect of this sequence of the film, directed by Quentin Tarantino. A car chase/smash movie with Kurt Russell playing a psycho stuntman? That's a hell of a good premise for a movie in my book.But in a way, I'm glad that GRINDHOUSE was split in two for its' DVD release, as that way we get to see some footage that was cut from the GRINDHOUSE versions of PLANET TERROR and DEATH PROOF. And even though I do look forward to getting the Region 1 copy of PLANET TERROR, I am glad to say I finally saw DEATH PROOF on R1 DVD, and it, the film that attracted me to the GRINDHOUSE project in the first place did not let me down. Granted there are a lot of 'talky' bits before the action actually gets underway, but I'm willing to forgive that because of the quality of the acting, writing and directing.Kurt Russell is excellent as the psycho Stuntman Mike. When first seen in the movie, he does look like a harmless good old boy from a Hal Needham film (as one guy says about him, he looks like he got his scar over his eye from climbing out of a time machine). Sydney Poitier, Rose McGowan and Tarantino himself in a cameo as a bartender are very good, but Russell oozes with his usual charisma. He jokes with the first group of his victims about being a stunt double on obscure shows, which, of course, Tarantino would know about. But very quickly, things turn nasty and there's a whole bunch of corpses piling up.There's a nice cameo by the father and son Texas Rangers from KILL BILL VOL. 1 where the father, although knowing that Mike is a killer, can't prove it because of the precautions Mike took (Mike stayed sober while his victims were both drunk driving and stoned). But then, when Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms and Zoe Bell come into the picture, Mike may just have met his match.Most people will no doubt know by now that Zoe Bell was Uma Thurman's stunt double in the KILL BILL movies. But for a stunt-woman, especially considering she's basically playing herself, she is a great actress and I hope we can expect great things from her. Dawson is as good as ever. As for Thoms, this is the first film I've seen her in, but she is brilliant, completing the trio who stand up to the stunt psycho.The final car chase is handled brilliantly, especially since no CGI was involved. Like in the days of Hal Needham movies, all the car stunts were done for real. The choice of cars was excellent too, with three great examples of American muscle being used: Stuntman Mike's two cars are a Chevy Nova and a Dodge Charger and the girls use a Dodge Challenger, just like the one from VANISHING POINT as the girls point out.At the end of the day, DEATH PROOF proved to be as good as I thought it would be. Two thumbs up from me!",Death Proof
186,elcopy,Tarrantino has become a parody of himself,1,9 December 2007,"While Rodriguez managed to capture the ridiculous campy nature of 70s and 80s B movies, Tarrantino showed how rusty he's become, and he's starting to look like a one-trick pony. The good moments in Death Proof are too few and far between and it's ruined by filler dialog overkill. This movie, more than any before, shows Tarrantino's biggest directing flaw: All characters sound the same. Instead of dialog the whole thing sounds like a big, self-indulgent Tarrantino monologue interpreted by several people. Maybe 15 years ago his characters calling each other ""bitch"" and ""nigga"" constantly was breakthrough, now, it looks recycled and overdone.Critics who praised this film over Planet Terror clearly didn't get it. B movies are not about acting, or quality, or even a coherent plot, the only sin of a B movie is being boring, and Death Proof is boring and practically unwatchable. Now I understand why producers wouldn't let Tarrantino direct Casino Royale.",Death Proof
187,joshi_3592,The best of the two grind house films.,8,29 June 2010,"Personally I didn't like the other Grindhouse feature ""Planet Terror"" it tried to look like a bad cheesy 80's film, and that's what it did, it was bad and cheesy. This movie however, while having some minor flaws, succeeded in reproducing the old 70's 80's cinema feel and still being good. It has that grainy look that old reel films had, but again is watchable, unlike ""Planet Terror"" which looked like it was gonna burn up every second. It's a simple story, some nut played by Kurt Russel, like to kill young girls with his car. It's a stunt car and is what he calls ""Death Proof"", not for the people he crashes into, the one sitting in the drivers seat, which is himself. A simple story, executed in true Tarantino style. It has long, realistic, but not boring (well depends on the person) conversation, harsh reality, lots of swearing, and well developed characters. My only problem with this film, aside from some long and slightly dreary sequences, is the violence. I normally son't complain about violence, sine I feel it is both depicts the real world, and is often need to make a realistic movie. But I sometimes feel that Tarantinos need for vi9olence sometimes gets in the way of his artistic abilities. Sometimes it's just there to be ""cool"". it's not supposed to be ""cool"", it's there for the realism and the effect it has on an audience. I hate to complain, but sometimes it can be just dumb.It's a simple and entertaining film. A must see for any Quentin Tarantino fan, heck even Kurt Russel fans. And it was definitely the best grind house film. I give it a 8/10.",Death Proof
188,Vincent_B,Slightly below average for QT,6,25 September 2007,"I rented the DVD version and my review is based on that not the theatrical release. This movie starts out with a built in grainy look of an old film of the 1970's but all the cars are 1990's or newer with the exception of Deathproof (late 70's Nova). It continues to confuse eras with old movie posters in a bar scene mixed with one of the girls doing text message on a cell phone. I felt like screaming at QT ""Stick with one era!"". Later the movie flips to black and white during a store scene, which I understand he did in Kill Bill Vol. 1 but that was for a battle sequence. It failed to make any impression here and when he flips back out to color we lose the grainy rough look the film began with. Now the plot was really too simplistic, not one surprise like his other films. There was plot holes, anyone actually listening to dialog loses interest because they just could care less about the characters and how they interact to each other. Over all Deathproof is worth a look but considering who made it, I expected better.",Death Proof
189,blazesnakes9,Very well made by Quentin Tarantino.,7,10 July 2011,"Quentin Tarantino, the director behind the masterpiece Pulp Fiction brings you an film that that have a lot of action and suspense at an greater speed. Death Proof is an thrilling roller-coaster of suspense and action. Kurt Russell plays Stuntman Mike, an daredevil that stalks women in Austin, Texas. His latest victims he meet are in a bar. He, then takes an woman on an ride in his ""death proof"" car. The car is an very good feature because Tarantino uses an muscle car in this film to create an grind house muscle car movie. Soon then, Mike takes the woman on an dangerous ride down the street. While the woman is yelling for Mike to stop the car, Mike gives an fairly response saying , ""Hey, Pam, remember when I said this car was death proof? Well, that wasn't a lie. This car is 100% death proof. Only to get the benefit of it, honey, you REALLY need to be sitting in my seat."" After that response, he slams the brakes, killing the woman in the car. Afther that, he sets to finish his other victims by speeding toward them, sort of in the way of Chicken style. Those victims are dead after an gruesome death for the female victims in the car. Tarantino does an very good job doing the car chases because they don't involve CGI or visual effects, just like the way they are used to be made. I enjoyed his screenplay because again the characters are great for this film and the look of it is very good for an Grindhouse film. I certainly enjoy Death Proof. ★★★ 3 stars.",Death Proof
190,jamhorner,An Action Packed Roller Coaster Thrill Ride,8,5 January 2008,"Death Proof is a very interesting film and an unusual film by QT. It is, despite the previews, one giant car chase. But as far as car chases go, it's very, very full throttle, so to speak. The story follows Stunt Man Mike; a stunt man turned serial killer who stalks a group of women, who soon take matters in their own hand. What makes this movie awesome is the whole ""turn of table"" storyline; the killer becomes the victim. I enjoyed the performances in this film; the excellent high-octane car stunts and the fact that It still keeps it QT touch to it. And the storyline, I love the storyline; brutal and action packed, yet very simplistic. I enjoyed this film despite what some people thought of it compared to Planet Terror. Still, it's a notable addition to the Grindhouse feature.So lets kick the tires and light the fires, the plot line is very QT for many reasons. Mainly because it starts off as any QT movie does: with some sort of variation of nightlife, heck, during some of the dialogue they make mention to Big Kahuna Burger, where we all know from Pulp Fiction. On the subject of dialogue, this brings me to another great point, the long-winded dialogue in accompanied with sweeping camera motions and a hint of foreshadowing in it. There is also numerous mentions to Big Brute Cereal and Red Apple Cigarettes. But what QT feature is not complete without the twist of fates? This movie does have a great table turn, however, the whole car chase thing itself is a twist of fate. QT is not known for high amounts of heart pounding action, but when he dished out this movie, he surprised me.The performances in this movie were pretty great. I enjoyed Kurt Russell, who is so believable as a psychotic stunt driver-turned-murder, but even more believable as a killer who is on the run from vengeful women, whom he tried to kill. The scene that I am talking about is when women take a bat to his car. I enjoyed Zoë Bell and her great performance for being on the hood and top of a speeding car for most of the movie. She has some guts, and I really appreciate that. I enjoyed Rosario Dawson and Vanessa Ferlito who both did a great job of going ape after being nearly killed. I really enjoyed that. Secondhand characters like Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rose McGowan and Jonathan Loughran who all did a great job providing supporting roles. Don't get me wrong, they are not Oscar worthy, but they will still great nonetheless.Now, for what makes this movie all the worth watching, the action. This movie is practically every iconic car chase all put into one huge movie with added twist of having someone tied to hood of the car. There are so many great high octane and ""edge of your seat"" chases, some great car stunts as well as one horrible, up-close car related death. I'm very thrilled to see Zoe Bell do her own stunts and for the others, I'm also glad to see them contributing to the adventurous nature of this film. Russell, himself, brings this movie to high action expectations that it demands. The car action was just so, intense and you really get the adrenaline going every time something happens or a car flips. Even the car's themselves have personality that reflect of their driver, black for the bad guy and white for the good girls.Overall, it was a very great and well-done Grindhouse feature, however, compared to Planet Terror, it was a bit more action and adventure and did not incorporate the randomness and humorous side that Planet Terror captured. Don't get me wrong, I loved Death Proof and I think it's just another great action movie by QT. It's a great roller coaster ride than any adventurous personality would love. I would strongly recommend this film to horror fans because it's genre is very bifurcated. It's a horror because it involves a psychopathic stunt man who kills beautiful girls and it's very violent, but it's also an action because practically the whole movie is stunt scene. If you enjoy horror and action, this is a movie for you. Also if you are a fan of QT and really understand his world, then this is also a great movie for you. I enjoyed it, and at times I was standing up. I would see this movie again and again, because I enjoy QT action flicks.",Death Proof

192,ihrtfilms,Sometimes there's a risk of Tarantino overload...,4,6 July 2010,"This is one of two parts that make up the Grindhouse double feature, the other being Planet Terror, which I'm yet to see. That is directed by Robert Rodriguez and Death Proof is by Mr Tarantino and it wreaks of him.The films premise is about a psycho stuntman stalking hot women. The first half ends badly for a groups of four woman and in the second half the women get their own back and things end badly for the stuntman. The film is meant to be a homage to the 'grindhouse' movies and because of this the film has an 'aged' look to it, scratches and lines appear across the screen, scenes jump and cut suddenly and whilst this for some might be clever I found it annoying, it looked like cheap effects and clearly the actual film was modern. The two parts of the film where also broken up with a long segment of black and white before the second half had a more bright colour effect and less aging, all of which just seemed pointless and all over the place. Trying to be clever and not succeeding.The films plot is pretty thin and there is a lot of talk, as there often is in Tarantino film's except, despite the claim on the DVD box that the film is full of quotes, the conversations where pretty forgettable. The woman are all very good in this and are perhaps the highlight: I was quite gutted the first four met a nasty end as they were worthy of more screen time. And the stunt woman Zoe Ball seemed out of place with her strong antipodean accent. Of course as with any other Tarantino outing the film is laced with various film references throughout, people talking about films, film posters in the back ground, cars driving through a sign for 'Scary Movie 4' (suggesting that the film is worth driving a car through- er it's a car wreck? Or am I going in too deep?!). But there is little to really enjoy, the car chase scenes for instance are okay but far from the best I've seen. The film is worth a look, but if only for some girl power, but little else.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",Death Proof

Death proof is a more mature movie with a better plot that pay more attention to the dialogs with a couple of great action sequences. instead planet terror focus more in the special effects and many action parts which I found entertaining but not much intelligent.The plot of Death Proof, which has two parts, is about a man (Stuntman Mike) who likes to stalk sexy women while they are traveling in the highway crushing their cars with his death proof car. I liked the performances of the characters of Jungle Julia (in the first part)and the stunt women (in the second part). And of course the performance of Kurt Russell who was great like Stuntman Mike.

195,ukproject,Ah the 'Homage'. Where would Tarantino be without it?,1,14 August 2012,"I for one have been a great admirer of Quentin Tarantino. You have to appreciate his ability to copy and paste the artistry of 'B' movies, classics, Asian movies, kung-fu movies and the like, package them as 'Homages', and then sell them to gullible movie going morons who can't read subtitles or watch anything made before 1980.Death Proof however seems to be a lazy effort even by Tarantino standards. The witty one-liners and flashy dialogues are near absent. It appears as though Tarantino has aimed this movie at insecure women who need to see heroines kick and punch their way to equality, and dirty old men who get their rocks off watching women kick and punch their way to equality.Come to think of it, this formula seems to be prevalent in a lot of Tarantinos recent releases so maybe once again he has got his fanboy target market spot on.Had this movie not had Tarantinos name associated with it, it would probably be languishing in the worst rated movie section and if you've always suspected that Quentin Tarantino is a one trick pony, Death Proof will confirm your suspicions along with the fact that he has beaten that pony to death.",Death Proof
196,polysicsarebest,When discussing the worst films ever made...,1,27 August 2008,"...this is the one that most of my friends seem to agree is the absolute worst.This film is truly, utterly, amazingly awful in every way. I have a deep love and appreciation for grindhouse films, and I, uh, appreciate what Tarantino was trying to do here: Make a mainstream tribute to unmainstream films. The problem is, Tarantino crafted something worse than even the most awful sludge that grindhouse cinema ever churned out.Where to start? No characters are likable. There's literally 40 minutes of patience-testing conversation that goes nowhere and leads to nothing. I don't mind lots of dialog at all, but when the dialog ranges from, ""Man, that guy is cute"" to ""Man, I need some weed"" ... I mean, really now, who wants to hear this stuff?! There's no violence, except for some punching at the end and one car accident. There's no humor. There's nothing smart or charming about this movie. There's nothing interesting whatsoever happening in ANY scene in the movie! There's nothing to like about this film -- I can't stress this enough! Basically, this film is watching 3 people you hate having boring conversations for 40 minutes... then, just when you think it's over (because of about 5 minutes of scenes of a car wreck and a hospital visit), 3 MORE people sit around and have boring conversations for another half an hour about nothing. Then, just when you think something's going to happen, a girl rides on a car for 20 minutes. She just rides on the front of a car. Then, the girls punch a guy. The end. That's the entire film... does that really sound appealing to anyone? So, to sum things up, here's a film that isn't dramatic, isn't funny, isn't fun, isn't likable from any angle, ironic or not. The ultimate anti-film. You WILL be disappointed. And I say this as a huge fan of b-movies and a mild fan of Tarantino.",Death Proof

I never heard of Death Proof until about three months ago and I finally sat down to watch it. It has been said by Tarantino himself to be ""his worst movie ever made"" and sure, it is, but I couldn't help but enjoy it. It had everything it needed. Pointless dialogue, interesting characters, and mindless violence. It had major flaws that hurt the movie terribly but I can say this movie is a guilty pleasure. In typical Tarantino fashion there are some far-fetched characters. The four girls in the opening scene were enjoyable and a little cliché, but ii was invested in their conversation. Was it Pulp Fiction conversations about cheeseburgers? No, but it was girl talk and that was still enjoyable. They talk about their sex life and how to deal with guys. They are young and ruthless driving down the road cheering at billboards. They also talk about the weekend ahead where they will be at a lake house with no guys allowed. These characters would have been interesting if it wasn't for Kurt Russell. Now, I'm not a huge fan of Kurt Russell, but he was a badass in this movie. His first shot made him look like a complete boss. His name is Stuntman Mike for crying out loud. He offers to give a young girl a ride home at the end of the night. The four girls form the opening scene was there and their paths cross. The entire bar sequence with the four ladies and Stuntman Mike was very entertaining. The bet between the women, Stuntman Mike's backstory, and of course, the lap dance. The lap dance was hot. The girl is a very attractive woman and watching her be all over Kurt Russell, shaking her butt, and being sexy was OK with me. The bar sequence gave enough time to get into the main characters and care about their outcome. What happened after that was where the movie does a complete 180.The four ladies leave and Stuntman Mike drives off with the young girl. This isn't really a spoiler but he kills her. Its early in the movie and we need to know that so I can say why the movie goes down, get over it. Stuntman Mike is really a crazy driver who gets off in killing people in a car accident. He hunts down these women and the scene where he drives headfirst was beyond entertaining. To make it even better, we saw it four times. The scene had amazing special effects and made me jump out of my seat and laugh but for the story I hated it. The problem with this is simply that Tarantino killed almost everybody. The four ladies that took up a solid 40 minutes of character development were gone. I was thinking Stuntman Mike would have followed them up to the cabin and be one of those movies but no. One girl gets launched from the windshield, one girl gets a tire to the face, awesome, and another girl gets her leg ripped off from the accident. The sequence was gory and an action orgasm but it didn't make sense. The entire beginning was pointless and it showed how sadistic Mike was. That could have been shown in a much faster fashion.After this we get introduced to a whole different group of girls. The four of them are very similar to the others, they talk about very similar things, and are basically a photocopy. These characters I did not care about. I had no interest in their conversations and wanted them to die. One of them gets dropped off at some guys house and is never seen again. Naturally Mike catches up with them and tries to run them down as well. The car chases and action were great but I didn't care. The story was bland and boring and the new characters were lazy. I loved every second of the car chases and action. The scene with the girl on the front hood with Mike chasing them was fantastic. It didn't look real or believable whatsoever but I put aside my reality complex and enjoyed it. I'm not sure what Tarantino wanted from this movie but he swung and missed. He hit a few runners in scoring position but when it counted he couldn't score. Nobody is perfect and even though he is one of my favorite directors, he missed. I sat through Four Rooms just to see his section and his section made it completely worth it. This movie wasn't like that. This movie was a mess that ended in a car wreck. Overall, I have no regrets watching or buying Death Proof. I got it because I love Tarantino and as this was not my favorite of his, I can't say I hated it. I watched it, enjoyed the action, while I thought it lacked in characters and direction. Is this a good movie, not really, but it is one I mostly enjoyed. If you say you hated this movie, I totally get it, but I liked it enough to give it a WillyT Recommendation. It's a solid car chase action movie and if you watch it looking for that you will agree with me in saying this movie isn't that great but it is a guilty pleasure. Like Van Hellsing.",Death Proof
200,legendaryunderdog,Wow! Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike...whoa!,10,5 May 2008,"Quentin Taratino is a freakin' genius my friends! I love this guy! I'am such a fan of the old school slasher movies ala Grindhouse style and Tarantino did a fine job trying his hardest to create a visual homage to the days way back when. The cinematography was excellent! The acting was awesome (cheesy and mundane but thats what makes this movie so great!) Kurt Russell was absolutely fabulous as Stuntman Mike, his character was bad as hell. I just cannot believe that this movie finally happened, someone actually created a movie to look, feel and sound like the actual grind-house flicks of back in the day, what an awesome job!!!! I cannot say enough of how great this movie was done by Tarantino, everybody and anybody from all walks of life should watch this movie for the sheer feel of 'Traditional Grindhouse Heritage'. The chase scene towards the end with the Dodge Charger Versus the Dodge Challenger was awesome, I recommend this movie to everybody who is alive and breathing, I don't care if you are seventy five years old and don't normally watch this type of stuff. WATCH IT!!!!!! 10/10 stars. Awesome Awesome Awesome!!!!!!!!",Death Proof
201,robinski34,Damp Proof,4,28 June 2014,"Out of the trap, Death Proof is unmistakable QT dialogue all the way, zippier and hotter than a Zippo lighter. At the end of the day, the film seems to be about little other than fast cars, fast-mouthed women, and the demise of both. It's an assault on all the senses, the big five and also some of the others, like decency, taste, right/wrong. The use of texting is interesting as an incidental , possibly the most effective use in movies to date of one of the most prevalent forms of modern communication. In summary, there are some clever and innovative moments, however those with a weak constitution will probably feel as brutalised as some of the characters. Almost impossible to rate, but against QT's other work it has to be 'Disappointing'.",Death Proof
202,SimonHeide,Kurt Russel shows that he can really act in this drawn-out Tarantino movie.,6,10 December 2007,"This movie is filled with typical Tarantino dialog. Girls chatting on endlessly about girls things. Around midway in the movie I clocked a dialogue between three girls that lasted around 20 minutes. Gosh that was boring (only thing that made it watchable was Kurt Russel lurking around somewhere in the background). I cant figure out why anybody except teenage girls would like to watch this - maybe except for the boys who has a secret wish to know what it really is that girls are talking about when they are together with their friends.Russel makes the movie a worthwhile experience as he performs really well as a total psycho on four wheels. I guess I never thought of him as a good actor because he is always type casted to play the classical hero (although he did play some quite funny roles in his younger days ""big trouble in little China"" for instance).If you are really fond of Tarantinos movies this is a must see, but if you have grown tired of the dialog that, although it can be quite witty and funny, brings the movie nowhere, then think twice b4 watching it.Regards SimonPs.

204,I_Love_Spielberg,What a cool action film!,9,22 June 2009,"The first review I did for ""Death Proof"" was through my review for ""Grindhouse."" If you read that, you would already know that I thought ""Death Proof"" was amazing. Not meaning to sound arrogant or pretentious here, but it is the truth. Anyway, the first review I did where I reviewed the movies separately was for ""Planet Terror."" Now, on to ""Death Proof."" ""Death Proof"" is the final installment of the ""Grindhouse"" movie about a misogynistic sociopath named Stuntman Mike who kills women not with a machete or gun, but with his car. But when he runs into a bad-ass group of women, that's where he's really in for it. This is a really cool movie! I mean, it's a little long-winded, but that's sort of how Quentin Tarantino is...he loves dialog, which is great. Plus, the ending is amazing! It goes on my list of great endings to movies along with ""The Sting."" It's really hard for me to believe that so many people disliked it. But hey, what are you gonna do?Like ""Planet Terror,"" ""Death Proof"" has great DVD extras. Plus, there's one where one of the girls sings, which is amazing. Please rent it or just buy it if you want. It's really cool!",Death Proof
205,ALauff,Spare the Stuntman,5,1 April 2014,"There's always been a thin line between Quentin Tarantino's maniacal zeal for pop culture and his ability to integrate those enthusiasms into a worthwhile narrative; sorry to say, here he's succumbed to exclusionary self-indulgence. I found the mirroring roles of two quartets of female friends interesting, as well as the implications of Stuntman Mike's sexual desire channeled into vehicular, head-on ramming. But with the overwhelming amount of time devoted to stilted chatter, character development is a secondary consideration. Unfortunate, too, since there's so much fertile ground left uncultivated by the director-writer-DP, who has conceived his characters as sounding boards to his obsessions, which include many interminable dialogues about Vanishing Point, Dirty Mary Crazy Larry, and ""the original"" Gone in 60 Seconds, as well as alluring women literally costumed in obscure filmic references. The actresses, with the possible exceptions of Vanessa Ferlito and Rosario Dawson, are clearly adrift in this shapeless world and compensate with unbelievably annoying line readings. What remains, or has been added, from its Grindhouse provenance is a tedious cataloguing of QT's faves in unmotivated pursuit of a story. The point might be to get lost in a low-budget, drive-in aesthetic, but the clever frame-skipping, variable sound, and scratched print of the (far better) first half is largely missing from the last hour, which statically records banter before clumsily transitioning into the much-ballyhooed chase finale. This is a stylistically uneven and selfishly insular movie.But then there is Kurt Russell, direct and authoritative as Stuntman Mike, cutting through the BS and articulating an honest, intricate, even sympathetic portrayal of criminal compulsion and masculine confusion in roughly thirty minutes of verbal screen time. Easily the best thing about Death Proof, he wrests a great performance from the director's pervasive self-attention.",Death Proof
206,moimoichan6,"Faster, Stuntman ! Kill ! Kill !",6,19 July 2007,"I know the kind of cinema that Tarantino deals with refuses and stands against all kind of hierarchisation and classification between ""true movies"" and other popular projects, but I can't help thinking that ""Inglorius Bastards"" will indeed be Tarantino's fifth movie (after ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"", Jackie Brown"" and ""Kill Bill"") and that something like this ""Grindhouse"" project is only a sort of bonus in his flawless filmography, such as his episodes of ""CSI"", ""ER"", or his participations in movies like ""Sin City"" or ""Four Rooms"". Of course, some might say that ""Death Proof"" is a real movie because it has been released in theaters. But if the film is sold independently, it was never intended to been seen like that in theaters, but only as a feature of the ""Grindhouse"" movie. And this long version of the Tarantino's participation really ruins the impact of the movie.""Death Proof"", beautifully filmed (Tarantino is still a genius and creates, even here, unseen forms) doesn't really tells the story of a diabolical man with the most dangerous car, but the ones of the victims of the vicious bastard : gorgeous and superficial women, with Russ Meyer's heroins bodies, and R-Rated vocabulary. Everything that pleased the ""Kill Bill"" spectator is here : post-modern references, ultimate car chasing scene (after the ultimate sword fighting scene at the end of ""Volume 1""), and even auto-references (two characters and a song of ""Kill Bill"" are lost in the movie, will you be able to find them ?). But the problem is that the all thing lasts almost two hours, whereas the original project shall not exceeds 80 minutes. And you painfully fells the difference.The first scenes of the movie, with the everlasting talks in the car, are for instance endlessly prolonged in order to make a real long feature. The same goes with the bar scene : you kept wondering when Kurt Russell will rise and kill the superficial bitches. I'm not being vulgar here, unable to enjoy Tarantino's dialogs and ""mise-en-scene"", but blood is what you expect from a ""Grindhouse"" movie, and that's what you got in the short version. The lack of structure and coherence really hurts the spectator here, that has the right to fell bored by a movie that never really gives him what he wants, because it's neither completely a Tarantino movie, nor really a popular car-slasher movie. Thanks to the Weinstein brothers, what could have been a fun ride into popular culture with Tarantino and Rodriguez has been transformed into the worst Tarantino's movie.",Death Proof

Everything that can be said about this despicable film has already been written. The truth is that I just hate it that much. I couldn't resist putting my two cents in.I rather enjoyed Planet Terror. It got me pumped up for the second feature. Now I know why it was pretty much given away for free and saved for last. It was pungent garbage from start to finish and not the good kind.Those horrible girls and their vomit inducing coffee talk made me want to walk into the picture and strangle them, especially the disc jockey. She was probably the most obnoxious female character the silver screen has ever puked up.When Kurt Russel walked in, I thought things might pick up and they did for about five seconds, then we meet the second group of horrible girls that squawk for another hour about that horrible movie Vanishing Point, which sucked. I wanted them to die too, so bad I could taste it even though I knew they wouldn't.The director, I dare not mention his name for fear of spontaneous orgasm on the part of his brainwashed followers, owes his non brain dead viewers a much deserved apology.",Death Proof

211,misbegotten,Dull,3,28 September 2008,"While I enjoyed Death Proof, I've got no particular wish to ever see it again.It's got Tarantino's usual high-quality naturalist dialogue, good performances by a mostly female cast (it's official - I'm in love with Mary Elizabeth Winstead), most of the opening scenes are shot and styled using Seventies techniques, and the legend that is Kurt Russell adds another memorable character to his CV.But for the majority of it's nearly-two-hours running time, it's also very, very dull.Incidentally, I've heard a theory that with Death Proof, Tarantino is referencing an industry practice that often took place on the grindhouse and drive-in film circuits back in the Seventies. Apparently if a movie had one or more sequels, distributors would sometimes edit together footage from a couple of the films, slap a new title on the result, and release it into cinemas in the hope of tricking punters that it was a new movie. This is said to be the reason why the opening titles of Death Proof briefly display the title Quentin Tarantino's 'Thunderbolt' for a couple of frames, before the Death Proof title card (in a completely different font and background) appears.If true, this explains why the film is basically split down the middle, with two locations and two sets of characters, with Stuntman Mike - the villain of the imaginary series - being the only link. The idea is that we watching two separate movies that have been pasted together. It could be argued that Death Proof is one big obscure in-joke.",Death Proof
212,lee_a_scott,"A poor tribute? Actually, just a poor film.",4,26 March 2008,"Death Proofor How QT Fell so in Love with His Own Ideas that he Forgot to Make a Good Film. I'll be honest, for all that I've never really believed Tarantino's hype, I never expected to be bored by one of his efforts, but this is basically rubbish. If you want to see a homage to rubbish done in an entertaining way, seek out Garth Marenghi's Dark Places. If you want to see a lazy, indulgent, meandering, misguided, tedious example of what being too rich and famous can lead to (disguised as a homage to rubbish) then watch Death Proof. Quick summary to save you the effort, though: first hour  five minutes of character setting dragged out painfully for 60 minutes; next half hour  more of the same; last twenty minutes  a reasonably cool car chase. The end. Wow, how attractive does that sound? The patented QT dialogue now just sounds forced and unreal, and all the 'grindhouse' bits (random black and white, scratchy stuff on screen, etc) is a tiresome and inconsequential gimmick. Judging a film on a trailer can be rash, but Planet Terror looks to have nailed the idea that Quentin and Robert hatched together, whilst Death Proof would probably have looked poor next to a cheap-ass 70s car chase film.

Love the 70's look it gives. (Love everything about the 70's). Even though this is his only credit, but love that Mr. Tarantino was his own cinematographer. Did a wonderful job as that too. I wish that the first group of girls didn't get killed. I'm still like ""why...WHY stuntman mike?!. Arlene (""butterfly"") gave you a lap dance and this is how you thank her?!?!"" That's the part im conflicted about. Anyway, my most favorite parts of the movie are the car stunts and chase. Its one of the most greatest car chases ever!!! Along with gone in 60 seconds (1974 one, not that Angelina jolie BS), Bullitt, French connection, blues brothers... Anyway y'all get the idea. Real deal, original and unpredictable.

214,Sanou_san,Another Fresh innovation of Quentin!,10,30 August 2008,"Quentin Tarantino had certainly proved himself a rising best entity in wildly innovated movie genre. It was a blow for me watching Death Proof, though the hostile, nostalgic, and unlikely atmosphere of the opening seems uninviting, but I knew that if it comes to Quentin you expect surprises instead of a load of thwarted crap mess.Death Proof is a movie about this retarded-psychotic-stuntman-maniac naming himself Stuntman Mike, who seems to be normally conversing with other people, hopping in a bar, telling experiences and sharing views, but the danger for a being, especially a girl, waits when she intends to submit with his sugar-coated voluptuous style of luring a victim. Need to consider for that are his anomalous tendencies leading to perverse fetishes and absurd fantasies. Most of his victims are beautiful girls who are hot, flirty and nasty in their own ways. Stuntman mike uses his charismatic luring techniques to bait his victims; he uses his car to accomplish his unimaginable fetish. In the movie you will feel terrible for the first four victims on how unlucky were they in falling to his shut in, but the real excitement starts at the second batch. The next four victims had entirely flipped the situation upside-down, and progresses throughout as chasing the maniac out for sweet revenge.The story isn't tedious, it is absolutely not! You bet that those hefty, extended dialogues of characters seems to be a crap but it's not! The magnitude of the story line depicts the typical mood for girls gimmicking out with their fellows, and it just suits the mood of the story then suddenly out of the blue a diabolical maniac monster came to ambush the characters. Compare with other Quentin Tarantino's crime, thriller and suspense action films, like Grindhouse, Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs Death Proof will indeed be a must-see and an additive in your Quentin-list-collection. Watch it you'll never regret it! It just derserve the best 10 rating for me.",Death Proof
215,Red_Flag,The Grindhouse opens its doors to Tarentino exercise in car crash cinema,8,26 April 2008,"It's a crying shame UK audiences didn't get the full Grindhouse experience. And all because of the Americans intolerance towards it. Fair enough if you're not into this kind of stuff it's hard to sit through a film devoted to talking and car crashes but look under the bonnet and you'll find a world of possibilities.The Characters of these 8 seemingly unlinked women brought together by one diabolical man played by the absolutely terrifying Kurt Russell. But even he can't provide as much character as these two groups of four women. The first the lesser interesting of them who are fortunately given less screen time than the other four. Though Sydney Tamiia Poitier provides much entertainment as a feisty girl looking for a good time. It's the second group is far more entertaining including an oddly good performance from Uma Thurman's stunt double of Kill Bill Zoe Bell cast ironically as playing herself in the movie. Rosario Dawson's subtle turn from concerned ""play it safe chick"" to bad ass who in the end has the final laugh. As for Russell not much can be said about his massively entertaining performance only that he will most likely be haunting your dreams for long after what with him being absolutely bloody terrifying.As for plot there isn't much to it. A simple guy kill girl film reminiscent of the 70's Grindhouse flicks. But in no way does its film underestimate women what with a massive Massive role reversal 17 minutes before the end in which there is one of the most dazzling car chases in history. In witch our heroines get their chance at revenge upon the psycho killer with deadly consequence. Director Quentin Tarentino doesn't skip on the foreplay with most of the film being clogged with female chit chat and one interestingly choreographed lap dance.Another thing director Tarentino didn't skip on it the authenticity. This could honestly be shown at a Grindhouse what with the humours title change at the beginning. The title ""Thunderbolt"" flashes on screen only to be replaced by a Grey added on reel correcting it. Or the jumpy tracking in with the voices sometimes doesn't go with the actors mouths. Truth be told this is a brilliant exploitation flick.Though one thing that dulls down ""Death Proofs"" appeal is the horrible Tarentino cameo that is utterly cringe worthy. Not nearly half as cringe worthy as when he appeared in the second half of Grindhouse Robert Rodriguez ""Planet Terror"" when he appeared as the comical ""Rapist 1"" there is nothing comical about his acting abilities however. Or the fact that even when he transformed into that horrible beast his performance was still vile. The best thing on offer in Death Proof is its soundtrack and usage of music. Dave, Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich blaring away at group ones final stand. And April March ""Chick Habit"" at the final stand of group two. Though the music moment that stands out the most is The Coasters ""Down in Mexico"" during the lap dance sequence. Brilliant.",Death Proof

217,azeemnavarro,A misunderstood gem,9,31 July 2019,"People tend to say this is the worst QT film, and I really don't get why.
They say that the dialogue is very inconsecuencial, boring and stupid; that the characters are highly unlikable, that the filmmaking is bad...What I would say to them, it's that they clearly didn't get what the movie is about.
Death Proof tries to be an homage to 60's and 70's slasher, explotation, and muscle car films. And suceeds wonderful.
The poor and damaged quality editing gives us a feel that we are seeing a B-movie, while in reality it's a 30 million dollars one. The amount on effort putt on the look of the film it's outstanding.
While I agree that in some parts the dialogue and characters are irritating, that's the point of it. In a slasher movie you don't care about anyone because the characters are stupid in purpose, you are only waiting for the villain to kill them. And what's better if your villlain is Kurt Russell? The man gives one of (in my opinion) his best performances, playing this misogynist and sadistic killer that hunts sexy young women. And contrary to what people say, I think most of our female leads are good. Yeah, in the first half the characters are unlikable, but as I say, it has to be that way, for that amazing kill scene to be satisfactory. The girl out of that bunch that's actually good is Butterfly, Vanessa Ferlito gives a memorable perfomance, and that lapdance scene is truly stunning.
What you have to know is that this film has two totally different halfs, the first is a slasher and explotation film, and the second one is a muscle car. And in the second half the pacing suffers a little bit. Is slower, but if you stay watching, you will be rewarded by an amazing action piece. The ending is extremely ironic, and has to be one of my favorite endings from Tarantino.
Overall, if you love 70's b-movies, and you want to have a fun watch, Death Proof is for you. But if you expect something cerebral, don't watch because this film is not trying to be that.",Death Proof
218,Magenta_Bob,Death Proof,8,24 November 2012,"In Tarantino's 2007 homage to grindhouse movies, he trades intricate plot points for a straightforward slasher concept of sorts, in which a stuntman is trying to kill off women with his death proof vehicle.Death Proof might be Tarantino's stylistically most accomplished film. In it, he practices a sort of self-mutilating filmmaking by physically scratching the film, deliberately removing parts of scenes, and having one segment where the colors disappear, to achieve a grainy, lo-fi look. There are also occasions of the sound skipping, thereby cutting away parts of the dialogue. I can see a risk of overdoing it, but my only complaint is that the film is not even more ragged, as it really enhances the B-movie experience. That being said, visual flaws notwithstanding, there is a certain craft to Death Proof that prevents it from ever feeling like an actual B movie, but it is an excellent exercise in style. Adding to the style is also a terrific soundtrack with songs by T. Rex, The Coasters (player during the sexiest lap dance scene I have seen , and one of the best shot scenes in the film) and Dave, Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich, to name a few, as well as a great theme by Jack Nitzschze.In Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike, Tarantino has found almost the perfect antagonist. There are allusions to his impotency, and allegedly a scene of Mike masturbating was removed, but really, no motivation is needed; this is just a guy who enjoys ramming chicks with his death proof car. The first times I watched the film, I disliked that he was defeated at the end. It does not bother me so much anymore, and kind of makes sense since he is up against other stuntpeople. I do, however, object to Stuntman Mike being reduced to a crying weakling, as what I loved about him in the first half was his badassness.For people who are acquainted with Tarantino's works from before, lots will be familiar in Death Proof; it is talky, it is referential and self-referential. For an example of all at once, see the lengthy cafeteria scene where the camera is rotating around the table like in Reservoir Dogs, while the women discuss movies like Vanishing Point and Gone in 60 Seconds. The dialogue is, by the way, another thing that has improved with repeated viewings, and I now find most of it highly entertaining.However, if the dialogue is entertaining as usual, the key takeaway with Death Proof is the unusually great car scenes. From the shocking first murder of Pam, through the explicit, repeated car crash of the first group of girls, to the fantastic ""ship's mast"" car chase finale, this is Tarantino getting to play with cars and pay tribute to his favorite car movies. Watching Death Proof, I am having as much fun as he was.",Death Proof
219,RecoWilliams,If only I was Death Proof then I could take all of that talking!,5,2 November 2007,"Okay guys, I waited until this one came on DVD, i did not want to sit through a 3 hour movie. So now that Death Proof came out on it's on, I was more than excited.So with my microwave popcorn in hand I started to view this movie. I remember thinking several times through this, when are people going to die. I remember QT talking about it being a throw back 70's slasher films. So as the movie dragged on and the girls talked, and talked, and talked. And hold just wait, there was something else, even more talking. When the action finally came it really came. But I must say I don't think I enjoyed the action in the way QT would have wanted me to. I was just happy that all of those blasted girls died and i didn't have hear talking about going to the lake house one more time.I was so excited to see them die, I rewound the movie to see it again and again. I felt a false sense of glory doing that. Then I thought to my self, how glad I was for not going to see this one at the movie, because I would've been so upset to not to see those girls die again.Then the movie skips 14 months and introduces a new set of girls. Guess what they do? No, I'll wait take a guess............. They Talk and talk, but at least these girls talk about cars and stuff so it was kinda worth listening to. 35+ more minutes of talking and then comes action.The last 10 minutes was my favorite of the entire movie. It was an amazing chase scene. And I mean amazing! QT did a great job with that. But the script, the story, and the acting was all subpar. I expected more out of QT. This would have made a great short film if they would have cut out 70% of the dialog focused on the slasher character and then just kill some people already.It's funny that in the DVD extras QT talks about whether or not he has reached his ceiling as a director. So Mr. Quention One Question: Does your head hurt, because you hit the ceiling hard! Can't wait until you do a better movie, but this one is juice box worthy. That means (It sucks).""The movie critic who stills pays for the price of admission"" I give this movie a 5 out of ten, it would've gotten lower, but you that chase scene was a amazing, but not enough to save this bad B movie.",Death Proof
220,jeroen-106,Tarantino failed this time,3,19 August 2007,"* Spoilers *First of all, I liked all previous Tarantino movies (except his part in Four Rooms). I think Tarantino really failed to deliver this time.The dialogues are not funny and really don't add anything to the story. It's just some girl talk which was very boring to watch. It felt like it went on and on and on, and it really made me NOT to sympathise with the characters in any way.First Tarantino introduces some chicks. The introduction is very long (yada-yada in a bar, including a bad performance of Mr. Tarantino himself) and afterwards they all get killed by Mr. Russell (great performance!). It helped introducing the bad guy as a complex character.But then we have to sit through ANOTHER introduction of four chicks, this time a very boring introduction. What's the deal with the lengthy scene at the convienence store? And when they are eating? It lasts forever! So boring! Weak dialogue! And what's with the switch to black&white effect, the cut off parts? It's a modern movie with some ""Final Cut Pro video effects""...not a Grind House movie, so stop making it look like one!In the end we get what we hoped for. A good car chase with some great stunts. The ending was annoying.Some people may say: ""it's the unique Tarantino style!""...I say: ""its annoying and he tries to be cool but fails"".Now Mr. Tarantino, get back to your old skool work. I miss it. I know you can do it!",Death Proof
221,powerfull_jedi,Who knew a movie about girls who talk about absolutely nothing and a stalker would be so much fun?,9,9 August 2007,"I've seen a couple of Quentin Tarantino movies, the Kill Bill movies were pretty cool and so was Pulp Fiction. Death Proof puts together a simple plot, adds in a 70's style stalker movie(but with high-tech cellphones) and voilá, one of the best movies I've seen all summer long. Simple plot is an understatement, Death Proof is a story of a couple of girls, the kind you'd typically find in slasher movies, all sexy, mostly college girls or radio jockeys who just party all night long, and for the first 10 minutes of the movie, you're thinking... Is there a point to this? That's when you cue a stalker, aka Stuntman Mike, who keeps a close watch on all of those girls. Stuntman Mike is played by none other then Kurt Rusell, who's an apparently friendly, roughed, scar-bearing local stuntman who has done stunt work to shows and movies nobody heard off. He drives a stunt car which he claims is ""death-proof"", but has sinister intentions, no less. And just like that what could've been a simple teen movie, turns out to be so much fun to watch, even the endless drivel sprouted by the leading ladies is good enough to keep you interested(some lines are just laugh out loud hysterical). The simple story is divided in 2 parts and that's all I'm going to say. Just watch it. Kurt Russell plays his part so well as the stalker, you feel temped to both be afraid of him as well as cheer for him. Quentin Tarantino's small role is also pretty much to watch and even Hostel's own Eli Roth has a brief role in this film. Throw in a couple of cool songs and an old-school appearance and you got yourself a movie that somehow manages to combine comedy, thriller and gritty horror. Not for kids, though. Definitely worth the ticket price.",Death Proof
222,dj_xand325,Tarantino + B-Movie Style = Weak Story but Amazing Script,6,22 September 2007,"""Hey, Pam, remember when I said this car was death proof? Well, that wasn't a lie. This car is 100% death proof. Only to get the benefit of it, honey, you REALLY need to be sitting in my seat."" Tarantino does it again with another Cool and entertaining film. This of course derived from the America Only film ""Grindhouse"". Grindhouse is a homage to old Grindhouse cinema in which two films are played back to back.Tarantino loved this when he was younger so he decided to make his own B-movie styled Grindhouse movie with best friend Robert Rodriguez. This of course is 'Death Proof'.Its about a stuntman who has a fetish of stalking girls and murdering them using his so called death proof car. He stalks 2 sets of girls. One set, low life lap dancers and the other set, Travellers who want to enjoy themselves.The build up to this film is mostly typical and cool Tarantino script. You have to be a big Tarantino fan to enjoy these sorts of scenes because some people find them boring. However, i am a fan of all of his movies so i enjoyed it a lot and found it quite funny at times. The rest of the film is mostly car chase action that anyone would find edge of seat entertaining.Throughout the film there are constant homages to old style cinema such as the ""Film roll destroyed"" feature used in the middle of the film, and the beginning of the film with the ""Feature Presentation"" opening which QT also uses in the beginning of Kill Bill: Volume 1. Also the theme of a B-movie style is apparent throughout the film.There are also references to some of other QT's films such as Pulp Fiction. With the mentioning of foot massages and one of the girls telling another girl not to blaspheme similarly to the way Jules does to Vincent. In my opinion, Kim is just a female version of Jules in Pulp Fiction.Also QT brings back the traditional trunk shot which is in all his films except for Kill Bill: Volume 2.In conclusion, this is a film with a weak story but a stunning script. This is also a very entertaining movie. However, if your not a Tarantino fan (as if to not like his other films) i can almost guarantee you wont like this.",Death Proof
223,cartesianthought,Tarantino's underrated work,7,20 December 2015,"Releasing it as the 2nd of a double feature was a poor marketing decision too. Death Proof differs from his other films in that it's very light on action, although there is an electrifying car chase in the last 20 minutes which is one of his best set pieces. Also, the main characters are women and bulk of the movie consists of their pieces of witty, funny and inane commentary (mostly the inane part). Sometimes it's annoying, and other times its genuinely entertaining.Kurt Russell does a great job in playing the mass murdering villain. There's a little twist with this movie as it depicts the villain in two completely difference scenarios. In the first half, as cunning and unstoppable, and in the second half as a bumbling idiot. There isn't much gore, but it is a Tarantino movie and there is one scene that is quite gory. I'll also add that the soundtrack's song choices are quite apt.",Death Proof
224,h_wilson92,One of my favorite QT movies,9,3 January 2010,I am a Quentin Tarantino fan and has seen nearly all of the movies directed by him.This is the latest movie I saw and I really loved this movie.I don't know why some people say it is one of the worst QT movies.It was a great movie but not his greatest which is Pulp Fiction.The reason I deducted one star is because this movie has a lot of dialogue which is the let down of the movie but the action parts of the movie make up for the 9 stars I gave this movie.The movie has a great soundtrack also If you don't like gore then you will be easily offended by the ending scene and the first car crash in the movie.This movie has a great plot from finish to end and Quentin has done a very good job at directing this movie from finish to end.rating: 9/10 stars.,Death Proof
225,twhiteson,People don't talk like this!,4,13 April 2017,"I absolutely HATE how Quentin Tarantino writes dialogue for his characters. Twenty-five years ago it was somewhat unique and fresh, but now it comes across as stylized and phony drivel. No one talks like that in real life or even in trash cinema! ""Death Proof"" was Tarantino's failed attempt to pay homage to the ""trash"" exploitation films of the late 60's and 70's. Muscle cars. Hot chicks. And a madman killer in a muscle car who likes to kill hot chicks. It has all three elements, but it gets all of the Tarantino signature ""flourishes"" which unfortunately means lots and lots and lots of lengthy ""dialogues"" in which its characters transform into motor-mouthed, foul-mouthed video-store nerds with an encyclopedic knowledge of obscure pop-culture. In other words, the characters all talk like Quentin Tarantino! It's just so phony and fake! It reeks of nerd-scriptwriter trying way too hard to impress his fan-base.What makes ""Death Proof"" almost unbearable is that Tarantino has his phony-sounding drivel coming out of the mouths of svelte, super-attractive young ladies. Yep, the pretty young women in this film are all spouting QT's patented, faux, tough-guy lingo with references to obscure muscle car movies that these actresses probably never heard of until they read QT's script. Also, the African-American actresses are saddled with QT's usual gratuitous use of the n-word and ""ghettoized"" dialects/mannerisms. (I imagine QT's direction to African-American actors and actresses being similar to that of the ""black acting school"" in Robert Townsend's ""Hollywood Shuffle."") Why four stars? I can't stand Tarantino's fake sounding characters. However, the stunts were well done, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is smoking in that cheerleader outfit, and Kurt Russell is great as usual.",Death Proof
226,nikxatz,A study on consequence,8,29 August 2018,"Death Proof was released during 2007 after Tarantino's Kill Bill vol 2. which is a damn great movie. Death Proof is considered by most Quentin's worst film and many claim that it is really, really bad. I have to disagree with the latter statement, though it may be his worst film. But, no, Death Proof is a hell of a ride and not just because of its entertainment value. 
 Sure, it gory and fast-paced, it has thrilling car rides and some cool dialogue, but what really struck me after watching it was the fact that Tarantino, one of the best directors ever, manages to tell a story which is fun and purposeful at the same time in 2 acts.
 And now you probably wonder how a movie about girls getting killed by a stuntman can be meaningful. Well, it all lies in the character or more specifically in one character. Stuntman Mike.
 He portrays a ruthless man who enjoys killing people just for the fun of it and doesn't care about the consequences of his actions.
 In the 1st act, he succeeds in killing 5 girls, but he also gets hurt. Although he knew that by damaging the girls he would be damaged too, he didn't stop and didn't care about the aftermath.
 If he had a bit of logic, he would quit his hobby and rest. But stuntman Mike does not know of logic. He gets ready and does a come back taking for graanded that he will win. again.
The problem is that he fell in the feet of the wrong girls and because of not caring about the results that his actions will have not just to his victims but to himself too, he dies in a really ironic way.
The movie opens with the feet of a girl, who is later killed by him (or by his car to be exact) and ends with a leg crushing stuntman Mike's skull. As they say the end is in the beginning.
 Stuntman Mike is a great character. His is notorious, cunning and mysterious. He just didn't think of one detail. That the car may be Death Proof, but he isn't.",Death Proof
227,donuthaters12,Reviving A Forgotten Genre,9,10 January 2014,"Death Proof is part of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's Grindhouse, which is a double feature from both directors and it tackles the exploitation films of the 60's and early 70s. I have yet to see Planet Terror but I hear great things about it. Death Proof has been considered a lot by many as the director's weakest film, he also stated that in interviews as well, but I consider it as one of his best.Death Proof is from an original screenplay from Quentin Tarantino. The film doesn't really have a conventional plot which I enjoyed a lot because it follows the tradition of the genre that it takes homage to. The first half of the film is more of a horror slasher film, containing very sexy women under the prey of Stuntman Mike. Though for the bulk of the first story doesn't include a lot of action, instead it takes the rambling and banter from Pulp Fiction and writing interesting dialogue filled with personality. People probably didn't like the dialogue in this film due to the fact that characters in this film feel underdeveloped. I felt that it was important for us to know less about these characters, in order for us to not completely too attached to these characters and feel expendable. The second half of the film on the other hand started off similar to the first half but after a few scenes it does start to pick up and becomes this revenge flick. The second half takes homage to the iconic car films of the 60s and 70s. The ending is quite satisfying leaving the audience off with a smile in their face, it cannot be helped when the scene is so thrilling and at the same time fun and hilarious. The lack of story is not really a big deal to me, because it was something I never expected from the film. The dialogue on the other hand is quite entertaining to listen to because it seems to be inspired by real words that come out from women that may be part of his life.Quentin Tarantino directs this film with such passion and at times very pretentious. I admire the balls that he has to make two 40 minute segments of these characters that interacts with Stuntman Mike's life. Pulp Fiction has much shorter segments sprinkled throughout the film told in a non-linear order. Death Proof is much more chronological which may feel draggy for some people but it wasn't too much of a bothersome for me. I love the homage to a lost genre that he has demonstrated here, as it feels like a breath of fresh air after watching so many films that are too safe and conventional. Tarantino also has created, probably the most iconic car chases of the decade and did not rely on CGI to show it.Quentin Tarantino is credited as the director of photography of this film. Tarantino does a decent job here but it does feel a bit amateurish in comparison to his previous films, though that kind of goes with the genre of the film. In homage with the genre, he manipulates the image by having scratches and dirt littering the frame, which what makes the film unique. It's also supported with sudden jump cuts that ruins the flow of the film, but respecting the genre. This gritty style ends with the second half of the film, starting off with a black and white image as a sort of transition to a contemporary look, saturated colors and a clean sharp image. Tarantino chooses great shots for the climax showing the most frightening of moments to create the tension of the film. It may not be perfect but it does it's job well in service to drive the film forward.Tarantino comes back to a complete soundtrack driven film, picking songs that are reminiscent of the grindhouse films of the past and applied at the right moment gaining a response from us. The bulk of the tracks are found in the first half of the film, with the second half relying more of the action in keeping our attention.The actors in this film are mostly women, with Kurt Russell as the antagonist and the only prominent male of the film. Tarantino has casted beautiful women to play his main characters and their looks do prove a distraction of the dialogue, but if it doesn't have unbelievably attractive women to play this role then it kind of takes a left turn of the homage that it is paying tribute to. Films like Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! primarily have women leading the film and these films usually give off sexuality as a way of keeping our attention. This isn't the best example of brilliant acting from Tarantino's film but the actresses do their job well, spitting out rambling dialogue like it came from their heads. The standout actresses here are Rosario Dawson, Zoe Bell, Rose McGowan and Sydney Poitier. Kurt Russell as a man who has a major fetish for murdering sexy women with his car, plays it so well that it's hard to picture someone else to play the role, though I do wish that he got a little bit more screen time on the second half of the film.Death Proof may not be the perfect film but it is the film that demonstrates the most balls from Tarantino, reviving a genre that is under-appreciated or forgotten today. Death Proof brings back the great dialogue and the experimentation that defines his films. This is definitely a personal favorite of mine.",Death Proof

Here it's just to apparently soak up time and nothing else. It's not even anything exciting or even interesting it's just aforementioned females squawking while on a night out. Truth be told, I can't recall a single word or sentence of what they were talking about, that's how dull it is.Enter Kurt Russell. I actually felt sorry for him as he was sidelined, teased and the subject of some cheesy lap dance ""dare"" by one of the girls. At least he didn't have to do much I guess. I actually couldn't wait for the inevitable scene where he takes all four of them out. I didn't feel bad for any of them.The second half begins just the same as the first. The second set of shallow, irritating, blabbing chicks appears. This time they'e all ""movie people"" There's one or two stunt people, some actress, and some other girl who might be a make up person, I don't know, I wasn't interested enough to remember. After another endless barrage of squawking and swearing, the girls sans the ""actress"" take a muscle car for a test drive and are terrorized by Russell. One of the stunt girls is riding on the hood for no discernible reason other than to show the audience her ""skills"" and create some tension for the showdown with Russell in car vs. car action.The second half is slightly better than the first as the tables are turned and the girls chase Russell, ultimately dragging him from his car and beating him to death. The end. Yep, that's it.I guess Tarantino didn't feel any compulsion to give a back story of ""Stuntman Mike"" (Russell)and why he does what he does. Thank God he didn't bother to develop any of his other characters beyond being targets for Stuntman Mike, I couldn't stand them for the screen time they had already, and found none of them interesting. Save your money, no matter how big a fan of Tarantino's you are, you're wasting your time on this one. Not even good in a ""there's nothing else on TV and it's on HBO"" kind of way.",Death Proof

What I ended up getting was a chick flick. Two groups of flawed female characters are stalked by Kurt Russel's character who's car is supposedly Death Proof.

234,Rainbowbeany,Tip top entertainment!,10,23 July 2019,"This is a throwback Review for me. I have loved this movie for the past 12 years. This and Kill Bill are what made me a Tarantino fanatic. Death Proof starts out so simple. 3 old college friends are having a night on the town, in Texas, while one of them is in from New York. Each of these girls is relatable from their look, all the way to their conversations. I have lots of love for the dialogue in this film. The stories the girls have are very witty and entertaining. Not to mention the degree of realism in topics of discussion. While they are bar hopping the audience sees that they are being stalked by a faceless stranger in a black muscle car. After a few awkward exchanges with the mysterious man later revealed to be Stuntman Mike played flawlessly by Kurt Russell, the girls head to their lake house destination. Mike follows them and kills them all grotesquely with his car! Which will make the squeamish squirm. A cop vows to never let it happen again. Only to flash forward to Tennessee and Mike is at it again. Only this time he has met his match by stalking Stunt Women and their friends. Leading to one of the coolest car chases in cinema history! The girls save the day and beat Mike to death. While this is probably Quentin's simplest movie, it's also the most relatable to me character wise. I know these girls, they are in each one of us. They are real characters with real motivations. Which is missing from pretty much all of the grindhouse films of old. I prefer the longer stand alone version instead of the grindhouse cut. The story rushes to fast with that one and we don't get to care for the characters like we are able to in the stand alone. My acting stand outs are Kurt Russell ( of course) Vanessa Ferlito, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Rosario Dawson, Rose McGowan, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and the introduction of the endearing Zoe Bell.

In the circle of acquaintances I hear again and again that Death Proof is a boring film. Sure, the movie is special, but I do not share that opinion. For me, it is even one of my favorite films of Tarantino.Why is that? One of the key points (and that's what movies usually are about) is that it's just extremely fun to watch. The film goes by in flight (ok, the runtime is also relatively short, but there are just short films with lengths).The look of the film is terrific, the dialogues are as usual strong and the soundtrack is suitable at any time. When I hear Chick Habit in the credits, I immediately want like watching the movie again.

237,eddie052010,"When even Tarantino admits that this is his worst film, you know the film's got problems!",3,12 March 2015,"Back in 2007, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino collaborated on a project which would be an homage to the exploitation films of their youth: Grindhouse. The premise was simple, the film would consist of a double bill with fake trailers in between to create one long tribute to the heyday of the exploitation cinema. However, the film bombed in the States, leading the film to be split in two to make recover some of their losses. One of those films was Tarantino's effort, Death Proof, which was instantly despised on release by critics and audiences alike, and it also bombed at the box office on its own. Hell, even the usually full of himself Tarantino admitted that this was his worse film. So is the film really that bad? Well, let's take a look...The plot is that Stuntman Mike drives around in his car, hunting down and killing groups of women. That's about all there is to it, and while the simple story technique may be quintessentially grindhouse, the story is very badly told, due to an achingly slow pace, and not happens in the film as a result. Hell, Stuntman Mike is reduced to a smaller role than one would like, to the point of essentially being in a cameo. Meanwhile, the film consistently focuses on unlikable characters talking about literally nothing, and being utterly bitchy to each other in the process. It's no secret that Tarantino can't write original female characters to save his life. The Mia scenes in Pulp Fiction are boring and slow the story down, the female characters in Reservoir Dogs either killed off or cut from the final film and Kill Bill focuses on a sadistic sociopath who we have no sympathy for (Jackie Brown doesn't fully count as she was originally from a novel). However, these female characters are his worst yet. Clearly Tarantino doesn't know what women are like, as they talk about nothing, are obsessed with sex & have a cocky attitude towards each other that makes them annoying to watch. I understand that they might be satirising dumb teenage characters in modern horror movies, but considering that they take up most of the running time, we should be caring for them, otherwise we would be watching the film at all?It also doesn't help that when we do get to the car chases, they're unbelievably dull, and when they're good, they often end abruptly, making the talking scenes feel all the more pointless. Sure, there is some tension when there is a car chase with stuntwoman Zoe Bell actually being on the hood of the car, but for the most part, the car chases are unbelievably routine, outside of occasionally very gory (and completely unnecessary) violence. Say what you will about the Fast & Furious movies, but at least the car chases in those movies are exciting and fun to watch. Both of these things lead to the biggest problem with the film: it's utterly boring. As nothing exciting happens throughout, you get bored really fast, and you'd rather watch paint dry. At least the paint doesn't have so much pointless material in it. It would also probably look much better too. I understand that the bad look of the film maybe part of the point, keeping in tone with the grindhouse theme, but that doesn't excuse it fully, especially considering that ironically enough, many of the films from that era have better HD transfers. Here though, the film looks completely cheap and like a made-for-TV movie, thereby making the film look utterly dull in the process. The sound mixing is also quite poor in some scenes, with music and background sounds being so loud that sometimes you can't hear what the characters are saying (not that you'd want to anyway). Are they any redeeming values here?Yes there is, in the form of Kurt Russell. In a very underrated performance, Russell delivers a lot of charm and charisma as Stuntman Mike, making him the best thing in the film by a country mile, and also has the most personality, and even makes some of the overwritten and awful dialogue sound cool and intriguing. Everyone else also delivers fantastic performances, much more than the film deserves. Even stuntwoman Zoe Bell is quite good playing herself, and is the most likable female character in this film, coming off as kind, but dangerous, whereas everyone else is an attitude filled annoyance. It also helps that her half of the film is better than the first, as the characters are slightly more likable than before (probably down to being more likable actors), and it moves along much quicker because of it.But great acting can't polish a smelly turd, and sadly this is what you're left with. A badly-plotted, lazy, boring, and utterly pointless turd with characters you want to murder, a weak story with plot holes (e.g. why do the police never show up?), needless carnage and a lack of a true ending, rather an abrupt end. Truth be told, this isn't Tarantino's worst film (the Kill Bill films fit that mold nicely) but it still isn't very good and is further proof that Tarantino has lost his way, making junk like this when he could be doing so much better.",Death Proof

239,diz-syd-63,Girl power,7,4 November 2015,"I love QT's movies, they are not to everyone's taste, granted. I notice the criticism on here, and I think you have missed the point. Did you not realise it's made in honour of a specific type of film that was made here (Australia) decades ago?I love the symmetry of it, two groups of four girls, two different outcomes. If you ignore the dialogue, which the use of 'motherf*cker' in too many times for my naive tastes and simply take this as a spoof/play on/homage (call it what you will), then you might just enjoy it.The leading man, Stuntman Mike, is nasty and a coward and splendidly played by Mr. Russell!. His sole purpose in life is wrecking other's lives. The first group of girls annoyed me, and their demise was a little over shown (too many repeats from different perspectives) but I was glad they died.The second group of girls, whilst no less annoying, introduce an actor from Auckland who is fantastic. I mean the scenes of her on the bonnet of the car are incredible. I guess they used stunt doubles. Just amazing.Stuntman Mike has met his match ... well worth watching IF you keep the historical context in mind.I love the camera work, first class.

240,andrewfleming-57891,Terrible from start to finish,2,23 August 2018,"Like most of his other films this film is just an excuse to show violence on screen, woven together by a paper thin plot that is inflated with tedious long conversations that add nothing to the plot. Tarantinos direction is a disgrace, this is defnitealy his weakest movie. The characters are poorly developed apart from Stuntman Mike who is given far too much time. However, the films weakest aspect is its script. There are large periods pf the film that just should not exist. Its a lazily made film, with stupid scenes of violence, terrible acting and no funny moments. Awful and best avoided. 2/10",Death Proof

Not only for the awesome car crashes but because Kurt is such a damn psycho. Basically, a guy called Stuntman Mike goes around killing girls in his death-proof car. The start of the film is quite slow at the start but it picks up when he kills 5 women in the space of one night. We later arrive at Tenessee where he stalks four other women. After a long chase with a girl Zoe stuck on the hood of their car they turn the tables on Mike shooting and chasing him to the final conclusion, they beat him up and after a very nasty kick, kill him. This movie is a wonderful tribute to the old car-chase movies of yester-year and deserves a look by all Tarantino fans.9/10",Death Proof
242,waterman_harry,Second (Better) Half of Grindhouse,8,26 April 2015,"The second (better) half of the Grindhouse double feature directed by Quentin Taraninto and featuring an audaciously over-the-top cast of ballsy females, Death Proof is probably Tarantino's weakest film, but even then it's pretty damn good. It serves as a tribute to grainy footage in sleazy, back-alley movie theatres, ""real cars smashing into real cars"" definitely referring 'crashploitation' cinema such as Richard Sarafian's Vanishing Point and isn't dissimilar to Russ Meyers' Faster, Pussycat Kill! Kill! Regardless of the film's influences and origins, it sure does work and has an amazing soundtrack to boot. The performances are good and very relaxed, after watching Death Proof it made me think that Tarantino is probably a really fun guy to work with. Unfortunately he just had to cameo as usual, but thankfully in quite a small role. I love the guy, but am I alone in thinking he really can't act as well as he thinks?",Death Proof
243,luke-346,Remembrance cinema at its best!,10,14 January 2008,"This is an absolutely brilliant film and a film that I could watch over and over. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino this film seems to have divided audiences like no other, it has been adored and despised in many quarters and there seems to be no middle ground for opinion. It is cited, by Tarantino himself, as being a remembrance to the B movies of the 60s and 70s through the guise of Grindhouse cinema. In order to fully appreciate what Tarantino has done then I would agree that you must be at least familiar (on some level) with the films of that genre and era and familiar with Grindhouse cinema and its workings. It is not an absolute necessity to be fully aware of this type of film-making but it helps if you want to completely appreciate this film. Grindhouse cinema was never revered in its day and many have questioned its reprisal. For an audience to require adequate knowledge of such a minnow in cinema history is regarded by many critics as asking too much and is adduced as being a major factor in its downfall. This is due to the belief that Tarantino has made a film for too niche a market, and as a consequence it should be of no surprise that it flopped at the box office. This is something that I whole heartedly disagree with because, to the contrary, I believe that Tarantino has made his most selfish film to date, he has made something that he wanted to... that no studio dictated... no executive planned and no audience asked for, this film is 100 percent his and it just so happens that not that many people like it, all great directors make films that fit into this category.A major critique of Death Proof has been that it contains a lot of dialogue, but I feel that this should be expected as it is a remembrance to Grindhouse cinema and these types of movies are notorious for the amount of talk they can contain and the amount of ""build up"" they might have and Tarantino himself is recognised as being a writer that emphasises the dialogue in his films. Modern cinema goers are likely to not have the patience for such an offering and thus dismiss its significance and become agitated at a lack of ""action"" and this is evident from some of the reviews on this website.The film is about two separate sets of voluptuous women who are stalked by a stuntman called Mike that uses his death proof cars to execute the women. The essence of the story at the heart of Death Proof is that it's impeccably nostalgic as it insinuates to the very essence of cult, it is a forged story because of its countless renditions and numerous re-tellings by the way of novels, films and tales. Being familiar with such a story allows for an ease in understanding and following of narrative  a common attribute in cult films. The voluptuous women, or female characters, in the film are all so similar in appearance yet all so different in disposition, because the film is essentially split into two parts we witness the floundering of one set of female characters and the resurgence in dominance of another. The female empowerment in Death Proof is symbolic to a desire for masculinity which is so wonderfully conveyed by their attempt in ""taming"" the car (I shouldn't need to mention what the car is symbolic of). It's often perceived that in these films masculinity must be achieved in order to succeed, which in itself is a direct reference to the inspired B movies of Russ Meyer.On a personal level I was happy to watch a film that accomplishes its stunt work without any CGI and re-live many of the films I dismissed too eagerly in my youth. Being a homage the film is littered with references, the most notable of which being the casting of Kurt Russell  a deliberate nod to the master of cult (and horror) John Carpenter (the shirt worn by Jack Burton, from Big Trouble In Little China, is visible on the wall in the bar), The Dodge Challenger driven by Stuntman Mike has the plate numbers OA5599, which correspond to the white Dodge Challenger from the heavily referenced film Vanishing Point. The film also contains lots of Tarantino-esquire moments, from the copious amount of foot shots to re-appearance of Sheriff Earl McGraw, and there are some moments of pure Tarantino ingenuity i.e. the four-shot death scene, the reversed hospital set, the lap dance, the shot of the car in the rain, Stuntman Mikes nod to the third person and the wonderfully constructed soundtrack. Upon seeing Death Proof I immediately watched it again as I felt it deserved it. Enjoy.",Death Proof

245,jonathanmark-77048,A Decent Tarantino Flick,6,20 February 2017,"Plot: Two separate sets of voluptuous women are stalked at different times by a scarred stuntman who uses his ""death proof"" cars to execute his murderous plans.I'll be honest, the first 47 minutes of this film were painful to watch to me, from the annoying characters, to the pacing, and the long takes of uninteresting conversations by these women in the first half. The one positive note I could say from those minutes was the performance of Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike who gives it his all and delivers a very good performance. This film really picks up when we're introduced to Zoë Bell, Rosario Dawson, Mary Elizabeth Winsted, and Tracie Thoms who were more interesting characters than the ones in the beginning, even though Zoë Bell plays herself, she actually managed to surprise me by being very good in this film. The only character of the 4 that I wish was written better was Tracie Thoms mostly because of how Tarantino writes the character not necessarily the actress who did the best that she could do.Overall, this is a decent film from Tarantino, it would've been great if he focused more on the characters from the second half than the first half. If you're a Tarantino fan and you haven't seen it, check it out it's worth a watch.",Death Proof
246,im_veritas_photo,Why Is This Ultra-Violence Acceptable To Me? Hmmmm...,6,10 November 2007,"Violence (usually) counts very much against films I've rated; most of them make me nauseous, truly.But: ""Death Proof"" helped me to analyze why some ultra-violent films don't get panned as badly as I might. Why? ""Terminator,"" with its up-close eye-mutilation and multiple murders: I think its plot was so unreal that the violence was accepted by me as somehow totally imaginary. ""Fargo,"" with its believable portrayal of homicidal psychopathy, was all too realistic: but in ""Fargo,"" I think the violence exactly matched the film's requirement to show what was needed. There are a few other examples of ""acceptable"" violence in films I have seen, usually with an accompanying reason for my ""acceptance,"" if I analyze them very carefully.Everyone who knows anything about Quentin Tarantino knows his works are as violent as anything seen on the silver screen. So I don't know exactly why I rented ""Death Proof,"" knowing it was directed by this guy, but I did.Tarantino walks the fine line between clever use of a made-up genre we might call ""B-Film-Bad-Quality-Spoof,"" and merely making the film disgustingly bad (bad taste, bad quality) because he happened to choose the right spoof for it. I cannot decide if, or exactly when, or why, he drifts below the line, because it is difficult to decide just how much is spoof and how much is just gratuitous badness.And, I suppose, that is what makes this ""Death Proof"" at least marginally ""acceptable"" to me. Although when one young lady gets her face ripped off by a tire revving at over 100mph, and another's leg gets severed from her body and flops bloodily to the tarmac... I did come close to barfing. Yes, it was quite shocking. And yes, it was... I admit... morbidly fascinating, at least for the one and only time I've had the courage to view it. I won't be viewing it a second time, if only because I fear the addictive stigma of giving in to morbid fascination.No one under the age of about 65 or so should be allowed to view this film, and, even then, age and experience might not prevent nightmares after seeing it. If anyone allows a teenager to view it, that person should be locked away for fostering severe anti-social behavior on the rest of us.Acting: Fair to good by the lead roles. Screenplay: Horrible, just the absolute pits, dragging on interminably through most of the film, punctuated by only a very few minutes of sheer terror and frantic action. Cinematic Quality: Purposefully awful, I guess to go along with the spoof. But neither the dragging screenplay nor the lack of cinematic quality were sufficiently excused by the spoof they were supposed to reinforce.Six out of ten, and that is, perhaps, too kind of me...",Death Proof
247,Mr_Saxon,"AKA ""Quentin Tarantino's Worst Movie""",2,3 October 2007,"Quentin Tarantino is cool right? True Romance - Brilliant! Reservoir Dogs - Amazing! Pulp Fiction - Incredible! Kill Bill - Totally entertaining! Etc.And now we come to ""Death Proof""; Tarantino's movie from the ""Grindhouse"" double bill (where it was packaged alongside ""Planet Terror"" by Robert Rodiguez). After ""Grindhouse"" flopped, ""Death Proof"" was expanded and then released by itself.""Death Proof"" tells the story of two groups of girls and their fateful encounters with the man who calls himself Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell). Stuntman Mike seems like a nice enough guy. He has plenty of charm and he even offers to take girls home from bars when they need a lift. But what about that car which he drives? He claims that it's 'death proof' meaning that it was designed for the purpose of allowing the driver to walk away from the kind of car crashes seen in Hollywood movies. But there's something slightly sinister about Stuntman Mike...Oh dear. This is the movie where one of America's most prolific directors finally loses his sparkle. And, Quentin, if you read this then here are the reasons why: 1) You should have named this movie ""Yack Yack Yack"". It's an hour and a half of women talking with half an hour of horror thrown in. And it's boring. Usually Tarantino's dialogue shines but here it sounds forced and gets tiring really quickly.(2) If you're going to write pages and pages of women talking, try not to make them sound like the gangsters and lowlifes from your other movies. Every other word seems to be 'bitch' or 'niggar'. And the way you've dropped in pop references doesn't work here either. These aren't normal women. They're just there to act as cyphers for your 'cool dialogue'.(3) You have a thing for women's feet. We get it Quentin, you don't have to hammer the point home so much. We open on a pair of women's bare feet, a woman performs a lap dance and the camera focuses on her bare feet, another woman hangs her bare feet out of a car window, a pair of bare feet are slowly licked, a woman mentions getting a foot massage from the guy she fancies etc. Thankyou for letting us know what floats your boat Quentin. Thankyou very much.(4) I'm sure you love everything that is filmed in front of your camera but please think of the audience when you're editing. This movie was far, far too long. You could argue that this is because scenes had to be put back in once ""Death Proof"" was released on its own. But most of the scenes are pointless anyway!The only good thing about this movie (well, aside from the soundtrack) was Kurt Russell. He's a great actor and he gives another fine performance here. It's a shame that it's in such a tedious movie.Oh dear, Quentin. I've got my fingers crossed that this isn't the first of many misfires.",Death Proof
248,DaveDiggler,Quentin Tarantino at his Best and Worst,6,2 May 2008,"Only a Tarantino film can give you the feeling of pure boredom and electric intensity all at the same time. Both can come of simple conversation and over-the-top action. ""Death Proof"" is the quintessential Tarantino film, where he has long, drawn out conversations that are constantly interrupted yet free flowing and very natural as the characters talk about everyday things (pop culture) and use quirky old sayings. Tarantino is easily the greatest writer you could think of for pure dialogue and even though that's his greatest asset, it's also his biggest flaw. The film is cut into two halves and the first half is excellent. The ending is great (in both halves), but man, did that middle nearly put you to sleep or what?!?! It's not that it was incredibly boring material. The problem was: This was two similar movies smashed into one, with a ton of common parallels, Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), being the main figure. The second half doubles back on the first half; ultimately repeating itself. The women are powerful. They can control men because men are pigs and only think with their little heads as the women in charge tease them with their sexuality. Even though the girls aren't whores, they surely push the limits because when they don't put out, they'll get a guys respect- a common theme with both the first half and the second coming from eight different women who all think the same. The standout female performance came from Vanessa Ferlito (Arlene) who brought a certain flare to the screen that made the viewer care for her more than anyone else. She nailed this performance and carried the first half along with Russell. The dialogue (and there is a ton of it) is, as usual, captivating at the start. ""Death Proof"" is a faller, not a riser, but the action packed ending is strong enough to give this fair remarks. This is a common issue with Tarantino. ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" may have had the longest, most drawn out ending this side of ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,"" and the worst part is that we know exactly what's going to happen, because, like most Tarantino films, the women usually come out on top. The first half of the film is flawless. The conversation is perfect. The mysteriousness of Stuntman Mike- who has a thing for car crashes and testing the ""death proof"" slogan that goes along with his ""scary"" car- is great and the best part is that we never know where the movie is going to end (Or at least this story). Kurt Russell actually gave a very strong performance. His look was great and when he imitates John Wayne that should crack everyone up even if they don't know what John Wayne sounded like. The ending to the first half of the movie is great and the look of the picture is incredible as Tarantino pays homage to the 70s style look. You have random cutaways, intentionally poor editing where the conversation will skip, double back, and some parts will completely cut away (During a lap dance, too) at what feels like an inopportune time, but that's what makes it so great. The texture and overall look is dazzling right from the very first shot of one of the girls feet rockin' away- to a modernized Scorsese styled, catchy beat- on the dashboard against a light blue sky. Tarantino, stylistically, has a style all his own and this was great to see.The second half of the film brings in four more women that walk, talk, and act just like the four we seen in the first half. The film doubles back on itself and repeats the first half over again, just with different girls. The conversations are the same (all about sex), but there's one difference: ""these girls will fight back."" That will bring us to a wonderful stunt worked, high speed, well choreographed, and even better shot car chase that just doesn't want to end and I guess, in a way, that's okay. We deserve to indulge in a thrilling sequence for as long as it was after Tarantino toyed with our concentration and focus; dulling us with repetitive banter. Zoe Bell, the stunt women, had too many speaking parts. She's not a good actress where the first group of girls were much, much better and more engrossing. The last four girls weren't all that effective (Maybe because we seen it all before just minutes earlier). The final sequence will leave you laughing, not only because it's ridiculous, but how long it lasts and the camera work along with Russell' face is very funny. ""Death Proof"" was, for the most part, an enjoyable film, but this same old Tarantino song and dance is running on thin ice. Conversation, as always, in a Tarantino film is starting to take over more than ever for plot and the second half of ""Death Proof"" nearly ruins a nearly flawless first half. There's not much here in regards of plot and a lot of people are going to be getting sick of tired, pointless, going-no-where talk. It's time Tarantino reinvents himself.",Death Proof
249,dustinhunter707,"Good, but a boring middle.",6,23 September 2007,"OK I love Quentin Tarantino's movies and I am a Kurt Russell fan as well and this movie was pretty good but I have to admit that I thought it would be a lot better. I thought I would be giving it a 9 instead of a 6 out of 10. But I mainly give it a 6 because some parts at the beginning and the end were good and well shot but the middle was pretty boring because Tarantino seems to think that we care about what the girls' lives are like. We just want to know how they encounter Stuntman Mike and we don't care about their love lives or what they prefer. Anyways the movie was OK, Kurt Russell gave a good performance as a demented psycho bent on killing young women with his race car, but it was a little boring so I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but it is pretty good so just don't watch it if your tired, because the middle will make you fall asleep.",Death Proof
250,djensen1,Too much house; not enough grinding,7,2 December 2007,"When the Tarantino/Rodriguez retro-double-feature Grindhouse came out, it was Death Proof that got the critics' motors running. They admitted it was talky, but this is the king of dialog, after all. Count me among fans who are underwhelmed. This film does have a kind of quirky charm, but the writer/director indulges himself far too much in eavesdropping on his characters when he ought to be putting them in peril. The setup is intriguing: some girls get together for a night of drinking at a bar and are stalked by an older man in a creepy muscle car who turns out to be a bad guy. Later, a similar group of girls becomes the target of the bad man's attention. Instead of spending 20 minutes setting up the first section, the director spends nearly an hour, with the payoff lasting about 2 minutes. The second group of girls includes two movie stuntwomen in their 20s who nevertheless know all about Quentin Tarantino's favorite movies and have a fantasy involving the car featured in the 1970 gear-grinder Vanishing Point. It's fairly ludicrous stuff that only really gets going when the girls at last get on the road with the bad guy. If Tarantino had cut 30 minutes from the beginning and extended the second section with more peril, he would have had a better film. As it is, it tends to ramble and go nowhere. It's full cool '70s music and the director's other trademarks, and the acting is good. I found the parts that work watchable enough, but overall, it was a disappointment.",Death Proof

Here you have everything: Tarantino's usual and famous manner with that useless but surreal kind of boring dialog, a simply basic idea about a psychopath and how he tries to kill his victims in car chases, director's film - buff preferences to female action b-movies of 70's (remember Pam Grier in ""Jackie Brown""). A mess with no reason to exist, full of director's observations (lean legs, hot shorts, noisy cars etc.) not enough gore, not scary script lines, not even an interesting villain (even though Russell's come-back in a character at the end of the film sacrificed to stupidity, is at least a good funny choice) to make a wanna-be B-movie.

It is about a psychotic infamous stuntman who stalks and kills young women using his ""death proof"" stunt car. Quentin once again writes and directs perfectly.Kurt Russel is once again very good in the role of the psycho and in general the film has very good interpretations. Death Proof is a big homage to the 70s muscle car,slasher and exploitation movies referencing many times to some old,legendary b-movies such as the Vanishing Point,Gone in 60 Seconds,Dirty Mary Crazy Larry,White Line Fever and many more.It also makes references to many memorable exploitation and slasher movies just using their score,or showing posters of them.

What came across as quirky, off-beat and insightful in RD and PF becomes self-indulgent, vacuous and -quite simply- boring in this sub-par ""exploitation"" flick. Instead of memorable round-table discussions concerning the hidden meaning behind ""Like a Virgin"", here we are treated to mindless girly talk about boyfriends and making out.

255,bobwildhorror,"I've Got an Affinity for B-Movies, But...",6,27 August 2008,"A lot has been made of this film's painfully slow pace. And there's no doubt that DEATH PROOF contains way, way too much dialog. In numerous sequences the film gets lost in minutia that does nothing to advance the storyline. It's not even minutia that develops the characters. It's minutia that reads like in-jokes for nerdy film fanatics, guys who probably wet themselves at the mention of every obscure seventies TV show Quentin throws at them.But that's not the biggest sin on display in DEATH PROOF. The biggest is how the women, who are supposedly super-feminists, are used to fulfill every adolescent male fantasy imaginable. They not only talk endlessly about sex and ""doing"" it, they place each other in situations where they could easily be sexually assaulted (which are supposed to pass for funny in this picture). They drink and cuss like truckers, all the better to get them in the mood to put out. And they chatter endlessly, in stilted Tarantino-English, about scoring weed and car engines. And dare I mention that a good percentage of them are martial arts experts? Silly stuff, and easily forgiven, if I felt there was a point other than Quentin's intellectual masturbation. But this overlong film is simply a great ten minute car chase (and spectacular car crash) tacked onto 90+ minutes of dialog. In the end  and ""the end"" literally amounts to the film grinding to a purposeless halt  it all comes across as labored.Quentin, you're too good for this.",Death Proof

I don't know why many people consider this as a bad film. Even Tarantino said that this is the worst film he ever made. This flick was so engaging and thrilling to watch! The car chase scene was mind-blowing and Tarantino did a very good job as the cinematographer. The camera angles which he chose to shoot the long and wide shots during car chase were awesome.The movie doesn't have a decent story but it has got all the elements which a good action-thriller needs.A very engaging action-thriller.

But that lapsed his focus on other very important things... Like script, direction and performance.
This movie would be a good movie if cut to 75 minutes. 113 mins is too long for a 2 car chase movie with a ton of boring filler.
His new movie, Once upon a time... in Hollywood, is titled as his 9th movie. But by IMDB count, its his 10th full length feature. My guess is he excluded this one from the count to hide it.
The most important fact left out of this movie was any explanation as to why Stuntman Mike is a serial killer after these specific girls. If we are left to guess..... was it because he was just having fun?

259,paulmamak,"Overall a let down, ending car chase sequence was amazing though!",5,22 September 2007,"This film could have been so much better, the reason why it was probably not as good is because it evolved from being a double feature. The film started off with Tarantino's trademark of foot fetishism, which is fair play, but he used it too often and their feet were not that great either. Then we are introduced to this group of skanks that just talk rubbish around 10 minutes that does not even compare to Taratino's previous dialogue in films. So they finally go to a few bars talking more waffle and bringing up something about ""Butterfly"", while being stalked by this driver. The story follows by them ending up at a bar continuing their rambling only to have the stalker sat at the bar ""AKA Stuntman Mike"", with a weak appearance by QT himself. With Stuntman Mike chatting up the best looking blonde out of the whole bar as well as talking to the skanks, which clumsily cutting back and forth. Consisting of mildly amusing moments of him all most sneezing and doing a John Wayne impression. When he mentions that butterfly business he manages to get a lap dance out of one of the skanks, which carries a good tune, but remains non-erotic and resembles that of a scene in Reservoir Dogs. Finally comes to him giving the sweet blonde a lift home, which I thought would have been a bit more interesting than it was, but the death scene was acceptable. Then comes probably the highlight, in a Tarantinoesque sort of way, in Stuntman Mike having head on collision with the skanks. Showing each of the individual deaths frame by frame with one girl hilariously ejected, one losing her leg and the other two dying in boring ways. The scene follows Stuntman Mike in hospital with Michael Park making his usual cameo as Earl McGraw, but this time with his son in real life and on screen. With brief talks with Marley Shelton, sexy as always, and then talking in the usual quiet way hardly understandable to the audience all about how he cannot be bothered to deal with the whole case. The film continues the same way as the story starts this time with different girls, Rosario Dawson and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, being the only attractive ones, with another stupid coloured woman trying to be Pam Grier. With more foot fetishism, pointless dialogue, more stuntman stalking and scenes that drag on for too long. Then we are introduced to this stupid New Zelander, actually a stunt woman in real life that cannot act, who tries mingling with the dialogue consisting of blacksploitation crap. Then finally getting to the point that they want to test drive this car locally for sale. Therefore they go to the seller, consisting of more blacksploitation crap and more waffle. Finally three of the girls manage to test drive the car, where the New Zealander performs this crazy stunt on the bonnet only to have Stuntman Mike come along and try and run them off the road. Where a partially entertaining sequence emerges, only to find the two cars coming to a halt. Stuntman Mike getting comically shot and the girls thinking the New Zealnder died, which made my heart raise with delight, until you find out she is alright, bugger! Therefore the girls decide to hunt him down with a trusty pole. Cutting next to Stuntman Mike wrecking his character by acting like a baby while applying alcohol to his wound. Only to then find that the girls have rammed him from behind and so begins the climatic moment of the final car chase, performed very well, but let down by Stuntman Mike behaving like a baby once again. They finally flip him and find him in a state where he is crying over a broken leg, as if the character has not already embarrassed himself enough already. The final scene consisting of the him being continuously punched by the girls in a circle and finally knocking him out to the floor. This scene was improved by Rosario Dawson's character sinking her heel into his skull. Overall I would say it is the worst Tarantino film to date. Too much dialogue, blacksploitation and not enough of cars.",Death Proof
260,he_who_leads,Quentin's Best Since 'Pulp Fiction',8,7 February 2008,"The people that will not like this film are the people that need a frequent appearances of blood, cursing and action in their movies - 'Sin City' fans. Those people will call this QT's flop but it really isn't. Despite the controversy, we've always known QT is more than just some film-violence geek. He has fun playing with the audience's expectations and yet he is on your side. He wants to make a really good night out at the cinema for you, but unlike so many others he knows exactly what he's doing. He has the talent.'Death Proof' is just plain-old entertaining without ever feeling forced. The focus here is on women and instead of being plot heavy with multiple twists we just follow them as they talk, drink, argue and kid around. Having acquired more experience in the world, QT doesn't have to turn to Royales with Cheeses and Madonna dick dick dick as much. The characters feel normal and you really do become swept up in their respective personalities, sparkling fresh dialogue and private little battles. Plus the girls are pretty hot/cool. Not in a fake look-but-don't-touch-me kind of way but more fun and laid back. I fell in love with the slinky Jungle Julia (Sydney Poitier) but my friend liked Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito) and another guy liked Pam (Rose McGowan). About 25% of the flick is car action and when Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) first strikes after all the build-up tension, it is one of the most gripping action scenes I've ever seen. 'Death Proof' is much better than the less-creative, here-come-the-zombies-again flick 'Planet Terror,' but that film is still passable entertainment. I don't think 'Grindhouse' would have flopped as much in the US if the films were released separately. Four hours of cinema in one night is just not something most people can get behind. The quality is still here, see it.",Death Proof

It's a girls movie. Much of the movie is girls sitting around talking about girl stuff. The only bright spots were the parts filmed in Austin and Kurt Russell. After the movie shifts to Tennessee, I kind of started getting bored with it- I liked the Austin girls better than the Tennessee girls. Too bad the Austin girls were the ones that had to die. I was actually pulling for Kurt Russell to take out the ones in Tennessee as well, to shut that potty mouthed girl up for good. But it was not to be. Maybe the genius of Tarantino was at work putting us in Stuntman Mike's mindset after being forced to listen to these ill-mannered obnoxious young ladies use language that would make a sailor blush, for 2 hours straight, even a sane person would be ready to strangle them.",Death Proof

263,hcaraso,07 is not 70,6,8 June 2007,"So Tarantino wanted to make a revival of the 70s movies, in 2007. He reminds me of a movie named 1984 (almost halfway from 1970 to 2007, based on the famous book by George Orwell), in which the main character says I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. I can understand how Tarantino managed to accomplish such a well-done movie. I cannot understand why he made it.I enjoyed all his previous movies, even KILL BILL, for the wonderful second hour of the second part. I gather the movie is a flop in America, while Cannes Festival swallowed it quite nicely. There are so much snobs in Cannes, the kind of ""tout est dans le non-dit"" (it's all inside the untold). No wonder Tarantino looked so satisfied during his appearances there. Hope he does better next time, because his style is fresh in all the good and bad terms of the word. harrycarasso,Paris, France",Death Proof
264,michaellaing71,"Grindhouse good, Deathproof annoying",4,26 September 2007,"Excitement had been building up for months. I had really been looking forwards to Grindhouse. Then after it flopped in America I heard that we were only going to get the single movie, thank you America for messing it up for us Brits. What we get is a over long boring film with to much dialogue. This film should never have been more than 90 minutes long and it makes more sense as part of a double feature. The story was poor and unsatisfying, I can't fault the acting Kurt Russell is good especially in the first half of the movie. But his character suddenly changes in the second part which is annoying. The girls are nice with Vanessa Ferlito standing out for me. It was interesting seeing Zoe Bell though, she isn't in certain ways a natural actress but she suits the movie well. I was less upset about the directing than normal. Quentin Tarantino is normally over showy but in this film he gets away with it.I was also unhappy that they didn't put any of the trailers from Grindhouse at the beginning of the film, which I was really looking forwards to.

266,wmjahn,Emminently watchable !,7,29 August 2007,"Quentin Tarantino did it again and he scores high again ! Although this is not his best movie, his tribute to American ""muscle-car movies"" from the early to mid 70ies (it's actually a pretty small genre, with 2 or 3 top films and maybe 2 or 3 dozen followers, mostly forgotten today) is a superbly staged high-tempo action flick, which pulls all the right triggers at the right time.Kurt RUSSELL is perfectly cast as ""Stuntman Mike"", the role fits him like a tailor-made glove and is certainly the best one he had in the last 10 years. Watching him one can easily say that he had a lot of fun, too.The ""ladies"" (whom I have to put between """", since I have never heard ladies using foul language so much, ha ha) are well chosen and capable. Of course Tarantino could not cast Uma Thurman this time, simply because all the ""ladies"" have equally strong presence and screen-time, none is much better or worse than the others. Of course Uma is another league and would have Tarantino chosen to cast Uma, she would have either out-shined the others and unbalanced the movie or Tarantino would have had to make the impossible possible by finding 3 more ladies equal to Uma, which even Tarantino could not have accomplished.The stunt-work, which is old-fashioned real stunts and no computer-beep, is superb and the story runs along well and as expected (no surprises here, but then again how often are there surprises in B-flicks?).Still, I can't agree to give this well-made and highly entertaining flick a 10 rating. It just ain't THAT good.To start with, in my humble opinion at least 2 of the movies Tarantino cites are better than DEATH PROOF, which is first and above all the unmatched VANISHING POINT. Cultists of this achievement will have surely noticed the similarity of this movies end and the scene, when Stuntman Mike goes over his first victims plus the multiple replays. Great, but VANISHING POINT is still simply better. VANISHING POINT has 7,1 on the IMDb and A LOT of spirited comments, check them out. I think with that rating it is still underrated (I'd give it 9 to 10, more 10).The second one is DIRTY MARY, CRAZY LARRY (I wrote a short comment on that one), which is a guilty pleasure of mine. I just love this one! Considered a throw-away picture at its time of release, this has a pretty strong cult following meanwhile and that's justified. With 6,2 on the IMDb it's definitely underrated ! Deserved 7 to 8.The other two main achievements Tarantino cites are GONE IN 60 SECONDS (as one of the sweeties says: ""of course the original, not the Angelina Jolie beep"" - logically everybody has rightly forgotten that Nic Cage was in it too ... was he ? :-) ) and CONVOY (""Rubber Duck"" on Stuntman Mikes car). Also worth mentioning are of course THE California KID and ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE. I don't consider them any better than DEATH PROOF, but also not much worse. Nice B-flicks, all of them (for Peckinpah-standards CONVOY was of course lame).Keeping that in mind I'd agree to the average rating of the IMDb and give DEATH PROOF an 8-rating. But I still have to lower it for a point, which is of course due only to my own humble opinion and credited to minor ""inefficiencies"": First I think Tarantino overdoes it a little, especially at the beginning. The first 30, 40 minutes are a little slow moving (which none of the 70ies classics is), simply because the scene in the bar goes on forever. Of course there is some spirited talk in this scene, but then again only SOME. The point Tarantino proves in this is that women can't keep their mouthes shut. There's also a lot rude talk about ""fuck and suck"", but nothing like this ever happens, neither on nor off-screen (didn't happen in the 70ies either). There's only one light hint on xxx and that's also off-screen. People who talk about ""it"" all the time should do ""it"" at least once ... Anyway, a minor quibble, but still, this could have been handled better.Then Tarantino clearly shows his love for technical imperfections in 70ies flicks, but again, slightly too much. The harsh ending of the lap-dance-scene will have frustrated not only me, smile. Did Tarantino hint that the cameraman was so fascinated, that he didn't realize his film is running out ...? There are other abrupt ending of scenes and then there's a long black-and-white scene, which suggests that in the 70ies there was either not enough money available for a color film or nobody noticed the wrong film in the camera. I do LIKE the idea, but it was too long, in my humble opinion.Last but not least, OK, the story of this movie take place today, but ... do we really need cellular phones in a tribute-to-the-70ies movie ?? Again, a minor ""fault"", but all scene except one (the one in the supermarket) could have worked with normal phone booths as well and I am sure a capable script-writer could have made up a nice scene involving a phone-booth ...Summing up my few cents, I give this a STRONG 7 out of 10 rating and recommend this superb ""B"" to everybody, who loves cleverly made high energy movies !PS: I just saw I have only one agreement and 15 non-agreements! That's COOL ! Obviously the ones who adore Tarantino find 7 of 10 a blasphemy and much too low and the ones who don't like DEATH PROOF think 7 is too high ... I must have done something right, I guess. :-))",Death Proof
267,Exeron,Tarantino tries again...,8,3 February 2008,"And he succeeds. I was very skeptic when i first saw the trailer, i'm not a huge fan of Kurt Russel so that would probably be why.Tarantino tries to give you this 60's B-movie feeling...and man did he pulled it off or what?! If i didn't knew before i saw it that this movie was new, i would easily mistake it for an oldie. They've thought of everything, the font, the little dust particles on screen, the music and how the sound gets a bit wavy.The story is not to much to brag about. It's about a crazy stuntman which has the interest of killing teen-aged girls with his car.It's like this movie was made for Tarantino fans especially.

""The movie of the year 2007, no doubt"" 9/10",Death Proof
268,Reef-Shark,Where's the Tarantino we know and love?,5,11 February 2010,"The frames are damaged, full of grain, becoming dead on imitations of junk films both visually and thematically. Both Tarantino's Death Proof and Robert Rodriquez's Planet Terror (the other feature from Grindhouse) use this styleOne key difference. Planet Terror is so over the top that it becomes a BLAST; not a perfect or even a good film, but certainly deserving of a 7/10 star rating simply for its entertainment value. Death Proof on the other hand is very down to earth in its premise and without many exaggerated stylistic choices just becomes what it set out to be: a trashy, boring film.As a story it is generic (as it should be) following a group of girls stalked by a man named ""Stuntman Mike"" (Kurt Russell)who drives a ""death proof"" retired stunt car. He stalks them, kills them with his car, then skips state to repeat the process elsewhere. He is a fun character speaking in a pleasant Southern drawl, passing himself off as a nice guy. Too bad he has little screen time compared to our three female protagonists who are boring as can be. I kept checking the clock wondering how long it would take these bimbos to become street pizza! After a bar sequence that seems to go on forever (where I have to admit, Tarantino's cameo as the manager is the second most entertaining aspect of this film right after Kurt Russell) I have to admit the stunts in this film really are remarkable. Stuntman Mike isn't joking about his set of wheels given that all the chases in this film are for real. When he talks about what a shame it is to have lost the old time values of using real cars and stuntmen over CGI crashes it really shows. Nothing can top the thrill of seeing real vehicles getting, smashed, slammed, and creating mayhem. No computer program can compare to live action.After a thrilling stunt where Stuntman Mike kills a group of girls through a straight on collision (while Tarantino delivers the promised Grindhouse style gore) we are greeted to a cameo from by the cops from Kill Bill before moving on to the second act. This is where things really begin to fall apart. For the most part the second half seems a poor excuse to show off Tarantino's lead Kill Bill stuntwoman Zoë Bell's skill as she hangs for dear life on the hood of a car during a chase.Like Kill Bill, Vol.2 the second half of this film is so different than the first that it seems to be something entirely different. Stuntman Mike who is an intimidating, soft-spoken stalker in the first half suddenly becomes an obnoxious over actor. Now I have no problem, because Kurt Russell hamming it up certainly was amusing for awhile, but it was very out of place given how calm his character was during the first half of the film. Over the top or serious Tarantino, you have to choose one or the other and stick with it! Speaking of the acting it really is a wonder as Tarantino, to preserve the concept of this being a junk film intentionally baits the cast to do stupid, amateur stunts such as looking directly into the camera for entire scenes at a time, breaking the fourth wall, and just being general hams. Nothing can be much funnier than a truly awful movie, but the film actually had to be completely unaware of how bad it is. Death Proof it is clearly intentional, and though this might be amusing when a viewer first notices these quirks, the gag soon loses charm and just becomes annoying. When you see bad films you want to see a bad film. You don't want to see an obviously smart director and actors being led to intentionally look bad. They aren't over the top (until the final ten minutes or so of the movie) so they're just boring.Another problem is the script. Tarantino is not a great director on a visual level seeing as most of the time he replicates the styles of great directors. What has always set Tarantino apart as an artist is his engaging dialogue. That's where Grindhouse is a disappointment of colossal proportions. There is very little action in Death Proof, which is good seeing as Tarantino isn't that good with action scenes, but the dialogue in the film is justboring. It's as real as it gets. No, seriously: the dialogue in this film is as entertaining as stalking an actual troop of girls. Only good dialogue comes from Kurt Russell during the first half, but then Tarantino butchers the appeal of that character in the second act. If you're not enjoying the dialogue of a Tarantino film it means something is going horribly wrong.So congratulations to Mister Tarantino for successfully making the junk film he set out to make. No doubt this was an entertaining thing for him as a director, but as an audience member I was often bored with this film. The action is fun, but the final car chase goes on for far too long, but worse is that Tarantino's dialogue in Death Proof is just bland. There is nothing really working for this film. It could have been far better if Tarantino had made this a more exaggerated homage because as it is it's no different than the bad films it tries to poke fun at. Planet Terror managed to give that bad movie feel while taking its premise to such absurdity that it was hard not to be entertained by it. Death Proof on the other hand is so serious about being ""bad"" that it becomes just that.",Death Proof
269,thebengalimafia-1,Too slow and incredibly disappointing.,2,20 February 2008,"Death Proof opens with all the gratuitous (fill in the blank) you would expect from any type of exploitation film of which includes director Quentin Tarantino's trademark bare foot fetish, a black woman bending over right into the camera, and her friend racing up the stairs in desperate need to urinate. The camera gives us a close up of her crotch as one finger digs deeper and deeper into her, well you know.The story centers or loosely involves a psychotic killer that uses his car to kill young women. The film as a whole fails pretty miserably, but Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) is thoroughly convincing as the Jekyll Hyde type killer. He's completely lovable and charming one minute and mowing down a car full of people the next. There's no reason a woman wouldn't trust him in this film, especially the likes of Rose McGowan who is labeled ""the dirty hippy."" I don't think it ever occurred to Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez that grind house cinema has lost its appeal as entertainment for the masses; exploitation cinema isn't made today for a reason. Every one of the characters is a racial stereotype; the ghetto girl, the black drama queen, the cheerleader, and the white girl (New Zealander Zoe Bell) who's always hunting for action. Even Tarantino seems to have lost his talent for writing dialogue. There's a scene in the second half of the film that tries to mimic the diner scene in Reservoir Dogs but ends up being four airheads rambling on and on with food in their mouths. Come to think of it, there are several references to every movie Tarantino has ever directed which makes me think that he's running out of ideas.I watched the uncut director's edition on DVD, and there was an 18 minute long action scene in the end that is one of the best ever filmed. There's no CGI, it's just Zoe Bell (who played herself in the film; she's a stuntwoman) on the hood of a muscle car going 80 miles an hour with Kurt Russell trying to knock her off. It was old school action at its very best. The movie never really came together but I don't think it was supposed to the way we think of movies today. The ridiculously abrupt ending made the entire movie seem pointless, not to mention the first half could more or less be disregarded.I'm a big fan of Tarantino's work, but this has to be his worst movie ever. How could the man who gave us Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill make something like this? It was too slow, no witty dialogue, and was just a string of loosely related events that made up the movie. The only consistent and entertaining character is Stuntman Mike, and he doesn't even get that much screen time. Let's hope the Weinstein Company isn't so quick to finance a film like this in the future.",Death Proof
270,RovingGambler,Blah blah blah,4,18 November 2007,"This is the first Tarantino movie that I didn't like. The dialog just went on and on and on and was so pointless. It wasn't even interesting to listen to the characters talk. In fact, I don't even remember most of what was talked about and I just watched the movie about an hour ago. And I don't have anything against pointless dialog as long as it's interesting. I mean, Pulp Fiction had some pointless dialog, but it was interesting and funny. Quentin Tarantino really lost it with this movie.The action sequences are above average and entertaining. Unfortunately, it makes up probably less than 20 percent of the whole movie.

271,coltsw-10803,More nonsense from the super self-serious Quentin Something-or-other.,5,21 July 2019,"Tarantino, that's what his name is. His movies are somewhat entertaining, but only once. I could never sit through one a second time. They're weird and a bit unique (except for all the cliches that abound), but the dialogue drives me nuts. It's so self-consciously hip that it gets on my nerves. And Death Proof is a prime example. No women actually talk like these insufferable tramps. Even tramps have more self respect than to utter the uber-masculine nonsense that Zoe Bell blathers in the second half of this silly waste of time. She might be a fine stunt woman but she belongs in non-speaking roles; especially when she's given lines like: ""(Blank) me, swinging balls out!"" Only a ten-year-old trying to act like an older kid would think that's cool. And her character is getting all excited about test driving the wheels off an exact match to the car used in a classic '70s car movie. I guess there might be one female under age 50 who has seen that movie and likes it. So they made a movie about her.Several of the roles in this forgettable clown piece were miscast. Pe-plastic surgery Vanessa Ferlito, all sweaty in cut-off shorts and flip-flops, is nobody's idea of a fantasy chick. As stated before, Zoe Bell is better off pulling punches and not talking, and Tracy Toms is not believable as a stunt person. The stupid scene where Toms and Bell discuss breaking their pact not to perform a dangerous stunt while test-driving somebody else's car they have no intention of buying is the typically silly, ""ain't we naughty"", over-the-top nonsense that Tarantino thinks is so clever.That guy really believes his own hype. So much so that he insists on casting himself as an ugly, greasy, sleazy bar owner. The man may be able to craft movies that mindless hipsters are willing to buy into completely, but Tarantino CANNOT ACT! Also, he has the stereotypical face for radio.Kurt Russell once again wastes his formidable talents on a Tarantino script.

We get it, QT is...WAS edgy and innovative but he's really not doing it anymore. His dialogue is becoming cheesy, his style of directing is really growing lame.

And while it's nowhere near as ingenious as Pulp Fiction, the movie has so much going for it, I'd easily consider it to be an 8......if it weren't for the lamest car chase EVER!!! Sure, 70s chases weren't all that exciting if you compare them to more contemporary action scenes, but this one is not only totally lame, it's 20 minutes long! 20 minutes without much in the way of, say, events.

Halicki-films such as ""The Junkman"". Since I didn't like ""Planet Terror"" so much, I made a mental note and would suggest, that this one would perfectly and rather match in a 'double-feature' with the excellent ""No Country For Old Men"", which is also set in that time.There ain't much plot to tell (and spoilers are therefore practically impossible) but the nevertheless movie is even so richer and cooler than many others with a more complex story-structure.We follow a few beautiful women on their weekly tour to their favorite joint where they first meet their hangman – the 'Unknown Stuntman' ""Mike"". Then -at dusk- the tour goes on to the open interstate where Mike waits in ambush and kills them in a kamikaze frontal crash, sacrifying his car and putting even his own life at stack just for the killthrill.Months later ... Mike is on the road. Again. Some girls are on their weekly tour. Again. They meet. Again. On the open county-roads the next duel begins. But these ain't no average girls...The major part of the film is that following race-off and as you see it has in about the same amount of plot as the terrific 'Cardigans' - videoclip ""My favorite game"".Hilarious is the scene where Mike finally mourns over his broken arm – the entire audience in my theater laughed their asses of. That, and his brief smile right into the camera before made Mike not the most unsympathetic fella to us. But we rooted for the girls and his fate anyway.QT has a minor part in the movie, mainly playing himself and the usual State Trooper/Sheriff shows up too so the movie is regularly embedded into the QT-canon.The rest is: cool cars, cool chicks, cool music, cool carchase with nice crashes.

276,ilikepuppies,"""Scary tends to impress.""",6,30 December 2007,"It's perplexing to me that Tarantino gets so much respect as a writer, considering that so much of his writing is done on the fly. In fact, this film was largely written as it was being filmed. He starts with an excuse to make a film and his ambition makes it happen, while his vast film vocabulary fills in all the blanks. And like all his films, the result is a movie drenched in Tarantino's personal nostalgia, a nostalgia which he seems to think important enough to repeatedly push on our culture for some reason. Here, that excuse is the desire to film the ""greatest car chase ever, dude!"" The rest of the film is dressing.I consider Tarantino an arbiter of the hip-hop aesthetic, transplanted into film. I'm talking about sampling, and the fine line which exists between the art of sampling clips from other songs and simple plagiarism. Quentin's use of ""samples,"" that is, bits from other films is comparable. At times it seems he's not so much creating as he is simply re-sequencing, referencing his own DVD collection. In order to pull this off, you have to be one hell of an interesting person (with one hell of an interesting DVD collection), which he unfortunately is not.But wait...The reality is that in spite of all this criticism, Death Proof is actually my favorite of Quentin's films so far, and the reason is the adventurous spirit in which he attacks that chase sequence, the centerpiece of the movie, remember. It's a spatial ride, and the best bit of film-making to come from him to date.All the technical aspects of this of course get a free pass, because well, the worse the better, right? So it's easy to ignore it all, although a few in the crew had interesting tasks, especially the actors. Is it more difficult for a makeup department to create a realistic scar or a poor one which is supposed to look like a failed attempt? Maybe it will someday dawn on Tarantino that film can be important. If ever, he just may become important himself.

The action is furiously edgy, filmed with real cars and stuntmen, no computer generated effects here. The cast are also superb, with Kurt Russell finally getting the chance to play a deranged psychopath. And he pulls it off with maniacal glee. The bevy of beautiful ladies are too many to mention, although Vanessa Ferlito (of CSI New York fame) performs a lap dance that is extremely sexy.Tarantino also has the audacity to make the film feel like an 'old school' flick, and this is best observed in the colours and the grainy texture of the film. Certain scenes also just cut to the next, and some seem to have spooling problems, making it feel like you sitting in a bioscope in the 1970's. And that was one of the aims of the production, which formed half of the Grindhouse double feature experience along with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror. An excitingly enjoyable film experience from one of the two most innovative directors in the business. Next up, bring on the terror!",Death Proof
280,Leopold2,Typical Tarantino,9,20 March 2008,"Death Proof (directed by master Quentin Tarantino) is the second part of ""Grindhouse"" with the first being Planet Terror.Death Proof follows the story of Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), a former Hollywood stunt race car driver who targets and kills women with his ""death-proof"" stunt car.Mike goes to Austin, Texas to target a group of women whom he knows; Jungle Julia an outgoing, dope-smoking, radio DJ/fashion model meeting her old school friends for a night on the town whom are sentimental model Arlene, and local bad-girl Shanna, as well as bar-nut hippie Pam who tries to make Mike notice her, unaware of his sociopath and misogynist tendencies.He then goes to Tennessee where he targets another group of girls to stalk all of whom work in a motion picture.In summary, this is a fun ride and is a typical Tarantino flick with bloody violence, references to his other movies etc. Although not his best work, it's definitely a misunderstood film and includes the best car chase I've ever seen in film. 4.5/5.",Death Proof
281,codeE,It's my Mom's car.,7,9 October 2007,"After renting this and reading the other reviews I felt compelled to throw in my two cents also. First off, many reviews say that this just a pile of self serving crap. Did you see his last movie? Wasn't there such a volume of self serving crap that they had to make two piles? Secondly, many reviewers say that there are not as many movie references as to be expected. Are they the girls at the bar when Stuntman Mike is going over his resume? The movie is slow. The witty banter is good but goes on for too long. Kurt Russel saves this portion of the movie. His character is Ted Bundy like in that he is not socially inept but has enough personality that he comes off as your typical weird guy that you meet at a bar. The tension builds, the feeling of impending doom builds and then it goes on for too long. Now we know someone is going to die, Death is in the title. So the first one is the only one we give a crap about, and this drawn out. The others that want to see die, and they do, is very abrupt. Now at this point we have, in total B movie fashion, a law enforcement officer who could bring justice but because work is involved blows it off. Now we are introduced to a new set of girls. They are less annoying than the first set but not by much. Again Kurt Russel saves the day. He is so creepy lurking in the background and then the foot thing. This is where the action finally kicks in. The car chase was totally cool. The sense of speed, real actual cars, realistic accidents of the other motorists caused by two cars. I think everyone is in agreement on this. Then the end. I don't know what was with the end. Was the flurry of Stooge like punches and head squishing a tribute to Lloyd Kaufman? Anyway, I cant help but think the shorter version from the double feature was tighter and made for a better movie. So if your a fan of Kurt Russel see the whole thing, if your a gear head fast forward to the car parts.",Death Proof
282,kenvandenbussche-2,Made for men ...,7,21 October 2007,"Some of the greatest directors of all time started back in the '70s. Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and Brian De Palma all became kings of the camera because of their instant-classic masterpieces. The '80s wasn't quite so amazing for new directors, but you still had a couple of great ones though. James Cameron is without a doubt the single most talented and important innovator of the '80s. Every single movie this Canadian director made became a classic. The same could be said about Quentin Tarantino. Everything this man comes into contact with, turns into gold. Another thing that these two have in common is their love for a strong woman in the lead. I guess some directors have a very good understanding what it is that their audience wants and as such they are in a perfect position to deliver the goods and make classic after classic.Because Quentin Tarantino started his career like few had done before him. He created no less than 3 instant-classic masterpieces before slowing down. ""Reservoir dogs"", ""Pulp fiction"" and even ""Jackie Brown"" are as good as any crime movie can get. Both volumes of ""Kill Bill"" were very good, but simply not of the same superb quality. With his latest movie, he - yet again - lowers the bar one nudge even though he is more than capable of keeping up that same highest quality that his first three films had. Luckily: he seems to be aware of this, because at times he deliberately numbs down this movie to a lesser quality. ""Death proof"" contains a few premeditated errors in both audio and video. The movie is a throwback homage to '70s films and to be appreciated, it has to be seen in that context. Quentin Tarantino's fifth film does indeed have many similarities with Steven Spielberg's first film ""Duel"". The latter one is about a meek, middle-aged businessman driving cross-country on a work-related mission and the psychopathic truck driver who spends an entire day chasing him with the intent to kill.""Death proof"" however tells a slightly different story of Stuntman Mike, a stuntman with a sick taste for using his car to terrorize women. Just like the Spielberg-movie ""Duel"", there isn't much of a story in ""Death proof"". Spielberg mainly focused on the actual chase between the two men whilst Tarantino splits his movie in half and shows us two different groups of women who have nothing in common with each other ... besides that they both become the victims of a scarred stuntman ruthlessly driving his death-proof car to execute his murderous plans.The first part of the movie focuses mostly on the women and thus contains a lot of nonsense dialogs. Ironically enough: all this talking is never any boring. Then again: Quentin Tarantino has always had a knack for making even the longest and most mundane dialogs interesting. What also helps is that this movie is packed with voluptuous women and the film doesn't shy away from wanting to show this in a very confronting manner. That's why an extensive lapdance is included in the first part. The most awesome moment is without a doubt the car crash which is shown multiple times from each woman's point-of-view. In between both parts, we get a small and relaxing little hospital scene.The second part starts in a similar way and shows us a new group of beautiful women who talk about pretty much everything from fashion magazines to personal relationships. As before: they are targeted by Stuntman Mike, but this time things do not go down the same road. Part two concentrates less on the women and more on the action. This part has a pretty exciting chase where eventually the tables are turned. The end of ""Death proof"" is both abrupt and absurd but somehow we could have expected such a thing from Quentin Tarantino. It's a rare thing that a director gets that kind of freedom to do whatever he wants.The acting in ""Death proof"" is good but not great. Kurt Russell clearly enjoys the part of Stuntman Mike and I have to admit that this performance is one of his best. The women do fine but it's hard to be objective when so much beauty is thrown in your face. I suppose the best acting performance by any of the women is either Vanessa Ferlito (whom you may recognize as Claudia in ""24: Season 3"") or Sydney Poitier as Jungle Julia. She doesn't only have the same name as Oscar winning actor Sidney Poitier but she is also related. They are daughter and father. Quentin Tarantino also makes a cameo as a bartender.In short: ""Death proof"" is a good movie but only for those who thoroughly love the works by Quentin Tarantino. This film is an obvious homage to '70s movies and as such it's been modified to look like that. Even so: I can't help thinking that Quentin Tarantino can do a lot better. One thing's for sure though: he is an extremely versatile director as he taps into a lot of different film genres.",Death Proof
283,BruddanChrist,Rather disappointing...,7,25 May 2008,"I love Quentin Tarantino's movies. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are among my favorites, Jackie Brown was a great movie, and Kill Bill Vol. 1 was pure fun. Up til now, Kill Bill Vol. 2 was my only Tarantino disappointment.Death Proof had a lot of potential. Besides being paired with Robert Rodriguez's crazy fun Planet Terror, it had an intriguing story with a seductively creepy antagonist (brilliantly executed by Kurt Russell). It fell short, however, more than it succeeded.I'll start with the good stuff. Kurt Russell is without a doubt the highlight of the movie. Tarantino's unique characterization really allows Russell to perform in ways I've never seen before. The end product is, in my opinion, Oscar-worthy. You can't help but root for the guy, even when he is being a total bastard.The story is very interesting. It's very grindhouse and quite original. The action sequences kick ass, too. The car chase near the end of the movie is extremely suspenseful and honestly unpredictable (up to a certain point, that is).That's about it for me. Now the bad.The plot is good, but it unfolds very unevenly. It starts off really slow, picks up a bit, then slows down even more, then picks up again and leaves you hanging in the middle of an adrenaline rush. Maybe some folks like that, but it didn't sit well with me. I like closure.My biggest qualm with the film is the dialogue. Normally, I love Tarantino's quirky dialogue, but there's way too much of it here. And worse, it's all girl-talk. ""I'm doing this guy,"" ""She's such a whore,"" ""I really like him, but I'm not sure."" No guy is going to sit though forty minutes of that. And the stretches between action sequences (all two of them) are so long that it's easy to forget what movie you're watching.Death Proof is worth seeing once or twice for Kurt Russell, but certainly not worth owning. Don't expect much and you'll be entertained.",Death Proof
284,Shakor77,Awful is not enough to describe this,1,30 December 2007,"When I was introduced to Tarantinos movies with Reservoir Dogs and then Pulp Fiction I thought the guy was a genius. He made movies that were smart, with cool dialog and a compelling story that was somehow both believable and unbelievable. And the characters in those movies felt genuine. Yet after those two movies he has gone downhill and Death Proof is where he finally drove of the cliff.The movie starts quite nice with sexy women and a mean looking American classical muscle car which is driven by a at the beginning very cool and scary Kurt Russel.However without spoiling too much the movie start to lose it when you find out the intentions Kurt Russel, or rather his cheesy character with the name Stuntman-Mike, and how he carries out his intentions. Totally unbelievable and ridiculous, contrary to both of the movies that I mentioned above which had scenes that were unbelievable yet you could feel that it could happen.But at that moment I felt that well the movie could still be saved if he somehow finished the second part in a better way. Buy was I up for a disappointment because the second half of the movie was surreal. The characters exhibit a behavior that was completely and utterly absurd, like taken from some kind of weird hardcore version of Charlies Angels. Also Kurt Russels characters takes a U-Turn, from a calculating, mean looking bad ass, psycho to a weeping, pathetic, common hooligan. It is like they changed his character in the middle of the movie.This is the last Tarantino movie that I will ever watch, I could have forgiven him for the pointless, bloodbath of the Kill Bill movies but this? No, Tarantino has sadly completely lost it.",Death Proof
285,addicott,Laughed my ass off!,9,14 March 2008,"The ""missing reels"" and added film scratches are an unnecessary contrivance. Try as they do to emulate the ""Grindhouse"" drive-in movie, they can't hide the fact that everything about this film is very much A-list. And that's a good thing.Quentin Tarrantino has always had the ability to make me laugh, even as I'm clinging to the edge of my seat. This movie is no different. Some decry the vast quantities of dialogue that occupy most of the film's run time. I can tell you I enjoyed every second of it.Tarrantino has a knack for reviving actors whose talents have been wasted by lesser filmmakers. This time it's Kurt Russell's turn to shine in the best role of his life and be 100% genuine badass.Of course, the whole thing hinges on a big car chase - apparently the whole premise of this project was for QT to test his mettle and hopefully do the best chase ever. I don't know that he's completely blown away the likes of Vanishing Point, Bullitt or Magnum Force, but it's certainly comparable, in terms of visceral excitement.This combined with the dramatic weight (if you want to call it that) yielded a finale that made me want to whoop and holler out loud. It's been quite some time since a movie has had that effect on me. So congratulations, Quentin; you've done it again.",Death Proof
286,Twilight_Wraith,Problematic on every level,3,21 October 2007,"Don't get me wrong, I am not offended by the blood and gore in the film. I want to say that the gore was actually kept to a minimum. What did offend me however is that there's way too much talking for the first 40 minutes of the film. This group of four girls talk and talk forever and ever about sex, drugs and alcohol. Finally, the movie starts to pick up steam and something finally happens. However, we are then introduced to yet ANOTHER group of four girls who are stunt women. We are forced to watch them drive about. They talk about sex, then they talk to one another about guns and sex in a diner, then they talk a farmer into lending them his car, then finally something happens. The last twenty minutes are dynamite. Problem is that it's too little, too late. The ending is quite kick-ass, but it seems to me the movie had to limp on and on just to get to that point. I was quite disappointed and unless you find inane babble about drugs and sex to be entertaining, I think you will be too.",Death Proof
287,KnowOne1988,The woods are lovely,10,14 December 2008,"Artistically, Death Proof is amazing. It is designed to look like an older film which is a nice break from all the high-tech crap they through at us now a days. Stylistic, this movie is a beauty, the choppy scenes or the skipping/relapsing scenes they use for transitions, the static, the black in white film that eventually turns back to color, all of it gold.What really makes this movie, and most movies, are the ladies though. Jungle Juice is scandalous, Butterfly is interesting, all the ladies are characters. I like this movie because it's like, finally, a movie that depicts real women. God, most movies got our gender all wrong. They either make us too girly and ditsy or too controlling and bad-ass, like the Jolie flicks, but this film really hits on actual female behavior. I see one of my friends in each of these girls. Not to mention, the dialog is fantastic. All the conversations are so interesting. Each scene is so original.I have watched this film a handful of times and i never get sick of it. I always find something new, and though it is kind of a horror film, it is so funny, and witty. It's genius how they make the Robert Frost poem so creepy, almost a death sentence.All in all, this movie is a good time.",Death Proof
288,TheBkMogul,Think hard about it after your initial viewing,6,7 August 2010,"OK, this is a strange film to review. On one hand, you've got a maniacal Kurt Russell (is it just me or does Quentin seem to resurrect former stars?) mowing down girls, and that's fun and all. On the other hand, you've got loads of dialogue. You may say, well Quentin wrote it so it must be good. Problem is, most of is sleep-inducing. It pains me to write that is Quentin written some great films, but the extended chat sequences with the ladies is bogged down by needless filler that really goes nowhere in the end. However, I enjoyed a few of the performances (most notably Poitier, Russell, and Ferlito) and the car sequences are more than enough to recommend this film to action fans. It just quite a bit of time to get to said sequences. A let-down in some aspects, but still enjoyable nevertheless.",Death Proof
289,Rosettes,30% Fun......70% Boredom,6,19 June 2010,"When one looks at the notes of why scenes were left out of a movie, it is often because ""they needed to get the story going"".This movie, alas, has so much footage that didn't get the story going. For whatever reason why, one is sitting there wondering when is something going to happen.The chase/death scenes are wonderful. The seduction as it happens is enticing. The popping of the surprise on the innocent friend is a beaut. The thoughts of a Texas Ranger who realizes that sometimes, the dragon wins are ideal. The villain is excellent...............but there is so much darn meaningless talking going on, minute after minute, that one is ready to reach for the aspirin for the headache that is screaming at the dribble. It may be wonderful acting, but for a movie about murder, chase, and revenge, it's not wanted.There is one other downer part of the movie. One wants to feel for the victims. What a waste, they didn't deserve that, and such. There were a few victims where that could happen.But as the movie goes on, it seems the despicable level of the victims increases, making the final group not very likable at all and actually, something of a criminal. They do illegal drugs, they drive drunk, they put innocents in the path of danger, they don't care who gets in their way, they have no respect for the property of others, they have no remorse for their actions which hurts others. It may be that last element where they actually cross the line and become part of the bad and that's a deadly mistake in story telling.A story cannot exist with bad fighting bad; somewhere on one side, there has to be an element of good. Bond may be ruthless, but he does so on orders of a government. In most if not all Death Wish movies, Kersey has an element of regret of what he has become involved in.But when the good side of a movie starts moving with ""We are going to do what we want and we don't care who gets hurt."" then they start losing parts of the audience because the audience wants to root for the heroes, the good guys.Quentin Tarantino may make some wonderful movies, but he has to remember that he is a movie maker, not a historian. He's got to remember that part of his worth comes from being known for making good movies and this was not one of his better ones.",Death Proof
290,p_jones92,Superb movie deserving of a much wider audience,8,30 September 2007,"I had the fortune to see Grindhouse - the double bill feature from Tarantino and Rodriguez - and it was blast, and they deserve high praise for getting the corporate machines to provide us with nearly 4 hours of top entertainment for $10 rather than releasing 2 separate movies (as they have done overseas, and as they did with Kill Bill). Anyone who didn't go see it has really missed out, and anyone who deliberately didn't go see it because they didn't want to sit through two movies is an idiot. Grindhouse is great, but I have to say I enjoyed Death Proof more than Planet Terror, so couldn't wait to see the extended cut of Death proof on DVD. Having watched the extended cut, it really is a masterpiece, but I would have to say not as enjoyable as the shorter version in Grindhouse.Don't get me wrong, the extra footage is great, superb direction, acting and dialog, but it just slows the pace of the movie too much. As individual scenes they can't be faulted, they are superb, but the extended periods of a lack of action, in what is supposed to be a B- movie, are just a tad too much. However, this does make the ending action sequence that much better, because you've been dying for it, and it really delivers, easily in the top 3 greatest car chases ever seen on film. The stunts, directing, score are all superb, and interact to create a perfect automobile orgasm of action.Tarantino once again proves his mastership of direction. Every shot is the right shot at the right time, I mean it's perfect, it can not be faulted, he get's 11 out of 10 for direction. The cinematography is great too, it's a beautiful picture to look at, such vivid colors. The acting is top notch, and a great cast, once again proving to studios that you don't need star names to make a great movie. Tarantino should be commended for this movie, it goes against the grain of formulaic studio blockbusters, and concentrates on telling a good story in an exceptional way. I mean if you look at the premise, a mad stunt car driver attacking girls in his stunt car, and compare it to the premise of Ghost Rider, Spiderman or any of the other action movies this summer, then this story sounds the weakest but in reality, it's the strongest, with great character development and storytelling, and put's the studio blockbusters and their multi-million dollar scripts to shame.A superb movie overall, a few cuts to speed the pacing of the movie would've made it a 10 out of 10 for sure.",Death Proof
291,Bioweapon,Unlike Palet Terror this one was pure crap,3,20 January 2010,"Saw Planet Terror and I found it a good tribute to B class movies.But when it comes to this one, I felt like I wasted 110 minutes of my life: 1) no action, you get two scenes only, each one lasting about 10 minutes, the rest of the movie is pure chit-chat 2) I ended up hating all the characters, excepting K Russell 3) though it seems to be some character development (the idea of Tarantino with all the chit-chat in this movie was to give us certain notions on the nature of the characters), you get to a point in which you don't give a sh*t about who they are and want you want is action 4) in the second part the story doesn't show you how does Russell gets to know where the second group of girls was going to be 5) dialogs don't allow you to know anything on Russell's character 6) the end of the movie was sh*tty/cheesy/crappy/a total piece of bullsh*t and did not add to the movie",Death Proof
292,gingerrdriley,Kurt Russell? They should call him Cute Russell.,8,17 February 2017,"Death Proof feels like a distillation of the things which make make Quentin Tarantino exceptional as a director. This film is wonderful, but it's almost contradictory in nature in that there isn't necessarily a narrative drive in the conventional sense. The premise and thriller tone might lead one to believe that this film will be a heart pounding thrill ride, but I think that if you walk into it with that sort of expectation you might find at a certain point that you've become a bit confused or frustrated. You might be pleasantly surprised. I was. Probably though, it would serve your experience better to understand clearly what you're getting into. One of, if not the, greatest strengths of Tarantino as a writer is his mastery of dialogue. It is perhaps the most engrossing aspects of his film making and I've yet to see a film of his that wasn't absolutely exceptional in this aspect. That's very fortunate for any viewer of this film, because the speaking to action ratio is pretty high. Easily well over an hour of this film is the simplest kind of scene, which is people talking. Talking in a bar, talking in a car, talking outside. There is no shortage of talking in this film. If you aren't a fan of the way Tarantino writes conversation then this film will be an absolute nightmare for you. For everyone else, myself included, you'll find a wonderful energy and flow to this film which drives it in a way that nonstop action and excitement really can't. There is action though. This film doesn't lack a sense of urgency in its entirety. The more conventional thriller aspects are executed very well, with the sort of recurring winks to the audience which is integral to the nature of a grindhouse send up such as this. The reservation in use of action actually gives the more adrenaline-fueled segments a nice sort of pay off after an arguably excessive amount of build up. If you find that you can't get into the conversational portion of this film, I somewhat doubt that you'll find it worthwhile to sit through it for what remains.I think the simplest way to sum up Death Proof is that it's just watchable. I of course don't mean that in a derogatory sense. It just has such a feeling of effortlessness in how it flows for nearly two hours on almost nothing but people sort of just hanging out and shooting the breeze. It's may not be a conventional thriller, but really, that's what makes it so great.",Death Proof
293,nigel-18854,Is this where it all started to go wrong?,4,12 November 2017,"I feel bad about this, bad mouthing Quentin because he's one of the few who's been on our side. No matter how much cloggy sentimentalised pap the US film industry threw at as, Quentin would be there giving us the stuff that would make a cold night in with just a stack of DVD's, some beer and maybe a few mates in from the pub bearable. Something went wrong with this flick though, it's still got its fair share of the Tarantino flair; those 2+ dialogues executed through his sense of Jo ha kyu that's served him so well. It' just that it all goes wrong in the third act and that kind of frizzles with the whole vibe of the flick.What should happen is Mike gets away with the second murderous attack after a gruelling and bloody ordeal. And then the alternate ending is tagged on body snatchers style, to show him being dealt justice and our heroines making a miraculous return. Instead though, he continues with girly revenge theme but instead of the righteous vindication of Kill Bill it's all a bit miss timed and weak. Of course my ending is a teeny bit contrived, it's just supposed to illustrate the point that Quentin has maybe swallowed a bit too much of the stuff his critics have levelled at him. As a consequence, lately it seems as if he's been chasing -right-on- credits both with his later films and his public pronouncements.",Death Proof
294,tonysharp,"A gratuitous use of feet, butt, and English language",5,5 September 2007,"Yeah yeah yeah ... Tarantino was trying to make a ""grindhouse b-movie"", but Grindhouse wasn't bad enough to be a b-movie, or good enough to be enjoyed on its own terms. Deathproof had many of Tarantino's trademarks, most of which were done so to the extreme it annoyed me.I enjoyed the editing and camera work more than anything, but not even the excessive style could save the film from being a brutal bore during the endless talking scenes. And by endless I do mean endless.If I wanted to sit and listen to people casually chat about every little thing that has happened or is happening in their lives I'd go sit at a bar or listen to talk radio. I can understand the appeal of listening to people chatting; it adds to the depth and realism of the characters in a scene. But I don't go to the movies to see something I can see down the street.Aside from the talking, and the gratuitous foot and butt shots, it was okay.

Amateurish, dull, lifeless, the film fails on just about every level. The action is brief, the dialogue juvenile, verbose and repetitive, the plot nonsensical, the acting cardboard. Worse still the film completely misses the spirit of the 70's road movies it attempts to parody. A clumsy attempt at scratching the film-stock and splicing a few jumpy edits does nothing to make this film feel even vaguely authentic. You'll need a whole jar of coffee just to keep awake through this plodding mess. Typical Tarantino-esquire attempts at hip-ness fall flat on their face every time and are all wildly misplaced. Which is all a shame because this could have been a sort of ""Thelma and Lousie meet Vanishing Point"" of a movie rather than something that looks like a Z-grade film student effort. Risible and awful beyond belief.",Death Proof
296,kalay,Achieved from the point of Tarantino,8,21 June 2007,"Tarantino separated the story into two parts. Second part of the movie, in reality, is the beginning of the story. This part began with the black and white scenes which indicate the past. There are girls related with Hollywood and one of them is a stuntwoman. Kurt Russell just try to have fun, did not show lunatic behaviours. Probably after girl's revenge he became crazy about lonely girls. Then, we suddenly find ourselves in first part. He called himself as stuntman, he furnished his car plexiglas cabinet etc.As expected from Tarantino I find the movie successful. Tarantino tried to show us characters at the movies at 70's. If we see the movie in those days, probably we would not find it strange expect handy phones etc.The girls are really very artistic. Especially Vanessa Ferlito ,as Butterfly, affects us visually. Her hula dance was so sexy and fitted into the scene. I jut get upset with Tarantino that he sent the girls too quick.I really wonder about Lee, whose friends left her with the repairman. I am sure that the repairman would ask additional things instead of the new car. The girls broke the car badly. The cars were excellent and classic. They are inevitable in such kind of speedy car movies.The story is simple. This is normal if we think the 70's movies. The action scenes are typical and delighted with Tarantino, player are cool and suit the body of the movie well. The aim was achieved from the point of Tarantino. I also enjoyed the movie.",Death Proof
297,superguapo2000,Could have used a missing reel,4,11 April 2009,"Death Proof is yet another of Quentin Tarantino's weird exercises in nostalgia. This one pays tribute to a now forgotten niche of exploitation movie: the Avenging Boring Babbling Vixen Car Slasher Chick Flick.The movie kicks off with a series of endless scenes of excruciatingly stupid dialog, in apparent homage to MTV's Real World. Tired of having to blabber at you by proxy, Tarantino himself barges in, telling you about how tame today's movies are compared to those of yesteryear -- and he's going to prove it.In comes Kurt Russell, who does a good job as the creepy and intriguing Stuntman Mike. There's some more idiotic chat, and some light parody of the grammar prevalent in today's cell-phone ""texting"" culture, done à la Austin Powers, so we can say ""OMG so true!"". Oh, and Stuntman Mike kills all the chicks.Then the whole above scenario is repeated, this time with another team of equally fascinating young women who, like so many girls nowadays, are all huge fans of ""Vanishing Point"", an obscure 70's movie that Taratino references explicitly at least three times throughout Death Proof. It all leads to another murder attempt by Mike, at which point the movie suddenly turns into a flaccid angry-broads-revenge sort of thing, and ends quite abruptly.Overall, Death Proof falls flat whether you look at it as homage or as the alternative film it hopes to be. All that distinguishes it from the typical Hollywood half-assed fluff is the absence of gratuitous product placement. If you threw in a few ads for Coca-cola and Audi, Death Proof would fit right in with the status quo.",Death Proof

I understand that Tarantino has a way with dialog, but this was purely a masturbatory exercise in script writing. Where's the action?? Ugh. It is no surprise that this was a first class flop in theaters. Kurt Russell is wasted here, and the climactic car chase is way too short.

If the movie ended here it would have been a great movie, and having Grindhouse along-side it wouldn't have felt like having 2 full length movies back-to-back for the sake of it but rather as an added bonus.Unfortunately you then have the second half: Tennessee. Which is basically a sequel within the original movie. Basically it takes everything that made the first half creepy and weird and cool and turns it into a poorly acted, kind of boring, comedy.My recommendation is to watch Texas, and enjoy it, when you get to Tennessee, perhaps have a break and prepare for a goofy sequel of the movie you just watched.I do recommend watching this movie, don't let my opinion of the second half put you off, after all if you really can't stand Tennessee, just stop watching.

Quentin uses the techniques that made him famous, and makes a movie filled with conversation very interesting.Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell, badass once more) is a stuntman who travels the country meeting girls and luring them into his ""death proof"" car. However, the car is only death proof for him, and always results in the girls' deaths. However, when Mike picks on a group of badass babes (Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms, and Zoe Bell), he may just have met his match.Viewers will complain about the long sessions of dialogue in this film. If they do, why are they watching a Quentin Tarantino film? Did you complain about the long dialogues in Pulp Fiction (The Jack Rabbit Slim's scene comes to mind)? How about the opening diner scene from Reservoir Dogs? That scene is basically recreated by Dawson, Thoms, Bell and Mary Elizabeth Winstead in one portion of the film. What, it's okay for Tarantino discuss Madonna and Steve Buscemi discuss tipping, but it's not okay to hear why Thoms' character carries a gun? The character frequently bring up pop culture as well. So what if Stuntman Mike brings up old TV shows you've never heard of? I'm sure you never heard of Get Christie Love before Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, Chris Penn and Tim Roth discussed it in Reservoir Dogs.Overall, Tarantino does not make films for the man with the attention span of Dory from Finding Nemo. Tarantino puts juice in conversations, iucluding a particularly interesting one between Michael and James Parks. Tarantino works his magic via soundtrack too. You will immediately go on iTunes to get it.A Perfect 10, and I cannot wait for more efforts from Quentin Tarantino.",Death Proof
301,jayce2279,Surprisingly entertaining,10,11 June 2007,"Death Proof is Quentin Tarantino's homage to the B movie genre form the late 60s, 70s and early 80s. Keep this in mind when you watch this film. Like the original low budget flicks, this film has very bad picture quality and sound, terrible editing, silly dialogue, revealing mistakes and bad acting. Of course, these characteristics were all accidental or due to a lack of talent in the original movies, whereas Tarantino has deliberately added these ""mistakes"" in order to recreate the feel of the old films. This might be a bit confusing or even annoying during the first half hour or so, because, unlike 30 years ago, this movie is not shown in a Grindhouse but a modern theater and you can't help but notice that the bad editing is deliberate and therefor misses the charm of the old B movies. Also, the fact that the film is set in 2007 but shot in a way that would be below standard even 30 years ago, slightly removes the charm it would have had, had it been set in the 70s. However, this changes about 30 min into the movie when cell phones, MP3 players and Japanese automobiles are replaced by muscle cars, references to cult classics and John Hughes movies, old school car chases, stunts and your typical Quentin Tarantino dialogues and soundtrack. The uncut European version could have done without some of the more boring conversations at the beginning of the film, though, but Kurt Russell more than makes up for this when he uses his old charm to talk Vanessa Ferlito into a lap dance and by the end of the film real life stunt woman Zoe Bell and Tracie Thoms will have you roaring with laughter as they seek to get even with Stuntman Mike. Although Death proof might not be quite as impressive as House of 1000 Corpses or The Devil's Rejects, it definitely is just as much fun.",Death Proof
302,DrTeeth007,A poor teen film at best.,1,2 September 2007,"I was so disappointed on seeing this film. I expected a film with Quentin Torrentino's involvement to have lots of action and suspense. This film had none of those essential QT ingredients.It took ages for the film to get going. For the first 30 minutes or so, it was a formulaic teen flick...the sort where you want the cast to die a horrible death FOR REAL. This was not helped by being heavy on the minority stereotypes...the darker the skin, the more the character's head moved when they spoke.After that initial boring bit, we got about 5 minutes' of excellent action. One had hoped that this was it...action all the way to the end. It was not to be, it went 'teen flick' for ages again. I gave up watching this about 20-30 minutes from the end as it was 'teen flickish' for too long without any action. During this second part of the film, the main character was conspicuous by his absence.I almost lost the will to live during this waste of film. Every single Tarrentino film that I have seen has had me totally gripped from beginning to end...except this one.",Death Proof
303,guycorhuo,"Trash, garbage, sh.t...disappointment",1,31 August 2007,"Being a Tarantino fan, i can't believe how bad this movie is. The problem isn't that pretends to have the same poor look of the trash movies/ exploitation movies of the seventies. The very big problem it's how much boring it is. I don't know the Grindhouse version, but this extended one it's awful. Just the five minutes in the middle and the last half hour brights like Tarantino use to astonish. But the rest of the movie, with those eternal conversations about/full of nothing - the Tarantino's touch so great in the rest of his filmography - seems made by someone who imitates Tarantino more than the real one. I believe is specially in these parts where Tarantino is too accommodated to his own style. And he believes that to repeat his touch is enough to satisfy his fans. I think that if the people in U.S.A. would suffer the European version the rating never will be so high. I would like to know other opinions. My rating 1 over 10",Death Proof
304,Survive_Kino,"Tarantino motor madness movie, an ex stuntman gets his kicks from killing women with his car, then he meets some stunt-women who can match his motor.",6,24 September 2007,"The film oozes with Tarantino's conventions, the script betrays his anally retentive obsessive compulsion from which he is identifiable in almost every conversation and the mise-en-scene is stylised far beyond the point of realism, but who cares when that means unbelievably beautiful women and undeniably cool automobiles? Some of the best chase sequences in cinema history, a carefully selected slick score of blues, soul, rock n roll and some very memorable one-liners make this a classic. However the film is certainly not without faults. There are no characters in the film with whom Tarantino encourages the audience to consistently identify; large chunks of the film are wasted on story lines for characters whose part has no significance to the plot, these include the supermodel Lee and the Texas rangers amongst others. Kurt Russell as stunt-man Mike is as cool as ice, however there is no redemption nor satisfaction for his character, I suspect Tarantino intended to punish the sadism of the male viewer who bays for the blood of the fetishised, scantily clad women he so clearly adores.",Death Proof
305,General_Cromwell,"Great fun, but way to long!",8,22 September 2007,"I'm sure Death Proof is much better seen with its partner, 'Planet Terror' in Grindhouse. But alas, here in England we have to see them separately, at least until the Grindhouse double bill DVD comes out! Death Proof is still great fun though, and fans of the low budget 'grindhouse' genre are going to be in seventh heaven. The scratches, jumps and dirt on the print have all been lovingly added to add to the effect. You could argue that this is nothing more than cinematic masturbation, and casual cinema goers will be totally bemused by it all. But then Tarantino has never tried to satisfy the masses. The film itself has some great moments in it, and contains one of Tarantino's most shocking sequences yet, that will leave you stunned. There's also a kick ass car chase that looks incredibly dangerous with a neat twist in the outcome. Even Tarantino die-hards will find some of the dialogue tedious though, the chats between the females is incredibly dull and you'll find yourself examining your watch during these scenes, that go on way to long and add to the films already overlong running time. This is Kurt Russells film though, its a great performance and the film comes alive whenever he's on screen. So on its own, not a classic, but although it is way to long, its still well worth a look, especially if your a fan of the low budget exploitation genre. Great soundtrack as well!",Death Proof
306,misterlinder,Death Proof,10,8 March 2010,"Death Proof is an action movie made by Quentin Tarantino. The subject is about stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) who terrorises women with his Muscle Cars in Texas. In the end three women in a '70 Dodge Challenger turn the whole thing and finally beat Mike quite hard. The movie is an homage to the B-movies of the 1970's and it does very well on this. With cool dialogues, cool car stunts and an overall bunch of action it keeps the viewer eyes nailed to the TV until the end. I really think people who like this kind of movies should watch it because it's really a masterpiece of Quentin Tarantino. The composition of all the different things make it quite different to other movies and there is no time when this all could get boring.",Death Proof
307,bleakeye,A Mastery Of Film-making vs.Much Hyped Nostalgia Piece,9,7 February 2008,"After the trio of ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Jackie Brown"", a review of any work from Quentin Tarantino must always be about the director/screenwriter himself. As painful as it is to feed anymore compliments on his abilities in screen writing, he truly did revolutionize the way films are made. Not the non-linear nature of movies nor the stylized violence but the way his characters approach the situations he creates for them makes him an original. It's 'all in the dialogue' for the filmmaker as obviously seen and heard in this film. An interesting observation, Tarantino's forte in his writing doesn't appear to be dialogue but in his character development. A hugely unfortunate decision then, it seems that this ""Grindhouse""/'B-Film' idea would be the way to showcase his latest original work. Had this film not been involved in this project, it would be obvious to most anyone the quality of his work. His films doesn't pander to trends and pop-culture but actually creates them in a seemingly intentional manner. It is annoying, but that doesn't mean were being subjected to a feature-length advertisement. There is content in all his works and it is also here in this one.Packaged alongside Robert Rodriguez's movie and several trailers celebrating the 'Grindhouse' experience, this film doesn't fit in very well. It looks like the bad second movie of a double-bill show, which it turns out to be... but this complete version, separate from those other works proves very much that he has turned out another excellent film along the lines of his ""Kill Bill"" volumes.As with what he's done with ""Kill Bill"", Tarantino has taken aspects(gimmicks... it seems) of(mostly from) certain genres and turns it into an original, diverting, entertaining film. It's been said that what he's personally 'into' at a particular point in time is what makes it into his films and it seems true. But personal prejudices aside, one sees a mastery of the medium and a deep appreciation for it coming from a talented filmmaker that is truly impressive. This is the quality one hopes to see from future releases.Seen as a work amongst traditional 'Grindhouse' movie, ""Death Proof"" apparently fails with it's excessive dialogue-ridden scenes and inappropriate 'homages'. Seen as another piece from Tarantino's 'canon' it's something else entirely and it's actually, genuinely great.",Death Proof
308,ForCenturies,"Hilarious, intentionally. ""Scream"" meets ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" (not that Angelina Jolie BS)",8,7 October 2011,"I began learning about making films earlier this year (2011) because ever since seeing Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams (or more specifically, the 10 minute film school on the DVD), I have been gangbusters on becoming a film-maker. Not necessarily a director, at least not so much now, but a person who makes moving pictures with sound that entertain people. It's a magical phenomenon when you feel moved, excited, when you cringe, when you laugh, when you cry at a purely fictional piece of work flickering before your eyes.Of course, most wannabe-film-makers quote Quentin Tarantino as an influence, or more often, the guy we most want to be making the films we want to make. Of course, reading that sentence, you could think ""There's nothing wrong with that. Make what you want to make, sounds awesome."" However, I think Hollywood, or the viewing public, seem to put so much onto first-timers that hit it big (refer to the recent example of Diablo Cody and Jennifer's Body, a wonderful horror-comedy that never found its audience, obviously on the heels of the smash-hit Juno, which is equally as wonderful). However, I wouldn't jump onto Quentin's defence, especially not in recent years.Everyone seems to have seen Kill Bill, and because they do, they're automatically a connoisseur of film. And let me set the record straight - ""volume"" two is much better than one. It's odd - compare the films and they're almost apples and oranges. Volume One will be the cotton candy, the popcorn - in other words, the snack foods that don't quite fill you up. Not much actually happens in the film. It's all set up for volume two, to which two is a brilliant pay-off, a three-course dinner that leaves you full and satisfied. Full of actual character, hilarious wink-and-nod moments, it's the much more satisfying of the two films.Then along came Death Proof. Of course, another part two of an entire film ""Grindhouse"", that, too, failed to find an audience beyond its niche target of males 18-35 who love b- movies. The concept of making a b-movie with A-list stars and a huge budget is actually contradictory to philosophy of b-movie-making, however, for Death Proof, I can probably let it slide.Having seen the film for more times than I care to count, able to recite entire conversations alone, let's just say I'm familiar with it. Having re-watched it around four years after its release to the world and having a grind house break (both movies were wearing out their welcome) I can genuinely say that Death Proof can suck you right back in.People complain nothing happens, and that's kind of the point. It's anticipation. Wonder why the second set of girls are from the film-world, and not the music-world like the first set? Because it takes ages to make a film, months, even years, and you end up with ninety minutes of coherent footage. If you think about it, it kinda seems a waste, but if done right, you end up with some of the most amazing, funny, moving, and above all else entertaining ninety minutes you can ever see. Best of all, you can relive it with DVDs and Blu-Rays, but I digress. It takes ages to get to the first car crash, but goddamn it's worth it. It takes ages to get to the heart-stopping climax, but goddamn: it's worth it. This movie is all about anticipation, all about being rewarded with the most thrilling car chase ever filmed for waiting. Besides, you have to build these girls up, build up their personalities, their relationships and make them likable, and if you don't do that, the climax is for nought. Tarantino may not be the second coming of film, as most of his movies, after seeing them all multiple times seem to blur together (dialogue was beginning to run too long in Death Proof and especially in Inglourious Basterds), and you may never like the guy. However, Death Proof is a laugh-riot, a wink-and-nod homage to the amalgamation of slasher movies and car chase movies at once (think Scream meets Gone In 60 Seconds, and as Tracie Thoms' character puts it - ""not that Angelina Jolie BS""). Kurt Russell is the ultimate bad-ass who becomes an absolute pussy once the girls turn the tables, making the hunter become the hunted in a wonderfully devilish (again) part two of the climax. Having done this film course for most of the year, I've been taught quite a bit about character and character development, and unfortunately (or fortunately, however you want to look at it), most characters don't have gripping, or for that fact apparent, character arcs. They just ""are"". However, this is an auto-slasher. Who really cares? I just bring it up due to noticing the only one of the girls who actually has an arc is Abernathy (Rosario Dawson) who turns from a somewhat snobbish ""I'll tell on you"" kind of girl (who's still likable, of course) to, in a snap moment during ""ship's mast"", a bad ass, cemented by the line ""Let's kill this bastard"".I have rambled on long enough and I doubt anyone will actually read this. However, I felt impulsed to write up a review-cum-essay on Death Proof, and Quentin Tarantino, warts and all, having realised how much I not only love this film, but film in general. It's manipulation, of course...but it's the good manipulation. Just don't get me started on Inglourious Basterds' problems.",Death Proof

It's a respectful tribute to the car chase films of the 70's, and a revenge flick (among other things). I'm not going to sit here and write a detailed review, only because along with the (1) scores we have a few (10's) as well and the writing for these (10's) is spot on. I can't add to that.

311,joharitaylor,Death Inducing,2,20 March 2008,"What can one say about this movie that hasn't already been said? This movie is torture! The completely unsympathetic female characters are all irritating as hell, all smug as can be, thinking that they are all so hot to trot (which most of them aren't). Dislikable characters I can take, but then to have to endure 95 minutes of vapid, try-hard cool dialogue was unbearable. I don't mind dialogue heavy movies as long as they PROGRESS the plot. The dialogue in this did nothing of the sort and was a demonstration of Tarantino on an ego trip trying to demonstrate his ""talent"" for writing witty dialogue.I was actually extremely happy when the first (better looking) group of girls were slaughtered by Stuntman Mike. I was hoping that would be the start of mayhem and murder, but no, instead we get introduced to another bunch of girls who are even more detestable then the first group. I just knew they were going to win as Tarantino seems to be on some sort of mission to provide the 21st Century with Alpha-Females (if I can borrow a term a fellow reviewer has already used) to kick the ass of macho men the world over. I'm sorry, but this is getting really annoying. I am all for the demonstration of strong female characters, but not at the expense of making men look whiny, desperate, evil, perverted and just all round pathetic. Is Tarantino a feminist in disguise?!?!? Anyway, this has all been said before by others, but let me give you some advice, watch Planet Terror, it's infinitely more entertaining. There is more entertainment in the first 5 minutes than in the whole of Death Proof. It is a pity that a character like Stuntman Mike was wasted on a film like this. While I've never been a huge Tarantino fan, most of his other movies were generally quite good. Let's hope this movie is an exception for Tarantino.",Death Proof

The first problem is the dialog, which banal and stupid. You know, in Pulp Fictions how all the dialog was crafted with nano-precision and filled with humour and coolness? Well, this is the exact opposite. The characters are boring 1 dimensional dullards that are completely unlikeable, hell I was rooting for the villain. The story is garbage and paper thin. So I'm watching this movie debating whether to cut my losses and turn it off, 'but', i tell myself 'the action sequences are coming up, that'd make all this dreck worth while.' Oh how wrong I was. The scenes were pedestrian and utterly predictable. So at the end of this movie what are you left with: no story, no characters, no good action...in short nothing. What a w4nk job.",Death Proof

Now serveral months later I am disappointed to find that ""Grindhouse"" is no more because of the bad ticket sales I assume the powers to be decided to split the the double bill and try to get a few extra bucks for separate dvds.OK so I dealt with that so what I will bone out the extra 20 bucks to recapture the experience but wait thats not the only catch they also are releasing the two titles months apart but like a sucker I bought Death proof ""special edition"" figuring well its not a double bill but its sure to have the fake trailers and with the gritty missing reel 70s style that should be enough to recreate that atmosphere I felt in theatres well guess what they added the missing reels and more importantly none not even one fake trailer.Now don't get me wrong Death Proof Is still a awesome film but half of grindhouse was the atmosphere created with the double bill, the 70s style filming, and of course the hilarious fake trailers. Quinton Tarantino is a master of conversation and he proves that once more. The characters are all very likable with exception to the Kim character I found her irritating but the grand slam performance goes to of course kurt russel. The film also offers one of the best endings to date seriously.All I have to say this is the worst theatre to DVD translation I've ever in-countered. My advice is if you seen it in theatres and want to recreate the great experience felt months ago its not gonna happen yet not till they release the real special edition real GRINDHOUSE and I don't even want to think how long that will take and for everyone else definitely rent it everyone should see it but don't be a sucker like me and buy it!!!!",Death Proof

318,icdrgon,Not even close,1,23 September 2007,"This movie was a total disgrace to the genre and shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as movies that showed in the old Grindhouses. For those that are unaware, a Grindhouse was an establishment that showed exploitation films starting in the late 50's, in the area where I grew up it was mainly drive-ins.Some of the popular and most common titles of the Grindhouse genre are Death Race 2000, Blacula, Piranha, Boxcar Bertha, Cannibal Hookers, Shogun Assassin, Blood feast, Last House on the Left, Born Loser, Cannibal Holocaust, Dawn of the Dead, to name a very few.This film starts off boring and only has one redeeming feature that comes way too far into the film to save it and that is a car chase (possible spoiler?) that is pretty well done, but looks to be a whole lot of stunt ideas that have been weaved together to make one (way too long) chase scene. After watching this film it made me truly believe that brief and fleeting brilliance of Tarantino was truly limited to Pulp Fiction (a film that I thoroughly enjoyed) and possibly even From Dusk 'Til Dawn (a stretch) and in his case should be considered only luck but certainly not talent.The really poor box office response should be a message to all that this film rates the scrapings in the bottom of the barrel and only served to drag a much better 'Grindhouse' soon to be classic named Planet Terror down with it (poor Robert).Thank the distributors for deciding to release the DVD's separately.

319,deathscythe_42,Brilliant First Half - Disappointing Second,8,18 May 2009,"Quentin Tarantino's half of the double-feature ""Grindhouse"" is his sixth full-length feature film ""Death Proof"", a so-called exploitation flick about a stuntman who likes to terrorize women with his souped-up ride that he considers to be ""death proof."" As a huge Tarantino fan, I was very excited for this film, and while 8 stars is nothing to laugh at, I found it to be somewhat disappointing. However, this film is somewhat complicated to break down, and while overall I find it to be somewhat of a short-coming, it is definitely not without its merits.Tarantino is notorious for his style of referencing older styles of film in his movies, and with this one, he kills two birds with one stone. The film is made up of two distinct halves with a transition scene in between, each involving a different town and a separate set of women, both being terrorized by the central character, Stuntman Mike. In the first half, Tarantino pays homage to old cheesy 70's/80's horror films which usually involve young adults partying and then being stalked/terrorized by somebody or something, while part two of this flick references old gear-head racing movies like Gone in 60 Seconds and Vanishing Point. This in my opinion is the chief weakness of this movie. The 8/10 rating that I gave this film can sort of be seen as an average of a 10/10 rating I would give the first half of the movie, and a 6/10 that I would give the second half. These two distinct halves in my opinion severely hindered the momentum and purpose of the film, and the second half was far less intriguing than the first.I personally wish that Tarantino had cut out the second half entirely, and made more out of the first. The first half of the movie builds up perfectly. Some may think it starts slow, because there's a lot of talking that goes on before anything really ""happens"", but this is how I like my movies. It builds up the characters very well, and the dialogue is interesting enough that it keeps you watching. It first introduces the girls, and then it introduces Stuntman Mike. It includes a couple of cheesy scenes that hint the girls are being stalked, a reference to those old horror movies, and then it introduces the character and builds up him as it continues to build up the the characters of the girls. Stuntman Mike is played excellently by Kurt Russel, and actor who I often think seems kind of cliché but in this role was very fun to watch. I particularly enjoyed his John Wayne impersonation. This half of the movie then culminates in a fantastic climax that I find to be the high point of the movie.The movie then transitions into part two, and a major drop off. It introduces four more girl characters, and starts all over with the build-up. The dialogue here is still very good, and the characters are very interesting, but the scene isn't as well done as the first. I try not to include spoilers, but as it's mentioned on the box of the movie, i don't think it's a spoiler to say that this half builds up to and ends in a something like 14 minute car chase scene between the girls and stuntman mike that Tarantino was hoping would be one of the best car chase scenes of all time. I think that he missed the mark. The circumstances of the scene made it kind of intense but all in all it wasn't that special, and it honestly in my opinion ruined what the first half of the film started.With the first half Tarantino had a brilliant, well-built, suspenseful horror film, and if he would have taken the climax of that scene, and made it more like the first big horrific part of the movie, and then kept going with that momentum and built up that story and drug it out more, I'm sure it would have been fantastic, but instead he ended it prematurely and inserted this disappointing and in my opinion failure of a second-half, the ending of which is particularly disappointing.Part of the charm and brilliance of the first half was that you weren't sure where he was going with it. There were a few film-making jokes in there, like mistakes with the filming and strange cuts and some off-the-wall not-entirely-realistic comments that were made, and it makes you wonder if the whole thing is just a big gag, but when it gets to the point Tarantino shows you he means business. The scene is very serious, Kurt Russel is sadistic and scary, it's very intense and yes rather gruesome. However, the ending of the second half (and the whole movie itself) is almost farcical...it doesn't seem to be taking the film seriously anymore, and Kurt Russel has lost all of his scare factor.To be fair, dialogue throughout, including the second half, is excellent. Some may find it tedious but I find Tarantino's dialogue to be a treat every time. The characters generally seem to talk as if they're real people. They get off on a lot of random tangents, but they build the characters and they add depth to the movie. the majority of my 8 stars to this film is contributed by that factor.Overall because of an unnecessary transition and premature drop-off in quality, Death Proof missed the mark and had the potential to be so much more. This film is still more interesting and well done than most of the stuff that comes out these days but on a Tarantino scale it was below par. That does not mean however, that I would recommend passing the chance to see it. It's still a fun ride of a movie and is worth seeing even if just for the first half.",Death Proof
320,skradji,Grindhouse 2,8,5 October 2014,"This if you do. Tarantino gets his taste for the talks, his unwavering love for the films of the 60s and 70s. This is especially seen that hobby with a photograph dated and dirty, but somehow more cool and puts us in much better than the situation in the second half. Talks between the girls are fun and shows us again so the fans ¨ Female Tarantino, or in short, his love of women, his way of speaking, behaving, his feet ...... The film is really not much action, all reserves for the final leg, but is equally entertaining and enjoyable by the skill with which Quentin handles it all, proving that indeed is a genius and a lover of cinema. There is also stored certain nods to his own films, as the pair of cops father and son number 1 of Kill Bill. Kurt Russell is immense, but this time Tarantino has failed to take advantage of it all, it has made ​​a mistake. A Russell is seen as comfortable and charismatic psychopath maniac, and should have had more scenes and prominence. Highlights: Russell torturing and killing blond girl without even touching on car specialist, sensual dancing girl Russell at the bar, the front shock of the cars of friends and Rusell, beautifully filmed, and the said end, which is frantic and funny at the same time, the change of roles. Finishing with an THE END, as in the old Kung Fu movies.",Death Proof

What you actually get in Death Proof is an hour and twenty minutes of a couple girlfriends smoking dope, drinking and hanging out listening to a great soundtrack. So in a nutshell this movie is like going out to dinner with your wife and her seven best friends and while they talk non-stop, you get glimpses of Mad Max being played on a television far off in the distance. Not a terrible movie by any stretch, but one that will probably leave you scratching your head wondering where the hell Quentin went off to.",Death Proof
322,konya-s,Underrated!,10,4 August 2008,"Mr. Tarantino was always my favorite director. Well, not THE favorite, but I really like his movies, I think he's one of the most original movie makers ever lived, and - in my opinion - he doesn't repeated himself. Always something new, something different, one genre after another, but the most important thing is: he is Tarantino! When you see a Tarantino-picture, you will know that it's HIS movie! From the greatness of the dialogs, the camera-work, and from the story, that is very simple, you've seen somewhere else, but not in that way. This is QT's universe. You never know what's gonna happen in the next scene, who's gonna die, or raped or who's gonna cry. Full of surprises! Now this movie is very stylish, it has very dirty language (like in every Tarantino-movie), and it has very very memorable scenes. Scenes that you will remember 'til the day you die. For example, the car-chase-scene. Transformers has car chase, and many movie has car chase, but this IS the real deal! Fast, adrenaline-filled, and you can't breathe. You're jumping, and screaming while the girls kicks Mike's ass! It's glorious, believe me! Violent as hell, but this not the 'Scorsese-type' of violence, it's a bit cartoonish, like the Tom & Jerry.As a Grindhouse-flick it works but better if you see this movie as a Tarantino-film.",Death Proof

324,kezopster,"Sigh, not even a good grindhouse flick",6,12 September 2007,"First off, Kurt Russell is wonderful in this movie, though don't expect to seem much of him in this flick.The fuzzy, scratched pictures... the sound gimmicks, etc., all add the sense of time warp, and for those old enough to remember seeing movies like this at a drive-in through a tinny speaker... it's a bit of a trip down memory lane. Not always a welcomed trip, but forgiven in favor of artistic integrity.Also, interesting is his use of 70's era fashions, cars, and locations... while still keeping the movie squarely in the 21st century (one of the characters carries a cell phone and texts a friend, for example). Again, artistic and this time, highly welcomed.Flaws? Plenty of them in my opinion. First off, the plot. While the killer is nice and menacing, he doesn't kill enough to establish his threat. Secondly, entirely too much time is spent listening to the women ramble on about one thing or another. While vaguely entertaining at time, it seldom advances the plot nor makes them more sympathetic.Now, perhaps my most controversial comment: an homage to grindhouse movies without any sex or nudity? Um, excuse me, but there are a couple of things that drove us to the drive-in... good car chases, lots of unnecessary, graphic violence, and at least one good scene of equally unnecessary (but welcomed) scene of female nudity... preferably, full frontal with that great 70's crop of hair down there.In general, this movie is all tease and no please with the possible exception of a good car chase.",Death Proof

Not to mention being humiliated by simply the three most annoying women, including a squeaky kiwi you just to be a road kill, even the the yummy Rosario Dawson winds me up.

It's full of beautiful women, fast, powerful cars, twisted metal, perversion, sadism, and and excellent soundtrack. The story is pretty basic which I liked. It's the classic stalker out to kill story except this one comes with a twist. What I also appreciated was the fact that there were connections made between Death Proof and Planet terror, two films which were released together as a Grindhouse feature. The cars and stunts were all real, no CGI. Tarantino made it clear that they performed every stunt and every sequence was genuine. The dialogue is fun but pretty basic. I thought there might have been one or two unnecessary characters that could've been removed entirely from the film and you wouldn't notice. Quentin makes a cameo, as usual.

As you will realize in a few seconds, watch characters like this talking endlessly it's boring as hell. At some point inside the bar, I fell asleep. Then, suddenly I awoke to the deafening noise of a car. I looked at the screen and I saw the dude's car in road and a blood chase happen. Then in this film there is a psychopath who likes to chase girls with his car and kill them? But that didn't last five minutes.

While I found 'Planet Terror' (the second part of this double feature) to be interesting, I found this part to be a standout; if not for the fact that it did not need special effects or ""science fiction"" to lend it its charm. And even still, I think that this movie stands as one of the best cinematic examples in film history.

331,TravS94,"A collision of nachos, babes, Kurt Russell, and headlights!",9,28 May 2012,"PLOT: A deranged stuntman stalks young women and uses his ""death proof"" car to cause fear, damage, and death.MY THOUGHTS: Death Proof is a very entertaining. Rather than use a machete, clawed fingers, or any other type of murderous weapon, the killer in this film uses his car. The idea for this movie is great. A ""death proof"" car that was built for stunt men equipped with a rolling cage to protect the driver is really vicious when put in the hands of a killer. Its unique and creative to solely use a car.While watching this movie, there is only one actor in it that you really want to see. When Kurt Russell appears in any shot, you know that it is going to be funny, interesting, and threatening. He alone steals the show and brings a ""bad ass"" feel to Stuntman Mike.The car stunts in this movie are amazing. While watching, you enjoy every second and are in awe of them. Death Proof brought more interest back to car chases in movies, and the final one lasts a good while too.PROS / CONS: The best parts about Death Proof are the car scenes, death scenes, and Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike. Now, with that said, the movie also tells its story at a slow pace and puts the viewer in the point of view of Stuntman Mike as you listen to his victim's conversations as he listens in the background. So as you are watching, some of these scenes go on for pretty long stretches. OVERALL: 9/10",Death Proof
332,The_Eighth_Passenger,A career low for Tarantino,4,26 April 2014,"It's hard being a movie fan sometimes. You anticipate the new film from a favourite director or in a much loved series, watching every trailer, reading up on every aspect of the production; eagerly awaiting its' arrival. Opening day comes and you sit yourself down in the theatre, the lights dim... and your heart sinks. You walk back out into the cold light of day with an empty, hollow feeling inside where only two hours before there had been such excitement. ""I over-hyped it"" you tell yourself, ""it could never live up to those expectations"". So, some time passes and you go in for a re-watch, hoping to catch something that you didn't first time around. Hoping that there really is some worth in it all. ""It isn't THAT bad."" you reason. But you know it is. Star Wars and Alien fans felt the same thing in 1999 and 2012 respectively. It may take a week, a month or even years but eventually you have to admit to yourself that it just isn't that good. Such is the case with Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof. I reached the point where I put it to bed and accepted it was no good a few years back but then Django Unchained came out and I didn't like it. At all. A few months later I reassessed it and now love it (with some caveats) so I thought I'd give Death Proof another chance, clinging to the hope that there is something to be taken from it. QT had already disappeared way up his own backside with the tedious second instalment of Kill Bill, where the dialogue felt like somebody ripping off the master of chit chat, rather than that it had been penned by him. With Death Proof he hits his career low, with long, dull scenes of women gossiping about men, fashion magazines and, of course, movies. Where it once felt fresh and new, things have turned stale. This isn't a case of over exposure though, his earlier films are still as entertaining as they ever were. No, this is a case of a man out of sync with his audience and given far too much leeway by the yes men he has surrounded himself with. The acting is bad across the board, only Kurt Russell and Rosario Dawson walk away from this relatively unscathed. I only mention it because Tarantino is known for getting great performances out of his actors, resurrecting and starting careers with almost every film he puts out, but with dialogue this bad, no matter how talented the performer may be, they don't stand a chance. Tracie Thoms is excruciatingly annoying as a sassy stunt driver and Zoe Bell, oh, Zoe Bell. We get that you fell in love with her on the set of Kill Bill, Quentin, but unleashing her on us in this way should be a criminal offence. Defenders of the film will say that people just didn't get the joke, that it was intentionally bad in order to parody/pay homage to genre exploitation flicks. Believe me, I get the joke, it just isn't funnyA couple of good moments aside, the highlight being a car crash seen from multiple viewpoints, there is almost nothing to recommend this film. Its' only appeal is to see how far from grace somebody can fall and then redeem themselves with their very next movie. QT learnt important lessons with Death Proof and although his next feature, Inglourious Basterds, could never be called trim, compared to this fiasco it zips along like a muscle car.Oh yeah, the soundtrack is good too.

Unfortunately, it's only an homage to himself. An ego trying to break free of his mediocrity. There's a reason why it is a subculture; it's crap.

To get rid of his post traumatic stress disorders? Just for fun? No answer to that throughout the whole film. Why the scene in hospital after the first crash? No added value... What about the police officer... any investigation or so? Second group of girls are definitely overreacting..

335,mercuryix-1,Misogyny Hits a New Low,2,9 July 2009,"from Tarantino. Quentin Tarantino has never been known for his portrayal of women as humans. They are either deadly ninjas or strippers in the making.In this film, four zomboid women who are self-indulgently stupid talk about sex with hot guys in a way only a horny junior high-school boy could write, then shows the four young jerks getting shredded by Kurt Russell.This is not one of Russell's shining moments. I'm not sure why he signed onto this; it doesn't exactly help his career. Tarantino can write better dialogue than this, and it deserves the criticism it has received. But what's most interesting is his uncontrolled hostility to anything female in this film. Even the female doctor is presented as a trash-talking, hostile bitch.Most movies are tolerable, and only a few are actually painful. This one was genuinely painful, and makes me think twice or three times before seeing another Tarantino film. It also makes me think about Tarantino's past attitudes towards women characters in his films. I think Tarantino needs more than a few sessions with a good counselor before sitting down and writing again. And maybe let someone else (who actually sees women as people) write the women's dialogue....",Death Proof

The lazy script doesn't give you any reason to sympathize with any character and chews your ears off with boring, pointless dialog. The long scene with the girls talking endlessly (you know which one I'm talking about) was possibly the worst use of film EVER. I'd rather watch Barbra Striesand in ""A Star is Born"" again that sit through that single Deathproof scene again. If Quentin Tarantino ever had any talent, it is not evident in this film at all.

To be more precise about the positive: 1. the music is well picked and QT's way of blending excellent, forgotten music with scenes shines throughout the movie 2. the action is in the realm of... reality (i.e. no slashing of 100 ninjas in 1 scene) 3. the dialog is recognizably QT'sBut, there is a but. The dialog, although QT's, is not backed by substance. There is no background, no reason, just the action. There is no second plot. Things are looking cool but there is nothing behind.

Are they that interesting that they should live? But is this Kurt Russell asshole not a total jerk, too? I loved the way scenes disturbed me, like in a Hitchcok movie they do, no moral left at all, ethical feelings disappeared and a troubled dual between good and evil...

347,Mr_W,Good movie in the style of the 70's,6,30 August 2007,"I find Tarantino to be quite an overrated director. Sure he was made some good films, but only one great film, which would be Pulp Fiction. With that said, this was an entertaining film, but let's not pretend it's a masterpiece, and I doubt it thinks it is either. It's hardly an Oscar winner material, but an entertaining flick with basically zero plot, in the vein of some 70's flicks which it mimics. I found the added 'errors' in the film quality, editing and especially the b&w scene to be quite unnecessary - we got it already, it's an homage to 70's trash films.The film starts very slow. For the first 45 minutes, almost nothing happens, just endless dialogue. And the dialogue isn't as funny as in other QT movies. Of course the dialogue has nothing to do with the plot either, but that's beside the point. After this boring start the movie picks up, and the last 30 or so minutes are pure action - great.If you don't like cars and car chase movies, you probably won't like this film. I however was a great fan of those movies when I grew up, and although nowadays I find them quite cheesy, it's kind of a shame that those movies don't get made anymore. No, movies like The Fast and the Furious don't count, they are CGI garbage. Death Proof however seemed to have real stunts and driving, and if there was some CGI, then it was well hidden.

I personally think this movie has a lot of punch with a strong car chase sequence, very good actors, well-written script....and a perfect soundtrack!I really like how the first part of the movie is a classic slasher/horror movie and the second part is a great throwback to ""car movies"".Death Proof came out in 2007 and I remember watching this movie with my friend and having a really good time. I watched the movie another time a few years later and really enjoyed it to for other reasons, especially the classic car chase sequence. Now it's 2015, I've just watched Death Proof for a third time and it's still a blast to watch. The music is perfect, the movie is very funny, and I love the performance from Kurt Russell, Sydney Poitier (Jungle Julia) and all the other supporting characters.R.I.P. Sally Menke, I really love her work on this movie...not only for the great grindhouse ""jump cuts"" but also for one of my favorite scene halfway through the movie that I won't mention and the awesome 11-min well edited car chase.I gave the movie a strong 9/10 and I hope this movie will have a better reputation 5-10 years from now.

349,xThe_Fury,Death Proof - A Review by Brandon Krzysztof,8,11 August 2013,"In this Tarantino film, a typical serial killer a gets a twist; with a heavy dose of pure Detroit muscle. And bringing those two things together can only impress, correct? I sure think so.Death Proof is the 2007 Quentin Tarantino film starring Kurt Russell who plays Stuntman Mike, a Hollywood stuntman who follows around groups of girls and then kills them; though not with his bare hands, but with his car via collision... in which he survives. This is the second half of the Grindhouse Double Feature with the first half being Planet Terror by Robert Rodriguez.We all know what we are going to get with Tarantino; very developed characters engaging in some very exquisite dialogue. We expect nothing less at this point in Tarantino's career and of course he brings it again and dominates it again. This film has some of the best dialogue I've ever heard. Quentin has always been knocked to never have female leads or at least key female characters. Well he struck that criticism down with Jackie Brown and later with the Kill Bill movies, and also does it again with this film but in an unique way. Both of those movies had female leads, strong ones I may add, surrounded with mostly male supporting cast. In Death Proof, Quentin has a male lead filled with a whole slew of females and makes the male the antagonist, which I think is brilliant because you can easily catch yourself in a situation where you actually might want to root for him instead of the girls he is stalking.Another thing that impresses me is that Quentin is also the cinematographer of this film and you get to see what Quentin wants you to see and throws in some great subtleties as well. He has great techniques and uses some pretty awesome shots during this film, mainly when Stuntman Mike is on screen. The best use of the camera is in the second half of the movie when the second group of girls are eating lunch. Quentin panned the very long scene and had you feel like you were actually apart of the conversation. He does a great job as the director of photographer. What makes the dialogue in this movie stand out is that for the first time in a Quentin movie we are listening to a group of girls gossip and tell stories when we are used to in movies like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction when we are observing mostly male characters. I knew Quentin was good with dialogue, but seeing write these realistic conversations that these female characters have is truly a pleasure. When it comes to the pace of the film, it tends to be between slow and moderate. But when you become engulfed in the dialogue, the speed of the film will not be an issue for the viewer. The tone of the film starts off very easy going, but when Stuntman Mike comes to the screen the tone suddenly moves to mysterious and scary. When the second half of the film begins, the second group of gals, we already we know what to expect to the mysterious tone is still with us and then the final act of the movie, the unbelievably exciting and tense car chase scene puts us to the edge of our seats and delivers us to a spectacular finish. When top car chase sequences come to mind, the end of this movie will be in the debate for greatest ever.At the end of the day this film is very underrated and with the masterpieces the Quentin has made, this one will unfortunately will be left at the waist side. It is your typical Quentin film with few twists and turns from his tradition, but all in all you will get what he has given you in every film he's made and that is an action pact thrill ride with a satisfying ending.8 out of 10.

Every person I've met who has seen this movie (which granted isn't many), doesn't like the film. The most often response for this film is that it's ""boring."" While that it may be true that almost the first half of the movie is dialog, I found it highly entertaining. Is it better than other Tarantino films such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs? No, so don't expect it to be so. Is it better than Planet Terror, its Grindhouse counterpart? No, but it is a worthy counterpart nonetheless. Those of you who have seen it and disliked it, ask yourself ""what did you expect?"" In my opinion, it surpassed my expectations (which were that the film would be decent). Those who are Tarantino fans, check this out indefinitely. For anti-Tarantino fans, there is a large chance of disliking this wicked piece of work. For those indifferent to Tarantino, here are so pro and cons to look for:Pros: 1. Highly suspenseful (which was probably its goal) 2. Cool action scenes for the action junkies 3. Interesting dialog (for some).Cons: 1. May have too much dialog and not enough action (for some, but for me it find a very nice balance between the two). 2. Could be a little too violent for some to bear.",Death Proof

I somehow summoned the strength to watch Death Proof a good 4 months later. Lets be clear first... the TV I watched Planet Terror on wasn't mine, I was at a hotel, and uhhhh Death Proof got released on DVD as a ""Blockbuster Exclusive"".... in other words ""Watch at your own risk"". Have you ever rented a Blockbuster Exclusive? If not, high fives. Another necessary statement: Pre-Jackie Brown Quentin kicked some serious as$. It's been all down hill after that (downhill on roller skates to be precise). I didn't buy into any of that Kill Bill stuff more than 15 mins at least so I was super skeptical coming into this ""exclusive"" more than most. But after I popped this in I was pleasantly surprised... what we have here is a QT trademark dialog driven film that promised suspense, action, and intensity. And for the first 1/2 of the film it delivered just that.... and it was real good. Kurt Russell (aka Snake Plissken who Robert R was a big fan of so not sure why he ended up in QT's film instead) delivers a top notch scary performance. For the first 1/2 of the film. Then for some unknown reason, QT completely drops the ball and gives us a piping hot piece of brown muck which we can only smell and not bare to watch. What the hell went wrong after the film's progression into Tennessee? Did anyone notice how really bad the film sucks at this point? Did anyone else yell during the car chase for the stupid girl to brake? Or at least drive around one of the thousand parked objects to give Ms. ""I love riding on hoods"" a chance to jump back in the car. No, we must proceed at a high speed chase no matter what. OK, did anyone please notice while Stuntman Mike and the suicide chick car were slamming each other the car or two that passed them!!??? WTF? Sure, ""Hey look at these cars playing death match derby ahead at 75 mph...lets pass them. We gotta get to grandmas or she'll be pi$sed."" Are you serious QT? Did you even watch this in the editing room? Is a this bad a$s chick really that bad a shot with a gun? I could go on about how the second half of this film just seems to run out of budget but I won't.... My advice: Watch the first half of the flick (Texas half) and consider it a mini horror flick...then toss the rest.",Death Proof

Although the movie producers claim that it recreates some of the old-era B-movies, the truth is that the movie has ridiculously long (soooo long) and boring dialogs, and only a few action scenes.The only one who has nice moments, is Kurt Russell, but the scenario is just too bad written, the imitation is simple, the final result is bad, bad, bad..There are three kinds of people: (a) Tarantino's fans who will say ""hurray"" no matter if they watch trash, (b) non-Tarantino's fans who pretend to find everything they watch, exceptional, and (c) all the other people (no matter if they love or hate Tarantino's style), who will find this movie, bad.

A film like this can only be graded on how bad it is and if so it deserves a 10. But that's not what I'm grading here, and I'm not grading Quentin Tarantino on whether he pulled it off or the writing or camera work because it was all fine to just OK but what I am really grading is Kurt Russell.What an amazing piece of work, what an amazing job acting this part. He plays one of the most disturbing, evil, messed up characters I think Kurt has ever played. I was shocked and reeling and kept looking deeply at the screen always questioning ""is that Kurt Russell?"" and finally when it sank in I couldn't believe it. This is the kid who played in Herbie the love bug, escape to witch mountain and portrays one of my favorite on screen hero's as Snake Plissken. This is Kurt our Stunt man Mike? Wow, words cannot describe the chill that went threw me the unnerving feeling that Kurt achieved in this role. He was insanely evil, disturbing and so excellent.You may have hated this film, you may have thought the camera work was bad, the grain effect was over played, the other actors maybe not that good, the script weak.

356,brainyidiot,Detroit Extreme Machines & Powerful Hotties,10,7 September 2007,"Being a gear-head originally from the Motor City I found Death Proof quite satisfying. A bit of a anti-climatic start following Planet Terror in the edited down version for Grindhouse, the stand-alone full version hits on all 8 cylinders high octane. No sissified upscale coffeehouse yuppie pleasing imported hybrid cars here, but genuine pumped up blue-collar Detroit steel right out of the rust belt making powerful use of their 8 miles to the gallon, cheater-slicks, headers, and glass-packs. From the applied film damage and choppy cuts to the transition into the more pristine second half, Mr. Tarantino succeeds in presenting an exciting homage to a time when smoke filled 2nd and 3rd run cinema houses would play a genre of machine chase movies that delighted while keeping you on the edge of your seat-that is when you weren't making out. Awesome soundtrack too. Kurt Russell is simply outstanding as a homicidal maniac who has a taste for hot colorful women. Trouble is, he really wants to kill them with his jacked-up muscle stunt car. Real standouts among the female cast are the lovely Rosario Dawson and the absolutely phenomenal Zoe Bell--herself a stunt women who demonstrates some smokin' moves and surprising acting talent. Marcy Harriell has a brief but memorable scene as a aspiring actress coaching Vanessa Ferlito on how to handle a pickup line. All of the female characters are very good and sassy. Tracie Thoms plays an intriguing fowl-mouthed but lovable control freak. Sure, there are unfortunate female victims along the way, but the ultimate message is ""chick power!""",Death Proof

Kill bill 1 and 2, Jackie Brown, these movies are terrible. This Death Proof film, is just boring. Pointless. The script just drones on. At lease his earlier films had some good writing, maybe he used up all his ideas in his first 2 films. Even the car chase, it was wasn't anywhere near as good as some of the classic car flicks mentioned in the film. Planet Terror was great. I love the homage to old B movie horror flicks. Quentin Tarantino is making parodies of his own style now. When it was Travolta and Sam L Jackson it was a great back and forth between them, just because you are making a homage to a B movie doesn't mean it has to be lame dialogue. Nothing said in death proof is memorable, I think of the lines from pulp fiction that are classic, there nothing here like that at all. Certainly no plot to speak of. The action is forgettable, the characters are one dimensional. The build up is slow, and then it doesn't build up to anything. I am ready to give up on this director.

I think even Mark Kermode thinks Jackie Brown is his best movie.So what about Death Proof? Let's just say it's different. Pretty much an experimental movie about a serial killing movie stuntman called Mike played by Kurt Russel brilliantly. He really makes this movie worth watching as do the second set of females who turn the tables on Stuntman Mike.There is some action, mostly at the end with a car chase and some physical violence. A greater part of the film is senseless dialogue between the female groupies who talk incessant nonsense throughout and this is Tarantino's big joke in the movie and Russel representing the ever suffering male trying to get even with a female characteristic that men loathe by killing them with his stunt car.The film is also notable for being a homage to 70's B movie genre using negative scratching, dated graphics and soundtrack with some black and white scenes. In conclusion I would say many will hate this film as Mark Kermode certainly did.

From the split feel of the camera, right down the middle of the movie, through the realistic sexapeal of the not so sexy cast, to Quentins own foot fetish, this movie kept me in my seat even without giving me some complex story plot.

364,Moviemaniacgirl-1,Classic Tarantino with a Punch,7,5 August 2011,"Tarantino has proved he can take any genre (even the ""grind-house"" flick) and make it into an instant golden classic. A brilliant cast, including Kurt Russel, Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferlito, Rose McGowan, Zoe Bell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Sydney Poiter and Tracie Thomas, brought the unique and shockingly original ""Death Proof"" to its feet. The six power-house females commanded the screen and were instantly the center of an oddly mixed slasher-car chase film. Each brought their sensuality and talent to some well developed characters. Whether it was Winstead creating a charmingly slow celebrity with plenty of leg, or Ferlito standing by herself, comfortable with her body, but not wanting to use it, each proved girls are more complex then men could ever imagine. Nothing short of Tarantino's entire arsenal of tricks and shots went into ""Death Proof"" and managed to be one of the most entertaining of all his films to date. Roundhouse kicks to the face and side-splitting moments of absolutely insanity perfected the oddly arced characters and story lines. Where double featured films generally had a heavily lacking story and almost no character, Tarantino was overflowing this film with his well written ones. This was almost too good to even try to be a grind-house feature. But, I'm not complaining. If you can handle fast-cars, hot girls and Tarantino's masterfully ass- kicking variety of characters, plots and shots, then this film is perfect for you. Overall, a must see film for everyone!On a further note I'd like to let all Tarantino fans know that there is a 7 minute long shot, beautifully constructed of course, with four girls eating and discussing life.

The name Tarantino credited as the director really makes this a highly anticipated movie. Well, be prepared to be disappointed. Sure, there are a couple of 'cool' scenes in the movie, but overall it is a steaming turd. Tarantino's movies are known for their large amount of witty, rude dialogs. As a matter of fact, that is what made those movies great. This movie also has many dialogs in it, but here they just kill the entire movie. The first 45 minutes are filled with a never ending stream of jibber jabber, while nothing happens in between. Besides that, the conversations are not even clever nor is there any storyline to it. While watching it, I really got the feeling that this movie was actually a non-funny Tarantino-movie-parody. However, I tend to believe that Tarantino simply used some leftover dialogs which were written for, but not used in, his other movies. When something actually does happen the movie is quite amusing, but never great. If Quentin would have cut the crap, there would have been about 30 minutes of entertaining material left. Compared to the other part of the Grindhouse experience, Planet Terror, this movie falls short in every area. While Planet Terror was so over the top with action and bizarre events, this movie just leaves you waiting for something to happen. A movie like Kill Bill was entertaining, but already showed some signs of the fact that Tarantino's ego got so inflated that it gets in the way of his ability to create another classic movie.

They both attempt to encapsulate a specific genre that was explored more in the past. However, their faults are shown through how they fail to provide commentary on the genre throughout the entirety of the film. Instead, they unfortunately embrace the cliches they're attempting to parody. Furthermore, Tarantino's Death Proof includes an ALMOST unbearable first half and an incredible second half that has the audience on the edge of their seats. Within the first half, we're forced to watch dialogue that attempts to be intelligent and annoying at the exact same time (it ends up just being annoying), A MULTITUDE OF SHOTS THAT ARE ONLY INCLUDED SO THAT TARANTINO CAN HAVE SOME FOOT FETISH FUEL, and awful characters that we're apparently supposed to care about.

370,ImOkayLarry,Ladies...THAT was fun!,8,12 February 2008,"First things first, I love Tarantino. Pulp Fiction, both parts of Kill Bill and Reservoir Dogs all rank among my favourite films, and Jackie Brown, whilst not as 'Tarantino' (that's right, it's a quality!) as these others, is still an excellent film. And that's not even mentioning his scripted films; True Romance, From Dusk Till Dawn and, to some extent, Natural Born Killers. (Although I admit I have not yet seen four rooms, but only because I hear that...it's not so great). Bearing this in mind, and after waiting for over a year since first hearing about Grindhouse, I couldn't help having certain expectations when I finally saw Death Proof.This is probably why after first viewing, I came away slightly disappointed. The film seemed flawed in many ways that Tarantino had always seemed to avoid. But saying this, there were many things that I loved about the film, and therefore looked forward to watching it a second time. And I must say, I enjoyed it a lot more. The main problem for me is actually the casting. Don't get me wrong, Kurt Russell is fantastic in his role and it's a classic Tarantino piece of casting, but many of the other characters just don't seem to fit. In the first group of girls, the first thing that really put me off was just how obnoxious and annoying they were, and unfortunately this was also true of the second group of girls too. At first I thought that this was due to Tarantino's writing, that he had really gone over the top this time, but this is proved wrong by a couple of redeeming performances. The first of these was by the very sexy Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito) or as I prefer, 'Butterfly'. This girl, opposed to the others, comes off as likable, human and very hot! (thank you for the lap dance!) The second would be Lee (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who gives a great performance as a cute-but-dumb actress. I also feel like I should mention Rose McGowan as Pam, Stuntman Mike's first victim, because her happy-go-lucky blonde is simply a joy to watch, and the dialogue and action between the two of them are some of the best parts of the film. Oh, and Rosario Dawson's character Abernathy is mainly acted well too. But unfortunately, apart from this the girls in this film simply don't seem to be able to handle the Tarantino dialogue, which is a big shame. (I wont even go into how big a mistake the casting of Zoë Bell was; sure he wrote the part for her, sure, she's a great stunt woman, and sure, Tarantino obviously likes her a lot, but the woman just can't act! Her acting is simply distracting (hey, that rhymes...) and is one of the two women in the film whom I refer to as 'the squinty faced ones'.)The casting of the men wasn't much better. The men in the bar just don't fit in with the tone of the film (why cast Eli Roth for God's sake?!), with the exception of Tarantino's cameo as the eccentric bartender Warren,. You just get the feeling that he's trying to make his characters too modern, which really doesn't fit in with the old B-Movie style, and instead of making unappealing characters likable (think of the depictions of hit men, criminals and assassins that populate his previous films), Tarantino seems to make these normal kids very un-likable. But alas, I fear I might lose myself if I rant anymore about that, so I'll move on to what I think was the other mistake; the structure. The film jumps to a completely different set of victims almost half way through, and seeing as the first half almost reached the pure ecstatic highs of Kill Bill at times, this seems like a big mistake. It also feels disruptive to the flow, and as a result, Death Proof never really feels like a whole film. This is not helped by the under use of Kurt Russell's character, who never seems to get enough screen time despite being one of the films biggest attributes. As for the action (i.e. The car chase/ killings), there is not much to complain about. It's done well; the final chase is tense and thrilling as long as you don't expect too much, and the deaths are suitably gory and darkly funny. Once again, Tarantino shows just how well he can frame his shots, making even the static moments somehow full of life and aesthetic beauty, so there are no disappointments here. But then there is the ending. I suppose it will be a matter of taste, and that some will like it and some will not, but I'm afraid I belong to the latter category. However well made it is, I just don't think that the audience *wants* to see the cowardice side of Stuntman Mike, simply because we grow to like the psychopathic killer more than his annoying victims! And the abrupt 'The End' finish seems to cut the film off when we're still expecting (and perhaps, needing) more to happen, to bring us out of the action smoothly. So it seems that Death Proof is a flawed film, and arguably Tarantino's worst to date. But it's saying a lot about a director when his worst film is as good as this! Hugely enjoyable and mostly memorable, Death Proof only just falls short of excellence through some poor pacing and some bad choices. There are few things as fetching as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel",Death Proof

It's roughly 2 hours of extremely boring dialogue delivered by uninteresting characters, and two mildly entertaining car chases. It doesn't go anywhere. There is nothing funny, witty, scary or exciting about it, nor does it convey or evoke any other feelings. Digitally making the first half of the film look aged, deliberately inserting bad audio-cuts and including a 5-minute black and white sequence for no reason whatsoever doesn't help either (yeah, we get it, it's supposed to look like a cheap 70s flick-- it doesn't). Unlike some of the B-movies it tries to imitate, Death Proof isn't even so bad it's funny. Unless the intention of this film is to put the audience to sleep, it fails horribly. Obviously Tarantino has lost it. He should have quit while he was ahead; his glory days of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are long gone.If this laughably amateurish waste of celluloid was by anyone but Tarantino, it surely would have an overall IMDb-rating of no more than 2/10 and quite possibly rank among the bottom 100 worst movies.",Death Proof

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this title. This movie is very slow, which is at times Tarantino's specialty because he is great at writing dialog, but not in this film. This movie is two different stories, and let me just say the first one is absolutely pointless. We get to know two separate groups of girls. The first group just drive around a talk for 45 minutes, with not very great dialog. Then we meet Stunt man Mike (Russell), who likes to kill people with his car. He talks to them for a while, gets a lap dance from one of them (which has to last 10 minutes), and then everyone leaves, and then Russell catches up to them and kills them all when crashing into them. Now we're on the next group of girls. What was the point of that? Why all that character development. And then the same thing starts with the next group of girls, just driving around talking (again, with not Tarantino-worthy dialog), and then after another 45 minutes, Russell finds them and he tries to kill them but they end up going after him. I will say the last 15 minutes of this film are really good, but other than that I did not like it. I give it a 3/10, mainly for Kurt Russell's acting and the ending gaining the 3 points.",Death Proof

I picked up this movie saying this will be another of the Tarantino instant classics and even if is not this movie has all the aspects that make a true Tarantino. The acting in this movie is not great but is not intended to be. The dialog even if is so fill with clichés is great and you can feel for the characters cause they seem just like every day people. The script is pretty simple but again is not supposed to blow your mind. Is supposed to be just a popcorn movie and it succeed so well in that that you can say is more than that.",Death Proof
375,AndrewKnevett,Oh Quentin..,6,12 May 2009,"Quentin, Quentin what were you thinking! A film that has a good concept is ruined by the long-winded, tedious, verbose dialogue spewed out by trash-talking women whose lives are so vacuous and vain I quickly become disinterested to what fate becomes any of them. It seemed the film was centred more on their pointless conversations rather than the villain Stuntman Mike.It's not all bad and there are redeeming features but to be fair they are very few and very far between. The stunt scenes featuring the excellent Zoe Bell for example are very well done and Kurt Russell does a good job as Stuntman Mike. It would have been better film if we saw more of Russell and car action scenes and a lot less chatter from the women. This film is definitely not for everyone. I am a great fan of Tarantino so it hurts me to give this a low star rating. I would say it's aimed for a certain demographic mainly very young woman who believe in ""girl power"".",Death Proof

Anyone who could sit through this startling awful piece of garbage is either stoned stupid or just a lemming believing that if Tarantino is involved it must be good. Anyone who finds this film meaningful should come to my yard where I will show them a wonderful object d'art that my dog just created.It is the worst movie I can recall seeing since Gus Van Sant's ""Last Days"" I think I actually gave that horrific abortion a ""2"" because, at least, the cinematography was decent.

378,RevengeOfBobRoss,An exercise in self-indulgence,2,23 April 2008,"It's common knowledge that Quentin Tarantino, the mighty, fanboy-loving, ultra-violence king of Hollywood, ""borrows"" heavily from other films, especially ""Grindhouse"" films(aka films nobody saw in the first place), and then passes them off as homages, but nonetheless as his own work. He has a trademark style, the style of the aforementioned violence, the use of 100 plus racial epithets per film, completely random dialogue, and lots of shots of bare feet.In ""Death Proof"", Tarantino gives us the ultimate in self-indulgence- an ""homage"" to the sub-genre Tarantino has himself created. He has somehow made a movie so bad it parodies everything that Tarantino has done in the past by taking his ""style"" so far to the extreme that the only possible person this movie could appeal to are Tarantino and his extremely adamant fanbase.The film starts with four women- one of which is Jungle Julia, a radio DJ. The women go to a bar and literally talk about nothing for 30 minutes or more. They stumble across Stuntman Mike(played by Kurt Russell), who is a vicious killer in the guise of a near-elderly stuntman who worked on (gasp) old grindhouse movies! More self-indulgence! Queue the only good sequence in the film- the first kill scenes. During this scene we also get the only good line of dialogue in the entire film.Then we find Mike on the hunt for more girls- four women who look very suspiciously similar to the first four girls. But there is a difference- these girls like old grindhouse car-related movies, and proceed to talk about them for another tedious, god-awful half an hour. Did I mention the black girl uses the n-word a lot? See, that makes it not racist.The ending chase scene is decent, but the ending is so pathetic it makes me cry. The character of Stuntman Mike, for the one scene in the middle of the film, was so excellent, but Tarantino had to ruin him. Russell only has a couple actual scenes in the film, and it's a damn shame.The dialogue is the true abomination here. it is so inane, so boring, so useless, and so utterly masturbatory in regards to Tarantino's trademark style, that it reaches the level of parodying it. Tarantino has finally reached a ""pure"" level. Gone are the days he made good movies, where the inane dialogue was entertaining and gave us insight into the characters on screen. Now, it is just a puerile string of nothingness that I could make up in my sleep. There is nothing fresh, nothing clever, nothing at all.It's just a waste. It is so unfortunate that a gem like Planet Terror and all the fantastic fake trailers had to share screen time with this garbage.",Death Proof

But the most important aspect of any film is the PLOT. And that's where he lost it. It's too slow paced that one would yawn within first 30 minutes of the film. Also it's too shallow and repetitive.

382,TypedbyTara,"""Death Proof"" but not Badass Women Proof",6,2 March 2012,"I was introduced to this film by my nutty father who was( and probably still is) absolutely bonkers for this movie. At first I was a bit hesitant to see this movie because I'm not a big fan of any of Tarantino's works. Death Proof is the exception. I finally decided to see the movie partly to shut up dear old dad, but also out of curiosity. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the movie started off a bit slow, watching a bunch of ""voluptuous women"" driving around whilst they drink beer and smoke pot wasn't particularly interesting to me (although I'm sure the fellas thought otherwise). However, the movie picks up when ""Stuntman Mike"" creeps into the picture. Oh, and for the record Kurt Russell did a scarily good job portraying the twisted/sadistic stalker that is Stuntman Mike...but I digress. The audience is given their first glimpse of just how sadistic Stuntman Mike is when he kills his first victim-a ditsy blonde who met her demise when her head met the dashboard. Immediately after that incident you know that the other group of girls are f**ked, Stuntman Mike has their photos and a burning desire to do some damage. Needless to say it didn't take long, the group was killed in a epic-head to head- car crash (yes I cringed a bit, and for the record I'm NEVER hanging my leg out the window of a vehicle ever again). Oh but there's more! Before I even have time to process the death of the first group, a second group is introduced. But there's something different about this group...hmmm what could it be? Oh right...they're BAMFs. Zoe Bell in particular. As a known stunt women (who could show ""Stuntman"" Mike a thing or two) I was expecting big things. I was hooked now because for god sakes, who would knock off Zoe Bell?? As expected Mr. Stuntman Mike develops a fascination with this group of girls as well. But what he doesn't know is that this group of girls(well really Zoe) has a fascination with a 1970 Dodge Challenger, which is a very very cool car that packs some horse-power to boot. Anyway, the girls get a hold of this car to take it for a test drive. Stupidly, Stuntman Mike makes an attempt on the girls during their test drive, but his efforts are thwarted when one of the girls, Kim, shoots him in the shoulder. Stuntman Mike's ""sick joke"" pisses off the ladies, and like all ballsy bad-ass women, they decide to go after him. A huge chase ensues and the women successfully manage to trash the death proofmobile then promptly kick the nachos out of Stuntman Mike-the world is once again at peace! Was this the best movie I've ever seen? Haha, no. But it was comical. The scratching and color changes to the film added a humorous touch that I had never seen before in a movie. It was also enjoyable to seen a group of strong women kick some major creeper butt. I would say this was an acceptable one-nighter and it was a good addition to my repertoire of ""watched films.""",Death Proof

I must admit that this movie had more of an effect on me after seeing it rather than during. There were times when I wasn't sure if I was at the movies and I kept asking myself: what am I doing here again? what is it that I'm watching? because the movie doesn't particularly make sense for the most part. However, that's not what's enjoyable about this movie. And don't expect tons of things to happen as it goes a little slow. There are things that are very well done, the transition to color at the convenience store is amazing. The suspense of the whole death proof car including Kurt Russel is nicely done. That he finally meets his equal in the end and becomes rather pathetic than scary is very much so in keeping with the ""girl power"" thing we saw in Uma Thurman in Kill Bill, and who better to portray this sexy yet strong atmosphere than a group of women. For the fact that it was a cool movie that I now remember and I'm just starting to enjoy and would definitely like to see again I give it an 8/10.",Death Proof
384,tjantus,Consider the Sum of the Parts,9,27 November 2007,"I've seen most of Tarantino's offerings, and generally like all that I've seen. I have read and commented on the message boards for many of them, and I've read and commented on this one as well.""Death Proof"" is Tarantino's half of the ""Grindhouse"" double feature, and it is not only a quintessential ""grindhouse"" production, it is a quintessential Tarantino film. It features all of his repeated themes and motifs: bare foot fetishism, inspired retro music, lurid sets and colors; odd camera angles, references to '70's films, amazing stunts, minimalist use of computer-generated effects when the old-fashioned type won't do, and the one thing that I have seen his work panned the most for---extended dialogue. Characters sitting around, talking about inconsequential things, the trivia and meaninglessness of their little lives. Boorr-ing!!!That is not the case, and you critics are missing the point. It doesn't matter whether or nor we like these people, these fictional characters who may or may not be about to get killed off. It is through the words that they say to each other that they reveal who they are. We may not like who they are, we may not identify with them, but we can identify them. We come to know them. They fill in the blank spaces in the character's soul, and make them three dimensional human beings.There are long passages where the characters--in this case two separate groups of young women--sit around talking. We learn what their backgrounds are, their hopes, their dreams, their petty annoyances. They reveal what it is that makes them who they are by what they say to each other. They reveal what their intentions are, and they further the plot thereby. When the time comes for action--and there is plenty of that (this IS a Tarantino film, after all)--it is completely in character. The wordy dialogue that was written off as boring, mindless chatter is brought to life in adrenaline-pumping action.And that is what makes this ""Grindhouse"" movie great entertainment. It's not supposed to be something we meditate on in the quiet moments of our lives, it is raw entertainment--filled with sexy babes, violent action, and all the movie artistry that true craftsmen can provide.",Death Proof

The girls are all thoroughly presented, regardless of whether they are:A) Interesting B) About to survive for more than five minutesKurt Russell seems to be enjoying himself as the maniacal stuntman and the ending car chase is pretty cool but this doesn't save Death Proof from being Tarantino's weakest film to date.",Death Proof

To me it looks like a tribute to the prolific and horrendous bunch of flicks which have entertained a generation and are an important part of our lives.The anti climax at the end where the ""prey"" get their revenge on the ""hunter"" was a sort of anti thesis of the whole genre.High performance automobile with their raw unrefined engine whines, open country, some beautiful girls, nice music and the Tarantino touch makes this one click.",Death Proof

390,europolismovie,Sex & Drags & Wreck & Roll (Part 2),6,4 December 2007,"Quentin Tarantino's '5th' film Death Proof was originally conceived as the second part of a 'Grindhouse' double bill with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror. The idea was to replicate the 70's exploitation movie experience of low budget shclock opera's, where the posters are better than the actual films, and which have clearly been such a huge influence on both filmmakers  missing reels, scratched celluloid, gate hairs, tacky trailers and kitsch corporate graphics all to an ear splitting trumpet-loaded soundtrack. It certainly took me back to the pre-multiplex days of my childhood when audiences had enough of an attention span to watch two films back to back with barely a moment in between to restock on Embassy No10's and another carton of Kia-Ora.I saw the original Grindhouse 'double bill' version in New York back in April, and appreciated it for the great bit of self indulgence it is on the part of the directors who should be in the happy position of being able to make the movies they want without having to worry too much about box office returns and studio interference. Unfortunately somewhere in the crossfire of a Mexican standoff between the producers, marketing department, distributors and the directors themselves Grindhouse has been mutilated, Black Dahlia-like, and unceremoniously dumped in two halves on U.K audiences. Although reviews were good, Grindhouse flopped in the states, so, with what appears to be a case of contagious cold feet tippy-toeing their way across the Atlantic, our distributors have decided that we're incapable of handling the Grindhouse experience in its entirety - hence releasing Tarantino's half as his 5th film.Death Proof is an intentionally slight tale of psychopathic 'Stuntman Mike' (Kurt Russell) who gets his kicks causing car crashes in his specially designed 'death proof' Chevy Nova (and later a Dodge Charger) in which everyone except himself is killed. After targeting yet another group of nubile young girls as his next victims the tables are turned and Stuntman Mike becomes the subject of their bloody revenge.Considering the promise of mucho car-nage that the premise suggests Death Proof is dialogue heavy; but then one line of Tarantino's dialogue is more action packed than all of Diesel, Seagal and Van Damme's 'roid' fests put together  and when the violence does descend, it falls hard. But isolated from the Grindhouse concept, Death Proof pales besides the likes of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. A 127 minute re-cut of the movie was shown at the Cannes Film Festival last May in an attempt to bring it up to the standard of Tarantino's other outings and this, I believe, is the version U.K audiences are about to witness.Unfortunately the faux-trailers of 'forthcoming attractions' such as 'Machete', 'Hobo with a Shotgun' and 'Werewolf Women of the S.S' (with Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu!) which split the original Grindhouse version are not included. This sequence was the highlight of the whole movie and I know I'm not the only one who hoped that they would actually turn some of these spoofs into real films. It's looking doubtful that the original Grindhouse double bill version will be shown in the U.K and even more annoying that the DVD releases of both films are not to feature the trailers either. (Apart from 'Machete' in Planet Terror) Death proof is one thing  but film industry proof?",Death Proof
391,fvikingo,Out of context,7,10 October 2007,"I believe this movie was probably a success as the first part of the Grindhouse project. And it was probably made for that purpose and not as a lone movie. The fact that we're watching it at home out of context as so, makes this movie quite poor, but because we're missing the good parts of it. I recommend this movie, if you are with a bunch of friends and talking a lot, maybe talking a lot and eating popcorn while watching it in a long session movie followed by Planet Terror. As it was meant to be watched. And I believe if you revive the feeling of the grind house, this movie is great.I have a hard time rating low a Tarantino movie, because I like his style and it is there, but I have to admit that analyzing this as a movie and comparing it with other movies with the common parameters makes it very bad as you would read by most reviewers on this site.

I found an unrated special edition used DVD for $1 and thought, what the heck, I can't be disappointed for a dollar. All I can say is, I'm glad DVD players have Fast Forward buttons.Sandwiched in between interminable dialog spouted by annoying, foul-mouthed women, there may be a movie. I couldn't find it, however. The gory deaths, Kurt Russell's acting, and a sporadically entertaining car chase at the end do little to take the edge off of this boring vanity project.Personally, I like Tarantino's early movies, but if he was trying to make a slasher/car chase movie (as he has stated in his ""Grindhouse"" movie book tie-in) he failed miserably. He must have made this for his buddies, who wouldn't dare tell him that, because this lump of cinematic coal is as toxic as anything made in recent years and shows total contempt for the audience. I can't imagine sitting through this nearly 2 hour film and feeling like I got my money's worth.This has to be the absolute rock-bottom for Tarantino's film making career, a self-indulgent, wrong-headed attempt at making a movie for movie's sake.And what's with ""Zoe Bell as herself""?

We are not given any real motivation for this, although my best bet is he had a hidden speaker to listen in on their chit-chat.The girls chased him back, through more built up areas, Their pursuing him lead to some near misses but also to a young motorcyclist flipping off his bike and colliding with a wall.The young man broke his neck and died shortly after.

394,Mahan18,Death Note - Review by Mahan,4,19 March 2011,"Okay, Quentin Tarantino is my #3 favourite director, and I have a great admiration for all of his movies (With the possible exception of Kill Bill Vol. 2, but the subject for another review). But this is a major step down in his career. It is just 90 or so minutes of talking. Not just talking, though, but completely uninteresting and pointless talking. It is the cinematic equivalent of going to the cinema with two loudmouthed movie-goers who won't shut up, and just listening to them for the duration of the film you wanted to see.Not only is the dialogue a problem, the editing is misplaced as well. This is probably Sally Menke's only example of being anything other than pitch-perfect, and I'm going to chalk that up to her not knowing exactly what to do with the concept of making the film look like it would back in the old exploitation theatre days. From random frames being repeated to an entire scene (5-10 min. tops) being in black-and-white while the rest is in colour, it just proves that rarely anyone has a flawless record in cinema.Also, there's Tarantino's use of the 'foot'. Now, anyone who is familiar with QT's films will know of his theme of putting feet into scenes in his films. From the 'foot massage' incident from Pulp Fiction to 'wiggle your big toe' from Kill Bill Vol. 1, it has become a staple of his. In this movie? He has Kurt Russell (the movie's antagonist) licking Rosario Dawson's foot. Enough said.Now, to be fair, it has got its good points. The soundtrack, as per Tarantino films, is awesome; The end car chase scene (with Zoe Bell on the hood of the car, no less) is exciting and well-directed; and I have to admit, some of the dialogue is kinda funny, if only for how bizarre it gets. However, this is far from being enough to save this movie.In the end, though, is this movie horrible? No, I wouldn't go that far, but it isn't that good either. If you're a REALLY big fan of American muscle cars and movie that revolve around them, than you'll probably like this movie. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.",Death Proof
395,philip-caveney,Tarantino Plumbs New Depths,1,28 August 2008,"Death ProofI resisted watching this for ages, I really did; but stuck in a London hotel with nothing else new to watch, I finally succumbed. And oh, how I wish I hadn't.Of course, everyone is by now familiar with the Grindhouse story; how Tarantino and best buddy, Robert Rodriguez, decided to assemble a couple of shoddy-looking 'drive-in' movies and put them out together in a double bill; how said double bill failed to lure in audiences; and how the films were then re-edited for individual release in a desperate attempt to claw back some of their budget. (The films may look cheap but they weren't). Now, I've already seen Planet Terror, Rodriguez's contribution to the double bill and I have to say that though it's no masterpiece, it looks like Citizen bloody Kane compared to Tanantino's effort.I've long been known that Quentin longs to be black, but from the evidence of Death Proof, what he really longs to be is a black woman. How else are we to explain the seemingly endless succession of conversations that bookend the two car chases that are the only other element of this dismal excuse for a movie? A bunch of females sit around, drinking, smoking and talking and talking and talking. About nothing. Presumably we're supposed to find what they're saying hilarious, but it's frankly an ageing white man's idea about what hip young women might have to say to each other and is consequently as convincing as the awkward supporting performances contributed by Mr Tarantino and his other best buddy, Eli Roth, creator of the Hostel torture-porn films, and another 'film-maker' currently wanted for crimes against viewers.Into this tedium wanders Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) a scarred psychopath who likes nothing better than killing young women in car wrecks. No explanation is given for this unsavoury hobby; perhaps he simply finds their endless yapping as irritating as I did. At any rate, he stalks four women then kills them in a head-on collision. A couple of good ol' boy cops wander on to say that hot damn, they can't do a Godamned thing about it because there's no proof that Mike did it on purpose and so he's let go and then he homes in on three other young women, and they drink and smoke and talk for ages and thenLook, I don't even know why I'm bothering to give you any plot details, since it's virtually non existent and really all this pile of misogynistic crap exists for is to invite viewers to gloat as a series of attractive, partially-clothed females perform pole dances and then have their bodies torn to shreds in automobile accidents. Tarantino once possessed a smidgen of genuine talent but these days seems to revel in a pool of retarded sexuality that wouldn't disgrace a fourteen year old. And Quentin, it may seem hilarious to you to pepper the film with smudges and scratches and awkward jump cuts, but believe me, no amount of it is going to hide the fact that this is witless, sexist crap of the lowest order. See, what would have been good is if you'd applied these techniques to a genuinely engaging story, then you'd have had something entertaining and maybe, just maybe audiences would have come to see your original double bill. But let's be honest, it's a long time since Pulp Fiction, the last genuinely good thing you were associated with and from what I've been hearing about your next project  Inglorious Bastards  my hopes are not high for any kind of progress in the near future.",Death Proof
396,Fizzwizz,"I don't understand why, but this is the film of the year for me",10,4 November 2007,"I can't figure this out, and I sincerely apologise if this is a useless review but Tarantino has done it again.I find it difficult to explain why this film hit the spot when so many others did not. Tarantino definitely has a handle on reality, and doesn't need to create artificial story lines and make believe monsters to thrill and intrigue his audience. This is a film that illustrates our everyday idiosyncrasies and shows us both the real, yet dark side of humanity, and shows us that real life is far more exciting and intriguing than fantasy.The dialogue between characters was funny, real, and interesting. Bringing together a variety of different characters (eg cheerleader, successful celebrity, ghetto girlie etc), he illustrates the common traits of the human psychology that we all pretend don't exist. Most other films take us into unrealistic fantasy, Tarantino knows reality is far more exciting! Kurt Russell surpassed himself. He's been absent for too long, and his part in Death Proof leaves me wanting to see more from him. His acting was superb and I hope this film relights his career and we see more from him soon.I definitely saw touches of Pulp Fiction in this film, but in a subtly different way.Cinematography was awesome, and the use of weird and wonderful camera techniques made this film more than just interesting.When it comes to films I'm a tough critic, I'm disappointed far more than I'm surprised so giving a 10 out of 10 for me is very unusual.This is a clever, interesting, and unusual film that will appeal to serious lovers of movies. Tarantino is both a movie scholar and genius. I bow before you Quentin and hope desperately to see more like this.Many thanks ... Shaun",Death Proof
397,paneraifreak,A nice flashback homage to what I once experienced.,10,5 April 2021,"First, I have to wonder how many of the reviewers here were teenagers in the late 60's and remember those Ploitation movies? If you are in your 20's or even 30's and you watched Death Proof then you most likely did not love it. Me, I know what Tarantino attempted to do here and he succeeded.I need to be very clear with this: if you did not go to a cheap, dungy theatre downtown in the 1970 then you will not entirely get Tarantino's creation here.To fully appreciate his movie, it is not enough to have watched several B movies and other bad flicks of the 60's. Tarantino makes many references to an era, a sub culture, a ""time now passed""...
I fully experienced it.In 1970, I had a young uncle in his twenties who got a job as an usher in a low class, cheap neighborhood theatre in the Italian quarters of Montreal. His job was to seat people with his dim flashlight, take the tickets, rip them in half and give the other half to the customers. He would do supervision during the movies, inspect the toilets to make sure people were not smoking pot, he would help the manager with what ever he needed done, refilling the CO2 tanks for the pop machines, etc,etc. The theatre itself was small but had a gigantic marquee that spelled Cinema Les Quatre Etoiles (The Four Star Cinema). Right besides the theatre's front entrance, they displayed the now highly collectible posters and lobby cards of the movies it was showing.I remember it like it was last week: perfect example of a vintage theatre that sadly rarely exists now.My uncle was fond of me so he asked my dad if he could take me, an impressionable 7 year old boy, to his work and I would watch the movies. Dad said yes.I was so excited.Every Saturday afternoon, between noon and 5PM, the theatre would show 4 movies for one price: $2.25
So, while my uncle was on the screen floor supervising the rowdy behavior of teenagers, I was upstairs, where the projectors were and I was watching four movies: monster movies: Godzilla vs Every Monster, Dracula vs Everything, The Love Bug movies, Elvis flicks, Sinbad, Italian Hercules flicks, black and white Batman movies from the 40's, cartoons between the movies, scary movies like ""The Man with X-ray Eyes"", Jerry Lewis flicks, Kung Fu movies , etc,etc.The teenagers there would intermittently lose focus and start throwing popcorn at each other, would boo and cheer, it was chaos for five hours but it was some good times.Then at five, they would all leave. That is when the crew would clean the aisles, sweep the popcorn, quickly mop the soda covered floor. I would often help with the clean up. I loved it.Then at 6PM, the theatre would reopen for the adults. That was then the time for those movies: mild ""x"" rated flicks, blaxploitation flicks, police thrillers; the films that no teenagers were allowed to see.But for about an hour, I got to experience these grindhouse and Ploitation flicks until the time my dad came to pick me up and take me home. I always wanted to stay there all night and see more women undressing, more car chases, more masked killers slashing throats: but I was only 8 so bedtime was coming soon for me.Now, both in the afternoon and in the evening, the films would always assuredly fail: the film strip would come off its sprokets and get jammed and start burning. People would then boo until the projectionist would fix the strip and roll the film again. But these films were used by many theatres over and over so they often would miss chunks of strips so the film would skip badly and sometimes so badly, it would jump from one scene to another...very jerky at times.And then, the films would sometimes lose sound and then play normal again.And then, sometimes the film would stop completely and the viewers would be left in the dark for several minutes. Lots of booing then.So, Tarantino did well what he intended: a sort of revival, nostalgic piece to bring people like me back to our days of youth when many of the ""dime"" movies made hardly any sense, showed mindless actions, badly dubbed flicks, jumpy editing, showed ridiculous ""special effects"" ...but I loved all these movies, whether because I was laughing at them or because an 8 year old was in awe watching Godzilla fight King Kong in 1970.And when the ""mature"" films started at 6, my young eyes saw the same things: jumpy editing from cutting too much film strip, dust infested film strips that would move around, so visible on the screen. Etc, etc.To me, being close to Tarantino's age, I relate to what his creative mission was for this film: simply a flashback to what used to be, with all the flaws and silliness we remember.To write a critique of this movie without having experienced the smells of a filthy small theatre with ripped seats and sticky floors, the emptiness of the pop cultural phenomenon of the ""70's teenhood"", the sense of revered tackiness of the mindless flicks played in my childhood theatre, the uncaring of what is on the screen because ""I am with my friends on a Saturday afternoon"" is to approach Tarantino's creation with only one foot.I could go on explaining how the ""experiencing the authenticity of the message"" is vital with the experiences of the old Drive-In when the snack shop was bustling with non viewers and the viewers were distracted by the social element of being in a Drive-In...the movies at the drive-in had no
more meaningful content as Tarantino's piece: it is a homage, no more.",Death Proof
398,RamirBorja,Only nostalgic film buffs might like this,2,21 December 2007,"Very disappointed from the latest offering of Quentin Tarantino. 90% of it are talking-heads and I should not be complaining if the dialogs are as entertaining as the ones on his previous films like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. What we got instead are the most drawn-out and inane girl talk I've ever watched. I find it hard to believe I can't think of any quotable quote which is supposed to be Tarantino's forte. The only memorable thing about this film is the middle part where it shows a very spectacular car crash viewed from 4 different angles. So visceral.. limbs flying I'm telling you.The second half has this car chase, while fun to watch is really dumb. The ending came so abrupt I really find it funny, which I think is the intention of Tarantino. These are the only parts of the film that I find mildly amusing.This movie is supposed to be the second half of the double-featured Grindhouse opposite Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror. Too bad this was only done in the US. I felt bad about the split because it diluted this film due to the amount of boring dialog. But I appreciate Tarantino's homage to the cheaply produced movies of the 70s. The film has that grainy, over-saturated, badly scratched look and the deliberate bad editing. It might be gimmicky but I still like it.Tarantino got the style but not the substance. Only nostalgic film buffs might like this.",Death Proof

Death proof on the other hand is always talked like hes worst movie, it has a score 0,5 lower than a CGI bomb with bad acting and a terrible twist.(Star Wars ep: 3) This is what death proof have. NO CGI. Terrific stunt work. Some dialogue almost as funny and good as Pulp Fiction. One of the most unique villain of the decade. Two really nice car chases. A really impressing and cool killing scene. A little historic lesson about the old cinema. Awesome music.

400,lvgoold,The BEST movie I have seen all year!,10,14 November 2007,"Once I heard that ""Grindhouse"" had flopped in America, I thought that it must have been the worst film of the year, from one of the best directors. Yet, I was really disappointed when I heard that ""Grindhouse"" was going to be split and would be shown as the individual films ""Death Proof"" and ""Planet Terror"". I could not wait until it came to the cinemas in England to oppress my curiosity to see whether it was the worst film that Tarantino and Rodriguez had ever done, so I pre-ordered it from America. I got both of them a while ago but I loved ""Death Proof"" so much. I think they are both good. But I love ""Death Proof's"" soundtrack and bought that as well! I understand that Tarantino's films are not the same as normal films but I think that is why I love them so much. I gave this film 10/10 because it exceeded my expectations!",Death Proof
401,maxdest,"Fun, but too long",6,1 March 2008,"The chase scenes were interesting, the dialog was snappy and as always with Tarantino the cinematography and soundtrack was excellent. The trashy 80s movie touches like the somewhat cheesy acting, unexpected cuts and random bad production added to the fun.Kurt Russell as 'Stuntman Mike' was the show stealer, but all the women accounted for themselves pretty well also. But, perhaps because I watched the stand alone version rather than the grind-house double-bill Death Proof seemed to drag a little. Ultimately it felt about 30-45 minutes too long.Overall a 6/10, but probably a whole lot better as it was originally intended.",Death Proof

It is meant to be a representation of grindhouse cinema of the 70s, so the story isn't really that great, it's supposed to be judged by the nostalgia it gives I guess. I didn't grow up in the 70s but wish I did, and it made me feel like I was in a seedy drive in theatre of LA back in the day. Really cool.",Death Proof
403,hokiefilm,"Close Second to ""Planet Terror""",8,4 February 2008,"I gave this title 8 out of 10 stars, which is lower than I give most Tarantino films. Overall, I thought that this movie was a great experience. The first fight scene was perfectly done... I especially enjoyed the Rose McGowen death/knock out scene-- ""I told you this was a death proof car, which wasn't a lie. But, to get the real benefit of it, you need to be sitting in my seat"" (I'm sure that quote is not exact... I'm doing this from memory, so forgive me). Like other Tarantino movies (i.e. ""Reservoir Dogs), he has great characterization at the beginning, which he accomplishes through having most of the characters in one place (in this case, a bar), including the villain, Kurt Russell. This scene makes for great entertainment and character development. It lets you get to know the villain, as well as develop an attachment to the other characters. The first crash scene comes as a pleasant surprise. I didn't expect the seemingly-main characters to be knocked off that soon in the film, but Tarantino throws in a ridiculously funny twist by shifting gears and taking the viewer to a completely different location-- same villain, different main characters/supposed victims. The only complaint I heard (from friends, haven't read these boards yet, sorry), was that the ending was poorly done. I have a friend who preferred the villain to win at the end. However, I think the girl-power/victim's revenge ending adds a comedic element to the whole film, which is what Tarantino seems to be aiming for. If you like Tarantino, you won't be disappointed in ""Death Proof."" He adds the perfect amount of characterization, gore, humor, and satire to this film and it's an excellent experience.Sidenote: Definitely watch both this and ""Planet Terror."" It's awesome to watch the two movies together, and, not to mention that, in my opinion, ""Planet Terror"" is even better than ""Death Proof.""",Death Proof
404,zarrod,Quentin Tarantino fails miserably at guiding my emotions,1,6 November 2008,"I enjoyed this movie up until I realized that I was ""supposed"" to like the four women in the second group of painfully obnoxious and boring girls. I recently watched an interview in which Tarantino expresses his desire to suck the audience into the final car chase by making them really want to see Stuntman Mike caught.Well if he wanted me to root for the protagonists, why did he make them so unlikable? And if he wanted me to root against the villain, why make him the most interesting and likable character in the film? Don't think I'm sexist either. I didn't mind at all when the female character in ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" chopped all those guys to pieces simply because she was a sympathetic character. I would have sympathized more with the women in ""Death Proof"" had they never started talking... swearing constantly, proclaiming their hatred for men, and treating each other like crap. Also, I felt that since they were stupid enough to play 'Ship's Mast,' they deserved some consequences, especially Kim and Zoe, the two worst actors and characters of the bunch.Not everything sucks, but unfortunately the good (the build up to a surprising massacre by head on collision and the first half of Kurt Russel's performance) occurs in the first half of the movie, and is completely forgotten after sitting through the malarkey of the second half. Luckily the music remains good throughout so you can just put on headphones, although that wouldn't save you from the incessant prattling of the real killers of the film, the female ""heroines."" One of the worst things about the film is how long we need to sit and watch these girls talk and talk and talk about pointless garbage. In ""Pulp Fiction,"" not only was the dialogue funny, but it was broken up by action which kept the tension just below the surface throughout the film. In this, the conversations are poorly written and there is no payoff whatsoever. I was hoping for the opposite outcome of what Tarantino had in mind... that the girl's blabbering would be put to an end by wonderfully bloody deaths, as happened with the first group of women.Maybe that alone was enough to get me to sympathize with Stuntman Mike. His character change after the film's midpoint is another thing that bothered me. He is willing to break his bones driving head on into another car but cries like a wimp when he's nicked by a bullet? Supposedly this movie is ""supposed to be bad"" as it's in the Grindhouse style but the cheesiness and sound popping and film quality were no problem for me. Stylistically, this film is successful in replicating the cheap exploitation and of the 60s and 70s. I just had a reversed idea of who the film's hero should have been and mistakenly believed that this was a movie about a psychotic killer who uses his car as a weapon and not a series of drawn out chats, one series followed by a crash, the other followed by a chase that ended contrarily to my hopes.This makes ""Planet Terror"" look like a good movie. In the words of Yahtzee Croshaw, ""('Death Proof') is what it took to finally make me lower my standards and I hope it's proud of itself.""",Death Proof
405,mcdegg,"Terrible movie,even worst than Grindhouse",1,5 November 2009,"Does Tarantino think he's ''cool'' by directing a pointless movie like this?And how about the dialog?There is not one single interesting line in the entire film.The characters are so empty and dumb that i couldn't care about what was going to happen with them. And why can't Tarantino make films that are not about monsters or psychos?Well from my point of view is because he's a limited director,not even close to Francis Ford Coppola or Steven Spielberg, for example. People use the word''genius''too easily these days,and Tarantino is definitely not a genius...he made two good films,and that's about it...The Grindhouse package is as bad is it gets.",Death Proof

Well its got lots of Tarantino's unique gimmicky editing. But what will bore the hell out of everyone that watches this film is Tarantino's trademark non plot driving dialogue. This was quite refreshing and new in Pulp Fiction etc. Here, he goes OTT with it. After all their drivel and waffle I didn't even give a sh*t whether the characters lived or died, except for maybe the kiwi girl. So it just wasted nearly an hour and a half of my life. The other 20 odd minutes were spent on the car chases and crash sequences, which were quite good, but not enough to save this movie. Kurt Russel does a decent turn, as do the girls. But they are so limited with their characters, that its hard for them to inject any substance into their roles. There's almost no back story to any of the characters. They all just happen to be going somewhere and meet a psychopath with a cool car who wants to kill them for no apparent reason. No intricate sub plots or twists or explanatory dialogue of any kind. It would have been worth the entry fee if I'd watched Planet Terror with it in its original Grindhouse cut. I just felt ripped off after paying £8/$16 to watch this. One star for Kurt, one for cool cars and one for first crash sequence. If all you want to do is listen to someone spouting sh*t for 2 hours, my mate's got some great stories with no points to them. After listening to him you will probably want to kill yourself in the car on the way home, so there's your car crash. I'm offering everything Tarantino's does for about half the price.",Death Proof

The movie shows some pretty graphic crash scenes, that make up for the dialogue that occupies the rest of the movie. I wouldn't recommend this for the faint of heart due to the face of dismendberment, blood, and drawn out frightening scenes. I played no attention to the plot, which entails girls talking about their sex lives for 40 minutes at times.

Then do the same yet again the next hour? I so thought these were going to be good movies. Project terror was a little better. I wont spoil the movie but it aggravates me just how random some movies seem. Tarentino went all crazy on the Kill Bill movies and i guess thats why this movies seems the same way. This movie is worth less than a rental and your girlfriend/wife will hate to see this movie anyways. Not to mention why would anyone do what the girl did on the hood of the car anyways?

I've seen Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill Vol. 1 and now this and I think I've had my fill of his movies. Why? Because they are all the same. Bunch of people blab about meaningless things mixed with over-the-top violence, mixed with incessant profanity sums up his movies in a nutshell. I wanted to believe that he can change his style around and give you something different but after seeing this its obvious that he cant.Death Proof in a nutshell: a couple of whores yap about meaningless things for an hour, get on the road and are killed by a crazed driver called Stuntman(Kurt Russell). Another group of girls are stalked by Stuntman, they survive and plan to deal with him while he turns into a craven wimp in the middle of the movie. They catch up with him and beat the snot out of him. The end.Nobody does anything that resembles acting here. Just a bunch of stupid people that yap about nothing for hours mixed with a stupid race scene. Kurt Russell is wasted on here as Stuntman. If I was the father of any of those broads(including the legendary Sydney Poitier), I would hang my head in shame. These dingbats are really inane and crass but then again when have you ever seen a respectable woman in a Tarantino flick? In short don't waste another minute on another overrated Tarantino flick. All of his movies are alike and he gets way too many undeserved kudos in this world. Now I know I've upset his fanboy fan base that foam at the mouth like a rabid dog groupie every time he's mentioned and to that I say I don't give a damn about your feelings! As a matter of fact you have no feelings of your own. You feel like what ever the consensus feels like. Just pathetic!

When watching this film you will notice its very low pace of story, many dialogues which sometimes may seem they don't make sense and last but not least a lot of emphasis in the characters and their extraordinary personalities. Also, do not expect action and quick time events.About the cast, Russel is very good as the psychopath and his way of approaching the women. The rest of the cast, although not that famous, is acting accordingly and one particular girl (Vanessa Ferlito) steals the show. The atmosphere is dark and thrilling and the sense of fear is unfolding slowly but at the same time adequately.To sum up, we could say this is a cult b-movie and we might be true. I give a 6 out of 10 because if you don't like Tarantino and his way of filming you will most likely not like this movie.

417,JohnTequila,Swing and a Miss (Just) **Possible Spoiler**,6,14 September 2007,"I never saw the US cinema version(I live in the UK) and have just watched the Un-rated DVD. Tarantino has delivered what I thought was one of the most exciting crashes and car chases I've seen in a very long time. The one with Zoe Bell on the hood was superb. What never worked for me was the script. His scripts are always fun to listen too, but his dialogue coming out of the young actresses mouth's was the biggest let down. I really like most of the stars, I think his dialogue only works on actors 30+ but that wouldn't have worked with the story. Since Reservoir Dogs, fans have enjoyed his unique writing and cool characters which, when put together, have made some of the best movies in the past two decades. I goes to show that his touch won't work in any occasion.The cast were also a let down, mostly because of the script, the black actresses seemed to be imitating Vivica Fox in Kill Bill. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Rosario Dawson (Two of the Hottest and talented young actresses around) were wasted. What worked though, was having Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike, There nothing Kurt cannot do in a role. Had it been another actor, I would have given it 5/10. To improve it, I would have made the script less Tarantinoesque, and had at least one more car chase with around 30 min cut in total.

418,pikhal020,Another solid entry from Tarantino,8,16 September 2007,"Death Proof really came alive for me when I saw it again without the more adrenaline charged Rodriguez zombie flick as the lead in. Its another example of what Tarantino really excels at: the amazing amalgamation of exploitation and art film sensibilities. He mixes up Godardian dialogue scenes with overt giallo tropes that create an atmospheric movie that is very different than your typical multiplex product. It doesn't just rush from one conflict/set-piece to the next, but builds on its own terms, hearkening back to the pace of the 70s movies he is paying homage to. The construction of the film effectively mimicked the sort of surreal breaks in continuity/logic that give many 70s exploitation films their fascinating charm, albeit indirectly from budget imposed limitations the makers had to work through. I thought that was pretty brilliant and really showed Tarantino's passion for these movies. He also continues to move in a more stylized direction, like in Kill Bill, and I guess we'll see if that turns out to be an overall good thing for his filmography. Having said that, the self aware hipster dialogue, particularly in the second half, does get frustrating and seems to slow down the film for no discernible purpose. The girl's stories are flat out boring, and that is a cardinal sin in my book. Tarantino definitely pulls off the first half a lot better, but the conclusion is very satisfying.",Death Proof

But personally, there's something very poetic to the Death Proof movie that not a lot of people see. This movie, being a tribute to the exploitation era of cinema has a lot more to say that meets the eye. It presents the theme of Missing your own previous time. The fact that presence is constantly changing and you can never travel back in time. Stuntman Mike is the most important character in the film as his story and motivation is incredibly unique. He misses the old days and his job and lifestyle has been rendered useless, Mike desperately tries to cling on to his past. This may easily be a self-insert for Tarantino himself. This isn't a complete tribute to Exploitation cinema, for the female characters that appear in the film are completely different to the ones audiences view in older movies. There are clear differences, proving Quentin didn't just watch a few Exploitation movies, take some notes and just make a movie out of it. He had interesting things to say about the ""death of cinema"" and having progressive, unique and interesting female characters compared to the ones feautured in the movies he was parodying. These women aren't objects or eye candy, they're characters you care for and become interested in.

426,glenxxvi,"good, but probably Tarantino's weakest effort",6,5 October 2007,"I did like this film but i felt that the dialogue scenes leading up to the killings was too long and at times boring, it should be able to get going within ten or fifteen minutes.I do like tarantinos clever camera work and settings, it makes a change from watching just a normally filmed movie.The action scenes in the film are very good and although there are only two great moments in the film (the first lot of girls getting killed in the middle of the film, then the other lot getting attacked by stuntman mike at the end) it is worth watching it just for these alone because Tarantino is excellent when it comes to action, kill bill is a very good example of this and the violence in this film was just as inspiring, especially the blonde girl getting bounced up and down to death by stuntman mikes death-proof car.I do like the unpredictability of the film as well, when I first saw it I wondered how he was going to give the blonde girl a lift and kill the other girls at the same time. Then later when stuntman mike is attacking the girls they get the upper hand and go after him and even though this was happening I still thought that stuntman mike would come out on top but they got him and the sudden ending was a big surprise.So in closing, DEATH PROOF is an OK film for what it is but it is probably Tarantino's weakest film in relation to the previous films that he has directed, so six out of ten.",Death Proof
427,Havgar,Very well made and a lot of fun to watch,10,11 March 2008,"""Death Proof"" seems to be a movie that divides people into two categories: people who love it and people who hate it. I don't think I need to explain which category I belong to, but I will try to provide some arguments.This movie is a homage to a lot of 70s exploitation films, having connections with such movies as ""Vanishing Point"", all of which is not to say you can't enjoy the movie as it is. In fact, this movie is amazingly fun to watch even if you've got no film culture background.The acting was top class, especially from Kurt Russell, but even from the girls of whom, with the exception of Rosario Dawson, I had no great expectations.The script is a classic Tarantino script, the dialog is wonderfully entertaining, and even though it takes up more screen time than the ""action"" scenes, it never once gets boring (for me at least).The soundtrack is wonderful, with a lot of 50s and 60s classics, and definitely works very well with the rest of the film to form a harmonious experience.If you happen to be a ""Grindhouse"" fan, then you'll probably get even more pleasure from watching this movie. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a problem with a little rough language and violence.Lastly, it should be mentioned that not only did this movie turn out to be a homage to a lot of Tarantino's favourites, it was conceived to be that way to begin with - as such don't expect a totally serious attempt at a slasher movie, but rather accept that there's a degree of fantasy involved, and just enjoy it for what it is.",Death Proof
428,joannaoman,Quentin Tarantino is on a mission again,7,12 October 2007,"Quentin Tarantino is on a mission again. The ass-kicking, boobs-bouncing, long-legged gals are in town and it's going to get messy. Two groups of girls going about their normal business: drinking, smoking pot, talking sex and cars, lap dancing for older dudes in their hot pants... hang on did I say ""normal""? Only in Tarantino movies. It makes you wonder, after Kill Bill and now this, what mother issues the genius Quentin is battling with. Good pace, original Charlie's Angels feel to the movie, good old American landscapes... a very watchable movie indeed. Men will enjoy the eye candy and the dominatrix innuendoes and girls will feel empowered even if they don't identify with the butch behaviour of these ""average"" women. In this man's view of the ""girls only"" world, Tarantino gives you glimpses not of the emancipated generation of women, but more of the used, confused and a little bitter modern man's world. Good fun though!",Death Proof
429,jefbtheone,Get this rating higher!,9,28 September 2008,"Yes, a movie with a bunch of chicks talking throughout half the movie is really that good. Why? One word - Tarantino. Of course, the characters are always interesting in his films because of the script and the dominant personalities. If it's not Uma Thurman or Samuel Jackson, it's Kurt Russell and Rosario Dawson. What movie do they not grab your attention at least a little bit? The movie was just filled with quotables like ""You're alright in my book!"" and Eli Roth jumping in with ""looks like he cut himself falling out of his time machine"". The old school horror movie thing was great..loved it. The car scenes pretty much made the movie. The instant replays of the first crash to the hood-riding stuntwoman sliding around, all very entertaining. The only reason I think it would be rated lower than an overall rating of an 8 is if the viewer is female or homosexual or because it was more of the slasher horror than one with a particularly creative plot. It was quite original but yes the story was short and basic. And with all the hot women it may not appeal to women and homosexuals, because that part of the movie played a big piece in entertaining the viewer. So if you don't like hot women dancing, sex stories and trashy bar talk, you might not like the movie. Out of all Tarantino's, I can say that Death Proof was as well-written as most of them (exclude Pulp Fiction which was the best) but yet the storyline was quite basic. Overall it was well-done and filmed with the usual originality. I think a couple extra scenes could have concluded the movie better. Maybe he could have shown what happened to their cheerleader friend. He also could have squeezed in a little more action between the dialogue of the second group of girls.",Death Proof
430,Sean-M,Assumption is the mother of all.....,4,23 September 2007,"Make no mistake, Death Proof is not a particularly entertaining film. In Russell and Tarantino you have a collaboration that I would and did pay good money to see. And in doing so I allowed myself to be misled by some astute promotional work on the part of Dimension Films (there's a new one) and a premise that all but screamed slasher film only to set up as anything but.Like a moth drawn to the light, the lure of Kurt Russell engaging in road movie violence was too much to resist. It may not have been a deliberate fiction on the part of the film-maker to pack out the theaters with this premise. After all, Tarantino himself has publicly emphasised the difference between this movie and a slasher movie. Nevertheless the fiction remained right up until the credits rolled, by which stage you can't help but feel that Tarantino misused Russell in yet another attempt to further popularise his now distinctive style of film. A style that increasingly seems to resemble the director using his lofty position in the industry to showcase the 1970s because the rest of us don't know what we've missed. And I personally would not have had a problem with this had he not taken an 80s icon and epitome of bad-assedness and then proceeded to sell him down the river before my very eyes by making him both different and diluted.Kurt Russell plays the role of Stuntman Mike, a psychopathic personality who stalks the roads in his death proof car preying on young and attractive women. As an idea it reads like a dream. In reality it was inconsistent and boring. Tarantino hung large sections of dialogue on the women in the picture, both hunters and hunted, while the audience waited patiently for something to happen amid the bluff and bluster of conversations that included references to sex, marijuana and of course lots of swear words, all stock in trade of an increasingly one dimensional Tarantino. In Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and even Jackie Brown these references are welcome and fresh. They represent breakout material. In Death Proof they are tired and old. You've seen it before. Again the script will likely be praised as another piece in the overall body of work that encompasses the genius. Those who disagree will be told they don't get it. What I got was that Tarantino makes use of fleeting bar-room wisdom, Robert Frost and Rose McGowan to let us know that Stuntman Mike is psychopathic. Alongside a dark car. And guess what? Not one of the three is unique in the slightest. And so the film lurches like a bar-room drunk between not having enough depth to be interesting on the dialogue alone and not having enough violence or tension to be interesting in the exploitation sense, all while being obvious from the outset, a bad combination to have. It runs slow, lacks build-up in key areas, is certainly predictable from one particular elongated scene onwards and is largely too abstract amid the boredom. To say it reminded me of Cannonball run is no exaggeration, from serious to slapstick while actually staying violent.Kurt Russell! The Thing. Escape from New York. Big trouble in little China. THAT Kurt Russell is not the one you see in this film. Critically this will be received well because for what it is, it is great. And what it is is a raw showing of female empowerment, bad versus badass. The fact that this sort of material has a very specific time and place that isn't necessarily on the back of a potentially iconic collaboration is what lets Death Proof down. Do the research before watching this one.",Death Proof
431,greenday840,I wished for Death,4,5 February 2013,"Come on, why the hell people are mad about this Tarantino guy. He can hardly make a good movie, the characters are usually over the top and the final product is an instant headache. Well, death proof is no exception and it has not done anything to change my views about Tarantino.For people who liked Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill and Reservior Dogs, I do not envy you. The Human Brain is a complex organ and sometimes repeated assault on the senses can cause some damage. The above mentioned movies do just that and now Deathproof does not lag far behind. This movie falls in the same league. Tarantino is a average director, he does place caution on the details and he somehow manages to get the stars to work with him, but i do not understand the frenzy around his movies. There is hardly any excitement in his movies and all we get is an unfinished product.Deathproof, though a part of the double feature, Grindhouse, is presented a single movie. Bad Idea. Planet Terror was better. There is nothing in this movie to write home about,except Kurt Russell. I agree with Tarantino, that Kurt deserves better roles. But this one, not sure. The ladies stack up like cheerleaders and none of them actually do get to act. All they do is keep on abusing each other verbally.The movie is presented in a B-Grade sort of environment. It is very difficult to hear the dialogues and the picture keeps cutting in and out. Overall, it was a very bad experience. Many people believe this guy to be a world class film-maker which is fine, all i am saying is he may not be the world class director he is thought to be.",Death Proof
432,billy-jackson56,"crap, just crap with some feet thrown in for good measure",1,17 September 2010,"I guess if you make a film like pulp fiction you can get away with making a film this diabolically crap. I can't see how this would appeal to anyone apart from insomniacs or perverts with a weird foot fetish like Tarantino. Here is a director that is so self indulgent he has almost become like the new Russ Meyer but whereas Russ Meyer had a thing for tits Tarantino seems to have a thing for feet it was bad enough seeing Uma Thurman's size 18's projected onto a huge cinema screen and Bridget Fonda's and Diane Krueger's yet here we are treated to Rosario Dawson's and some other unknown actresses who will never have a career because they obviously can't act, and who the hell told Tarantino he could write strong female characters this is a person who quite clearly hasn't lost his virginity yet and i'm betting never will, and not because he looks like a turd or talks like a turd or even acts like a turd but because fundamentally deep down he is a creep. I cannot believe any established actress would ever want to appear in any of his upcoming crap fest's like inglourious or whatever the hell he decided to call it, of course there are a lot of Moron's who still consider Tarantino as some kind of cinematic genius because he made pulp fiction but he also made Jackie brown and kill bill vol 1 and 2 and this, surely he should be black listed from the film industry, i'm guessing this is a film which he made purely to indulge his sick fantasies and not something he spent a long time and hard work and effort to make great like Leone or Kubrick or Rodriguez would have done. He should just retire and make foot porn and give us all a break, i WOULD NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAKING THIS KIND OF CRAP IF IT WASN'T ALWAYS FORCED DOWN OUR THROATS BUT UNFORTUNATELY ITS ALWAYS Tarantino HAS A NEW MOVIE OUT BECAUSE OF COURSE HE IS THE SECOND COMING OF Christ! the thing with Tarantino is that he made three good films in the beginning of his career but with the more power and prestige he obtained the more he could have his sick desires fulfilled, if you chopped this film up taking out all of the shots of feet you would probably have a film that ran for 5 minutes thats if you exclude of course all the horse s**t dialogue that the actress spew out of the ugly faces in this film i could just imagine Tarantino looking at the rushes of what he had shot that day in his trailer with a box of tissues by his side with the film on freeze frame.",Death Proof
433,rahilsp,An superb underrated film,9,6 August 2011,"Being a big Tarinto fan I expected a lot from this film and I was not let down. I've read many reviews which slate this film but I believe that these viewers have not understood what Tarinto was trying to do when making Death Proof.I somehow felt so transfixed to the screen when I was just watching a group of girls having a casual chat in a car. I don't know how Tarinto does this but his screenplay is always spot on. Most scenes in this film actually have little relevance to the actual plot but if anything this adds to the beauty of it. The characterization was also very good. Kurt Russell's haunting and creepy character Stuntman Mike is perfectly juxtaposed with the girls in both parts. His eeriness helps to create tension which finally explodes when his psychotic behavior is fully shown in a typically gruesome Tarinto scene where he kills all the girls in a horrific car crash.The second segment is similar in many ways to the first. Zoe Bell (a stunt woman often used by Tarinto) makes a great appearance playing her daredevil self. Again, much of this segment is filled with a lot of casual chat, but that is definitely not a bad thing. I'm sure that many of you had a shock when you realized that this half actually started black and white showing how engulfed you all were in this film. This half, contrasting to the first has a very different conclusion. The last twenty minutes or so had me on the edge of my seat as Stuntman Mike tries once again to kill a group of girls with his death proof car. However, this time he has Zoe Bell to contend with who somehow clings on for life whilst performing ""ship's mast"" and in the end we see him meet his sorry end.",Death Proof
434,Rick96,Incredibly unique Tarantino film.,8,10 July 2021,"Death Proof (2007)In what has been dubbed ""Tarantino's worst movie"", it is truly a masterpiece for what it is. This movie is notable for the way it features a terrific dim-lit/monologue styled filming technique that pays homage to many chase movies of the 70s.Death Proof follows two different sets of attractive women that are ultimately being stalked by a serial killing psychopath. The movie isn't as action-packed as many of QT's other films which has left fans divided. The movie instead relies heavily upon witty dialogue, incredible drive action sequences, and a dark twist.The movie offers a unique outlook on feminism; the first group of girls control their environment with sex appeal while the second group is far more independant and ultimately give the serial killer more than he bargained for. Although the second sequence is a bit dialogue heavy, this movie is undoubtedly a great watch.Grade: B+",Death Proof
435,theviperqueen,Great movie. Old school style,8,29 June 2017,"***My review focuses on the movie itself&the characters(to a lesser extent),not the actors,directors,or any of that nonsense*** As a slasher movie fan,I found this movie was a slasher movie of a different kind&in less strict,looser definition of the term,as the weapon of choice is a car¬ a butcher knife,or machete. Sure,it has it's slow moments,like any good movie should(all action all the time,is very often tedious,IMO)&the dialog was'nt too bad,interesting for the most part,just a bit too much of it,at times(Kims dialog was a bit overdone,for my taste. Funny,but a bit too overdone. Maybe it was meant to be that way,though.) Many say that the first half is the boring half of the movie,but the first half,is my favorite half,as you get to see the one&only murder done by Stuntman Mike,in the movie. And it is a good one,even if not typical. Plus,the first half,just seemed a bit more complex(to a small degree)&interesting,in a 'day in the life of',kind of way,like watching ordinary people go about their day&goof off.&have their idea of fun. Not that I did'nt thoroughly enjoy the ships mast chase. That WAS pretty badass. Others can poo-poo this movie,because it's 'old-school' style,but I happen to like it&I don't base my opinion,on other peoples opinions&reviews of it. To be completely honest,this is the closest thing to a 'chick flick',that I actually like. My only true gripe,is they killed off the killer&I would have liked a sequel(just one),to see more of Stuntman Mikes...'adventures',because though he's not a typical knife-wielding slasher(which I like),he was interesting. It's an unusual movie in ways¬ a style of movie most 'movie snobs' are into,as they usually prefer more 'mainstream' stuff. I'd say give it an honest chance&maybe you'll enjoy it for what is,not for what it is'nt.",Death Proof

437,HeatIsTheBestMovie,A movie by Quentin Menke!,8,3 November 2020,"This movie is an editing masterpiece. RIP Sally Menke.I can remark the same about acting, cinematography, and creative directing of visual effects.the film tells you to see yourself as strong and not get caught in some habits.One of the reasons why you might want to watch this movie is because the story happens in a close time period so you can see how Tarantino tends to visualize his stories in the 00s time period.In my opinion, the movie shows the general mindset of men and woman and how you shouldn't see yourself weak in life no matter of your age, gender, color and to not get caught in some addictive habits that encourage you to ignore some risks in life which could, or, actually will kill you at the end.As in all the other Jerome Tarantino movies, we see lots of different characters that have so much complexity that you could easily make a movie about each of them. Through the story, their life throws many life lessons in front of them but it also cares if they take it or not.I don't know why but funnily I think Tarantino is trolling us :D If we take this movie for instance, as far as I remember, who the hell was that Motorcycle driver that towards the end of the movie? :D I mean you can see him in the background but It confuses you the first time you watch the movie. Or the police chief who figured out what exactly happened at the scene but didn't pursue more to solve the case. (I guess it was a nice little decoration to the movie and maybe also s referencing of how smart but also how lazy a Texas police can be.We also see a lot of other female and male relationships with different problems.Don't expect a story where you'll cry at the end but except a story that will make you feel stronger, right after you watch it.Good for a ""movie night"" watch it with your friends and dogs...",Death Proof
438,Pineapples101,"Fun, but Tarantino needs to stop with the self homage.",7,27 September 2007,"Just watched the extended cut at my local British cinema. Im surprised no-one has referanced Mad Max yet, there were times when I felt I was watching that instead of what I expected to see. I was also annoyed that Mad Max was not referanced in the film it self, amongst all the dialogue - heavy film references - Vanishing Point, Gone in 60 Seconds (original) etc etcAnyway, I was let down and impressed at the same time. I am deeply annoyed that we in the UK were not given Grindhouse. DP while an enjoyable homage to B-movie, exploitation flicks would clearly have worked better in it's truncated form. I haven't even seen the shorter Grindhouse version but I can already guess I would have enjoyed it more. This film needs to be 90 minutes, it felt desperately padded out at 2hrs and I suspect that any tension built up in the GH version was severely lost in the extended version as character after character reel off overly long and overly articulate speeches that can only be described as a Tarrantino self homage.And who the hell talks like that? Mob Bosses, Samurai warriors and bible quoting hit men churning out overly elaborate monologues I can handle... but gangs of young women - many of whom were clearly not the brightest sparks - coming out with this kind of stuff... I know one was a radio DJ, but come on!And added to that the inclusion of Big Kahuna's, red apples and the excessive foot fetish, I just felt I was watching a 'fresh out of film school' kids attempt to suck up to Tarrantino. Is Quentin just buying into his own hype too much? I dunno?But saying all that, there were plenty of astounding moments throughout, I giggled my way through every film scratch, mis-frame, fudged soundtrack moment and scene jump. Kurt Russell proves once again to be the most underrated actor known to man, Tarrantino turned in a good performance, and the car chases themselves were legitimately tense, possibly due to the superb stunt work of Zoe Bell, but the fact that it was clearly not under cranked helped a great deal.Regarding the obvious shift in quality between the two sections, I for one assumed this was an in-joke to this being two 'bad' films that the Grindhouse theatre had simply spliced together to make one film, sort of like what we got with Shogun Assassin (Lone Wolf and Cub: Sword of Vengeance)One other minor quip, I recently saw an interview with QT on UK TV (Johnathan Ross) where he made a big point of saying that his car chases had to live up to what he considered the greatest car chases ever... clearly he hasn't seen Frankenheimers Ronin then?I must see the Grindhouse cut, I know I will love it. The extended cut felt like a workprint cut (in terms of it feeling un-trimmed in length) I feel we in the none US have been quite short changed of an experience that could have been fantastic.",Death Proof

It's just God-awful quacking.End of Part I: Thirty seconds of really gushy murder by car, and the one decent line in the entire movie.Part II: Some other chicks repeat the mind-numbing formula described in Part I, except this time, it's revealed that for some reason, one of them has a gun. (If you don't know what ""foreshadowing"" means, look it up.)End of Part II: About five minutes of predictable and unbelievable car chases, shooting, stomping, and Grrrl Power.To sum up: This movie has one good thing going for it: an awesome soundtrack.

It's quintessentially old fashioned, with an old fashioned villain a 'simple' sociopath, no grand or supreme level of intellect as per the modern movie trend of Marvel and DC villains like the Joker and Doc Oc. The villain, who is the focus of this film enjoys killing for the delight of the hunt, a true cat and mouse thriller Kilmer projects he role of cold murderer with a streak of class and benevolence which culminates in a great old fashioned Mustang, vanishing point esquire chase.This is simply a good fun movie, designed for cinema 'goers' who enjoy the art and history of cinema, you wanna watch an epic, lord of the rings is selling cheap these days.

Excellent stunt scenes performed by women (I assume they did their own scenes, it looked like it). Great car chases. It was nice to see Kurt Russel in action again also. He looks pretty ""mature"" in this movie at 56 he looks well worn but that may have been partially due to the way he was portrayed.Zoe Bell is the star of the show in my opinion.

Throughout the movie there are two parts which are pretty much awesome, and the rest is a long voyage in boredomtown.This was supposed to be a homage to older B movies, but it's not doing that.

Though you may want to rent it and ff through 4/5 of the movie.I like Tarantino, as much as Jimi Hendrix. He found a new thing to do in movies, but is repeating himself, and feeding off of his image. From my perspective of course. There are many now who would and could shoot Tarantino movies better than him. After watching this movie, I think maybe he should just be a producer and just push movies of his liking through his charms and connections.",Death Proof
450,AntoNEO,Death and dialogue at 200 MPH!,8,18 October 2007,"Death Proof was the second half of Robert Rodriguez' and Quentin Tarantino's audacious Grindhouse double feature, and it has just been released on DVD as a standalone film in its original uncut form, no longer trimmed to fit a three hour running time with fellow Grindhouse feature, Planet Terror.Seeing it in its uncut form and without an hour and a half of over the top campy violence preceding it, Death Proof can now be appreciated on its own terms. Death Proof is much more successful as a standalone Quentin Tarantino film than it was as the second half of a Grindhouse double feature. The truth is, Death Proof was far too talky and way too devoid of action to sustain the climax of a three hour plus double feature. Furthermore, while Tarantino's film is indeed the more authentic 70s grindhouse picture (Rodriguez' was more of a boisterous caricature), it simply didn't have enough of the key elements to fit snugly alongside Planet Terror as a rowdy good time.So now that we have Death Proof standing its own two feet, we can truly appreciate it for its own merits, even if it is by no means a flawless film.Across the board, the performances are wonderful. Every actor seems perfectly capable of handling Tarantino's trademark mouthfuls of dialogue. Kurt Russell gives an amazing performance as Stuntman Mike. Russell hits a variety of tones, from disarmingly innocent, to subtly frightening, to comically cowardly. His tough guy persona mirrors many of his iconic performances in John Carpenter films in years passed. By the end of the film, we witness a complete inversion of that archetypal persona that provides a wonderful ironic twist as well as some unexpected comedy for those of us who grew up on Russell's other films.The action sequences, though only two in number, pack an enormous punch, and prove to be some of the most intense vehicle driven action sequences in a number of years. Tarantino plays everything for real with absolutely no CGI enhancement, and the result hearkens back to a bygone era of visceral simplicity.As usual, Tarantino's visual eye is spot on, making the film another directorial feat. From the aforementioned action sequences to the choices of music, he gives the film that unique Tarantino feel.As for the weaknesses of the film, the most noticeable one is that this film is just plain too talky. I know we come to expect lots of dialogue in a Tarantino film, but this really is a horror/action film at its core, and given the genre, there's just not enough horror or action. I honestly think that just cutting snippets of dialogue here and there and replacing that running time with one more action set piece would have improved the film quite a bit. Then Tarantino would have struck an appropriate balance between his own predilections and the confines of the genre he's working in. As it stands, Death Proof is caught between Tarantino's love of the written word, and the more action oriented elements of the genre.The overabundance of dialogue also reveals the fact that Death Proof has barely any plot to speak of. I'm not saying other horror movies have any more plot than Death Proof, but one starts to wonder how long the movie would actually be if the bulk of the dialogue was cut out. Honestly, it would be a pretty short flick, because when you get down to it, Death Proof is really just about a homicidal stuntdriver stalking and killing a group of young women, and that's about it. In fact, Tarantino essentially tells the same exact story twice, once in the first hour and then again in the second hour. This gives the film a bit of an uneven structure. Sure, it has a nice Hitchcockian flare to it, but the way its executed, one can't help but find the second half of the film a little redundant.Despite these shortcomings, Death Proof is still a very entertaining and rewatchable film. After all, it may be a slightly weaker Tarantino film, but even lesser Tarantino is miles better than the majority of films being released these days. Just know that it's not really an action/horror film like its Grindhouse counterpart. Go into the film expecting a dialogue heavy Tarantino film with some great action/horror elements and you certainly won't be disappointed.",Death Proof
451,Unholyxxxx,Best B-movie ever!,10,10 September 2008,"This is by far the scariest and most disturbing movie I've seen in a very long time. People who are complaining about the long dialogs should go watch cartoons or something, if you don't recognize a genius at work, from the first shot on, go watch cartoons. The dialogs where well-written, funny and believable, like you can expect from our brilliant Mr. Tarantino. Just have patience and see what happens, and what will happen is shocking, ruthless and unexpected. I didn't know anything about this movie until I saw it; somehow I succeeded in not seeing any trailer or hearing any stories about it. So I didn't have a clue of what Dead Proof was about, and surprisingly it turned out to be an instant horror-classic, one of few that has actually cost me a few hours of sleep... The less you know about this movie, the more you will get blown away by this masterpiece, so my review ends here.It doesn't get more better than this, so 10/10.",Death Proof
452,greenfarfan,Quentin Tarantino's only Horror Film: Death Proof!,8,2 November 2016,"Mr. Quentin Tarantino brought back the classic slasher genre by making a film in the style of B-movies from back in the day. Starring Kurt Russell as a psycho who goes by the name of ""Stuntman Mike"", Death Proof sort of tricks the audience by focusing on a certain group of girls for roughly the first 40 minutes of the film until Stuntman Mike ""Does his work"". During the rest of the movie, Kurt Russell's character has his eyes set on another group of girls. This time however, things won't go as he expected. Compared to Tarantino's other work, Death Proof doesn't seem so great but in the end, it's a fun thriller to watch.",Death Proof
453,filmvisuality,To The Disbelievers...Shove It,8,15 April 2008,"This was, as many other IMDb reviewers will call it, an 'ego-trip' for Tarantino. I couldn't agree more - but this is why we watch his films! Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown, all insular dialogue that highlights Tarantino's wealth of knowledge and ability to make things sound cool. So any problems with the dialogue should be left here. It's a fact: Tarantino is the master of dialogue, from a bunch of girls talking about 'the thing' to Kurt Russell's unbelievably amazing Stuntman Mike's ideologies, he is king.The acting was awesome, apart from Zoe Bell, who provides a huge difference in Tarantino film-making. I don't want to discredit her, because she played her part well, but sometimes it didn't flow as well as it could've. Kurt Russell is awesome. Enough said. The girls were great, pick of the bunch is Vanessa Ferlito, with honourable mentions to Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Rosario Dawson.Many viewers will contrast the two parts of the film, Jungle Julia's group and Abernathy's group. It is undeniable that there is a great difference in the execution of these two sections, shown through the change in appearance on screen (you'll notice it), yet many people see this as a bad thing. What Tarantino has done is mash the Grindhouse films together, with the former half of the film being a creepy stalker movie and the latter being a stunt movie. Being different is not bad, case-in-point: Pulp Fiction.Some people note that it lags, that the action is not there. These viewers don't appreciate Tarantino films. Go back to Transformers if you want to see things blow up, for a real story, come to QT. The characters were so believable that you didn't notice the time gone by. I only recognized when I looked at the DVD player that he had spun 3 scenes into 40 minutes! That is very very cool.Death Proof doesn't set itself out to be normal, it is a strange trip back in time, yet with a self-mocking ending, it's clear that all Tarantino wanted to do was have a fun time and share it with everyone, that in itself, is the beauty of film-making.""Movies are my religion and God is my patron. I'm lucky enough to be in the position where I don't make movies to pay for my pool. When I make a movie, I want it to be everything to me; like I would die for it."" - Quentin Tarantino",Death Proof
454,demicore,Disappointing :(,4,6 June 2007,"Before starting I have to warn that I was immensely hyped up towards this movie, with Tarantino being one of my favorite directors and Kurt Russell being my favorite actor ever, so my high expectations most likely played a big part in the disappointment.I don't have much to say really, the movie just leaves you feeling empty when you're done watching. It's a whole lot of exposition and *minor spoiler* two action scenes *end of minor spoiler*, it just doesn't feel like a whole movie. It would probably be awesome as a half of Grindhouse if that ever gets released but as a single feature movie it's just not worth the price of admission.This movie might please Kurt Russell fans since he is simply awesome in it (even though you'll have to trudge through the endless exposition of the female characters in order to get to the Russell parts) and car buffs might like it too, but as a normal movie-goer looking for a good time in my humble opinion Death Proof just won't fit the bill for you.",Death Proof
455,harry-tresoor,Cheep Thills - The Best There Are,8,20 June 2007,"I have just seen both Vanishing Point (1971) and Death Proof (2007), USA version - both movies have a lot in common.This is not one of Quentin's best movies, I agree. They are definitely ""Jackie Brown"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". But hey, this is supposed to be a B-movie. It is though very much a Tarantino movie, with all the details, quotes and music (great music). Beautiful girls, hyper violence, foot fetish and quoting a lot of (his own) movies. This is the second part of the 2007 Grindhouse series, giving Robert Rodriguez all the credits for the first part (with the Machete trailer). They are both good movies.The movie is divided into two parts with two simple (non) stories. A bunch of lovely girls drink/driving, haunted by a crazy killer male car driver (both played by Kurt Russel). The build-up of the first part is pretty slow (a lot of blabbering girls in a bar), but is pretty haunting and threatening; it has though an explosive ending.The second part is about a group of lovely female stunt-drivers on a 3-day holiday in USA driving around in a yellow vintage Ford Mustang Mach III (completely unbelievable, but great). They will meet Mike's senior brother. He is not that lucky as his younger brother.The second part is all about quoting the 1971 ""Vanishing Point"" movie - it has about the same 1970/1971 white Dodge Challenger RT as the main character. The hood scene with Zoë Bell is a really hot scene.When you are a Quentin Tarantino addict, this looks likes another of his masterpieces. Cinematography, casting, sound, songs, cutting; all fits in great - for the purpose of a retro B-movie. But I like his other movies better.Why you should see this movie? 1. It is a Quentin Taratino movie 2. It has some hyper violent scenes 3. He is quoting the culty ""Vanishing Point"" movie 4. A 1970 Dodge Challenger RT sounds great 5. Zoë Bell is great in the car-chase sceneI give it a 8.0 out of 10.0",Death Proof
456,petzoid,Only for car fanatics!,4,13 July 2007,I guess you either have to be totally into cars or certain American series from the 70's to like this movie. I really cant understand why this movie has such a high rating. I have to admit I liked Kusrt Russell in that role and he did a really good job but this movie has no story or plot or anything. The car chase is exiting alright but really not that spectacular. How about some background information about why Mike does what he is doing? The end of that movie is utterly disappointing and leaves you with the feeling that you just wasted time you could have spent doing something productive or even watch a decent movie. I do understand that this flick is supposed to be a homage to B-Movies but I guess I just dislike B-Movies then.By this movie I was reassured again that Tarantino is just way overrated!,Death Proof
457,jacksherak,Better than I was led to believe,8,22 May 2008,"I had heard this was poor so never bothered looking out for it, anyho at a loose end yesterday evening and browsing the on demand movies I saw it and thought I would take a look.I won't go into the same detail that people before me have gone into but what I will say is that after the first 10 mins I felt the urge to turn it off.Whist I got the dialogue heavy intro I was expecting I didn't think the cast were doing a very good job of pulling it off (pulp fiction and kill bill at the front of my mind). I stuck with it then the penny started to drop, the whole style of the film gelled and it became more apparent that, love it or hate it, what was being presented was exactly what was intended.On starting to watch the film I wasn't really sure what to expect so its fair to say it was being measured against Tarantino's previous films, after readjusting my expectations slightly 15 to 20 mins into the film I was glued to the screen right to the very end.Like the guy below me says, it could be considered a little self indulgent by Tarantino but isn't this why he became famous in the first place.I really enjoyed it!",Death Proof
458,pleasendlost,Am I The Only Person Who Liked This?,7,10 February 2008,"I don't understand the vitriol directed at QT for this movie. It's not that bad! First, the negatives - it's nothing like a grind house movie, yes, OK, the girls' conversation gets a little boring at times, and it has ego stamped all over it.But the positives - awesome cars, awesome use of these cars, a thrilling car chase with a woman clinging to the hood, a memorable bad guy, great music! QT seems to have a foot fetish, and loves strong, hard, alpha females. He also thinks that everyone under the age of 40 spends most of their free time getting wasted! This isn't a bad thing, he's built movies around this before, it just comes across as a little clichéd in this one.Overrall, not QTs best one, but not every director has a 100% unbeaten record.

Yes it's disgusting that Tarantino could be compared to any film with Nicholas Cage, we know. Tarantino is an artist and in a complete class of his own, however I don't believe that we're ready for him. I put on Death Proof and it only took me 8 minutes to realise I would have to get extremely high to get through the rest. It was fairly hard to concentrate when your mind gets thrown about trying to contemplate weather it's 1977 or 2007. Watching the old school car chases in retro scenes with 70's themes and all of a sudden a 2007 Nissan Micra will drive past!

460,Dave_mech,Great Tarantino movie!,8,5 September 2007,"I can't believe how many people thought this was a bad movie. I think they might have viewed it with a ""wrong eye"". It's a Tarantino movie! That means it's all about nice dialogs great visual details and a (in most cases) a pretty easy story that is worked out so well it works.In a nutshell it's about a guy that likes to kill girls with his car. Pretty simple, however the car chases and everything that comes with it are so intense. Some times I really sat on the edge of my seat. Not because you don't know what is going to happen (because that is pretty obvious) but because of the way that it's filmed you really get a sort of adrenaline rush yourself.I don't see this as a B-film either, it's made in this style on purpose and in a very good way. I can understand why people might not like it because of the style but that doesn't make this a bad movie. I said it before, IMDb is starting to get to much about opinion. Opinion is important but if you don't like a movie it doesn't mean the movie sucks.Anyway, I think everyone who likes Tarantino movies will be pleased to see this one. Over the top but not like kill bill, he brought the pulp fiction style back a little in this one. Enjoy!",Death Proof
461,hitfan,"Tarantino's homage to the ""B"" movie does not feel like one",5,14 July 2008,"I was one of the few moviegoers looking forward to ""Grindhouse"" as it was being advertised before it's release. I've recently acquired several DVD box sets of public domain horror films (Treeline's 50 Movie packs: Classic Horror, Nightmare Worlds), along with a few Hammer films and a lot of Elvira Movie Macabre VHS recordings. I'm pretty much the target market for ""Grindhouse"" and I easily recognized the elements that were parodied here.While the first half, ""Planet Terror"" was a lot of fun to watch, I found ""Death Proof"" to be lacking. Some have argued that a lot of 1970s low budget films contained too much dialogue with only a handful of money shots, which is what this film sought to emulate. Call me a 'male chauvinist pig', but to hear endless girl talk on film is akin to being forced to listen to the sound of a cat scratching a blackboard or watch ""The View"".There's a few things that I did like, however. I thought that the opening montage was quite clever--we get to see a brief frame ""Thunderbolt!"" being covered up by a ""DEATH PROOF"" title card giving us the impression that this film had a previous theatrical release under it's former name. A lot of low-budget movies would be recycled in this manner, apparently.I did like Kurt Russell's ""Stuntman Mike"" somewhat. In the first half he was quite entertaining, but I was saddened to see him degenerate into a caricature of a wimp in the second act. If one should make a feminist revenge film, I think it's better to make the villain even more macho right to the end. Film heroes are only as good as their antagonists.",Death Proof

Nonsense gaily talk for most part of the movie. OK we all love that lap dance but anyway what was the point? Come on Quentin what happened to you man? I reckon that being a multimillionaire does not help very much your creativity.but it will be difficult to made a worse flick. I only felt sorry for Kurt Russel being wasted as he was. You can openly see the potential of his character but feel pity how this mess ended up One last thing, wasn't that car supposed to be deathproof?But not girlsproof? hahaha So do yourself a favour and watch this as a substitute for an sleeping pill when shown eventually late at night on TV.",Death Proof

Tracie Thoms as Kim was a standout (reminding me of comedienne Wanda Sykes with her delivery of Tarantino's script) but stunt woman Zoe Bell also deserves a nod for a role in which she performed all of her own stunts with no special effects.

That is why I am giving this a 3 and not a 1. That part was spectacular.The dialog is so absurd, girls talking about nonsense throughout the entire movie. Even the continuity of the film was bad.

I suppose the movie is purely a referential hoot for film buffs and those who have a bent for irresponsible cinema.In-jokes abound,cameo roles.Hey,great to see that mad film maker Eli Roth turn up playing what appears to be his scabrous self. Kurt Russell's evolution from Disney movies to Snake Pliskin and now Stuntman Mike. Stuntman Mike is just a jaded Snake Plisken with some unusual interests.I figure Quentin has intentionally besmershed the genres mixing it all up to produce some pure American grunge. DEATH PROOF is thoroughly enjoyable if you dig trashy movies and let's face it,trashy flicks are great time wasters.They're also great escapes from the hard rigours of life in the 21st century.

467,keef7474,A grindhouse film very worth a mention.,7,18 August 2008,"'Death proof' the grindhouse feature is a very well made film interestingly pointing back to a time of fast girls and even faster cars. The film is instantly recognizable as a Tarantino flick. It is mended together by long dialog sometimes boring meaningless idle chatter. But now don't get me wrong this is not at all bad, just very Tarantino in style. A lot of people did find it somewhat annoying but hey the film is a great reflection of the writer so enjoy it. Now for my review. This movie seemed to start slow, had no direction, no plot, a lot of dialog and attractive girls doing what they do best 'talk'. In saying this it gave the film a very shocking and twisted middle section after act one when everything changed as you know it will but its a matter of when will it change??? A lot just happened suddenly and its this 'sudden shock' that really changed the whole direction of the film, classic Tarantino again. The film skips has black marks on it, jumps, has a lot of grain lines and noise. This is Giving the film a 70's movie cinema feel and its great I loved it. There is great use of some fantastic camera work in this film and a lot of reminders to the 70's are mentioned. Kurt is always cool and shines through in this film. The stunts and car chases are well made and as usual acting is top shelf. A very different film, very original idea and story with that Tarantino feel throughout. An interesting usage of mobile phones (very not 70's but it fits in) 70's music mixed in with the time's atmosphere and record duke boxes in bars. Old muscle cars that sound great, Margareta s and nice girls. A must see.",Death Proof
468,kakihara83-717-174032,Out of love,8,15 February 2011,"Let's start this review by saying that I really, really enjoyed this movie no matter what people say and how many movies it stole from. Anyway, when it comes to Quentin Tarantino, we should know what to expect, and still I always wondered if his movies appealed more to grindhouse-oriented people or if regular audiences without knowledges of exploitation cinema are more likely to enjoy them. I really couldn't say. A lot of people also thought this was below his usual standards of quality. Sure we can all agree this is not Pulp Fiction, but ''in my book'' Death Proof was superior to Kill Bill, which was, ''in my book'' again, a little overrated. I should add that I really enjoyed this whole ''Grindhouse Double Feature'' nostalgic ride. I watched it at the theatre and it was great. The fake trailers were awesome, Eli Roth's Thanksgiving being my favourite of the bunch (and how I hope he's gonna turn it into a movie someday). But as good-looking and entertaining as Planet Terror was, I thought it was a little too much ''in your face''. And don't get me wrong, I truly, deeply, sincerely respect Robert Rodriguez as a director, and this film, along with Shaun of the Dead, was a perfect homage to the zombie genre. But there is something about Death Proof that just gets me. Is it Kurt Russell? Well no need to say Stuntman Mike was one of the best and most original villains of the 2000s. Was it the girls? They sure looked good, especially the ones from the first act. Was it the music? Tarantino sure knows what he's doing when it comes to soundtracks, and that song from Dario Argento's Bird With The Crystal Plumage was hugely appreciated along with the lap dance scene! Now was it the cinematography? Well it sure helped! Hell, even the flaws made this effort a better experience for me, like those never-ending and not- so-interesting conversations all the way. I don't know if any of you exploitation fans and slasher geeks remember, but how many boring scenes have we watched just for that one magical moment of sleaze and dementia? Fortunately, Death Proof has a lot of epic moments and funny bad-ass lines and the somehow boring bits are, at least, well-acted and well- directed. The more I watch it, the more I love. But to everyone his own cup of tea. Personally I prefer coffee, and this one may have been reheated with too much milk and sugar, but hell it woke me up just the same!

469,TerryDaniel,Maybe Death Proof but is it watch proof?,5,20 March 2011,Being a fan of Tarintinos film making such as Kill Bill Vol 1 and Inglorious Basterds this one had slipped through my net.So Death Proof is the first part in a double bill of 'Grindhouse' the second film being Planet Terror directed by Robert Rodriguez. This is some what of a homage to the genre of Grindhouse which were Exploitation films of the 1970's and 80's films such as Last House on the Left and Death Race 2000.What we have here is Kurt Russell(Escape from New York.The Thing) playing a stunt man who likes to kill woman in his death proofed car so that's the plot done with. It relies to much on the endless conversation drivel that you get in Tarintino's films.The film all so has references to far to far many films Which the average Joe Blogs film. The actresses in the film are just annoying but not in a cute girl way they are just annoying.They also fill the need to do a sexy dance for a random 5 minutes of the film which doesn't make sense.The film is full of what I can only describe is surf boy music.109 Minutes this picture ran for.you could of easily binned 30 minutes out of there at nearly 2 hours this film is quite long to fill the time. The final scene which is a car chase and kill was quite entertaining and its just not enough.Although I do like Tarintinos works this one wasn't as great as it wanted to be.On that bombshell can Quentin Tarintino stop doing that thing he does in films it seems his acting please stop.,Death Proof
470,richy-12,Worst Tarantino movie ever with no story,1,8 August 2007,"I expected to see a good slasher movie but I'm really disappointed.The first part of the movie isn't half bad. Stuntman Mike (played by Kurt Russell) kills a young girl in his car. The scene is fairly well done and at that point I expected a lot. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is a major letdown. There's no tension or character development. Mike kills the friends of that first girl (not well done like the first kill scene, just boring). Then, in the second part of the movie, he tries to kill 3 other girls (not related in any way to the previous group), but fails.This is the ""story"" of the movie, it doesn't make any sense, there's hardly any gore or violence, just mediocre looking girls in boring scenes (lots of trash talk too as in most Tarantino movies) and an endless car chase in the second half of the movie.If you like car chases for some reason this movie might be for you. For slasher/violence/gore fans I really cannot recommend this movie.Note I'm a big fan of Tarantino movies, loved Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, but this movie is just utter trash.",Death Proof

A crazy stuntman in a  crazy car just loves killing women he picks up, until he runs into  (behind?) the wrong bunch of women.  Straight story, straightforward ending, and one long car chase which is  well shot. The first half of the movie is just a build-up to the second  half. The stuntman's character is built up in the first half, and Kurt  Russell does a good job of acting spooky. The girls in the second half  are kick-ass, and along with slick camera work and editing, the film  manages to hold your attention till the end.

472,parekhdhrumil-374-333873,Tarantino is the MAN!,9,1 November 2012,"Whether 'Death Proof' is a Nice Film or an Awful one is a More Complex Debate than Rocket Science. Here, I am Attempting to tell What I seriously felt about it. I think 'Death Proof' is what Cinema is all about. It was a Hell of a Roller-coaster Ride for me. From the Word Go, I have been Glued to the Film till the Very END. And Mind you, I am not a Fanboy of Tarantino neither I have Watched his Classics Like 'Kill Bill' and 'Inglourious Basterds' but surely became a Fan of his After Watching 'Death Proof' Yesterday. I am not into ""Writing Reviews"" thing but here I seriously Felt I need to Add my bit because People have Misunderstood the Film to NO END. Well this Film was a Homage or a Tribute to the Exploitation Films of the Yore and for me it is a Success. Every Frame Rocks. It has Managed to mix Several Generes like Slasher Films, Thriller, Chick Flick, Action, Car Chases without the use of Fake CGI. 'Death Proof' is Like a Cinematic Orgasm. The Car Crash in the First Half of the Film is the BEST in Cinematic History. It is the BEST because it has been Shot without CGI or Animation. Though, I watch Films for Storytelling but in this case I forgot about Storytelling and was Drawn into the Film for its Cool and Powerful Content. Tarantino is the MAN, Indeed. The guy is Wikipedia of Films and truly knows How to Get Viewers Attention. I think the People Who Disliked this Film were Expecting a Chick Fast and Furious or an Ultimate David Lynch type of Mystery thriller but it was Neither of Chick Fast and Furious nor a Ultimate Mystery Thriller, It was an ode to the Films of the Yore And these were the type of Films by which Fast and Furious got Inspired by. The other reason People may have Disliked the Film is because of ' Herd Mentality'. The People who Liked the Film are the 'Subjective' lot and they are the People who does not go by the Opinion of others in Deciding What they Like and What they Don't. Coming back to the Film. It was a True Blue Tribute to the Exploitation Films with Missing Reels, Black and White for 15 Minutes and many more Features of an Exploitation Film. Quentin Tarantino Wanted the Audience to Experience the Old Charm of Films. Kurt Russel was in his Elements as Stuntman Mike. Sydney Poitier was Sexy as Jungle Julia. Rest of the Cast did a Nice Job. The Background Score and Music of the Film is like its Lifeline and par with the Soundtrack of 'Reservoir Dogs'. Cinematography was Amazing in the second Half. The Writing and Dialouges were Cool and Hip. Climax was Fcuking Awesome. A 25 Minutes Long and Gripping Climax which Kept me to Edge of My Seat. Do not Miss 'Death Proof' if you Enjoy Good Cinema and for Those who did not Liked it- Go and Watch those Italian Neorealistic Films because that is Cinema for you, For me Cinema is All About Magic and 'Death Proof' is a Type of Film for Which I Crave For.",Death Proof
473,baiolemi,Some Badass Bitches!,8,5 April 2015,"Simply a weird movie. You feel almost as if you were zapped through a time machine that was partially broken. Story (8/10) The story is certainly original. A stuntman using his car to murder women in their cars? Nothing else like it. Acting (8/10) Kurt Russell basically made his role his bitch! Not much else to be said. The girls did a fine job as well, nothing extraordinary but they sold their characters.Sound(10/10): Pretty much any Tarantino movie will have a kickass soundtrack, this one is no different. The music blends perfectly with the visuals, especially the lap dancing scene, it was epic... Dialogue(8/10): I see a lot of people complain about how boring the dialog is. These people are idiots. The dialog overall is funny and realistic, pretty much what you'd expect of what a group of immatureish women talk about. Plus Kurt Russell's role of stuntman mike was written to perfection. He seamlessly appears and talks like a normal down to earth guy, although at the same time he looks and acts as if he were some sort of creepazoid(not sure what that means but that's what he was). Overall Awesomeness (8/10) If you enjoy movies that are packed with moments where you ask yourself ""what the hell just happened?"" then chances are you'll dig this flick. And if you're a fan of Tarantino and you haven't seen this, then your not a fan of Tarantino.-Simple Reviews:D",Death Proof
474,dumpbox-55760,Astonishingly enjoyable!,8,19 July 2015,"The most amazing jaw-dropping car stunts I've ever seen in all my 50+ years of movie watching! All of the 'holding onto the hood' sequence is worth watching this movie for, because it's beyond belief. I kept thinking, ""This isn't real, it can't be real,"" because we're so used to seeing CGI these days that when good old genuine stunts appear and actual real car driving, it totally blows you away. I can't fathom how the hood stunts were done safely, because the sense of absolute peril and imminent death of the stunt woman was ever present... AMAZING!Kurt Russell was as usual a phenomenal actor in this movie - he's so under rated - he really is so good at his craft/art. I'm not at all a fan of Tarantino as I hate the glorification of violence, so I wasn't looking forward to that in this movie; however, it didn't offend my senses at all - the gore/violence was pretty mild, plus it was appropriate and in the end justified as the bad guy got all he deserved, which was very satisfying. I imagine that Tarantino fans would feel let down though by the lack of focused ultraviolence.The only thing that let it down big-time for me was that a huge chunk of the movie was just the girls chatting about zero; this was utterly boring and did nothing to move the plot along, and added nothing to it; it caused the flow to stagnate for a good long while.Also; the girls leave their friend alone with the grunting hick that they 'borrow' the white car from and we never get to know what happened with that - or what happened about the car after they wreck it, or what the consequences are for the three of them after what they do in the end. I know none of this is ultimately important, but these are questions I would have liked tied up a little bit - even just by using stills or text while the credits were rolling rather than the inclusion of pics of random faces.In total though this movie was a blast and I'll be watching it again. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes mild to moderate gore, plus knock out car stunts and real action. It was great to see strong tough women taking it out on their attacker and not simply being exploited victims.",Death Proof

I am so glad I did not went to the theater to see this movie, I am so sure I would have left without seeing it to its entirety. I rented it and for the first half an hour, I had no idea what was going on! I started to change the channel and then I remember that I was watching a DVD. I thought it was horror but I must have been mistaken. It was like a bunch of teenagers sitting down talking about their boyfriends, it almost put me to bed. There were only two parts where there was any action going on. The ending however was very good that is why I rated it a '5' I thought it would have been much better especially since Clinton and Eli were actually in it.

476,kkitt,A knowingly bad film is still a bad film,1,22 January 2008,"When it comes to drawing on an encyclopedic knowledge of cinema to craft an immaculate modern classic, barely a handful of directors can hold a candle to Quentin Tarantino. Some would argue that his output has been on a downward trajectory ever since 'Jackie Brown' turned out not to be 'Pulp Fiction II', yet few other filmmakers have come close to matching the dazzling energy and wit of his first two films, and even the more recent 'Kill Bill' contained enough memorable set pieces to justify the required four-hour sitting.However, where Tarantino's previous films excelled by skilfully weaving affectionate homage and technical innovation, here the scales tip too heavily towards the former; what we end up with is a competent but ultimately inconsequential pastiche, utterly devoid of the sparkling dialogue and engaging characters that have hitherto been the director's hallmarks. The '70s exploitation genre is convincingly recreated (to the extent that the appearance of a mobile phone seems oddly incongruous) but beyond this superficial achievement, 'Death Proof' appears to have no point whatsoever: it's the cinematic equivalent of driving around a ring road in a clapped-out Ford Cortina and picking up some rather dull hitchhikers along the way. As Samuel Johnson might have put it, this film is neither good nor original - and presumably, was never intended to be the 'proper' follow-up to 'Kill Bill'. In fact, one can only guess at what purpose it was supposed to serve; maybe it represents a low-budget attempt by Tarantino to dismantle his own myth, wilfully confounding mainstream expectations and thereby seeking to reaffirm his credentials as an independent maverick. Yet the suspicion remains that he simply made 'Death Proof' for his own entertainment and unfortunately, this kind of self-indulgence has shredded many an artist's reputation in the past. It remains to be seen whether, when Tarantino sees fit to release his next masterpiece, today's increasingly fickle audience don't choose to spend four hours doing something else.",Death Proof

(it seems they had lots) Whatever, cinematographically well drawn, and jumps you up to the space of dirty-cheap mouth,one-sided hot characters making party in honkytonkylike bars with jukebox, or running cars on dusty crossroads... of course brutal terror being showed off in doses.

Other than that, Death Proof has no compelling reason to spend two hours watching, especially when an hour and forty minutes of that is nothing but babble between several obnoxious women. This is one of those films that really relies on a multi-million dollar budget to make it a great film, well, even with all that money behind it, it still fails miserably to consider this even a mediocre movie, let alone a great movie. It is amazing to me how this movie has a user rating over 7, my best guess is that they all have to be Tarantino fans who think anything he puts out is great, which is rubbish because this movie was not good. The ending sequence was absolutely ridiculous and made no sense at all, there is no way three bimbos would overpower and get the better of Stunt Man Mike. That was just too stupid to believe and to take seriously. I would much rather spend time watching a B movie that relies on talent and creativity alone, and not millions and millions of dollars like Death Proof, and the funny thing is is that this movie is still really bad.

Yet, where Planet Terror used humour to get through the horrific parts, Tarantinos film just appears to be the musing of a disturbed mind. Well done to Zoe Bell, she was without doubt the star of the movie, but even her great stunt work and plausible acting could not lift what is a dire film. The car chase was nothing spectacular and we have all seen much better before and will surely see again. The film failed to work on two fronts, the characters where to shallow for a thriller and there was not enough action to keep petrol heads happy. So who was this film aimed at? Clearly not me.

494,Watkinnk,Pretty Cool,7,6 November 2012,Let me start off by saying when i originally saw this movie i hated it. As some people have said this movie has a lot of talking. For some reason when i first saw this i had a hard time understanding what the people were talking about. maybe the volume was too low! If you don't listen to the conversations in the film you won't understand what's happening. And if you don't like what the people are talking about or can't develop any type of interest or concern for the characters you won't like this movie.That being said after watching it again i enjoyed the overall feel of the movie from its imagery to the music in it. The main idea in the film was unique or at least new to me as i have never seen anything like it. I actually enjoyed the banter and there is a lot of it. This is unusual because i generally prefer action to talking. There is some action though. They might be few and far between but the climax of the film is quite satisfying.,Death Proof

496,DarkoPaligoric,Fun throwback to the 70s exploitation,6,15 May 2014,"The thing about Tarantino is that it has become a trend that he makes movies for the sole purpose of them being 'cool'. I'm not really complaining since I love the living sh*t out of every single one of them, but it also kind of bugs me that someone with huge talent would just kind of repeat him self. Not in the real sense, he is always working in a different genera or sub-genera of movies (it's more sub- genera's he's interested in), but it always comes down to him just inserting Roger Corman-isms in his movies (in a sense of him exploiting everything, out of this world movie violence... you can tell when it's him by those things). I have no problem with that, I love each and every one of his flicks (yes, even Four Rooms... I LOVE IT), Pulp Fiction, Reservoir dogs and Kill Bill i would say are some of my favorite movies in like EVER! But this kind of film-making kind of makes it immune to criticism. And that's most apparent here. I mean, every problem that one can possibly have with this movie is intentional because it's an homage to 70s B-movies that Rodriguez and Tarantino grew up on and love. No problem with that, Spielberg and Lucas made their careers out of combining shi**y television they grew up on in the 50s and film classics they got introduced to later on, and it worked. One thing that should be noted is that this movie was a part of a double feature, and Death proof is Tarantino's cut of that segment. So I don't really know about everyone else but it was in my opinion way too long (one thing that i liked about directors cut is that lap dance which was cut out of Grindhouse... don't judge me, it's exploitation, that's what it's for). As far as the story and structure go, i would say that if Psycho and Escape from New York had a baby, it would be Death Proof. And i don't like Psycho all that much. First half of the movie got me really invested, but then right at the middle we get 'Psycho-like' explanation of exposition and what just happen, we get a character explaining how we should interpret it and 'explains' how Stuntman Mike's mind works... And after that story just repeats in self. Then the movie lost me. I love how in movies like Phantom of Liberty you change your perspectives and main characters (only thing i liked in Psycho) but here it just didn't work for me. But bunch of people loved it, so it's really subjective. just because something is an homage or intentional doesn't make it immune to criticism and doesn't mean it's great out of the bat. But, like I said, I don't hate a single one of his movies... And this one i no exception, even though I wasn't that much invested into the second half, You still have some great characters and some great Tarantino dialog's. And bunch of chicks kicking some major ass. I can't help but think that if it was more cheesy (like Planet Terror was, that movie threw all the logic out of the window and it worked... it was funny as hell and i enjoyed it) i would have love it more, it is what it is. If only Tarantino was to move on from this trend of making movies, PTA started out similarly but he moved on to direct some great stuff. Jackie Brown was a really serious film with great characters (characters in that one are probably the best he had filmed because fist half of the movies is just you hanging out with them, getting to know them...) and Inglorious Basterds opening chapter was a great suspense ride (wish the rest of the movie was like that, but it went strait to exploitation again, until it got to be this really interesting 'love story' for a few minutes and then went to something that was clash of all of those... would love to see all of those movies separately but Inglorious Basterds will do).",Death Proof

Nope, apparently there was some other girls that he had to kill. Which he goes to do, and this is where the film goes downhill. WAY downhill. As I was watching, it was like the script was rushed or something -- goes the dialog/characters were just terrible. All they could do is say ""fuck"" and mention sex. Even guys don't talk that horrible! Then, what the hell happened to Stuntman Mike? He was so BAD ASS. But then he became this whining pussy, who kept screaming ""stop it!"" in the most girlish voice I have ever heard come out of a man's voice. Now, I like seeing Kurt Russel like this, but you cannot just change a character completely like that.So, was I suppose to feel revenge for those three girls?

499,Dr_Sibilance,"Most triumphant ! No spoilers here, just a good review.",8,7 March 2008,"This is a good film. Many people slam this film for the following reasons :it's egotistical too much talking and not enough action the second half feels repetitive in relation to the first the scratches, jump cuts and editing 'errors' that are laid through much of the first half inconsistence in the setting, time-frame and scenario, and general 'goofs' as IMDb refers to them.What many don't understand, is that these are intentional. This film is a celebration of Grindhouse cinema and only those who aren't familiar with Grindhouse won't get this film.This harks back to those old horror films where directors would use repetitive dialogue because they couldn't think of anything else or they liked their work so much that they'd rehash it. They'd go as far as appearing in their own films because they loved themselves and they'd shamelessly reference their own work. Some of these old horror films would even rehash footage and scenes from other films that the director had done before. There would be what seemed like obvious errors in the films or inconsistenceWhilst we have all this homage to Grindhouse cinema, we also have Tarantino's film making talent at work. I'm not a particularly huge fan of Tarantino's previous work. I thought Reservoir Dogs was good, and perhaps Kill Bill Volume 2, but I thought many of his films lacked the story or content that I hoped for.I loved this film. I think much of it is very carefully considered. Despite it supposed to be a homage to Grindhouse, you see inspiration from old Westerns from the likes of Sergio Leone, especially in the way that we have a long build up to the the death and gore which makes it much more hard hitting than if we just had a typical violence and killing at regular intervals.What is particular kudos to Tarantino, is that if this film had been released in the time that he's homaging, it would have been a huge cult classic.The only downsides to this film are some points in the second half, the dialogue goes on a little too long, and you can't help but feel that the better female actresses were in the first half.This film gets better with repeated viewing, which I think is a sign of a good movie. When viewing you get a sense that they had a huge amount of fun working on this film. The soundtrack is really incredible, works very well with the film and is certainly right up there with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Finally, I also have to say that Kurt Russell REALLY delivers in this film and it wouldn't have worked as well without him.",Death Proof

The movies have all the lines on the screen and the dropouts and all of the visual effects- kudos to that as it's a nice anesthetic. As far as the actual film goes itself it isn't that it's not a good idea- it would have been an amazing one hour film- it's just that the idea felt to thin being stretched over two hours.I felt nauseous after watching girls chit chat about hooking up with different guys for 30 minutes at a time. The conversations aren't very funny and in no way advance the story. They do, however let you get to know these lame ass girls that are as interesting as cardboard boxes- not at all.The film isn't completely evil and bad- just average and slow- not what I would expect from a master of cinema. I was let down as a fan. People will more than likely flame this or ignore this review but it's what I feel. If anyone actually enjoyed this movie than good for them, if they claim to like it because Tarantino made it- you should die.Too average- drags on- not interesting- just boring.-fetus orgy--http://fetusorgy.blogspot.com",Death Proof
502,pradey,"A solid, original film",8,27 January 2008,"I'm surprised and slightly amused by the amount of anger this film seems to have instilled in some of these reviewers, as if they feel let down or cheated by Tarantino.The one good thing about him is that he makes the movies he wants, like all true artists he creates for himself, not for others. That's why I generally find his films self indulgent and irritating.But I thought Death Proof was one of his better efforts. Sure the female dialog is infuriatingly banal, but he is setting these unlikeable characters up for a rather gruesome fall so that when it comes you feel slightly elated, happy to watch the gore without sympathy for the individuals you have got to know.There are some great original features; the car as a fearsome murder weapon, the female cast that were ""interesting"" looking rather than obviously sexy, a Kiwi actress as one of the leads without trying to tone down her non-US accent, Stuntman Mike's whimpering at the end and the abruptness of his demise, the obvious seventies era feel to the movie yet cell phones and smoking outside are incorporated.I would rather watch this than sit through the Kill Bills any time.My definition of a successful film is when it leaves a impression on the audience and clearly this film succeed here, this is proved by the amount of reviewers on here who gave the film a 1 out of 10 rating then proceeded to write an in depth essay on it.",Death Proof

Personally, I really enjoyed watching it. Maybe there could have been a little bit more progress or action, but if you look at the scene's, the time they took for it, the editing, and above all acting! It is just wonderful.You should really not watch this movie if you expect torture, crime and blood. Just think about the way Tarrantino did when he made it, en you will get it is a really nice piece of work. A movie in which hardly nothing big happens, is very difficult to direct. But the most difficult thing is to make people like it. And that is just what Tarrantino did in this very good title.,,You can break the rules of film-making, but only if you know why and which rule you broke...'' (Roemer B. Lievaart)",Death Proof
504,madiganman,"blah, blah..blah... freaking BLAH!",1,3 October 2007,"Am I the only one that thinks Quentin Tarantino's 'Death Proof' is a piece of junk?The first hour of the movie consists of four women chatting away in a bar about the party tonight and how the boyfriend of one of them who's a radio personality is like TOTALLY spaced on her birthday and blah, blah.. blah... freaking BLAH! Then they get killed by a mysterious guy called Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell). That's when the action begins.....and lasts for like 5 whole minutes! Then cut to few months later where another group of women chatting of the type that makes most men's eyes roll up into their skulls. Sorry, ladies but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. I know that when my wife has a bunch of her friends over I have to either leave the house or retreat into my den, otherwise it's like having bamboo shoved under my fingernails.Now eventually... eventually as in 45 long..... torturous..... b-o-r-i-n-g minutes later, Kurt Russell finally shows up again to wreak havoc on this set of women. Unfortunately by this time I was so mad at having had to sit through so much mind numbing dialog that I couldn't even enjoy the car chase and what followed. No payoff could have been big enough for having been subjected to about a full hour of excruciating boredom except for maybe, the credits to roll. I don't know what the heck happened to Tarantino, but if felt like he was channeling Oprah or ""The View"" through some sort of trailer park filter. It was, in a word: bizarre. Another 5 minutes of car chase action. Then the movie ends.This movie is supposed to be a spoof on the 70's B-grade camp movies.

Kurt Russell had a great performance and i could see he was enjoying it and the girls were all hot, especially Mary E Winstead of Final Destination Fame, sadly again she didn't appear in the film that much and what happened to her we are left wondering about. i just got to wait for planet terror now. peace",Death Proof

507,ajfuller,Death Proof - 40 Million Dollas Spent To Make You Snore,3,3 October 2007,"Okay, okay, I get it. This was supposed to be an updated version of those so-bad-they're-good movies from the 70's. You know, the ones that cost 20,000 dollars to make, and are a guilty pleasure that draw you in every time you see them pop up on the USA Network. The problem here, is that with the level of time and money involved, this should have been a great movie.It isn't.Quentin Tarantino is great at writing dialog for men, but he really stinks at writing dialog for women. Another flaw is that while the exploitation films this one is supposed to be referencing to, suffered from a lot of problems, they were rarely boring. This movie will put you to sleep before the first intentionally scratched reel is finished rolling. The women, who make up 95% of the film, are truly empty, shallow characters. They look great, but you don't care about anything they have to say. The dialog, which mimics basically every male character has ever written, goes on, and on, and isn't realistic to any conversation I have ever heard in my lifetime of engaging in female conversations.There is no point to the dialog. It doesn't add anything to the story, other than making the run time insufferably long. The pointless conversations go on for so long, the viewer secretly starts hoping that Jason or Freddy would get their rear end in gear, and finish these dull characters off, already. Fans of QT say he is building up suspense. That is nonsense, the only thing he is building are calluses on the rear ends of people who are sitting in their seats waiting for something to happen. Don't get me wrong, I can see where the money went. The acting is good. Kurt Russell is GREAT. The car crash scene is amazing and the chase scene at the end is incredible, but what you have to sit through to get to those scenes is long, boring, and pointless. Tarantino's personal indulgences run amok in this film. The story would have been a great one hour, Masters of Horror episode. Stretching it into a 90 minute or 2 hour version (which is the one that I saw) made it an insufferable experience, made even more intolerable by the pat-myself-on-the-back attitude displayed by Tarantino in everything from his smarmy cameo, to the overuse of references from his earlier films... Where are the scenes of Stuntman Mike's other kills? A montage of those would have been great. Why didn't we get more back story on him? He is, by far the most interesting character. Why didn't we see him making his death-proof cars? What happened between his time in Texas and Tennessee? Are other stunt men helping him? Is this a side-line for several frustrated guys?The guys I see at car shows usually do look like they really, really need to find a woman... An Evil Dead 2 tool-shed type montage of him making the modifications to the Chevy Nova, and getting excited about what he was going to do, would have been really fun to watch, but instead we get to see 6 vapid women eating, and cursing, for an hour.All of these things lead me to say that the main problem I have with this film, is that all of the screen time goes to the irritating characters that we don't care about, and completely ignores the one character (Stuntman Mike) that would have drawn us in.",Death Proof

This movie is Long indeed, and the characters are so 1 dimensional. They expend the first 50 minutes talking talking, and no action what so ever. And when the action starts it last 40 seconds and cut. The actors are so lame and the dialog is suppose to be deep and entertaining. IT'S NOT!

510,T-bird-7,Tarantino on a smaller scale,6,7 June 2007,"Not a bad movie, but nothing special as well. I don't know much about the original project, but this section was really not very inspiring. Sure, the car chase was great and the girls' killing sequence was impressing - but the rest of the movie goes on and on with endless dialogue that looks and sounds like a pale copy of what QT made in the past. Here we don't have the spirited and out-of-contest talk of Pulp Fiction or even Reservoir Dogs - just very boring and inconsistent dialogue between characters that fail to grab attention or sympathy (at least mine). Kurt Russel is, of course, on a different level but again it's too little, in a film dominated by sassy dialogue of no interest. If it was a whole 45 minutes shorter, it could have been a little gem, even though the female characters were so and so. But for its real length, it's more of a wasted opportunity. Even the cuts/grainy film/under-overexposure/sound mistakes/B&W are nothing new. It's all said and done, and better saved for video clips or commercials. Nice, but nothing more... ...and there's a goof: A Challenger has frame-less door windows!",Death Proof

Pretty girls messing about having fun talking girly-girl talk and then it gets dangerous... And in the end there is of cause the, by now, classic Tarantino twist.. But that is not at all what this movie is about. This movie is about one thing only. Showing all the crappy Hollywood directors out there how it's done. Tarantino artfully keeps the plot to a minimum and shows us how skillful directing is all it takes to make a movie interesting.This movie should be enjoyed like a good bottle of wine.

He replicates scenes from his first 2 films (in the car at the start and in the café), only they feature women! Wow, it must be new then... Oh, and the style of dialogue is also identical to those previous films. The story becomes quite interesting as it moves on with Stuntman Mike and the girls in the bar but as soon as the first part of the film is complete, the story just disappears. You always know what's going to happen as the theme is the same in the second part but with a complete lack of a plot. Some parts are just so corny, it makes you groan. The only reason Zoe Bell is in the film is because she can do stunts well but her main scene goes on far too long. There is also a tiny little error when Mike gets his neck and skull broken several times but comes out of it without so much as a scratch. It continues to get worse and worse to the end and even though it's 2 hours long, it seems like it's much longer. Absolutely terrible.",Death Proof

Maybe he needs to concentrate on direction and let someone else write it, or spend More time on the writing and let someone else direct it!. Not to mention the was of talent in the movie!

514,moro_650,Not a great movie but still entertaining and different..,6,27 September 2009,"One of the best characteristics about a Quentin Tarantino movie is that it guarantees you an entertaining and unique experience, even though it might not be a terrific piece of work as in this case. the story is about stuntman mike the psychopath who chases girls and kills them using his death proof car, through the lives of two separate groups of girls, while each member of each group has her own troubles and dreams, the real action in the story doesn't appear before the second half of the film.Tarantino's style in the dialogues was obvious, he tried to create a spontaneous dialogue like in his previous works (jackie brown, pulp fiction&reservoir dogs)but this time Tarantino couldn't hold his grip over the dialogue and drifted a little bit through long pointless chitchat that might not appeal to all people through the movie, but the dialogue wasn't totally boring it had its ups and downs. the most special thing about this film is the sudden change that happens in the second half, the rhythm of the movie increases highly and makes it very exciting, while in the last scene i couldn't help myself laughing!. all the actors did well, specially the female characters they were brilliant ( Zoe, Tracie, Sydney, Vanessa and Rosario..), good performance by Kurt Russel as stuntman Mike, light presence by Tarantino that shows a good actor in this guy.As usual the movie still has references from other movies by Quentin Tarantino ( big kahuna burger throws its shadow again in the movie for example)In the end the movie is not too great as people praise and it doesn't suck that much as other people who doesn't like it said, its an entertaining movie with unexpected twists as we are used to from Quentin Tarantino, at the same time the story lacks much magic and attraction differently from his previous works.",Death Proof
515,allyrd,50%trash 50% genius,8,22 January 2008,"Hmm, for all thats really bad about Deathproof there's just as much brilliance. ill be honest after 14 mins i was about to switch it off but then Kurt does one evil laugh and i was hooked for another 20 mins. Kurt's 2sec laugh made up for the first 14 mins of trash. i mean if i wanted to listen to ladies gas then i would go for a drive with my girlfriend and her friends but anyway...Personally i think the script was just a bit much for the cast to perform and was not really convinced these gals were really old friends. QT gave them lots of dialogue and IMO they struggled with it, (first and second lot of girls)..... then there's some creepy stuff and then one of the scariest scenes iv ever seen in a movie. wont spoil it but you do not want a lift home with this guy! Kurt is one scary dude with a sick humour. the second half tapered off for me (the script improved a bit) but was fairly exciting stuff all the same. I'm going to watch this again when i have the time cause i did think ""that was so bad but at the same time its complete genius"". its pulp fiction on film and i don't mean qt's other film but that its a trashy film.

516,MConley7,"A layered and complex film, if seen properly",10,28 October 2007,"I just figured I'd give a shot at this whole message board thing; to start off with, I guess I should say that I liked Death Proof. Rather than just say my opinion is according to my taste and that, if you did not like it (or hated it, as some have made perfectly clear), you did not like it because it did not fit your tastes. Maybe you don't like it but others did; so let's make no more argument of it. That sort of thing.Yet such an argument lacks in any form of persuasion because it claims that the beauty is in the eye of the beholder (or the greatness of films is according to the viewer's taste); such is the same as saying one's perception is the only truth (perception is reality). These remind me of the liar who says he ""always lies""; the statement must itself be a lie, much as the statements above are championed subjectivity yet are also subjective themselves; that is, these are subjective comments disguised as universal truths. So the real task remains for arguing why I believe this movie is great and worth watching.What I like about this film is that it portrays a repetition of a series of events--conversations, interactions, and tragedies--yet changes the level of maturity and intelligence of the protagonist characters in the second repetition. The story works by parallels. Repetition is interesting in literature because it provides the viewer a second look at a situation, and then also a deeper penetration into the meaning of the work, while also revealing how small differences can change the overall fate and outcome of the characters involved. In this case, the theme is a group of females; in the first story, girls, and in the second, women.Each character embodies a certain archetype that becomes matured within the second story. Each of the black girls are leaders, assertive and tough, though the younger has more bark than bite, for instance. These girls are paralleled within the film, along with all the conversations and incidents they encounter along the way. Each conversation--which some on this board have called ""meaningless"" and ""random""--reveals the difference between true women and mere girls. However, treated, singly, in and of themselves, these conversations would be worthless, boring and stripped of any meaning. However, the parallels allow the viewer the opportunity to penetrate into the theme of feminity, and how the theme is addressed by the director and the film.With the change in targets, from girls to women, stuntman mike has the situation reversed on him, and he becomes the target after his attack on the challenger. Even the idea of the battling cars as a type of rape (an idea opened by the sheriff after the girls are killed) is reversed when the stuntman mike gets shot...it is then that his status as an almost supernatural being--brought about by the connotations of his ""death proof"" car--is broken.Some of the rest of the film I believe is self-explanatory in my mind, in the sense of aesthetic brilliance and depth. The car chase is fantastic, and the idea of Kurt Russell (dressed much like Snake Plisken from his Escape from... series) crying like a baby when shot, barely able to chug some Maker's Mark without gagging, was hilarious to me. With him I've always attached this idea of this irreducible badass, and to see Tarantino shatter that facade is both interesting as another wrinkle in the theme, and also hilarious.What I've found with the film's dialogue is that it is better to interpret it like one interprets Hemingway; no cues are given by the director of what the dialogue means, but it is placed there, seemingly barren of meaning until someone reads between the lines (and then it has an appearance like an iceberg--10 percent above and 90 percent below--Hemingway's own allusion about his style). For anyone who has taken a class on Hemingway or reads him for pleasure, I am using a story like ""Hills like White Elephants"" as an example of how to look at Tarantino's, though the style of Tarantino's differs in that the meaning is mainly conveyed through diverging parallels. If one compares one conversation to its altered twin in the other story, differences emerge and a binding theme emerges along with interpretations of the differences.So that's my argument...I will not pretend I've convinced anybody of this film's greatness, but at least I have given some reasons why I believe this movie to be great without resorting to arrogance or attacks. Disagree if you will, especially if my argument has not won you over.",Death Proof
517,just-msn,Tarantino never made it out of the 80s.,4,9 November 2007,"""Death Proof"". It sounds good. The title is short and kind of made it sound like one of those old fashion action movies you used to watch back in the 'old days'. I wasn't alive in the old days, but i did see a bunch of movies from it, and they were pretty good. Quentin Tarantino directs.So, i was going through a little movie marathon anyway and decided to see Death Proof. Here's what i thought:I walk in the cinema sit down, get through 10 minutes of ads and we're off. Instantly I am hit with an old fashion title, which would have been great, were the picture not also old fashion. Then as the movies name comes up there is a horrible bad edit right there. I won't tell you what it is, you'll have to see this one for yourself.Then the movie started, the picture didn't get any better. What is it with the grainy film? Why is Tarantino uses out-of-date cameras? It didn't add anything to the movie, just took things away.More bad editing, as the girls were riding in the car instead of it disappearing 'down the track', it disappears ON THE TRACK. It just vanishes, the second car to come pass (Stuntman mikes) DOESN'T, however, disappear on the track, it actually travels down like the first one was supposed to. Don't even get me started about his horrible editing near the later parts of the film.So anyway, the film moves on with bad camera quality, bad editing and boring conversations that seem to last forever when BOOM, finally a good part. A car chase. It was so well done that i can't give anything away, you'll have to see it for yourself. :)However by this time I had already got the feeling that the cinema i was in didn't have enough movies playing and decided to run an oldie as replacement. I also questioned whether Tarantino was alive. I genuinely thought he had died at 80-something back in the 90s. The movie quality in general was just that bad and even a cool car chase couldn't save it.A new group of girls though and the film finally picked up. (minus the first 20 minutes due to it being in black and white - I had originally thought it was black and white for dramatic effect and that it would last about 3-5minutes, when it got to 10 I became seriously worried). Some more talk goes here, and we finally get to the good part. Another car chase, this one has an unexpected twist and it made me so happy that suddenly I liked the entire movie. I don't know how Tarantino did that, but it made me happy I had stayed for the entire thing instead of walking out half way through.I won't give away the ending, but you'll be very surprised and (hopefully like I was) very satisfied. I cannot give the ending higher praises.So, if you're old enough that old-looking movies don't bother you, or feel you can sit through all the bad parts of the film (nine tenths of the film) then you should definitely watch this, because the ending will make all that long, long, (very long) wait seem like it was all worth it.I can't stress enough how boring the most of the film is though, i put myself in sleeping position several times threw the film.Other then that, the feel-good ending will make it all worth while and is why i gave the movie 4 out of 10, instead of 0. :)",Death Proof

Tarantino is quickly becoming the Ed Wood of this generation. In fact Ed Wood was a genius compared with Tarantino's lack of focus and disjointed scenes. At least 95 percent of this movie moves at a snails pace with the characters sitting around and talking through the vast majority of this film. And lets not forget his trademark 5,000 uses of the F bomb.If his attempt was to recreate the look and the feel of the drive in movies of the 60's then he really missed the mark.

519,nils-wright,Worst Tarantino move EVER,3,15 November 2007,"This move had no redeeming qualities at all, unlike its partner flick, Planet Terror, which was phenomenal pulp horror fiction at its best. This movie droned on with really inane dialog that was fit for men not women. Tarantino showed his weakness in writing in this picture because he has no idea of what a woman would say and it was the same banter that I heard in Reservoir Dogs, except in Death Proof IT NEVER ENDED. At least on Dogs he had the good sense to have some believable but inane dialog mixed in with good action and a good plot. This movie had neither and if it is an homage to the Grindhouse flicks of the 70s it is a poor one at that.And like the previous writer, I too am sick of seeing Tarantino inject a cameo of himself in every movie he makes. In fact when he does this, his poor acting and delivery always seem to take something away from the film, leaving it worse than it should be.

Deathproof has a great switch when the hunter become the hunted. But this is also a parallel too Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! when the girls come too a farm, and the farmers are killers too.

These types of films I thought would suit them down to the ground. I watched planet terror and loved it so i had high hopes. boy was I disappointed. Death proof lacks in a lot of places, nothing happens for the first 45 minutes, then you get about 5-10 minutes of some very cool stuff then another 45 minutes or so of dullness until the 20 minutes or so at the end which again are pretty cool. Normally QT doesn't need a lot going on in his movies to make them interesting, his scripts are enough to keep everything moving along nicely. Not so here I'm afraid, the script is dull. We spend so long with the girls before Mike arrives yet we find nothing out about them apart from they're not as slutty as they look and they drink and smoke pot. It's just really uninteresting. I know grind house movies aren't' known for their character development but why spend 45 minutes with them when we could spend 10 minutes with them and find out all you need to know. I can't really say much more(nothing much more happens) but I think I'm glad they ended up splitting the 2 up because I think this would of soured my enjoyment of Planet terror.

It's fun to see how much homage Tarantino puts in his movies-even to himself. This film, however, has some of his weakest dialogue and characterizations. Whether this is intentional or not, it hurts the pace of the movie, and you'll find yourself frequently impatient for surprises that never come. Considering that he has an almost all female cast, it's sad to see them used in such a shallow way. He should be transcending the genre(as he did with Kill Bill) instead of pandering to it.",Death Proof
526,serialspice,Down to basics,10,17 February 2008,"In my opinion Tarantino is a genius, but after seeing the comments on IMDb I honestly did not think much of this movie. So I sat down to watch it with no expectations. To my surprise I loved every minute of it, culminating with one of the best endings in cinema I can remember. Brilliantly played by Kurt Russel.The women dominates this movie with hardly no men, played by brilliant and interesting actors that glues you to the screen. It is full of classic Tarantino shots like the motor hood shot, the long-hallway-conversation-no-cut shot and so forth. The dialogs are long and uncut, boring but yet strangely captivating bringing you down to basics of movie-making and acting. And of curse the ultra-cool music.As a female one of my weaknesses in cinema is my love for strong female hero movies and I get my money worth here, and more.Masterfull!",Death Proof
527,theflynnt74,Major Disappointment!!!!!!!!!!,5,4 September 2007,"CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah! The acting is good, the girls are good, the stunts are good, Kurt Russell is great. BUT!! I'm still wondering where all the action is that people have been talking about. The one scene where stuntman mike crashes headlong into the girls car is fantasised (watch in slow mo as one girls face gets wiped off by a wheel) but that is about it.It takes too long before we see anything that is expected from a film like this. I know this is a homage to grind-house flicks from the seventies so why has Tarantino bothered to character develop prior to the kill. Who's bothered if the girls are nice girls or what they are gonna be up to at the weekend. When i hear that a film is gonna play like the mindless films of the seventies whereby people will be killed by a guy in a car then I want exactly that.Stuntman Mike goes from psycho to Captain Ron in no time at all which weakens the first two acts (for me anyway).I am a huge Tarantino fan, and I do offer praise for his choice to do this sort of movie, but I feel he has missed the mark here. After KILL BILL this is a huge let down.Im gonna watch DEATHRACE 2000 now!!!!!!!!",Death Proof
528,nb-12,Text Book Tarantino!!!!!,10,8 October 2008,"I absolutely loved this movie. Tarantino has again proved that he is one of the best directors in the world. I personally cannot understand the amount of criticism this film has taken on this site. I think that most viewers have totally missed the point of this movie. This movie oozes class in every aspect, albeit done rather tongue-in-cheek! If you were expecting an explosive all-out action flick then you'd be better off watching Planet Terror. If however you love any Tarantino movie and enjoy great acting, witty dialogue and edge of your seat thrills, you cannot go far wrong with this movie.Kurt Russel's performance as the rather mentally-unhinged Stuntman Mike was flawless.I'll be the first to admit that I love gory movies, so when the car crashes occur halfway through the movie, I was in dreamland! Tarantino, for me, filmed those scenes perfectly. The way that he filmed the second crash so that you got to see how each of the four females met their maker, was perfection.Nothing needs to be said about the final car chase. Awesome. That has to go down as one of the greats.Again Tarantino has created another fantastic movie of gargantuan proportions.10/10",Death Proof
529,Vodskiwhika,Pure art.,10,22 September 2021,"Before watching this, one should check why and how Tarantino made this and how a lot of the production has explicitly and purposefully been made to accurately represent 60ies and 70ies grindhouse B-movies.Anyone watching this expecting some serious storytelling or whatnot is definetily not going to enjoy or understand this.It's about creating an enjoyable version of old groundhouse dirt.

It's like someone stole 2 hours of my life, and laughed at my face in the end. It is so bad, I can't even make a structured critic of it. The first hour of the movie consists of shallow and ridiculous dialogue between four girls that is awfully painful to watch. Then some shot lived action, then more endless pain in the form of a movie until the end. Normally, when someone warns me about a movie, I still want to watch it so I can have my own informed opinion. In this case, I wish I could go back in time and just take the word from all the bad reviews made so far. Like one reviewer here said, avoid it at all costs. And please don't tell me I didn't get the movie. Just because a movie is non-sense, boring and pointless doesn't mean it is a work of art. Some times it just means that it's....garbage.

531,valek12,"""Insert pithy one-liner here""",4,4 November 2007,"I was not a fan of the idea of splitting up the Grindhouse films. I wanted to see them together with the trailers and judge it as the experience and experiment that it truly was.Unfortunately I live in Australia and so far we've only gotten the extended cut of Death Proof. I must say, I own the classic Tarantino films Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. And From Dusk Till Dawn is single handedly one of my favorite films. I loved Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 and I'm still waiting for a complete cut of that film to be released, eventually.So I like Tarantino, I think his dialog is fantastic and when delivered by someone like Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen or Harvey Keitel it is poetry. The long takes that require actors to be actors and live in the roles have created stars or renewed the careers of Travolta, Jackson, Clooney and hell even David Carradine. Not to mention the numerous lines from the films that everyone can spout at anytime and still have relevance; ""Yeah but bacon tastes good"", ""I'm sorry did I break your concentration"", ""They were vampires, psychos do not explode when sunlight hits them, i don't give a f**k how crazy they are"" etc.So what's wrong with Death Proof? in short: everything. This film was supposed to be an homage to the dirty exploitation flicks of the 70s. It was supposed to celebrate the cheesy nature of those films and have Tarantino characters inhabit that world. The only REAL Tarantino character in that entire film was Stuntman Mike (Nice Guy Eddie anyone?). He was stood out against the BORING two dimensional characters. His dialog was the only time words were spoken where you could tell that this was a Tarantino film.I understand that the films of the ""Grindhouse"" were cheap and nasty. But couldn't Tarantino have done for Grindhouse films what he did for Martial Arts films? Kill Bill was brilliant and was an homage to martial arts films. However Kill Bill was not so rigid that the very nature of martial arts films limited it from also being a love story, a western and a plain old revenge film in the second half.Any Tarantino trademark that could've been stamped on this was far from sight when it was made. He let himself be restricted by the format rather than take it and mold it into something new and different.I was very disappointed by this film. I don't whether the extra 20 or so minutes slowed it down or what it was but the film seemed to drag on forever with the first half of the film inhabited with unlikeable and boring characters. The honorable mention goes to Eli Roth for a funny as hell cameo.The second half of the film was MUCH better. I had feared that the second half might have been a retread and that would've made me sick to my stomach. But aside from the typical cheerleader character the other women were well developed characters, with interesting things to say. And by the end I was really on the edge of my seat hoping that Zoe wouldn't fall off of the hood. When she jumped up with ""I'm alright"" i laughed, one of the only times mind you.The car chases were great, the smash in the first half was pretty horrific. But sadly thats kind of what Death Proof was: A car crash that you couldn't take your eyes off.",Death Proof
532,robertnake,Only Tarantino Can Pull This Off.,9,20 April 2017,"Art is the expression of imagination, usually in visual form, and that is exactly what this film gives. A plot based off of sheer imagination and uniqueness. People try to be so analytical when talking about A- list directors rather than try to remember just how to be entertained while watching a film. Death proof is a refreshing piece of entertainment, which is edited creatively by Sally Menke, and the characters are beautifully idiosyncratic also. In particular, Kurt Russell gives one of the most superb performance. There is 3-second scene in the film, where Russell breaks the fourth wall, and it was just genius.

Carrie explaining the importance of shoes for an entire episode of Sex In The City would be more interesting.The next half of the movie was, you guessed it, women babbling about nothing for almost an hour only to have a 20 minute car chase, the end.

535,satan-bhattacharyya,Too low For Tarantino,4,4 February 2008,"Too low. Way too low. What a nonsensical waste of time? I have newly founded hate for Tracie Thoms.Tarantino's films have a knack for becoming cult classics and in comparison to his earlier work, Death Proof is way below average. Death Proof suffers from the Tarantino tag it bears and the high expectations it bears with that tag. I believe that if any one else had made this film, its reception would have been better. This is probably Quentin Tarantino's worst film to date and I really hope he doesn't do worse than this.In Death Proof, QT has tried to replace the ""Bad Mofo's"" like Jules and Vincent with the badly constructed feminine characters Abernathy (Rosario Dawson), Kim (Tracie Thoms) and Zoe (Zoe Bell). The problem is QT did not replace the dialogues. And needless to say this is the downfall of the film. Kim, who is a black woman says the words ""nigger"", ""bitch"" and ""fuck"" about 20 times in each sentence. Now I'm not pointing fingers to any racist sentiments in the mind of QT as has been done by critics before. Neither am I objecting to the foul language. What I am saying is that the ""bitch"", ""nigga"" and ""fuck"" don't come out half as well as they did from the lips of Samuel L. Jackson. Dialogue just does'nt transcend gender.It just doesn't. I don't want to sound chauvinistic but the girls are the problem. What the girls are saying is quite interesting, its just how they're saying it thats a bit pissing off. Whenever Kim or Zoe started to talk I pretty much put the TV on mute and read the subtitles. The other girls were'nt as bad but Kim and Zoe pretty much spoilt it for them. The character of Lee (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) was a waste and could easily have been exempted. It goes without saying that I enjoyed the first set of girls much more than this. Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito) and Jungle Julia(Sydney Poitier). Though even Jungle Julia had her foulmouthed moments.Bluntly put, they were hotter and the lap dance did help. But jokes aside, I feel the film would have been much better without the two different sets of girls. If QT had just eliminated Abernathy and Co. and decided not to kill off Arlene and Co., this film would have been much better. But I would also like to add that if you replaced the girls with the hard men of Hollywood, this film would not improve too much.The chase sequence isn't that bad I have to say. That is if you cease all thinking and reasoning. With Zoe strapped to the front, they go racing at a gazillion miles per hour. They find time to stop, to beat up Kurt Russell but don't find time to unbuckle the helpless Kiwi. QT, again, could have done better.Kurt Russell obviously is the best part about this film. His character(Stuntman Mike) is extremely well rounded and while his serial-killer persona didn't keep me awake, his crying like a pussy certainly made me laugh. The only thing about his character is that he was underused by QT, his appearance is way too brief. Though when he does come in bits and parts, it is too rescue us from the monotonous dialogue of the inane twittering of the girls. And because he is so briefly cast in the film, KR is not reason enough to see this film.In the end, I have to say with some sadness that my favourite director let me down this time. Its sad to say but QT's resume will not suffer if this project was exempted. Here's hoping that Inglorious Bastards (2009) will make up for this film. See this film if you have nothing else to do. Nothing.",Death Proof
536,tdh1878,B-,7,28 December 2019,"Most people haven't seen, or have never even heard of, Death Proof. I know of several individuals who would call themselves true Quentin Tarantino diehards, yet who have never had the pleasure of seeing this, his most excessive and over-the-top work, and in one instance, I know of one ""diehard"" who doesn't even want to see it.This is certainly the most divisive entry in Tarantino's filmography. Its unusual release format, in that it played theatrically as the second half of a double bill behind Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror, has caused an unintentional rift between the average moviegoing public and the filmmaker. For those generally unfamiliar with the film, if you didn't see it in theaters, then it would only have made its way to you via home video or television, but you would likely know little about it unless you were aware of the release of ""Grindhouse.""It's easy to see why Death Proof has been neglected over the years. Still, it is great fun. It's Tarantino going all out. The plot revolves around Stuntman Mike, a serial killer who murders his seemingly all-female victims by putting them in the passenger seat of his death-proof stunt car before deliberately cashing the vehicle, walking away with minor injuries but leaving his subjects decapitated. To top it all off, Stuntman Mike is gleefully portrayed by Kurt Russell. As ridiculous as it sounds, this is one enjoyable film that never takes itself too seriously - if that wasn't already painfully obvious. There's some truly great stunt work present here too, which makes it all the more fun to look at.Death Proof is probably the least engaging title in Tarantino's impressive filmography, but that's not saying much. Sure, it's more of an adrenaline rush than something to chew on thematically, but there is some substance behind the style. It takes its time getting started, a necessary route to flesh out the movie's largely one-dimensional characters, but the pace also contributes to a sense of suspense and dread, something that comes to define the film as it approaches its final act. And for those of you who love Tarantino and have yet to see this bombastic juggernaut, you can rest assured that, in what is arguably his signature directorial trademark, the final act will most certainly knock the wind out of you.",Death Proof

Deathproof was the best thing about this movie though. Underrated. What's cool about this movie is here you have kurt russell playing a bad guy for once. He's a maniac professional stunt driver. He kills people with his car. Doesn't think he can be beat til he comes across another set of professionals. To make it more intense there is added danger when of the victims is strapped to the hood of a car.

After seeing Death Proof, that hypothesis has been proved false.To be blunt, Death Proof is dull. I am a Tarentino fan and I understand that the dialogue in his films is one of his trademarks. However, Death Proof does not bring those same comedic conversations on pop culture like we saw in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Instead we get 2 groups of girls talking about nothing. No, i don't mean Seinfeld nothing. I mean nothing to the point where I had to fast forward 15 minutes each time to find Kurt Russel, the only highlight of the movie.The car chase/crash scenes are good enough to make you want to stop through the fast forwarding of probably some of the most boring conversations in recent cinema history. There is no CGI and instead Tarentino gives us the throwback feel that should have been there throughout the whole movie.The movie would not have been so bad if the dialogue of both sets of girls was cut in half, the scenes in the bar which seemed like Tarentino used as an excuse to insert a lot of rare, retro music had been left to a minimum, and we got to see more of Kurt Russel's interesting Stunt Man Mike character.",Death Proof

Jackie Brown, but he has gone too far with this one. I was all set for car chases, mayhem, babes and a plot I'd have to wait until the ending before giving myself the proverbial shot to the forehead and the 'I should've seen that coming' statement but NO. There is no plot, the tireless dialogue means nothing to the plot, the characters mean nothing to the plot, the whole movie goes NOWHERE !!

I've seen it a few times and I enjoy it much more when I interpret the 2nd sequence as being a portrayal of events that occurred *before* the first sequence.First of all, time scrambling is more consistent with Tarantino's style. Secondly, this interpretation provides a better explanation of why Stuntman Mike was stalking these girls. Third, there are certain features in the film that suggest that this is indeed the case.For instance, before he went after the girls in the first sequence, one of the girls (Butterfly) seemed to recognize his car (the distinctive hood ornament perhaps?) as if their paths had crossed before. Mike had pictures of the girls, (we couldn't see them clearly enough to be sure they were the same girls, but they were similar.) Finally, Mike seemed to want revenge on these particular girls.Potential spoiler alert!!!.....The girls in the second sequence are similar looking to the girls in the first. Even if they aren't the same girls, they are close enough! The girls (from the second sequence) thought they killed Mike. They didn't.

But when there is gore, it should be recognized as such - and there is quite a lot of gore in this movie. But there is a lot more to it than that. After the first hour, what it really brought to mind was ""A Clockwork Orange"", by Kubrick, the only other movie that I've ever seen that makes me feel good about evil. I'm afraid there's not much else I can write about this movie without turning this into a spoiler - except that it is original (I certainly appreciated the main theme by Serge Gainsbourg) and disturbing, which is a lot more than what can be said about most movies nowadays.

The acting was great, the action kept you pumped, the dialog was smart and funny at the same time and the cinematography and editing had the simplistic retro feel and look. Don't listen to all the narrow-minded reviewers here, especially the one about being bored during the majority of the movie. If you're semi-smart, which this person appears to not be, you'll understand the humor and incentives during the conversations and scenes. However, the plot was semi-plagued by a seemingly jumpy plot line, yet it never really moves like it feels.",Death Proof
553,helenelisechat,Not worth the trouble for 1 good scene.,1,18 April 2008,"This is really awful. The director has relied on his loyal fan base to make money with this film. He doesn't write well for women & consequently the endless conversations are lazy, lacklustre, & scrambling for humour & meaning. You can see what he was trying to do but he fails utterly to pull it off. Whilst the 'homage' to old 'B' movies may have worked if it had been set in the past; you have the absurdity of mobile 'phone use overlaid with fake scratches & sound faults. Kurt Russell's character was brilliant & the film overall was inferior to his superb acting talent. The dialogues felt really tired & you find yourself thinking he'd just looked back through his old screenplays & amended them to suit. I loved his other films & feel really 'cheated' by this. If this was a school report you'd find 'Must try harder' written on the bottom in red ink. Save your money & watch the 1975 classic Death Race 2000 instead. Alternatively, fast forward to the last 30 minutes of the film & then cue back to watch the few occasions where Kurt appears speaking & eating. Quentin...we deserve better than this self indulgent, foot fetish fest of old twaddle.",Death Proof
554,j-dsouza24,"make it stop, make it stop, won't someone please make it stop!",1,24 September 2007,"This is by far the worst piece of self-indulgent pap i've had the displeasure of watching!! First off the dialogue was very wooden, long and boring that actually made you want to be driving Kurt's car!! (And this is not just a man's perspective!)Secondly, nothing actually happens in the film, there is no real action save for one car crash 30 mins in then one car chase at the end. There's no attempt to tell a story, or build character development, or build any sort of suspense.Thirdly, the ""artistic"" film making to make it look like a low budget grindhouse film, fails because these films weren't made to look like that they just did because of the film that was used, lack of budget,etc. This is not an homage to 70s grindhouse or exploitation films, it makes a mockery of them. They were actually good, this is not.Anyone who tries to cover the total crapness of this film with lines like ""if you don't 'get it' or like it, its because you don't understand or get Tarantino"". I would say thats is simply an excuse for a director producing really, really poor films.My biggest concern is that a very good actor (Kurt Russell) may now find new work hard to come by as unfortunately he has the misfortune of having this awful film on his CVMy advice, save your money if you've seen the trailer then thats you seen the film!! It took 2hrs of my life!!!",Death Proof
555,Kudosa,Not a movie!,6,17 September 2007,"Tarantino brings us a movie that is not really a movie, there is no understandable plot here and character backrounds are thin and uninteresting, this file doesn't really go anywhere and it is too drawn out for the amount of action within. However when the action does arrive its gritty violent and at the same time funny. This film seems more of a guideline for shooting a classic 70's horror there is some great camera work and the whole film is put together like it is still in pre-production with film grain and juddering dropped in along the way. Not good if you want to watch a story. Great if your into independent art-house or Tarantino style approach to film making.",Death Proof
556,thevandahl,Waste of time,1,29 September 2007,"A complete waste of time. What a boring, crap movie. Even the action scenes are uninteresting. It's clear that Tarantino only ever had one good movie in him, Pulp Fiction. Kill Bill was fairly interesting, and had some good action scenes, but this piece of crap has nothing. Midway through the movie, we shift aspect from the main characters, just like in Pulp Fiction, where it was a complete surprise, but we've seen that trick now, it's not too interesting this time around. The movie contains a lot of dialogue, which I found boring, boring, boring. Tarantino himself makes an appearance, which makes you wake up for a few minutes, but then you can lie back in your chair and sleep for the next 20 minutes or so again. This is a movie for Tarantino-fans only, and their patience must be slowly wearing out as well, one should think. Please see it for yourself if you want, but expect nothing of entertainment value. There's and old saying stating that filmmakers are only as good as their last value, which means Tarantino is worth diddly squat.",Death Proof
557,GTheys,Death Proof,8,26 November 2007,"I always use IMDb for reviews of movies i have not as yet seen. I read a not so great review from one of the movie watchers and thought i should rather avoid this movie.Then last night i decided to watch it and found it quite enjoyable. I loved the storyline and especially the way Tarantino and grind house made the movie look like it was shot in the early 70's. This even includes lines across the screen, black and white portions and bad editing...it was brilliant. The dialog introduces you to the depth (or lack there of) of the characters and although it might seem arduous and boring, it all builds up to the action sequences which are mind blowing and shocking to say the least. I had to watch the first action sequences at least 3 times. It's not a movie about deep thought provoking issues, it's just a Tarantino thrill ride as we all use to his types of movies. i even loved the one characters ring-tone, the tune from kill bill.The car chase was scary and exciting at the same time. I was sad that they had to trash such beautiful muscle cars. I love the fear they instilled into the killer .It was light hearted in the sense of the story, entertaining and i loved every single minute of it. I would definitely watch it again, with Planet Terror after wards.",Death Proof
558,krushkilldestroy,Incredibly boring,1,26 January 2008,"Read the user reviews surrounding this one. You will soon spot certain points of criticism that are repeated over and over, such as:Death Proof is incredibly long and incredibly boring - The women in this movie are unsympathetic - Kurt Russel is cool but terribly underused - Death Proof is self-indulgentAs they say: Hundreds of IMDb-users can't be wrong, right? RIGHT! Each and every of the points above holds true for this movie. Death Proof will bore the heck out of you - it reminded me of watching Dr. Zhivago with my parents! It is very long (almost two hours) and 90% of it is irrelevant pop-cultural talk, which might have worked in the 90s but seems kind of pointless now. The women ARE unsympathetic and there is a very good reason for that: They are a product of a nerd's (that would be Tarantino) wishful thinking, which means they are sort of like... alpha-male high-school jocks caged in female bodies. This is also why this movie is not feminist at all: There is nothing less feminist than a guy projecting his wishes upon women. That's as about feminist as a wifey dressing up as a nurse because her hubby wished it for his birthday. As for Kurt Russel: He's a great actor but he doesn't get to show his skills in this movie. Finally: Death Proof smacks of EGOTRIP. Hell, Tarantino even quotes his own movies (one of the characters has a song from the ""Kill Bill""-soundtrack as her cell-phone ring-tone... talk about vanity). Which is weird, you know, 'cause I thought he originally set out to quote the 70s trash cinema with Death Proof. Which he didn't. There was no ""Death Race 2000"" here. Just boredom.",Death Proof
559,Neosparke,We Were Robbed,6,24 September 2007,Well what can I say death proof is not best viewed in this format and has lost a lot of the charm of the original grindhouse experience. And I cannot help but feel the extra scenes added in should have left on the cutting room floor. The film starts off in first gear and never really gets going until 30 minutes in. That said my score here is based purely on the heart stopping adrenalin fulled closing 20 minute chase and revenge sequence. Kurt Russell is fantastic as villain stuntman mike and really caries this movie off but i was left cold by the early female characters and could not wait for them to die. This was and experience of 2 halves and when you consider we are missing the trailers and planet terror we as film viewers have been well and truly robbed. What you have here is an overlong version that sat better in its original 89 minute cut. I am sure the money hungry Weinstein's will give the UK this film back in its original intended format at some point trailers planet terror and all. My advice wait for that.,Death Proof
560,chef-65,Tarantino's Funhouse,8,5 April 2010,"It just goes to show how much of an appraised director Tarantino had become by the time this movie came out if you read the many deeply disappointed reviews. Disappointment to the point of utter desperation, I dare say. But what exactly makes this film so entirely different from Tarantinos previous outfits? How could he possibly hurt so many of his loving followers' feelings? All his films have been rather weird blendings of his own unique style and blatant quoting from his favorite genres. It isn't any different with Death Proof.All his films feature lengthy, sometimes seemingly pointless dialog so this one - again - isn't really any different in that matter. Admittedly the dialog may very well be a notch lengthier and the imagery from grind house subculture harder to adjust to but then again this is just Tarantino having tons of fun, sort of sideways from his bigger films like Kill Bill and the recent Inglorious Basterds.And you can almost touch the fun he and his guys had with the filming and the editing - hell I'm sure the party started with the casting already. Don't you just love the women, the fake-damaged editing, the pseudo-authentic female power lines, the crisp soul music and the downright ugly super villain of Stuntman Mike?**SPOILER** With all the fun put on display the film still manages to make you feel deeply sorry for the death of the first group of super vixens and that's a true accomplishment for an hour of film making most people deemed nothing but ironic. **SPOILER OVER**The film may lack some of the action earlier Tarantino geeks are demanding since Pulp Fiction but in many ways it's smarter and more charming than this movie. I've got to give it to those viewers who describe Tarantino's role as bartender as pointless but it really looks as if he enjoyed himself. And isn't that what film making these days should really be about for a director, writer or actor: enjoying yourself?",Death Proof
561,oak12,One of Tarantino's best.,10,28 January 2008,"I, being a huge Tarantino fan, was excited about seeing this film. I was however, still expecting it to probably be Tarantino's worst. I was greatly surprised however, to see that it is one of Tarantino's best in my opinion.Firstly; the storyline. Very simple, and to the ear it may seem silly. However, it still manages to make this film incredible. The amazing turn-of-the-tables for Stuntman Mike and the girls in the second part of the movie was a great highlight for me.The casting was great. I thought Sydney Poitier as Jungle Julia was perfect, and the rest of the cast pulled off great performances too (special credit to Zoe Bell).Scriptwise, it was the best I have seen since Pulp Fiction. The girls' dialogue brought a youthful sense to the film (for me anyway), especially Tracie Thoms' dialogue.I thought the soundtrack was the best for any Tarantino film yet. Every song fitted the situation perfectly, as well as being very good songs in themselves. I especially thought ""Hold Tight"" was perfect for the head-on collision scene.I thought the damaged look of the film was exceptional, and I loved the way Tarantino added in goofs purposely (hopefully).I was greatly surprised with the film's box office failure. Whether you are familiar with Tarantino's work or not, I highly recommend this film to all.",Death Proof
562,melissa-moore,*Contains a spoiler!* scared the hell out of me...what a ride!,8,2 May 2008,"Okay, I waited with baited breath to see this flick because I am a Tarantino fan. It's not my favourite of his, but I did like it because Tarantino really let his movie-geek side come out, and I myself am a movie-geek at heart. Call me a wimp if you like, but this tale scared the hell out of me! By the end, I reached into my pocket to get out my chap stick, because my mouth was so dry, and my hand was so shaky and sweaty that I couldn't get the lid off! The one scene I thought was needless was where the girls leave their actress friend (in full cheerleader garb) at the mercy of the creepy hick (duelling banjos, anyone?), knowing what her fate will undoubtedly be. Other than that, I loved the ultra-realistic and snappy dialog, the music, the action, pretty much everything.

563,clintsnow,Not very inspired at all,5,21 May 2008,"I really think that this is Tarantino's worst effort to date. I know it's supposed to be an ""homage"" to grind-house cinema, but what it really is is just a recycling of tired exploitation clichés. Kurt Russell is great as always, but the rest of the acting stinks. Yes, one could say ""that's the way it's supposed to be"" with one of these films, but I don't buy that. Whether intentional or not, the acting is just sub par. Tarantino needs to prove that he has some directing chops still in him, not that he can recycle old film plots and write corny dialogue. Having said that, Tarantino's worst effort to date is still entertaining; I just wouldn't recommend that anyone actually pay money to see it.",Death Proof
564,Speedtrip,"OK, Quentin, we get the joke. Can we move on now, please?",1,14 September 2008,"This movie seems to have polarized opinion like no other I have ever seen.There are those who are ""cool"" and ""hip"" and who ""get"" what QT is doing here. These people give it full marks.Then there are the rest of us. We see this movie as being an object lesson in self obsessed drivel which patronizes a once loyal and on the whole forgiving audience.That's a little harsh. We must remember that the film was originally envisaged as being one half of a double bill and was much shorter. Maybe on this level it would have worked. At least audiences were spared the frankly embarrassing ""Lap Dance"" scene in the short version. Maybe the now traditional flip through QT's record collection wouldn't have made the final cut. Perhaps much of the turgid and irrelevant dialog would have stayed on the cutting room floor. Unfortunately it is in the nature of movie editing that one can only cut out what is bad instead of adding anything good.But what I saw (and paid good money for) was the DVD release. Sad, very sad indeed. Quentin, are you familiar with the notion that you are only as good as your last movie?

566,thoughtcube,Tarantino with a Twist,8,9 September 2007,"It is very interesting to see reviews of this movie. In fact I think most people gloss over the most interesting aspect of it, which explains why so many people don't like it.Basically, Tarantino decided to make a Tarantino movie with gals instead of guys. It's that simple. Yes, Kill Bill might be seen as such as well. But it is less similar to Tarantino's earlier work.So, most other Tarantino films are 'guy films' - lots of violence, and the 'Tarantino dialog' is, well, guy dialog. Or is it? Perhaps Tarantino asked himself that very question - is Tarantino dialog male in content, form, or both? In this movie he tries to see what happens when the form is kept the same, but the content altered. So we see girls talking in a Tarantino manner about girl topics (well, with a Tarantino slant, but still). Does it work? Well, that is exactly the interesting thing. If you liked the dialog, then I guess it means that 'Tarantino dialog' works for you, regardless of content. If not, then perhaps you liked the content and not necessarily the form of dialog in his previous movies. Regardless, people's response here is interesting.A second issue relates to form vs. content in another way, the action. Do people like girl action heroes as much as guys? Apparently many do, to judge by recent TV shows and movies (and even Kill Bill). So perhaps Tarantino isn't taking much of a chance by replacing his usual male roles with girls. However, he does make a statement while doing so: Notice that there are two parts to the movie, (*** SPOILER AHEAD! ***), the first where the girls are completely passive and get slaughtered, and the second where the girls survive the initial onslaught, regroup, and proceed to kick the guy's ass very thoroughly.Is this a flawless movie? Certainly not. But it was also definitely not what I expected coming in, and I felt entertained.",Death Proof

568,blackhawk1960,"Great stuntwoman, lousy acting",2,2 October 2007,"I got the same vibe many had. . . that Tarantino was either: infatuated with Zoe, gave Zoe a opportunity to act (which was a mistake), or thought that Zoe could act and finally found out that she couldn't until it was too late to re-shoot. There had to be a moment somewhere in production when he said to himself- ""What the hell is this movie about?"" Well, I'll say it.It's about the failure of a Tarantino movie. A thrown-together vegetable soup of a movie that displayed none of the magic of Vincent Vega or the Yellow-Haired Warrior. Yeah, it had its brief moments where Kurt Russell did his good-stuntman bad-stuntman shtick, but that's all.Creative, truly pure profanity was the life-blood of earlier QT vehicles because IT WAS BELIEVABLE!

569,lgonzalez12,One of Tarantino's best!,10,12 June 2011,"I know that most people don't think too highly of this film but I disagree strongly. This is one of the best Tarantino films. The dialogue is superb and not in the least bit boring. It was shot with excellence and the characters are well developed. It features very tasteful and car chase sequences that don't go over the top with CGI and unrealistic feats. The story is well told and the acting is great. It pays a homage to many great Grindhouse films. It was shot using many 60s and 70s style techniques which compliment the film very well. People might not like the idea of it being a girl power movie when in actuality Tarantino is known for using women as very powerful figures in his films with the exception of Reservoir Dogs. The film starts out slow but picks up and doesn't let you go until the end. This film is hilarious and action packed. It is a very underrated film in my opinion. This film is genius and if studied, one can truly understand the form of authentic filmmaking.",Death Proof

Much like the other grind house film, which in my opinion was better, but Death Proof is still good. It was very entertaining, and had some good lines and, from my perspective, a pretty interesting and different story idea. The beginning was a little boring, and it was mostly dialogue the first 45 minutes, but it built up to a very good moment. Kurt Russel did an excellent job on his character ""Stuntman Mike"".

Don't get me wrong, I love all Taratino's previous work, and loved the dialogue in Jackie Brown - but these involved interesting characters. Aside from Kurt Russell, the girls in DP are just plain boring.Eli Roth has a cameo in the film and by the end of the movie, I felt he had an influence on the directing and pacing of the movie given the slight similarities in style with the awful Hostel. If you don't like Hostel, you may not like this.I've not seen the Grindhouse version, but I suspect if you took out 40 minutes from the extended cut (easily done given the most of the dialogue scenes have no bearing on the plot), Death Proof would be a good film.",Death Proof

I have enjoyed every one of Tarantino's movies so far, but this one is, well simply, boring.

Tarantino's latest is a waste of time and money and energy, because it contains NO STORY, NO CHARACTERS, it's just never ending stupid shallow dialogues of genre speak, bad acting, and it 's not bad in a good sense, no it's not. Tarantino mocks us! Don't think this is art! It's the result of lazy work and pubertal fantasies of omnipotence. He thinks he can do anything now. Even puke into the audience's faces by delivering a series of looong dialogues that are not interesting and looong action scenes that are not thrilling. Every character in a good B-Movie has some kind of motivation and that makes a bad film good.

After the first group of girls were done yapping we finally got to see Kurt Russel kill somebody. That took about 5 minutes. When the first group of girls got killed it was kind of cool. But, still not worth watching. Then it was back to more yapping with a new group of annoying sluts. After what seemed like forever again, we had a really stupid car chase to sit through.

The film quality is variable; if you were trying to create an 'effect' at least have it the same all the way through and have some continuity. The sound quality is only good when we hear the roar of Mr Russell's car and those garbled scenes involving women clearly suffering from Tourette's syndrome.Did the concept of a plot get discarded along the way, perhaps? There is no clue given as to why Mr Russell might get his kicks wanting to snuff the lives of so many women, although I found them so boring and irritating that I would gladly have driven the car for him.If this is really the best that you can do for us, I have a suggestion for you: pop down to your local DVD rental shop and ask them if you can get a job.

580,MrGoodB,Dead Women Talking,1,16 September 2007,"I love movies in general. I love obscure B-, C-, and Z-movies in particular - the dumber the plots and the less coherent, the better.When I first heard of Death Proof, I was therefore understandably excited. Tarantino is undeniably a pro director, and though I personally think his trademark elements - bizarre dialogue about pop culture, foot fetishism - are somewhat annoying, I was willing to give him a try. He couldn't possibly screw up a movie that is SUPPOSED to be bad, I thought.Suffice to say, he could. Oh, how he could.We begin our long and arduous journey through the demented mind of Quentin ""I made two cult classics in the early 90s and am therefore beyond criticism"" Tarantino by joining a motley crew of four young women on their way to a local bar, tended by none other than Tarantino himself in an utterly pointless cameo role. Then, nothing happens. Twice.I'm serious, the first hour of this movie (it might have been less but it certainly didn't feel like less) consists of absolutely nothing else but four women, whose admittedly good looks cannot mask the fact that they are about as intriguing to watch as display dummies and slightly less entertaining, drinking in a bar and talking.What they are talking about, I have no idea. I really cannot remember a single sentence of note said in this torturous first hour (for the protocol, I cannot remember anything said in the second half either), but I am fairly sure that it involved some kind of prank about a lap dance one of them (don't ask me for the names) pulled on one of the others.After meeting Stuntman Mike, whose introduction moves at about the same snail-paced crawl as everything does in this movie, and another twenty minutes of talking and an embarrassing lap dance, we finally get to the ""action"" part of the movie. The use of quotation marks is deliberate, since the much anticipated murder scene (didn't I tell you? Stuntman Mike is a serial killer using his car as a weapon. Don't ask why, though - there is no explanation given) consists of two cars crashing headfirst and what amounts to about three seconds of gore.Cut: Stuntman Mike is hospitalized, but alive and kicking. The four broads are not. Throw in an absolutely pointless scene with two absolutely pointless policemen, which I'm sure is another one of Tarantino's look-how-subtle-I-am references/homages/ripoffs to/from himself.Cut again: Four shallow and irritating women sit in a car and talk boring nonsense, interlaced with four letter words to boost the as yet slightly neglected ""controversial and provocative"" aspect of this movie. After another hour of talking - mind you, this time, it's an entirely different deli! Nobody can accuse Tarantino of repeating himself! - Stuntman Mike appears and starts bumping into their car for no discernible reason.A car chase ensues, mostly consisting of the two cars driving alongside each other at high speed, with the women yelling at Stuntman Mike to cease the hostilities - during the chase, one of the girls lies on the hood and has some difficulties maintaining this condition - and for some reason refusing to, uh, stop their own car and thus prevent their friend from falling off. After finally gaining the upper hand on Mike and wrecking his car (not so death proof now, is it?), they drag him out and beat him to death. That's it. The end.I hate this movie. It's an insufferably boring and egomaniacal mess and there is absolutely no reason to see it. It's not funny, not even unintentionally so. It's not scary. It's not interesting, not over-the top surreal, nothing. There is no gore, no monsters, mutants, freaks, demons or at least a cool villain to hold your interest (Kurt Russell wasn't bad as an actor, but to call his character two-dimensional would be an exaggeration), there isn't ANYTHING in here that makes a good B-movie entertaining .

581,john7doe2002,Sh!t and run...,1,4 June 2007,"It really must have seemed like a great idea at the time.

In what must be a first for QT, the double-bill bombed, was panned at Cannes, and so is now being split into the two films for worldwide release, of which Death Proof is the first to be released in Belgium.Alongside the adulation, Tarantino has long had his naysayers - despite the obvious brilliance of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Kill Bill (I+II), detractors have pointed to the waste of time and money that was Jackie Brown and labelled him as a director obsessed with style over substance, so-called sassy dialogue over coherent narrative - a movie brat masquerading as Hitchcock (and his cameos don't help, either).This reviewer would previously have pooh-poohed such as heresy, but no more. Just so there are no surprises in store, let it be known that Death Proof is, without a doubt, the worst, most self-indulgent piece of cinematic codswallop in some time - 'great' director or not.Complete with all the 70s trimmings ('Our Feature Presentation' jingle at the start (charming in Kill Bill because of what followed), grainy colour under- and over-exposure, 'unintentional' jump-cuts, dialogue that's repeated, get the drift?) we have here a story of auto-slasher killer Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), a man who gets off on the high-impact pile-up.During a near-interminable 110 minutes, he victimises two groups of four juicy babes (Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Sydney Poitier (who has, to be fair, got absolutely glorious legs), Rose McGowan, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Zoë Bell) with his 'death proof' 70s Dodge Charger.'Stuntman''s car comes from a time before CGI effects in the movies, hence it's designed to allow stuntmen to survive any auto-accident, no matter how outrageous. He's got a little extra juice under the bonnet, too - handy for when you want to pile-drive your unsuspecting victims' car at 200mph.Sounds like a riot, doesn't it? Well, at a pinch, with the genuinely exciting mega car-chase that brings a blessed end to proceedings, it might have been, had it only filled a half-hour 'Quentin Tarantino Presents' episode. Unfortunately, old QT (who also wrote and makes his inauspicious cinematography-director debut here) obviously reckons that 70s visuals overload and non-stop, teeth-grindingly irritating 'sassy girl talk' will hold the attention indefinitely.They don't. They so don't. On, and on, and on it goes - imagine the opening diner scene in...Dogs or the Jack Rabbit Slims Thurman/Travolta chat in Pulp Fiction extended to 90-odd minutes, and you might get the picture. As a result, not only are you brutally bored by the girls' blabbering blah-blah, any sympathy/support for them in their plight hits the road hard and fast.Worse, though, is the waste of Russell, a great actor from the 70s/early 80s films that inspired Tarantino and Rodriguez (Elvis (1979), Escape From New York (1981), The Thing (1982)), in this doggerel. He's not frightening. He's barely sinister. Dark charm is about as good as his character achieves - and Russell has always had that in spades, anyway.So there you have it. Will the real Quentin Tarantino step forward, please?",Death Proof
582,watkinstodd,Audience becomes victim,3,14 July 2008,"Though I've always been curious to see the imagination of Tanantino in each of his releases, I've wondered if he could re-invent himself as he progressed through his career. With Death Proof, it has all come to a screeching halt as Quentin seems to be so self-absorbed into his historical film references and seeming ability to turn the most mundane dialog into gold that he has forgotten that he has an audience out there in which he needs to communicate his message.I will not go deep into plot, because there is none, and has been explained in previous reviews. The films premise is rather delicious, as we have the makings of a great villain in Kurt Russell, and a plot in a simple package - he is out for blood and it seems anybody can become the victim - especially if you happen to be a smack-talking, bitchy gal.After we have heard this endless drivel between the first set of characters, we almost see Kurt Russell as our savior - like a Grim Reaper out to do the work that we wouldn't do ourselves - to take these horrible people off the screen so we can get back to our business. It almost makes the viewer feel guilty to look at Stuntman Mike as the ""hero"" for a moment - because these four gals were devoid of any type of sympathy. But it gets worse, as we realize that this horror movie has introduced a new group of ""villians"" that we have to put up for (are you kidding me?) the last half of the film. Tarantino has created his least likable, least interesting characters I've seen in a while. If it was his goal to make us root for Stuntman Mike, then it's a new, but twisted play on the audience. To turn the most interesting (and actually more sympathetic character than most of the women) into a driveling whining baby was pathetic, and lame.The only thing worse than the overlong, dull, non-plot driven dialog, is the fact that we see Tarantino speaking directly through the characters. This self-absorption should never EVER come through the characters. They should have their own life, and never have those director trademarks interfering with the storytelling. A wink from time to time is nice (as when Hitchcock did his brief cameos, or showed his hand fetishes from time to time - but never interfered with the story).The action sequence (and it's build up - as the stunt gals talk about the ""telephone pole"") were quite nice, once we got past the mundane dialog. But a 10 minute sequence does not make a film, unfortunately.Hopefully Quentin's next outing will remember that telling the story is more important than self indulgent showcasing.",Death Proof
583,dav00zak,Simply not a good movie,3,5 September 2007,"All the way from reservoir dogs to Kill bill makes one wonder where Tarantino finds his genius ideas. Death proof shows that he sometimes looks for them in the filthiest of dumpsters.This is the movie i will refer to when someone asks if there is a movie with less story to it than ""insert lame movie here"". The story basically is about two different groups of annoying girls partying and talking a whole bunch bunch of nonsense, then either getting or nearly getting killed. The best parts of the movie had to be either the parts showing the awesome cars alone or the end (where you finally could conclude that it wasn't anything in this movie worth more than a wrapping paper from a bubblegum)I haven't seen the second part of Grindhouse ""Planet Terror"" yet so i'm hoping that it will somehow redeem this piece of mind murdering mumbo jumbo.",Death Proof
584,paschalakis-96-819945,Amazing movie!!!,10,7 December 2020,"Globally this movie is really underrated, even though it's one of my favorite movie from QT and probably one of my favorites in general!
It offers iconic scenes (e.g. jukebox lapdance), iconic lines, cameo guests from characters from other QT movies, classic Tarantino scenes (e.g. breakfast and girls talk about Zoe the cat) and great music choices.
The movie is a revival of car chasing/stunt 70's movie, as Tarantino loves to revive older American movie styles.",Death Proof
585,Yondaseso,kind of entertaining at best,3,22 September 2014,"First of all, Kurt Russell is a legend. His roles with John Carpenter immortalize him as a rock solid anti-hero protagonist. He has not starred in many leading roles since the 80's and 90's, so this was a big chance to serve up an amazing new character.*Spoilers* In Death Proof, Russel is cast as a villain. This is a lofty choice considering Russel has never played a major villain, but it could have worked.But it does not work.The movie is broken into two halves. The first half takes place in a bar where the villain, ""Stuntman Mike"" (let's face it, it's a stupid name) is sitting around stalking his prey. He ends up explaining that his car is death proof in the driver's seat (WHICH HAS NO RELEVANCE IN THE ENTIRE FILM). He kills some beautiful young women and ends up in a hospital. There is some potential here, but it has already been an hour of basically hanging out at a bar and 10 minutes of action. The characters have all died and are done except Stuntman Mike.Now the second half begins, with a new group of very similar young ladies. Why not just keep the same characters? Why introduce new protagonists after an hour? They take a ride in a fast car and here comes Stuntman Mike to kill them. Only this time, the women end up killing him... pulling him out of his death proof car and punching him.I hate to say it, this film is LOUSY. Not deliberate-B-movie lousy. Inconsistent-with-even-the-title-lousy. It starts OK then starts again worse, and ends stupid.",Death Proof
586,andycantona7,Absolute garbage,2,1 May 2011,"Big Tarantino fan and hadn't watched this, even though I'd had it for ages. I couldn't quite believe how bad it was.From the boring dialogue to the boring Kurt Russel.Turned off after 40 minutes.'Jungle Julie' is probably the dullest and least interesting character Tarantino has ever dared to put in place as a kind of lead part and the rest of the women were bland and unimaginative too.Kurt Russel was a poor choice too, he just doesn't engage you like some of the great actors who've played the lead in other Tarantino movies - no screen presence at all. 7.2/10 on here! Who's voting for gods sake?I've got Planet Terror to watch yet, I'm hoping for a huge improvement.",Death Proof
587,gamekings62,"Great, Intense, but the story is kinda.....",8,5 September 2007,"I gave this movie 8 stars because it is A great movie, and it really made me happy when I saw it. Sure, the storyline ain't good but it is A horror film. And because it is made by Quentin Tarantino people expect A lot of this movie. People like ""pugheaven""(Also wrote A comment) are just angry because they expect A lot of QT movies. But saying that this deserves A zero""0"" that's just cruel and stupid. I think this movie is just great because of the action and the funny and genius sketches. Quentin Tarantino you did A great job. And for the ladies, you will love this movie, because it shows A lot of female.....""Things""(Can't find the right word for it). Anyway before you see this movie, you should tell yourself, this movie that I'am going to watch is not going to be QT best work.

589,yellowrobe1,Robbed Me of My Dignity,1,30 January 2010,"There are lots of unpleasant things in life. Most of which are unavoidable. Taxes, sickness, death, poverty ... things which no one willingly subjects oneself to but are more accurately accosted by. Death Proof is by no means comparable to death or disease but sitting through it may make some viewers wish for death either upon Mr.Tarantino or upon their own miserable lives rather than suffer through another moment of Death Proof.Death Proof assails the senses like a vile prison rape. The awful dialogue continues at pace so constant it may as well be another form of Chinese water torture. Drop by drop the characters blab incessantly about things no one cares about and things real people would never talk about. One gets the feeling that no one subscribed to the hype of the QT writing ability more than Mr.Tarantino. In the case of Death Proof he couldn't be more wrong. It's cinematic atrocity on a grand scale. It's prison rape without the vaseline.",Death Proof
590,morphheus,Doesn't deserve to be a part of the Grindhouse double feature.,6,15 February 2008,"Saw this after I saw Planet Terror and I was expecting more of the same... blood, gore, violence and cheesiness that too done better as it was QT. It was a huge disappointment. Tarantino fails to capture any of the exploitation cinema atmosphere as there is little action, there is too much talking, the story isn't exploitation-film-cheesy and even the film doesn't have the same scratched and worn out effect that Planet Terror had.Its just another Tarantino movie with long drawn scenes with a lot of talking. Some violence but that too is handled with some maturity... something that was not expected from this film. Kurt Russel isn't really the bad ass he was supposed to be and the end just doesn't leave you satisfied.If you intend to watch the Death Proof double feature I suggest you watch this one first and Planet Terror later or maybe skip Deathproof altogether. On its own, Deathproof is ""just another"" Quentin Tarantino flick and that too not one of his better ones.",Death Proof
591,SwiteeGT,Do not forget that's a Tarantino movie,8,10 August 2019,"Even a lot of people considering this as the worst movie from Quentin Tarantino still is a very good movie in comparison with some others. The movie have slow dialogues that make the development stagnant and hard to watch without getting tired, but it also own good things. The character Stuntman Mike is very well represented by Kurt Russel, being able to demonstrate the insanity and madness in a lovely way. Tarantino is great making ends for his movies and in this one it's not different, is very funny and rewarding for all slow dialogues that had. (The lap dance is remarkable!)",Death Proof
592,chaindragger,Why the fast forward button was invented,1,3 September 2018,"This movie could be edited in to a pretty decent 30 minute show.

There's no way you could root for their charcters.",Death Proof
593,sean-mcevoy,Whatever happened to Tarrantino,1,26 September 2007,"I eagerly awaited the latest Tarantino movie, Death Proof. I don't know why i bothered to waste nearly two hours on this sorry mess. As commented by others on this site the film is very dialogue heavy. Not usually a problem, except the interchanges between the girls just wasn't that interesting. Even Kurt Russell, who looked every bit the part as the Stuntman with the Death Proof Car couldn't save this dire movie, And what is it with Butts? Seems this movie these would have been a lot better without scantily clad girls wiggling their butts in front of the camera all the time. The bar scene was boring beyond belief, the black and white section just went on forever. I guess the simple truth is that this movie just wasn't that good, check out the ending. Tarrantino seems to want to pay ""Homage"" to the 70s exploitation movies most of which never made it to this side of the pond (and with good reason!), or rip off the twilight zone or the outer limits. Reservoir dogs was a Brilliant movie, Pulp Fiction was a fantastic milestone movie. Considering where he got his best ideas from, I think Quentin should quit the movie business for a few years and go back to working in Blockbuster till he gets a new idea that doesn't involve homage or ripping off 70s midnight movies.But of course he wont. He'll just continue in the same vein, and we'll just keep on getting suckered in. Come on Quentin show us you're not washed up",Death Proof
594,s_raumann,Absolutely horrible,1,13 November 2008,"The only comments for this movie are a big BS, absurd, stupid, boring and utterly unnecessary. They should have mad two cuts, one from the beginning to the middle and one from the middle to the end. OK, the car chase at the end was fairly well done and sufficient to wake the sleeping mind. Either Kurt Russell received a lot of money for this, his degrading movie or he may be desperate to be in pictures again after some time. In any case it is not a staring performance for Kurt. And, maybe somebody can tell me what these 2 groups of women are talking about and talking and talking and............ What a waste!!! Tarantino was out to make fools of the viewers",Death Proof
595,vicvic2010,"Dreamlike film, art masterpiece",10,24 August 2008,"It's important to understand that this is not just exploitation, or a (great by the way) car chase film, it is also a pure art-house kind of film, and it is simply great Art, it is as simple as that. It's also an exploitation film and its all the more fascinating. (in fact I didn't really love it the first time, Im not a big big fan of violence in movies and I felt that the dialog scenes were too long, but then I felt the druggy aspect of these dialog scenes, and a dreamlike feeling) There are things in this film that don't match together at ALL, it gives a feeling of a serious problem SOMEWHERE... but we don't know where!! (maybe its a concrete FILM REEL problem, maybe its in the WACKO MIND of someone... or maybe even something else. It's almost Lynchian, very mysterious) It's like if you watch a film, fall asleep in the movie theatre and dream more or less about it, wake up and see the rest or something, or remember your dream while you're watching the rest. Death proof is like the film you see, plus your dream, or some mix of them. And these types of things are subtle, not underlined, that's why it's so fascinating. Its one of my 15 favorite films, a masterpiece.",Death Proof
596,openeye,A steaming pile,2,11 March 2008,"Quentin Tarantino in my opinion has such an inflated opinion of himself that he no longer can tell good ideas from bad ideas. He thinks that everything that oozes from his orifices is gold when in fact most times than not it is fecal matter.One of the things that Hollywood has praised Quentin for is his dialog. With ""Death Proof"" you can see a clear indication that even Quentin has fallen to the hype. Never have I been so bored watching a movie with never ending dialog spoken by characters I care nothing about. The movie is absolutely painful to watch because you want to scream out ""Get on with it already!!"".The whole movie is just a shameless showcase for Zoe Bell to do a stunt on the hood of a car. You are left with the impression that Quentin Tarantino wanted to have a date with this girl but was afraid to ask her. Instead he wrote a movie for her.Believe me when I say this, the 5 minutes of stunts in this movie is not worth being tortured to death by the rest of the movie. I feel so bad for Kurt Russell and Robert Rodriguez.",Death Proof
597,wolfylee,Great chick flick.....,4,23 September 2007,"...that was a waste of my time!Only time out of the 2 hours that it was WORTH my time was when Kurt was on-screen. Apart from that it was an overly-empowered girl lovefest, and NOT in a good way :)Almost all the dialogue was of the ultra-scripted mini-monologue variety that none of these actors(Kurt excepting, natch) could pull off. It was like they had all rehearsed it in the bathroom mirror and thought, 'yeah, I'm bad-ass alright biaaatch!' Like they had rehearsed their lines by themselves and then gone to straight to shooting, 'I'll say this - wait, now you say your line, my turn again.' No realistic interruptions or flowing conversation, it just didn't ring true at all.Tarantino introduced the irreverence in modern movie-making dialogue, I KNOW this, but this was a homage to himself which never works *An observation I heard Garry Shandling make: once you think you have IT, is the exact moment you lose IT. Quentin should step back, re-watch and notice the difference between his first 3 attempts, which were awesome, and his last three.Anyways, I had more fun writing this critique than I did watching the film...4/10.*as an example, the Simpson's do it now, and they are fecked - the writers have developed something which now has no room to maneuver - just massively OTT self-referential story lines which signals the demise of any show. Homer doesn't have one single line these days which isn't a show of ultra-dumbness. To turn a 3D character into a 2D character (no smart-asses) is a clear sign of something......",Death Proof

600,mkdafan2003,Not as Good as Planet Terror..,4,8 December 2007,OK so I started this movie expecting greatness. I had watched Planet Terror and then I was going to watch this movie. Well it started fine and I was just like alright learning who the victims are and such. Then you are stuck with a good hour of nothing until 5 minutes of a crazy car stunt. Well then its like it all over again but this time the girls fight back. I never actually felt connected to the 2nd group of women so I wanted Stuntman to prevail in the big finish. There is about 20 minutes of total action in the entire movie. Granted the last action scene is cool but I didn't like it that much. I thought the ending was disappointing too and could have been done in a much better way. The hour and 40 minutes that isn't spent on action is just useless babble between characters. I have to say that Planet Terror was much better.,Death Proof

Yhe movie had no story line whats so ever, and it was so badly made it wasn't even good enough to laugh at. just a whole bunch of actions scenes and talk with no point to them. after the first 10 minutes you will realise what i have said is true and wish you took my warning.",Death Proof

And I think it had a great message in that automobiles can and are used as weapons to kill and injure. In fact, automobiles kill more people than guns and they are constantly misused. I also love to watch Rosario Dawson. She is gorgeous and refreshing. Kurt Russel did a great job as the typical maniac bully. It was also cool to see Mopar vehicles in action, although I didn't like to see them banged up so much. I hope they can be repaired fully. I also liked to see the women defending themselves with a gun and putting the run on the killer maniac played by Kurt. There was a little to much dialogue with the women but hey, women do love to talk so it was a accurate portrayal.This movie was better than a lot of garbage that has been out there lately. I would recommend this movie.",Death Proof

The movie is superb, Tarantino is a genius for making movies and IMHO in selecting casts that work, Tracie Thoms and Zoe Bell particularly stand out for their performances. I haven't seen Kurt Russell in anything for a while but I think this will become one of the movies for which he is known. I was reminded of him in the role of Snake Plissken, does that date me?

604,akus-2,Duel it ain't...,6,15 May 2008,"OK, maybe an unfair comparison as Duel is one of my favourite films, but it's really the lack of action that lets this film down. Fair enough, the stunt work is impressive but... While Spielberg's film has non-stop suspense film, Tarantino tries to compensate with gruesomeness.Kurt Russel is the well deserving star of this film, but even his performance fades towards the end of the film. However, I will give him benefit of the doubt as he probably is being deliberately cheesy, having excelled himself in the beginning. Trademark cameo by director seems little too engineered, and also takes place in the very boring part of the film. Maybe he could have been the guy selling the car instead, hence adding to the climax of the film(?).A full hour of the film listening the lovelies delivering lines you are accustomed to hearing from actors like Samuel Jackson is just too tedious. Sure there is quantity of flesh on show, but I probably would have enjoyed watching them just jogging more..Run of the mill film from a great director.(Thank you for reading my first ever review)",Death Proof

Fans of Quentin Tarantino and the genre he has created will recognize this to be some of his best work. Loads of pithy and quote worthy dialogue punctuated by an incredible soundtrack and of course briefs moments of extreme violence. The painstaking attention to detail is evident in each frame to create a true homage to films that inspired him.
Watching this film in the post #metoo era is truly surreal given that Harvey Weinstein and Rose mcgowan were both involved and the subject matter. A serial predator of women finally meets his match in a group of badass women who turn the tables on him in epic fashion. Almost as if Tarantino were trying to tell us something?

BUT the most annoying and uninspired thing is the obvious copying of elements from the genre. it appears cheap (that's something i also disliked about ""kill bill"") and somehow awkward. this movie gets the same rating as a bad ""original"" 70's exploitation movie would get: 4 out of 10.",Death Proof

The films main real issue is that the first group of characters managed to be much more interesting than the second. Death proofs second group isn't bad per say, just not as interesting. Especially since they get much more time develop. The first crew is shown going about there day and hanging out in a bar. The second group gets some dialogue, we learn one of them has a gun, then we abandon one of those characters and enter a fun yet predictable climax.I think you can enjoy this film without knowledge of what it tries to parody, but it immediately becomes a much better and more rewatchable film when you have insight.

It's complete unrelated to the issues of the film (violence, car chases, dolled up girls and Stuntman Mike, tributes of numerous films from the 70's), but oh so good. I love the fact that you can just listen to it without watching the flick itself.Tarantino has a knack for satisfying his audience with films that make violence a form art, over exaggerates it to a point where it is no longer nasty, but humorous (just look at Crazy 88 and the fight between Uma T. and Darryl H.), and takes it far beyond what is expected. Death Proof is yet another cry for post modernism in the hands of a true fan.Anyways, you gotta go see this one - his tribute includes bad camera, poor sound, awful editing and no plot what so ever.

612,beltrangarrote,Booooooooooooooooring!!!!,2,2 September 2007,"People say this movie is about a crazy man who enjoys killing girls with his ""death proof"" car.Wrong!!!This is a movie about girls that nobody cares about (Tarantino does not even try to make us like them), talking about girl-things really boring and not interesting at all. It is like listening to your little sister talking with her friends (did he kiss you? did you kiss him?).The takes are really long, even lighting up a cigarette takes forever. At the beginning i thought that he was going to surprise us with some fun turn, but that just never happened. I was all the time thinking: ""Ok, this is a B-movie but it is a Tarantino movie as well, lets be patience and wait for the good stuff"". Never came. When the movie finished, one thought came up: ""where is the entertainment"". The b-movies were very bad movies but fun to watch and likable in it's own way. At the middle of the movie somebody yelled ""what a bullshit"" and i could not believe that this was happening in a Tarantino movie, but the really sad thing is that I agreed. The only good thing about the movie is Kurt Russell and his car, too bad it takes forever until he comes up and then it goes away until almost the end. I would say he is in 20% of the movie.Tarantino tries to make his famous dialogs about nonsense things that are so well developed and taken care of, and he fails dramatically. With the last four girls in the restaurant he tries this reservoir dogs round table thing, and you know what? It is the most boring and annoying part of the film, just bla-bla-bla talk (again). I found myself praying (while other people yelling out loud) for the conversation to end, so something entertaining could happen; which it happened (finnally!) with the car chase that i really enjoyed. It is a pity that it lasted the last 10 minutes of the movie, but, after the previous 110 minutes, it was not worth at all.I want to state that i am a Tarantino fan, and i knew what this movie was about and how it was meant to be. What really matters to me is that I came out from the theater bored as hell, and i thought that was never gonna happen with Tarantino",Death Proof

I could have wasted my time on something better... like cartoons. not sure what the producers were trying to get across but it sure missed the point If i had been Kurt Russell I would have had to have turned this movie if you can call it a movie down... it didn't do anything for his career. sorry some people may have like it for some reason but haven't figured out what. IPODS in the 70's red bull in the 70's I was in my 20s in the 70s and that did not exist at that time also the late 90s dodge truck was a nice touch in the 70s.,Death Proof
614,crpnzombie,Didn't live up to the hype,3,13 October 2007,"Here's half the reason Grindhouse flopped.I was extremely interested to see how this movie, along with Planet Terror was going to be presented, with the hype surrounding the theatrical release consistently drooling over the fact that Quentin Tarantino was bringing back the ""exploitation films of old"" that shaped his childhood.What I got was a snoozefest that was almost two hours long, interrupted once or twice with a spectacular scene. The movie opens up with a group of girlfriends that decide to go out for the night. An extremely long and drawn out conversation/drive to the bar (or was that supposed to be character development?) ensues until finally there is something to wake up for. It seems pretty little blonde Pam (Rose McGowan) needs a ride home, and Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) is only happy to oblige, once he's ready to go. Once they do leave, the conversation goes something like this:Stuntman Mike: Well, Pam... Which way you going, left or right? Pam: Right! Stuntman Mike: Oh, that's too bad... Pam: Why? Stuntman Mike: Because it was a fifty-fifty shot on whether you'd be going left or right. You see we're both going left. You could have just as easily been going left, too. And if that was the case...it would have been a while before you started getting scared. But since you're going the other way, I'm afraid you're gonna have to start getting scared... immediately! This conversation ultimately leads to a spectacular scene that is deserving of Tarantino's direction. I won't spoil it by going in to detail, as it's one of the only things worth seeing. The way he gets Pam to shut up was a nice touch, one that will make any guy think about changing out the seats in his ride.Now we move on to the second set of four beauties that Stuntman Mike gets to play with. But first, we must endure another pointlessly long interaction between the girls. Quite frankly, it has nothing to do with character development because knowing anything about the girls  in either of the groups  is irrelevant considering the climax of each scene. Does it matter what you know about them? Absolutely not. The only thing you need to know is that when you see Stuntman Mike, the monotony is going to be broken up. Kurt Russell was solid throughout, but loses points at the end. All I can say is, dude grow a pair!While the four girls in this final group decide to play a little revenge on 'ol Stuntman Mike, the remainder of this flick is just tired. Even the action scene with Zoe (Zoe Bell) didn't impress. I realize that Tarantino may have been following a formula from the past regarding the movies he idolized, but even a ""nod to the old school"" is lost on these segments. If this is what it was like sitting in theaters on a Saturday afternoon, I'm glad I missed them.But that isn't to say the whole movie is horrible. Tarantino did an outstanding job presenting all (other) aspects of an exploitation film  the grainy film, the bad edits, etc. The style he applied really gave Death Proof an authentic realism. Awesome job in pulling that off.He in fact did such an outstanding job making you believe you were watching of flick from so long ago that you immediately noticed little things  like when Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito) pulls out a cell phone and sends out a text message or another character mentions CGI special effects  that you think shouldn't be there.I can't say this was that great of a flick, and the one damaging factor was all the hype that surrounding the release. The movie definitely didn't live up to the hype. But still, rent it and see what you think.the zombie review . com",Death Proof
615,phantomfears,Steer Clear,1,16 September 2007,"This is by far and away the worst Tarantino film I have seen. An hour and a half or more (time begins to lose its meaning when watching this rubbish) and 95% of it is spent watching either group of 4 women ""having a laugh"" with each other. Basically this involves unrealistic swearing and dialogue which would have been slightly more believable had it been men saying the lines. There is a short break for a minute or two while the first group of women are killed. After another interminable fly on the wall peek at a further group dribbling on there is an attempt to kill them followed by them deciding to kill Kurt Russels character. This film is reminiscent of a 5 year old's first attempt inexplicably brought to life. Previously I would watch one of Tarantino's films without reading more into it. Now I would have to read some positive reviews. An hour and a half or so I will never get back.",Death Proof
616,jakob_rise,Tarantino's masterpiece,9,1 August 2007,"First of all: What a fantastic an complete movie. I'll start with the actors. Kurt Russell is the one of the most ironic characters ever. His ironic mirror to Snake Plissken Secondly: the girls. Perky, cool, sexy. Their dialogs are pure magic but they are true also. Style: The Movie is separated in two parts. Little movies at theirself. First the parody of the classical slasher movie, secondly the homage to classical 70's car movies. To support his homage to the trash cinema Tarantino uses intentional mistakes by using bad light and fore the trash cinema typical cuts. But what takes the movie so close to perfection? It's the music, the allusions and the ending. A grown up man plays around with his boy fantasy's. Absolutely great. Watch it. For everyone who does not like it. No problem, but i hope there will not be anyone. No CGI, simply vodka with sugar-free red-bull and an Italian vogue.",Death Proof

I really wanted to like the movie, but all the female characters were not likable, I could not care less what happened to them. The movie is basically just over an hour of non stop bad dialog that are not even funny and basically only one location. The only thing watchable about this movie is the good acting of Kurt Russell and Rose McGowan, but it is a very small part of the whole story. The most fun scene is when he kills her in the car and that lasts about only two minutes. Besides that there is nothing to see of any fun in this completely boring attempt to be kitschy.

Was this film below expectations? I do not think so. Tarantino wanted to do a film dedicated to his generation. We must respect this. He did great job making a film just like the b movies he loves with technical problems just like the grind-houses. But this is not the kind of style we loved in his movies. I prefer to believe that this movie is a break and nothing more. I believe that the next film of Tarantino must be considered as his next movie whenever make it. This was an another joke just like his previous co-directed film, From Dusk Till Dawn. I think that we must see this film like a b movie and nothing more.

620,bobbing-headz,Severely Disappointed,2,22 July 2008,"After watching this I can't help but think that Tarantino pretty much just blew it. Now I personally have not really seem much in the way of grindhouse films that serve as a base for this but I can say that this movie seems to have completely missed the park. I'm sure most people would say they don't like the slow pace and dialog. I actually am a fan of most Tarantino movies and this was probably the best part of the film for me. My problem was just that the movie really had no substance to it. Sure I can see that a lot of grindhouse films lacked on plot of stuff of that sort but this movie is just ridiculous. Essentially it's a bunch of almost disjointed scenes thrown together and called a film. The plot is beyond non-existent, I mean it's hard for me to enjoy the film when the characters are spontaneously doing things. Really all the film is is a way for Tarantino to pay some tribute to the grindhouse genre and throw in his trademark directing. What comes out isn't really a film.",Death Proof
621,he1008,QT: your train has left the station 15 years ago,1,26 October 2007,"Where can I begin? This was probably the worst movie I've watched in the last two years, and I've watched almost all main stream movies. There must be a special subset of population that this movie appealed to, hence the positive reviews, but to the general audience, this type of egoistical, self-exhortative exploitation only degrades QT's own image.Sure, this was supposed to be a 70s B-movie knock off that a subset of population can identify with, but can't QT at least be slightly imaginative and make it a better, not worse knock off? Besides the non-existent plot line and non-sensical, profanity-laced dialogue, the movie's delivered only one more thing: self promotion. QT probably expected his audience members to know everything about him - his movies, all characters in his movies, his favorite songs, his hobbies, his pet peeves, his personal assistant's name, his large chin - to be able to get the subtleties this movie delivered and thus transcend the experience they had when they watched a similar movie in an open-air theater sitting in a beat-up Dodge with their girlfriends with big hair-dos while sipping a thick shake served by teenagers on skates. Gosh, it must take someone with helluva lot of self tolerance to work for/with that guy.I've wasted 100 minutes of life watching this movie, but I'll sacrifice another 10 mins to warn you: please save your money and time, give it to the homeless if you want, but please don't give it to some egomaniac who's way past his original/productive/imaginative years so we can be fed with more of his garbage in the future.",Death Proof

It's like every film Tarantino has made since Pulp Fiction: An exercise in self admiration. Cheesy dialog interlaced and punctuated with racial, sexual epithets and profanity. I'm pretty sure the vocabulary of the cast is about one hundred words or less. Watching the movie is a laborious process. Thank God I have a kitchen to go to periodically. In a nut shell the movie approaches the quality of Plan 9 from Outer Space and then recedes away at light speed. Who would have thought that Edward D. Wood Jr. had a competitor.

I mean, it wasn't as if I expected a unimaginable super movie. I expect the movie to have a plot with an actual point, dialog that had actual meaning driving it. It was nothing but pointless conversations with a follow-up scene with action in it. Which was the only thing that received a ""star"" My and my brother both were bored out our minds waiting for something to actually give meaning to the film. I finally couldn't take it anymore and skipped through it just to see something entertaining. At the end of the movie I had felt like I had wasted my time watching a movie that purposely wanted to be boring. This is the first Quentin Taratino movie I didn't like.

624,red-rebecca,A Big Kahuna flop?,2,12 September 2007,"12/09/07 - I attended a pre-release viewing of this film last night at FACT in Liverpool, UK at which Quentin Tarantino was present. Now let me get one thing straight from the beginning, I have always been a dedicated Tarantino fan and have nearly all his films on DVD. I admire his ability to tell a story, use innovative cinematography, draw complex characters with depth and have dialogue which leaves me gasping. But 'Death Proof'....it was a complete disappointment.It looked like a fresher's film. The storyline was thin, the character development lacked depth, the dialogue was tedious and did nothing to move things on. Stylistically it lacked imagination (Tarantino is the Director of Cinematography for the first time). If you are looking for a repetition of the superb 'Kill Bill 1&2' or 'Jackie Brown' forget it. The first half of the film has been purposely treated post-production, according to Tarantino, to have poor image quality, scratches, deliberate mis-edits etc and is aggravating in the extreme.The self-referential links to his previous films by using things which are as he put it ""in my universe"" when he writes a script eg. Red Apples, Big Kahuna Burger etc were very tedious after a while. Using the same actors/ensembles has been a notable success in previous films, but when they re-appear as the same characters (James Parks as Sheriff Edgar McGraw & Michael Parks as Texas Ranger Earl McGraw -Kill Bill 1), it was almost as if he had nothing new to say.Having said all this the humour that the script contains was entertaining, the performance of Kurt Russell was the most outstanding and especial comment should be made about Zoe Bell, appearing as herself. The stunts that she performs toward the end of the film are truly awesome. Who needs CGI when there are true stars like her willing to risk her life to give us thrills!! Tarantino made it clear to us that the cut we were watching was the 'director's cut', half an hour longer than that released in the States and certainly the one he wanted. I have to say I would have appreciated half an hour less of this messy film. Or maybe I'm missing something somewhere?Comment has been made before about the violence in Tarantino's films and especially the feminist viewpoint on this. I have to say that for the first time I felt the violence, especially the final scene, was gratuitous and did not have the same style or relevance as seen in for instance 'Kill Bill 1&2' or the great 'Reservoir Dogs'. Whether the suggestion that the violence in this film directed toward women is a metaphor for rape I am undecided, but certainly it left me uncertain as to what Tarantino was trying to say. See it and come to your own conclusions. Please don't assume that the Tarantino label has to mean excellence on all occasions.",Death Proof
625,brynjus,It's your car,10,16 June 2007,"Don't listen to anything that may be bad about this movie. Ever since Tarantinos old classics (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill) people think that every movie is like that. Kill Bill was a modernized Grindhouse-film. It contained everything that Quentin liked when he was a kid. Now he is making it just like the 70's. Death Proof is authentic, brutal, fun and artistic. Any film-lover will be amazed. If you don't like this, then you simply don't get the Tarantino-style. This is a Car movie, a horror movie, and a quite soft soft core-porn movie. Exactly what i need these days. We got To Fast to Furious, all nitrous and babes in bikinis. But that's it. Death Proof are real stunts and all real. So any other car movie i see today is boring, but when i see death proof, i feel it in my stomach.Death Proof: Clearly a 10 of 10",Death Proof
626,martijn-van-dalen,90% boring 10% okay,2,1 September 2007,"i loved reservoir dogs and pulp fiction as much as the next man. Jacky Brown and Kill Bill on the other hand were very boring. And now this. I always watch a movie with an open mind. I see dozens of movies..hoping every time for that little movie that will rock my world. Unfortunately, most of them suck. And so does this one. I had never heard of grindhouse movies, but the concept sounds simpel yet great to me..action, violence and nudity! Well this movie is just boring my socks off.. It's like 50 minutes of girls talking trash. There are a these girls, and the think they're oh so tough and interesting. The talk F** this and F** that, trying to sound like they're the queens of the world, yet they all sound like stuck up whiny brats to me. Especially that Jungle Jill or something. She was super annoying. I don't know what Quentin was thinking, but i just couldn't find any sympathy for these 'protagonists'. In fact, i just wished the bad guy would stop holding out and kill them right now, to easy my suffering!! Then after this almost hour long torture, we finally get some action as Stuntman Mike finally gets busy killing the girls. That short scene was great, but not great enough to warrant all the boring stuff that proceeds it. But wait, it's not over yet ! We are introduced to yet another bunch of girls. And another hour of mindnumbing conversations, that goes nowhere. Its like some other reviewer here said: like listening to someones phonechat. Just idle chitchat thats not interesting at all. If you're looking for some *interesting* chitchat like in Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs...go watch those great movies again ! So again i was bored to tears..i ffwd a lot through this second half of the movie, so maybe i missed some mindblowing conversations. But i doubt it.. When all hope had faded though, you finally get awarded by another car chase. Its very nice and adrenaline pumping, but again a little too late. And what's even weirder is that Stuntman Mike is transformed into a little cry baby, while he was a super badass all the time before. I don't buy it.. Also it ends on a very adrupt note..the girls get the drop on Mike, start kicking his ass..and all of a sudden: THE END. What the...??Furthermore, i expected lots of action, violence and naked girls. Well, the action was okay, but very sparse. There was hardly any real violence at all (expected this to be gory as hell). And the naked girls..what naked girls ?? There were like 10 hot babes, but i did not see one piece of skin in the whole movie !! (but maybe i missed it, because i dozed off a lot of times because it was so boring). If you call it a grindhouse movie, then i expect to see an extreme movie, but i think i better go watch Robocop or Totall Recall again for those traits.........So, to conclude: is was like 90% boring fat and 10% kinda juicy meat.",Death Proof

I expected a raw film with cult classic potential and was not disappointed. This is something I'd buy and watch with the girls, cheering right up to the very end. The dialog was slow at times, pointless perhaps, but it was a semblance of a very normal day in the lives for these women, disrupted by a freaking lunatic. The 'Death proof' car was genius. First time I've ever seen a film where the killer uses their car with as much precision as he would a knife. Some parts are not for the squeamish, but the special effects were spectacular.

But i have to say, i am a bit disappointed. One of Tarantino's specialties is his way of making dialogues interesting to watch. Well, that doesn't mean that you should make a whole movie which is almost only about these dialogues. There has to be enough action in between the dialogues. I think that's the biggest fault of this movie, too much useless dialogues, and too little action.So that's why i rate this movie with only 5 out of 10 stars.Come on Tarantino, you can do better. Pulp fiction had a lot of strong dialogues, but these where followed by really hardcore action scenes. That's what makes it the best movie ever.

I can't believe the enthusiastic comments here or that such completely base film-making has such appeal. There is no intellectual level whatsoever. The humor is predictable, dull and unfunny and the characters are stereotyped and contrived. The black humor of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs has been replaced with unfunny sadistic violence and offensive sexism. The extent of the misogyny is scary.

With versatile actors and a top notch director I was sure to bag a winner on my television. However after the first very uninteresting half an hour I found myself wondering what it was I had subected myself to.In essence this film is just about a man who tries to kill a bunch of surly and frankly crude females with his 'deathproof' stunt car. Not even the clever kill bill themes running throughout the piece could save this screenplay from dying a most horrible and painful death.

632,everythingdie68,Atrocious,1,12 September 2007,"The film is just boring. From the outset the dialogue is terrible and none of the characters are interesting. Tarantino reverts to his usual style of having the cast say 'nigger' a lot so he can be controversial or outrageous. The story doesn't make much sense and his authentic grindhouse touches (scrathed film, abrupt cuts etc.) don't help make it more entertaining. He tries for a 1970s feel to a film that is obviously set in the 21st century and the effect does not work. His constant references to road movies such as Vanishing Point are misguided. Interestingly he is a friend of Monte Hellman who made Two-Lane Blacktop, one of the most boring road films in existence. Tarantino has outdone him with this. Tarantino talks a good film in some people's opinions, but this isn't anything like a good film. A total waste of time.",Death Proof

Well, human behavior will never stop to give me bad surprises, but neither I didn't hope the masses to think by themselves instead of just looking the director before making themselves a rational judgment. No surprise that they chose the leaders they have if they like this kind of movies. Anyway, I was told to expect an action movie with loads of chases, good old cars and 70's style; nothing intellectual but a good entertainment at least. Instead, I got a two hour boredom torture with less than 15 minutes of real action scenes. I have nothing against movies with many dialogs, on the contrary I like them when they are interesting, well written and interpreted. However, this horrid movie takes you inside a multiracial bunch of dirty, ugly, junkie and silly girls whose only goal is to get easy sex, loads of drugs and more alcohol. It's an insult to Tarantino's adult audience to portrait such a teeny and stupid girlie characters. Perhaps he made it this way because he only expected this kind of people to watch his movie. Well, we got two hours of brainless girlie talking and no more than 15 minutes of middling action because you know from the start that the second chase will end with the bad guy killed. I left the cinema with the feeling of being ripped-off and regretting myself by having let this movie to steal two hours of my life that would have been better even if I was dead. Had I gone alone, I would had ran away before the first 10 minutes. And, above all, what a bad taste, what a monstrous demonstration of teenage idiocy, what a disgusting portrait of women... Is that all you can think about, Quentin? Is there also a girl like those inside of you, perhaps? You won't swindle me again, I promise.

But alas it passes that point and you just wish you would die in your seat, if you haven't already left by this time. Then when some action does happen, it lasts for all of 2 minutes.

The story is pretty poor but suitable for a Grindhouse movie/road movie. Vanishing point referenced by Tarantino, quality film, this was a guy trying to get a car from A to B high on dope with a blind DJ helping him out, still a truly ace movie but crap story, same thing(plus I want that car!)

Tarantino trying too hard to be artistic. if he wanted to keep you guessing, he should have been more mystical about the car. the more i think about it, the more disappointed i am. the plot focused too much on cars than character development. no real explanation on what eventually happened. way too much left hanging. i loved the cars and the added color after the filming giving a good effect of cheesy seventies movies. pure quentin. should have spent more time with the background.",Death Proof

There isn't ANY and I bet they have forgotten it all five minutes after leaving the theatre. Tarantino is a magpie who 'borrows' from other films constantly.

With Death Proof, the dialogue just doesn't settle properly into the mouth of the actors - it just seems unnatural, like Tarantino was thinking about someone else, when writing the lines for each person. I really wouldn't have thought that I would think of his dialogue as boring, but there you go. I actually stopped watching the movie after the first 60 minutes and finished the next day, it was so boring. Now that I stop to think, that five stars that I gave the movie was maybe too much.The last 50 minutes of the movie were fortunately the better part. I would have thought that the talk would be the best part (which was 80% of the movie), but it wasn't. Well, I was sure hoping too much. The dialogue was mostly mind numbing. Surprisingly the best part of the movie is the overly long car chase scene. And it's _not_ masterly, it's not in the upper echelon of car chases (like Tarantino said he wanted it to be). Not by far. The car chase part is well done, but too long and too much of the same s...tuff.From someone who thinks Pulp Fiction is 10 star movie, this movie is a huge drop.

Some idiot who appears to be quite smooth with the three masculine ladies, but besides that, he is just some psychopath... interesting.

They do their job in the film perfectly well if you've never seen them before, but they add a cute half-smile to your lips if are familiar with them. All in all, a good watch.

Hopefully Tarantino gets back to whatever state of mind he was in before he made this film. I can fully understand that he gets problems with his fundings now.

You see a chic getting her face run off by a tire. You see a girl's leg hanging outside the passenger window get sliced in half by the force of impact. It flops on the ground, thigh, knee, foot. You see the grimy spit on Kurt Russel's greasy, stubbled chin while he slobbers all over nachos. You see him take Rose Mcgowan into his death proof car. And she is not the normal bad sexy girl we're used to. She's sweet. Child-like. Cute and gentle. Until her face is bashed into the dash and her nose breaks, and she grovels. Then she's not so great.

657,toobroke2004,Death Proof as a Thematic Felony (it was terrible.),1,9 June 2008,"This movie is terrible. It's not that I don't get its campy feel playing to an old cult style of film-making. It just doesn't work. The movie never advances toward a larger point, it has no meaning. Though the dialog is well written, it at times seems to be poorly acted or forced by the actors. The film is unnecessarily long. And Tarantino's recent work alludes to a somewhat creepy revelation in my book-- these days he seems to be making movies simply to cater to his own twisted fantasies. I honestly believe if he wasn't famous he'd be a sexual deviant. I am a huge fan of the Kill Bill series. But even that homage to viscera had an underlying theme, however trite and basic it was--revenge. Death Proof has no artistic merit in the sense that it does not have any point whatsoever. Some would say it, too, has a thematic element of revenge, but I would have to say that is a cop out. It is as if Tarantino envisioned Death Proof (along with its sister movie Planet Terror) as a means to visually recreate some sick fantasies that he could never get away with in real life. He spends so much time developing the characters, letting the audience get to know their inner workings, way too much time in my opinion (so much so it was like 'a day in the life of..'), only to climax by running over faces. How groundbreaking. I can see the appeal of this movie, and as a Tarantino fan, I was simply disappointed. I expected some of that intellectual profundity that he expressed so brilliantly in story lines such as 'Natural Born Killers.' Which I guess gets me to my main point. A superb and breathtaking film such as 'Natural Born Killers' only gets an average star rating of 6.9, yet the vapid 'Death Proof' walks away with 7.4 stars. Hmm.

In that time, even if it got good, it would still be a waste of my time and money. This is pure self-indulgent nonsense, and Rodriguez's own self-indulgent flick 'Planet Terror' shows just how far beyond QT Rodriguez is in his sustainable originality and ability to entertain.Just awful, very disappointing.PS, actually forced myself to finish watching it.

I was disappointed. The movie was cheaply made and it dragged on. I'll grant you that parts of Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill do drag on, however, there the result is good. Here, the result is pathetic. It does reminisce of other Tarantino films; it's split into two sections like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs; every car used is 'American Muscle', Dodges and Chevies, no Fords and Toyotas and Tarantino has a brief appearance in it. Ultimately, I gave this film a 4 out of 10 because some scenes were well made and frankly without perhaps 2 quality scenes, this movie becomes a conversation!

Female characters' expressions limited to surprised open mouths or valley girl sulky glares. The level of character maturity is par with teenager intelligence (cell phones and gossip). For better dialogue you might consider watching thirty consecutive tampon commercials... in Japanese... without the subtitles.I give this dead fish one sushi out of ten. (The sushi goes to Kurt).PS.

667,daniel_achtung_baby33,Death Proof: Better with the whole freakin' package!,9,31 July 2009,"First of all, let me say that Quentin Tarantino is one of my personal heroes (he's the reason I decided to attend film school). Having said that, I have to admit I was pretty disappointed when I saw the extended and unrated version of Death Proof. I Freakin' hated it. I thought it was one of the most boring and never-ending movies I had ever seen. It was a pretty hard thing for me to accept (I actually thought QT had gone mad). As if all of this isn't enough already, I also thought Planet Terror was better than Death Proof. But, despite all the above is true (I really went through all of that), I have recently seen the original theatrical version of GRINDHOUSE, and I am pleased to say that, in that particular context (where both features are shorter), Death Proof is a MASTERPIECE! it is so much better than Planet Terror. Tarantino did it again! He made a great movie! The only problem was he wanted to be at Cannes with his ""personal"" version of the film, for which he made it larger in both time and unnecessary scenes.In conclusion, Death Proof was originally conceived as the closing 90 minute feature for Grindhouse, and that's the way it should've been always. In this version all the dialogue makes perfect sense and timing, making it a delight for those of us who love Tarantino's talent for writing characters who have great background, a witty sense of humor and a balls- out perspective of things. Tarantino is great in this back-to-back analysis of the female psyche. Watch Death Proof. The theatrical version.",Death Proof

Kicking ass is never supposed to be a woman's job in a horror flick. You'll definitely hear some girl talk in this flick. There will be some banter, bickering, laughing, loving, intellectual conversations and downright irrational conversations. You know ""every day"" girl talk.

The rest of the movie dragged on and was full of trashy people and conversations. Story line could have been much better, and I didn't feel emotions towards any of the characters besides disgust/revolt for the wasted lives of these young people.

I replayed it over and over to see if I was hearing him correctly, and sadly I was...The movie can't hold a candle to the Vanishing Point or Bullitt, which hold a cherished spot on my shelf. The films that he was trying to pay tribute to have a very different feeling, and a different level of respect surrounds them as well. There was far to much use of bad language to give this movie anything but a trashy feel. The director I think might fit in nicely with the trashy, filth uttering characters he creates.

670,my_wet_pants,Too dialogue heavy with little attention to character development,6,1 February 2008,"my vocabulary does not stretch to that of other commenter views, but i will try to lay some simple views for intelligent readers. i could not agree more with Max_cinefilo89's comments. The classic dialogue-heavy tarrantino script we have become used to is very much present in this feature and seems to lend nothing more than length to what could have been another Quentin classic. Tarantino is renowned for his ability to dissect even the most simple of pop culture conversation through the use of general banter between his central characters. The problem here is that the film is shared amongst two sets of main characters, in none of whoms dialogues do you learn anything other than their vocation. i came to care nothing for said characters as i knew very little about them. There are some extremely well executed car chase sense (in some of which i came to wonder how some of the cast were'nt injured), and kurt russel did play his psychotic stunt man part very well.i feel this film simply lacked in depth. a lot of dialogue time could have been spent on character development which may have lent to more sympathetic feelings of certain untimely deaths.One thing that should be noted is that i know little about ""Grindhouse"" style cinema so may be taking this review out of context.overall i am disappointed (as i was with kill bill vol.2) but still look forward to seeing ""Planet Terror"" as to complete the Grindhouse experience)",Death Proof

This film should have been three quarters of an hour long but has been filled out by stilted, excessive dialogue - especially in the second 'half' - which detracted from the story. Also (and this bothers me about a lot of films) why, when given obvious alternatives does a character always pick the less plausible one. This is a ploy of B movie writers - not an A lister like QT. Why not, when being broadsided by a maniacal driver and a serious risk of death ensues, just slow down and stop. The only reason should be that they can't, anything else and it's just sloppy writing. While I'm on the subject of QT, the film jumps from 70's style (complete with added on defects in the 'film stock' and deliberately poor editing), to black and white, then back to colour - it's irritating and frustrating in equal measure. This film feels experimental, and not successfully. I watched it all the way through but my finger permanently hovered over the fast forward button.

Coming from a classic car enthusiast, with the opinion that the right movie can immortalize these amazing machines, I must say this is not ""the right movie"". This film is an embarrassment to the muscle cars it destroyed, and to think it was given seven stars is a sincere disappointment.Quentin Tarantino was apparently trying to create a tribute to the classic muscle car films, but instead made a garbage movie where nearly the entire dialog was the ""f"" word. To top it all off, I actually wanted to fast forward through more than half the movie to get to some action, this movie could have been 30 minutes long if you cut out the filler (this comes from some one who enjoys nearly every film he watches).

673,TheBebop2071,Wasted on 2007's movie-goers,9,10 July 2011,"Death Proof is another gift to audiences around the world from the ever gifted Quentin Tarantino. This man has an uncanny knack for ingeniously unraveling his stories and characters-- and oh are they characters! Especially Stuntman Mike, delightfully portrayed by film veteran Kurt Russell. Just like anyone who knows Tarantino's work, there's everything from laughs to brutal stuns, and always a cool wit that's lost on no one with half a brain. But that's just the predicament with this one; that is, in an era when movies as terrible and brainless as Transformers and Twilight are the box office toppers, the American audiences of 2007 circa are in fact brainless-- the majority of them, anyways. Because of this little failing (not the movie's fault, I might add) Tarantino's trademark attributes are wasted on many of today's movie-goers, who don't appreciate the fine art of dialogue (which Tarantino absolutely excels at) or any sort of gradual development of anything. Granted, his craft isn't anywhere near its most ambitious on this outing, but that's because it's simply an homage to cheap, lurid exploitation of the 70's, particularly slasher flicks and car chase thrillers. Those flicks are a bit of a guilty pleasure for me, and even though in Death Proof they are honored nicely, it's not much of a surprise that Tarantino transcends them in many different ways. Of course, leave it to half of us not to realize just exactly what it is that he's doing here, and the other half of us to not have the patience or attention span to listen to three lines of dialogue without any explosions or zombie attacks. Yes, that's right, I'm referring to Planet Terror, Death Proof's bosom buddy in the double feature entitled Grindhouse, which, even though was a nice way to spend an hour and a half shutting the brain completely off and enjoying nothing but pure cheesiness and CGI exploding puss, it's still nowhere on par with the deft craft of Death Proof. In fact, Rodriguez seems to be making more of a grindhouse parody, whereas Tarantino is doing a more sincere homage. It's no small wonder that movie-goers took more to Planet Terror, given that being desensitized from film-making by a decade of nothing but crap, it's right up their alley.And this is yet another problem for Death Proof. It would have been received better had it been the first of the double feature, so that the audience, after seeing something a bit more rooted in reality like Death Proof, would roll their eyes at Planet Terror's lazy absurdity. But instead, Planet Terror is the first in the installment. And once it has managed to undermine any need for the audience's patience or ear for dialogue, and brought them right into their comfy confines of being content with silly (I might even dare say idiotic) action sequences that hop around boorishly without much more story development, that's precisely when Death Proof comes along; just after the zombies have scooped all their brains clear out of their skulls; just in time to try to entertain a room of pretentious stooges. Lo and behold, the stooges think there is too much talking, not enough wall-to-wall gore, and disappointment(even annoyance) sets in when they realize that a go-go dancer won't be launching herself into the air with her machine-gun leg to take out a whole battalion of soldiers in one foul swoop. Then they have the unmitigated gall to brutally criticize Mr. Tarantino. Seriously?! After all the good he has done for film-making? Of course they wouldn't even realize that he actually lifted movies into a higher level with the shear brilliance of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction (one of the most important films of modern cinema). Where's the respect?One thing I've learned from the response to Death Proof is: Never underestimate movie audiences' stupidity. I blame it on Michael Bay and all the talentless hacks like him, who send their robots, vampires, teenage wizards, and CGI monsters to lobotomize society. Bottom line: a gift of a film, but wasted on ignorant and ungrateful recipients.",Death Proof
674,nikibrodin,One of the best modern revenge stories,10,28 October 2017,"In my opinion this is one of the best modern revenge stories. Although it has a totally different style, in my opinion it is up there with Old Boy and Lady Vengeance. But even if you are not into revenge stories, I would still recommend it for the way it is shot, the dialogue, and the actor and actresses. Zoe Bell (who is one of my favorite actresses), Rosario Dawson and Kurt Russell all do a fantastic job in this movie. All in all, it is a great movie. 10/10. Just see it goddammit! :)",Death Proof
675,edilf5577,Great movie with lots of haters.,8,20 September 2011,"Before I start this, I need to get something off my chest. I have been reading the reviews of this movie and a majority of the people don't like this movie. I can see why people would think that. In my opinion Tarantino is a filmmaker to the highest, but of course that's my opinion. The problem is it seems that people are bashing the movie because of dialogue. Now because everyone is watching mindless violence (Including me) that most people get bored the second that someone reaches the ten minute mark while talking.Anyway, on to the review. Kurt Russell stars as ""Stuntman Mike"", a guy how stalks hot chicks and then uses his car as his murder weapon of choice to kill them. To movie follows his two latest groups. The first group consists of ""Arlene, Jungle Julia, Shanna, and Pam"". The first 45 minutes have them going from this bar to that until Mike shows up. Then after a lap dance, Mike takes Pam home, which means he killed her, followed by the other 4.Alright, I know I did a bunch of jumping ahead. But that's because the first 45 minutes is dialogue. So that's my first warning. It's not a con, but it's hard to do a review for a movie like this.Back to the main point, so 14 months later he finds himself going after yet another group of girls. This time around it's ""Zoe, Kim, Lee, and Abernathy"". After a few more conversations, there is a epic twenty minute chase scene where Mike gets his behind kicked. It ends with Abernathy putting a cowgirl boot in his head.So for cons, the only one is some useless scenes. The first one is right between the transition between one group to the next where you see stuntman mike in the hospital. The other one is some random part where Abernathy goes to the ""Circle A"". There, the clerk talks about her getting that months issue of some fashion magazine. What do these have to do with a crazy stuntman? Well, that's it. This is my first review so sorry if it's bad. So, watch this movie. You'll love it(Hopefully).",Death Proof
676,amruger,Senseless chiller with great music and an excellent Kurt Russell,7,25 July 2007,"The movie was better than I had expected (I had read a lot of mediocre critics before). First of all, the music and the choreographed parts are great! Kurt Russell really steals the show. I personally didn't like most of the actresses (e.g. Zoe is an awful actress who should stay at being a stuntwoman). Tarantino's appearance was okay (there is nothing to complain about). The movie is full of chilling scenes and comical ideas. Sometimes it drags on (mainly due to the excessive dialogues) and it's getting self-pleasing. Instead I would have preferred to see more of Stuntman Mike who should have been the undisputed centre of the movie. The grindhouse gimmicks with wrong cuts went on my nerves on occasion. In addition Tarantino's self-references (e.g. the dialogue about the director who sleeps with a double = Zoe) are blatant attempts to create a certain ego cult attitude. I think that's a bad sign for a director. Does he have any complexes because of the fear not to be loved anymore? - The end is hilarious and compensates for the weak points (e.g. Tarantino shamelessly shows his love for Zoe and glorifies her. He also gives indirect advices to women who want to be his girlfriend: make him horny. Could this be the reason why he made this movie? How embarrassing!). All in all the movie is senseless but entertaining and could better if cut to 80-90 minutes (get rid of unnecessary dialogues, Tarantino!).",Death Proof
677,johnwoodside1,Worth watching....half of it,5,6 August 2013,"I thought this film started out promisingly. It ticked all the right boxes for a classic Tarantino film with its dark, quirky, yet intriguing plot. This lasted until the middle of the film, at which point I found myself utterly disinterested in the rest of the story while harbouring a growing hatred for every character on screen. After enjoying the exposition I was very disappointed at how suddenly the plot fell apart and the signature Tarantino 'long-dialogue' scenes actually turned about to be boring, aimless drivel. I've given it half marks for the half I enjoyed, which is probably generous for a film that, mid-way through, has you eagerly anticipating the end credits.",Death Proof

680,tigeriffic6884,Oh My Goodness!!!,1,31 December 2007,"I'm still in disbelief that a filmmaker with the talent of Tarentino made such an awful, awful movie. I sat there most of the second half of this film with my mouth agape at the horrible dialogue, boring un-witty conversation that this movie provided. I refuse to believe this was the same person responsible for ""Pulp Fiction"". The first half of the movie was somewhat watchable, but the female characters were so annoying, you just wanted someone, anyone to kill them, and not in a nice way. The female characters in the second half were even more annoying, but you knew they weren't going to be killed, although you could hold out hope. I've seen over 2200 movies in my life, and this may just be the worst. I stuck up for Tarentino with his silly ""Kill Bill"" nonsense, but this one went to far. I think the guy either wants to be a woman, or a black man. I wish he'd just have the operation and get it over with. What looked to be a nice homage to the drive-in flick, turned into another ""woman gets revenge on the bad man"" movie. It was like watching a TV movie on ""Lifetime"", or maybe an episode of ""Law and Order:SUV"". Kudos, however to.....Russell, who's part was way to small, but made the best of it..and McGowan, who was the only female character that didn't seem like a cartoon.",Death Proof

Why would I want to see a bunch of girls beat up the only good character in the movie. Maybe if the girls had a single redeemable quality to them and weren't just a bunch of retards who talked about a bunch of inane crap the whole movie, you would want to root for them at the end to get back at Mike, but, again, his character was at least interesting, so why would I want him to get his due? And, that Zoe chick couldn't act for ANYTHING - it was no surprise that she usually does just stunts in movies and doesn't act. And I don't believe for a second I have to understand the whole Grindhouse movie concept to really ""appreciate"" this movie - B. S. !!! People do homages to crappy ""B"" movies all the time and made them watchable - this was not! I won't even tell someone to watch this movie out of morbid curiosity of how bad it really is.

682,pappa-phil,Tarantino careers off the road...(don't tell me i don't get it)...,1,25 September 2007,"I was a little dubious about seeing this out of context of 'Grindhouse' as i figured, despite what the greedy distributors might think, it would make less sense and the idea as a whole would work better in Europe, particularly after we've been waiting for so long. It started off brilliantly, style wise the whole seventies exploitation flick look was there and executed fantastically (the scratches, the jump cuts, the poor continuity) and worked better than i expected as it successfully walked the difficult tightrope between homage and parody. Then the talking started. I don't want to labour the point about the dialogue but feel i have to as it is painful. Tarantino has never been able to write for women. Far and away the worst scenes in terms of dialogue in Pulp Fiction are those involving women. The Uma Thurman scenes with Travolta are ham fisted attempts at fantasy chemistry, how a teenager might practise talking to a high school crush in front of a mirror. In Reservoir Dogs one of the only women characters that doesn't get shot was cut from the final film. In fact all of his original work aside from Kill Bill is male based, but even the Bride is merely an action revenge figure in female form so the scripting here would have worked either way. With that in mind what made him think him he could pull off a two hour movie with 8 women talking incessantly all the way through it? Worst still amongst all the talk Tarantino self references his own films in it, even when he's doing one of his useless cameos he references Pulp Fiction! I know he's made a career out of this but in previous films most of the dialogue was in short snappy burst with outside views on mass pop culture and it was charmingly woven into strong individual characters that moved the plot and story along. Quentin has got to the point now where it's clear when HE is talking through the characters to put across a personal point of view or about his knowledge of obscure trash Americana from yesteryear. This is all laced with his wet dream on how he thinks women talk when he's not around. Here one woman is much the same as the other and by the time a brief anti-climax comes along involving Kurt Russell i want them all to die! When Stuntman Mike does finally appear it's good but too brief, in fact it's a cameo role. I understand that there's no explanation for his actions, there doesn't need to be, it's supposed to be exploitation. But, without wanting to sound like a sadist, if it is supposed to be exploitation then where was it? These films were supposed to be a retro study of the cheap drive-in extreme cinema of the seventies, OTT comic book violence and unrealistic set pieces. There's more sex and violence in Bourne than in this! If the movie had kicked into overdrive as i expected after that point i could have perhaps forgiven the poor exposition. But from there we have another cameo from Russell who disappears until the end, a clean up of the reel and 4 more women, impossibly more annoying than the last. This again allows Tarantino to put words in their mouth so he can have a conversation with himself about his favourite muscle car movies for another hour. When Russell does pop up again for the final pursuit he's inexplicably turned into a groveling whining bitch. Then it ends.There's a popular lazy argument on IMDb lately that if you don't like a film you don't 'get it'. Don't tell me i don't get it. I get the retribution, i get the elongated build up, i get the missing and throw away characters, i get the metaphoric idea of women screwing Stuntman Mike with a car, i get (and liked) the abrupt ending etc etc. And I like Tarantino, but this is not good, not good at all. Sure there's a couple of genius strokes (the four view death, the reverse hospital set, the fact that there is no CGI) and Tarantinos perfect use of popular music is, as ever, outstanding, on par with if not better than the original master of this skill Scorsese. But it's not enough to make this worth seeing. Buy the soudtrack, put that on and listen to your girlfriend chat with her friends on speaker phone, at least the conversation will be more realistic.Any film, no matter who is involved in the making of it, that causes you to drift off while you're watching or can't hold your attention is poor. Even at the 'Grindhouse' 90 minute mark it would still have been 10 minutes too long and it's a shame it's been taken out of it's context and elongated to it's detriment. If you want real Grindhouse get some originals or see 'Devils Rejects' or 'House of 1000 Corpses' as Rob Zombie seems to have done this already to much better much more extreme effect...and with a retro twist.usprod@gmail.com",Death Proof
683,samnalexander,Underrated but not for everyone,7,1 April 2013,"This is definitely not a masterpiece but how anyone can find it awful I don't understand. Tarantino shows his skill as a story-teller once again in this action-packed B-movie adventure. It is funny, entertaining and engaging from beginning to end. I never felt that the dialog dragged as so many do, and an hour in I started wishing the film to last longer than it did. The principle characters are a bunch of girls hanging out and being stalked by a psychopathic killer who uses his car to bash girls to pieces. After an excellently-paced build-up, he strikes down the first batch, and it is glorious! With blood spattering, feet flying and faces being ripped apart in typical Tarantino fashion, Stuntman Mike is built up as a villain as endearing and despicable as Elle Driver of Kill Bill, bouncing back from the accident and moving on to the next batch of ""innocent victims"", who are tougher and hardier than the last lot. The film's darkest and most cringe-worthy moment comes as the girls persuade Redneck Jasper to let them take his car for a spin, by leaving an innocent and exhausted friend at his disposal. Observant viewers will recognize Jasper in Kill Bill, having his tongue bitten off as punishment for an attempted rape. The naive cheerleader exits the film with a dramatic gulp, and this is nastily distracting throughout the rest of the movie, her fate never being revealed. Low on morals but high on excitement, this is nowhere near Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but it is a thrilling and clever homage and deserves more credit than it gets.",Death Proof

Its musical equivalent would be The Beatles re-forming and making an album of Herman Hermit's Greatest Hits, i.e. horrible and pointless. There is very little plot, the dialogue is laughably bad and moreover this film is terribly slow. Tarantino seems to have lost all sense of pace, or how to retain the viewers interest. Is this the man that made ""Pulp Fiction""? In the extras section of the DVD disc, Tarantino cites the Australian ""Mad Max"" movies as an influence. This film doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as those films, in terms of story, plot or sheer excitement. And who the hell are ""Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, ""Mitch"" and Tich""?

All that requires is that you actually like watching movies and you don't want it to go faster.Tarantino makes very long dialogue scenes so he can enhance the payoff of every feeling, when you have heard a group of people talk for a long time you feel part of you group, when they are threatened you feel threatened and so on.If you liked any of his other movies and you don't have the attention span of a 14 year old you will like this movie, I guarantee it!",Death Proof

I've never seen a Grindhouse movie, but Death Proof has a gritty feel that could be the low-budget stuff he wanted to imitate. A lot of the dialogue is interesting and kitchy. You might even say it's vintage Tarantino. The problem is that it doesn't do anything besides sound snappy. It doesn't flesh out the characters, so you don't care what happens to them. Any of them. It certainly doesn't advance the plot, which means that after a few minutes, the movie stagnates and then just drags on until the next action sequence. There is, however, a way to enjoy Death Proof. First, read the following sentence: ""Kurt Russell plays Stuntman Mike, who is a sociopath who stalks women before he kills them with his car."" This is all you need to know about the first half, so jump to Chapter 16 on the DVD. Yes, you'll skip the first half of the movie, but the second half is a repeat of the first, so you're not really missing anything.

Hear me out before dismissing this theory. First off, let's look at the inane amount of foot-shots in the film. It's common knowledge that Tarantino has a foot fetish, so that's just one of the things adding to the pornographic. However, this alone could only leave Tarantino chubbing, let's go on shall we? Now we visit the fact that all of the dialog in this movie was either referencing or directly based on Tarantino's previous work. The entire scene where the girls are sitting around the table is obviously a long-winded poor replication of the classic dinner scene in Reservoir Dogs. Two of the girls have the same basic conversation you get between Travolta and Jackson in Pulp Fiction, and there are so many references to his previous works littered throughout this mess of an action movie that you can't help but notice it's a movie jerking Tarantino off the whole time.Even the ending is essentially saying, ""You were waiting for this movie to have a point, well here's the ending...

The Action I wont give to much away but the action shown on camera was very well captured and it had me on the edge of my seat!! 4. The music It went well with the film and gave it atmosphere to the 70's look Now the bad...1. The DialogueThe dialogue in the film went on for too long and I looked at my watch every five minutes. I understand that character development is important and Tarantino likes it in his films (Jackie Brown anyone??) but this just got boring and I was hoping for a little more action. I also thought that the dialogue was very repetitive, most of it was girl talk which got boring (it was okay up to a point)2. The Grind House EffectWe didn't get the full Grind house effect over here in the UK, which I was annoyed about but never mind. I think it would of been a more memorable experience if planet terror and the trailers were includedVerdict If Taratino would of put less dialogue in it(I think he had to make it longer for the release, so fair enough) and more action, I would of loved it.

This is a film that cannot be placed in one specific category. Its a mix of slasher film (e.g. Friday The 13th), car chase film (e.g. Vanishing Point), girl gang film (e.g. Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!) and one of QTs most favorite subgenres: the hangout film (e.g. Dazed and Confused). Add to the mix some Southern seasoning, a shot of chantreuse and you will begin to get an idea of what Death Proof is like. Tarantino was initially inspired to make this film from watching his favorite 70s/80s Slasher Films but being a post modern filmmaker and genre re-inventor, he decided to go somewhere else entirely with the standard ""hack em up in a row"" storyline. Tarantino also did with Kurt Russell in Death Proof what Sergio Leone did with Henry Fonda in Once Upon a Time in The West. He took someone that was known for being the blue eyed All American good guy in movies and turned him into a cold blooded psychopathic killer. The ambiguity of those kinds of characters is what makes them so great to me. As most of us know, real killers aren't frankensteins wearing hockey masks, they're the (seemingly) normal guys that live next door. Thats who Stuntman Mike is. Also, when he turns into a crying baby at the end, its just who he really is inside. The whole cool ""Stuntman Mike"" monster character is the front which hides the twisted, frightened being. Its very realistic. Its also part of the traditional slasher film formula in which the Final Girl (or Final Girls in this case) rise up and take out the killer who has been preying on their victims. Its both following the genre rules and making it cooler/expanding on it by having it be a girl gang instead of just one Final Girl (like in Halloween, Friday The 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street). On another level I think Tarantino was sort of poking fun at the tough guy type characters (like Russell plays) in movies. He is really saying that regardless of how tough men are, women can *beep* them up just as bad as another man (a theme he's been interested in since True Romance). I loved it, I grew up seeing every kind of tough guy movie out there and it was very refreshing to me. Death Proof is an amalgam of not only the slasher film/car chase film/girl gang exploitation films, its also bringing in ideas from the Asian kung fu & samurai films which often had females (Deadly China Doll, Deep Thrust, Lady Snowblood, Female Convict Scorpion) as the main heroes. Thats the reason why QT threw in the trademark triumphant Shaw Brothers style kung fu freeze frame/music sting at the end. Many people have complained about Tarantino putting too much dialogue in this film, (ironically, many complained that there wasn't enough in Kill Bill!) but I found that it was actually some of his best work as a screenwriter. There is a different type of Tarantino dialogue in this film, mainly because we are listening to women speak to each other for most of the running time. Instead of male oriented subject matter (like we heard a lot in Dogs) we hear what women talk about when they're in the car or at a diner. It is still the poetic, quirky, comedic dialogue we know Tarantino for, but it is written through a female perspective. I found it to be really refreshing and a departure for Tarantino as a screenwriter.Death Proof was also made to play and look like a true Grindhouse style film as well. Its a genuine ""Frankenstein print"" as QT calls it, which means every reel is in a different state of quality. One reel may be faded and contain editing errors, the next may be in black and white (a common occurrence in the Grindhouse era) and another reel may be a pristine IB Tech print (the crown jewel of celluloid cinema). A lot of the ideas and concepts in Death Proof may be overlooked and/or misunderstood on first viewing but being a longtime Tarantino fan, I know for a fact that his attention to detail is not up for question. He has a precise idea what he wants in his films and he did an amazing job creating the world come alive inside Death Proof. From the dialogue to the use of music to the cinematography to the action, QT has a unique eye and ear for cinematic storytelling. He has proved once again that regardless of genre (or subgenre), he can keep the same kind of high falutin' energy and brilliance as he did with his early crime based films.You can always tell that Tarantino does not make movies to have the images glaze over peoples eyes and not touch them in some way. He makes movies for people like him who really love them and who want to invest time in his cinematic worlds while seeing something new and offbeat each time out. If you watch Death Proof and let yourself get into it, you will surely have a wild, entertaining film experience, guaranteed.",Death Proof
700,Cosmic-Monkey,Absolutely Abysmal Film,2,29 February 2008,"1/3/2008How this movie has a current rating of 7.4 is unbelievable?!?! Long conversations between groups of people, that's all this film is about. What makes it worse is that these conversations are BORING! Which in return, makes the film PATHETICALLY BORING!Can I suggest to people who are contemplating watching this movie to go to a café or pub instead, sit next to a group of people and deliberately eavesdrop on their conversation, then drive home as fast as you can. You will find this experience to be very similar to the film but much, much more enjoyable and entertaining! Disclaimer: Don't drink and drive!This film only has a high rating because it was made by Tarantino. If it was made by any other director it would score way below 5. Obviously this is theoretical, I could never prove it, but the point I'm trying to make is that it seems that Tarantino can do no wrong in some peoples minds. Well he certainly has done wrong with this!I would have given this film 1/10 but the car chase was extremely good (the only good thing about it to be honest) so I give it 2/10Avoid at all costs!!",Death Proof
701,sbcara,Fantastic movie!,9,21 April 2018,"You people are crazy who are giving this such a low review. This is cinema classic - fantastic, witty dialog, lots of humor, two amazing action scenes, one consisting of an outstanding car stunt that always gives me chills in the stomach, and a great ""women's revenge"" ending. I could watch this anywhere, any time and be thoroughly entertained. This movie has two distinct halves to it, and both are great. But you have to enjoy the buildup of we'll crafted dialogue. If all you want is mindless crap, don't watch a Tarantino movie.",Death Proof
702,sturno55,Stop,1,9 March 2008,"****SPOILER ALERT****If you read this far you have wasted too much time on this movie. Quent, please either give it up or grow your balls back. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen and no I am not just saying that. I have seen some tankers before but this one truly takes the cake. It disappoints on every single level. All the characters stink and the dialog is absolutely terrible and at some points truly hard to watch without cringing. Mike the stuntman was the only character who had anything going for for him and he completely sells out in the end. His name should be Mike the Pussy. Avoid Like The Plague!!!! I want my 2 hours back!!!!!!!",Death Proof
703,martinsnd,"""The weakest Tarantino movie""",7,23 March 2018,"The movie pays tribute to the 80's B-movies and muscle car films like Bullit and Vanishing Point (Which are referenced in the movie). It is very well shot and the soundtrack blends very nicely with the scenes, something that Tarantino does pretty well in his movies. The movie lacks of that amazing and interesting dialogue that we are used to in Tarantino's films. It might be the weakest tarantino movie but still is a very good movie.",Death Proof
704,drivenbyseclusion,One of my best movie experiences,10,7 June 2007,"Death proof is a masterpiece in its own right, so many different and great concepts in this movie its hard to begin my review. I'll start off with kurt russell ""cult icon"". It was so awesome witnessing the revival of the legendary kurt russell. Kurt russell plays the anti-hero once again in the first half of the film, putting the bad in bad a** as the psycho killer stuntman mike that uses his death proof car as his weapon of choice. This concept alone made the movie for me.In the second half of the movie we see russell's character go through a vast transformation. Tarantino creates a character that is possibly one of the coolest bada**es in cinema and turns him into a complete p*ssy. The idea is just so amazing and the pay off at the end was just genius. Russell truly gives one of his best performances in death proof and creates yet again an awesome cult character.I think some of the reasons that people had a problem with death proof to begin with was its rhythmic pattern. while Rodriguez's planet terror had more of a consistency with its fast paced action, Tarantino chose to rather build up his momentum than to evenly distribute it. Death proof hits you out of nowhere with its action sequences and when it does its well worth the wait. The first action sequence that takes place with the first set of women alone packs as much punch as rodriguez's entire movie.Death Proof was one of the best experiences i've had at the movies so i give it a 10 out of 10.",Death Proof
705,ebonyway,Quentin is amazing.,10,26 March 2020,"Instantly became one of my favorites! This is my first time seeing this movie this year! 2020, and I can't believe it. I fell inlove with this the first set of girls they were all so beautiful and I just can't believe he did that to them wow I was in complete shock when the accident happen it was literally no way out of that smh. But when he got to the second set of girls they let him have it! I loved the Challenger so much!",Death Proof
706,wilson-samanthalynn,Not bad.. but not good either,4,20 February 2008,"I love the old B movies. I enjoy the cheese factor and needless violence. I understand that Tarantino was attempting to pay homage to the great B movies of the 70s and 80s, in my opinion he failed. Here is why: First of all, I really thought it was set in the 70s at first. The way it was filmed and the dialog seemed pretty right on for that time. When Jungle Julia whipped out her cell phone and started texting people I quickly realized that it was NOT the 70s. That really disappointed me, because it seemed authentic at up until that point. So I figured, there must be some reason for the text messaging right? NO! There wasn't. I don't know if there were scenes that were cut, but it added NOTHING to the story. It actually seemed out of place. Totally pointless.Now I don't mind dialog driven films.. sometimes they do more than special effects laden films. All I want is some coherent dialog. Not too much to ask for is it? First of all, it seemed really forced. I'm not going to say the actresses were bad, just that they didn't seem to get the concept. Again, let me state that I do love those old B horror films. With the inane dialog that is pretty much just filler until you get to the gore scenes. In this film it wasn't even B movie standard filler. It was more like D movie. Actually, you know what it reminds me of is porno dialog. That's how bad it was.I did enjoy seeing Kurt Russell as a psycho though. That was great casting right there. I do wish they had delved a little deeper into his character. Why did he choose these particular girls? How long had he been watching them? Was he really a stuntman or did he just use that as an explanation for his pimp car? Obviously he was a serial killer, as he went on to TN after he killed the girls in Texas. I would have liked to see more about him.The second part of the movie, set in TN was probably the worst part. These girls just ditched their friend with a creepy hillbilly and took his car. Then they act like total idiots by riding on the hood of the car. OK, fair enough. The two girls were supposed to be stunt junkies in films. Then Stuntman Mike comes and starts ramming the car they are test driving. One question: If you had a friend on the hood of the car and some guy started ramming you, when he got up next to them why did they speed up? Wouldn't a normal person slow down and stop, get the friend safely back in the car and then continue on? There a few times in that chase scene that they could have actually done that, but she just kept speeding up. I know that was to build suspense and make the viewer wonder if they will survive or not, but c'mon.After they finally kill Mike the movie ends with them cheering at the side of the road. WTF? Seriously? They killed him. They weren't THAT badass to begin with. One was a makeup artist the other two were just stunt chicks on films. If they had been really tough like the women in Sin City then I could believe them beating Mike to a pulp and ultimately killing him. They just weren't tough enough for me. It seemed totally out of character for them to chase him down and actually follow through with murdering him. I could see bashing up his sweet car but that's about it. Maybe if they had been biker chicks or something? Not women who work in the film industry.That being said, I was really disappointed in this movie. Not nearly as good as it looked in the previews. Ya know how the B movies usually throw a little sick humor in? I got none. They usually throw in buckets and buckets of gore. I got very little. The coolest gore scene was the girl who gave the lap dance dying. That was about it. I don't really see how this movie was paying tribute to those cheesy movies of the past at all. The basic idea was good, just very poorly executed. It's almost as if he made this film, then realized it sucked and decided to call it an ""homage"" to the bad cinema of old times. My final opinion on it: FAIL",Death Proof
707,evgeny_malo,Very dull!,2,22 September 2007,"This movie was a huge disappointment for me. The only part of the movie that was worth filming was when stuntman killed those silly skanks with his deathproof car.I don't know who in their right mind would film the rest of the scenes. I can get a better dialogue in a grocery store. I can get better looking girls in a public library. This movie is for stuck-up, fake girls who love girl-talk, and girl-power. Kurt Russell was definitely out of his element. I thought he was pressing in his role. He got smashed and beat up by 3 disturbingly boring girls and that was the end of the movie. So you get 55 minutes of girl talk among 4 girls. 1 minute car chase and they all die to pieces. You get another 55 minutes of girl talk, 10 minutes car chase after which stuntman Kurt is beat up and down by a bunch of girls who want to participate in a pornofilm about cheerleaders.",Death Proof
708,amy-read,It's just different,8,24 September 2007,"I thought that Death Proof was just using a different format to most films which is good to see because so many people stick to the well trodden path. The stunt woman who played herself, Zoe, was absolutely amazing in those stunts. And I suppose its not meant to be taken seriously, so I thought it was a good snippet of entertainment. There were lines later in the film which took you back to something said earlier on and little intricacies that were funny. The girls were obnoxious which in this case is good, because they weren't fluffing around being helpless and blonde. And of course like any Tarrantino film the score was amazing. Some real good music.",Death Proof
