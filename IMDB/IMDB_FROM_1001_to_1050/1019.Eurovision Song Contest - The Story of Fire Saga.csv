0,MartinHafer,Not really a comedy...but well worth seeing.,8,28 June 2020,"Although this IS a Will Ferrell film, do not watch ""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga"" thinking it will be anything like ""Talladega Nights"" or ""Anchorman"". In fact, I would go so far as to say I wouldn't even consider it a comedy...though it has some comedic portions. Instead, it's a strange tribute to Eurovision from some folks who seem to understand and love it.Now this MIGHT mean that the best audience for this movie are Europeans and folks from a few other countries that also compete in the competition (such as Israel, Turkey and Australia). After all, few Americans (apart from me and a few other strange folks) watch Eurovision or even know what it is or how it's conducted! But, if you don't know about it, you might still enjoy it...who knows?As far as the movie goes, it is the fictional story about Lars and Sigrit (Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams)...a singing duo who, frankly, don't seem very good. But through an odd set of circumstances, they find themselves the Icelandic entry into Eurovision!! Do they stand a prayer? Probably not...but the film is about them and how they manage to salvage some dignity out of this!What really helps this story is that so many Eurovision winners and famous competitors appear in the film. Additionally, they must have gotten permission to use the name, bumper music and more...making the film look and sound exactly like Eurovision!Overall, a wonderful and enjoyable film for anyone who loves Eurovision...and a mildly enjoyable movie for anyone else.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1,Prismark10,Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,6,13 July 2020,"The Eurovision Song Contest. It gave Abba its big break and lots of other winners based on incomprehensible voting patterns. You can be sure Greece will give Cyprus high marks and vice-versa.It was always campy but fun. Nowadays it is campier than an episode of RuPaul's Drag Race with countries that are nowhere near the continent of Europe being eligible to enter.Will Ferrell who is a fan of Eurovision co-wrote this story and it has a lot of elements from other Ferrell filmsAfter watching Abba win the contest as a small boy. Icelandic Lars (Ferrell) has dreamt of representing his country in the Eurovision Song Contest. His dream comes true when a freak explosion kills off the other Icelandic competitors.Together with best friend Sigrit (Rachel McAdams) their group Fire Saga get the chance to represent Iceland. However the group are not that good and are accident prone with their complicated staging. Lar's grumpy father, Erick (Pierce Brosnan) is very vocal with how bad his son's singing is.Fire Saga go off to Scotland where the contest his held. Sigrit is being romantically pursued by a Russian competitor Alexander Lemtov (Dan Stevens.) Bad luck still follows them every time they perform their song on stage.Ferrell just about gets away with his same old schtick. It is McAdams with Sigrit's obsession with magical elves, her love for Lars that gives the movie and the songs heart.The film is sporadically funny, it is too long and inconsistent. Graham Norton pops up to do the commentary.Somewhere up there, Terry Wogan is laughing his socks off that they made a movie about Eurovision.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
2,nogodnomasters,Anger cannot turn the butter,7,21 July 2020,"The first question that comes to mind is ""Why did they shoot a close-up of Will Farrell's mouth with his lower front teeth so crooked?"" Who doesn't get work done? Okay Keira Knightly, but it looks good on her. Lars Erickssong (Farrell) and Sigrit Brickdottier (Rachel McAdams) are ""Fire Saga"" and sing ""Ja Ja Ding Dong"" at the town tavern. Through a series of flukes (caused by elves perhaps) they go on to Eurovision.The film had a few funny parts. Some parts just Farrell stupid like the stuffed pants. It ends on a heartwarming note.Guide: 1 f-word I heard. No sex or nudity.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
3,kosmasp,Bigger than Super Bowl (?),8,5 July 2020,"Not my words, but what Rachel McAdams said on her press tour about Eurovision itself. She would never be so self centered to claim that about the movie or herself. Although since I'm not her, to me she is bigger than super bowl (and Eurovision for that matter).Now my love for her aside (what Ryan Gosling is for those who are into men from the Notebook, Rachel is for those into women ... well most of them anyway I would reckon), the movie is quite funny, while also being able to go dark. An explosion that is quite horrible (with body parts flying around), is being made fun of. This obviously is not for the faint hearted or easily offended or squeamish. If that is not something that is applicable to you and your humor alligns with that of the movie - there is quite some fun you can have. With a mesmerizing Rachel McAdams - in case I hadn't made that point clear already. Will Ferrell is nice too, but she (and even Dan Stevens as ""Russian"") steal the show - no pun intended!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
4,jboothmillard,Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,7,30 January 2021,"I, like many thousands, if not millions, across the world was upset when the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 was cancelled, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but thankfully this film was brought out by Netflix, directed by David Dobkin (Wedding Crashers, The Change-Up, The Judge). Basically, in the small town of Húsavík, Iceland, Lars Erickssong (Will Ferrell, also writing and producing) and Sigrit Ericksdóttir (Rachel McAdams) have been best friends since childhood and make music together as the band Fire Saga. Lars has always dreamed of winning the Eurovision Song Contest since seeing ABBA in 1974, but his widowed father, Erick (Pierce Brosnan), has always disapproved of this. The pair apply and are randomly selected to take part in Söngvakeppnin, the Icelandic pre-selection for Eurovision. Sigrit, who believes in the old Icelandic tradition of elves, asks them to help them in the contest and hopes that Lars will finally return her romantic feelings for him. Due to technical difficulties, Fire Saga's performance is a disaster, and the talented Katiana Lindsdóttir (Demi Lovato) wins the pre-selection. Lars is dejected and declines to attend the boat party for all the finalists and sits disappointed on the dock as Sigrit tries to comfort him. The boat suddenly explodes, killing everyone on board. Fire Saga, according to the rules, as the only surviving contestants, are automatically Iceland's entrant to the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest. Lars and Sigrit arrive in Edinburgh, Scotland, where Eurovision is being held. Once there, a new remix of their song and Lars' desire for an elaborate stage design causes them to struggle with preparations. They meet Alexander Lemtov (Dan Stevens), a Russian singer who is the favourite to win the contest with his song ""Lion of Love"". He invites them to a party at his house, attended by many former Eurovision contestants. There, Alexander introduces Lars and Sigrit to the Greek contestant Mita Xenakis (Melissanthi Mahut). Alexander and Sigrit spend the night together, as do Lars and Mita, but neither pair have sex. This creates tensions within Fire Saga, and almost derails their plans for the semi-final. Lars overhears Sigrit working on a new song in their hotel room and wrongly assumes it is a love song for Alexander. Katiana's ghost appears to Lars and warns him that his life is in danger; he ignores her. Fire Saga reconcile before the semi-finals. The performance of their song ""Double Trouble"" initially goes very well, but disaster strikes when Sigrit's scarf is caught in the giant hamster wheel, sending the wheel and Sigrit to fall offstage and into the audience. They recover and finish the song but are met with deafening silence and scattered laughter. The exit the stage thinking they are a laughingstock. Lars is humiliated and refuses to watch the vote results with the other artists, feeling that Fire Saga have no chance. Sigrit pleads with him to stay, saying that they should put on a brave face, although she also believes they have lost. Angry, he says something dismissive about the song he heard her writing. Sigrit angrily tells him that she wrote it about him, Lars is stunned, but nevertheless decides to return to Iceland. Sigrit joining the other artists in the green room, is surprised to see the ranking placing them in the top ten going to the final. Unaware of Fire Saga's advancement in the contest, Lars has returned to Húsavík. On a fishing boat, he talks with his father and confesses his love for Sigrit, and Erick tells him to go back and fight for her love. When they find out that Iceland is in the Eurovision final, they are shocked, and Lars jumps off the boat to swim back to shore. On his way to Reykjavík, Victor Karlosson (Mikael Persbrandt), the governor of the Central Bank of Iceland, and one of the Icelandic organisational team members, attempts to murder Lars. He reveals he blew up the boat at Söngvakeppnin, as Iceland is bankrupt and cannot afford to host Eurovision the following year if Fire Saga were to win. Luckily, Lars is saved by unseen elves who kill Victor. Lars makes it to the grand finale just in time to perform, after hitchhiking with some initially unwilling American tourists, whom he made many negative stereotype comments about. Katiana's ghost appears briefly to warn Lars, but he informs her that Karlosson is dead, and she disappears. Interrupting the beginning of Sigrit's song, he encourages her to ditch their official entry and perform the song she has written for him, ""Húsavík"" (""My Hometown""). Watching at home, their friends and families are all touched, along with the entire auditorium. The beautiful song has lyrics paying homage to their town, features the Icelandic language and a stunning finale. Erick watches the contest proudly with Sigrit's mother, Helka (Elin Petersdottir). After their performance, Alexander is revealed to be gay, he knows that homosexuality is not accepted in Russia, and considers the possibility of moving to Greece with Mita. Fire Saga are disqualified for changing their song during the contest, but both Lars and Sigrit have lost interest in winning the competition, realising that their relationship is more important. On stage, they share their first kiss, finally expressing their feelings they have long had for each other. Fire Saga returns home, where they are greeted with a hero's welcome. Sometime later, Lars and Sigrit have had a baby, and Erick and Helka have just got married. Fire Saga performs at their wedding reception in the local bar, with the American tourists in attendance. The band offers to play their Eurovision song, but everyone just wants to hear the local favourite folk song, ""JaJa Ding Dong"". Also starring Trapped star Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as Neils Brongus, Graham Norton as himself, and Jamie Demetriou as Kevin Swain (Artistic Director). With cameos from Eurovision stars John Lundvik (Sweden, 2019 representative), Anna Odobescu (Moldova, 2019 representative), Bilal Hassani (France, 2019 representative), Loreen (Sweden, 2012 winner), Jessy Matador (France, 2010 representative), Alexander Rybak (Norway, 2009 winner and 2018 representative), Jamala (Ukrain, 2016 winner), Elina Nechayeva (Estonia, 2018 representative), Conchita Wurst (Austria, 2014 winner), and Netta (Israeli, 2018 winner). Ferrell is terrific as the deluded musical dreamer, McAdams is great as his besotted partner, Stevens is funny as the smarmy Russian rival, Norton makes funny appearances, and the inclusion of recognisable Eurovision singers is fun to watch. The real Eurovision Song Contest does have good singing and songs, but more often it is full of weird, cheesy, and over-the-top performances, so it is exactly the kind of the thing that would get either a spoof or homage movie. This film does have predictable moments you expect in this kind of story, but it works well deliberately mocking the contest and celebrating its quirkiness. You cannot help but go along with it, it is funny, and ""Volcano Man"", ""Lion of Love"", ""Double Trouble"" and other songs in the soundtrack are very memorable, a fun musical comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music (Original Song) for ""Husavik"". Very good!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

6,CinemaSerf,Seez pwa de moi,6,26 June 2020,"I suppose your view on this will very much depend on whether or not you like (or at least appreciate) the Eurovision Song Contest - much of the humour derives from decades of the subjugation of Europe by this: the epitome of campness, talentlessness, political bias and general tone deafness! If you do, then this will work; if not - then don't waste your time. Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams are good as a couple who ever since Abba won in 1974, have been inspired to take part in the competition, representing their home nation of Iceland. After an exhaustive selection process - involving a bin and some CDs - they find themselves auditioning and well... you can guess the rest. It swipes at just about everything from the corny looks/lyrics; huge - frequently calamitous - staging; dodgy judging and just about anything American but it also manages to tap into what makes the whole event work - it's gentle sense of national pride; of silliness - epitomised by a superbly smouldering Dan Stevens as ""Alexander Lemtov"", the gorgeous, super sleazy Russian candidate - who is clearly enjoying himself. Graham Norton (who hosts the real BBC coverage in the UK) is as taciturn as ever as the event is showcased in Edinburgh. It is not, however, particularly well written; the jokes are a bit low-brow and the romance between the two characters is, frankly, quite distracting from the point of the whole thing. I have to admit that it did take me a good half an hour to recognise Pierce Brosnan! Oddly enough, there just isn't enough music in it - but it is still fun, if forgettable",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
7,Calicodreamin,Surprisingly good,8,27 June 2020,"I went in this with low exceptions, but found this surprisingly good. Rachel McAdams is so cute in this movie. It's the perfect mix of cheesy and goofy. Low key liked the songs and the acting was great from the whole cast. The storyline was well developed, though I could have done without the ghost of Demi Lovato. Otherwise, perfect.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
8,deloudelouvain,Funny enough for me.,6,12 July 2020,"I remember the days when there were not many different tv channels to choose from, only about twelve, a couple from my country Belgium and the rest from neighboring countries. When it was Eurovision every freaking channel was broadcasting that show and I hated it. It's the lamest music possible, and the voting was quite ridiculous as neighboring countries would give eachother big scores no matter how bad it was. So yes i hated everything about that yearly show. Watching a movie about it would have never happened if Will Ferrell wasn't in it. I like everything with Will Ferrell, even though it's ridiculous humor, but he has one of those faces that makes me laugh so that's already enough for me to watch it. This one is probably not his best one but still I had some good giggles. The story is lame like the real Eurovision Song Contest is so it was funny enough quite realistic. I can see why people would hate it (those are the people that can't stand Will Ferrell) and I can see why people loved it (Eurosvision fanatics and Will Ferrell lovers), I'm between it so a six star rating seems fair to me.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
9,FeastMode,a mixed bag,5,17 May 2021,"This movie started out awesome. Unfortunately the funniest scene is the opening music video. And the frequency of laughs decreases throughout the movie. I was laughing a lot early on, and barely at all in the last third of the movie.The three leads were awesome, especially mcadams and stevens. I generally had a good time watching, for the most part. But the movie overall isn't very good. There were a bunch of dumb parts, typical drama that feels forced and unnecessary, and one scene that made me cringe to the point of disbelief.

10,ThomasDrufke,Jaja Ding Dong!,7,22 July 2020,"I would have never guessed that one of my favorite songs of the summer would be Jaja Ding Dong by none other than Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams vocal stand-in but hey, here we are. Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, much in the same vein as Ferrell's other film, Blades of Glory, tells a heartwarming story with tremendous comedic effect while also entertaining an audience with its musical thrills and surprising them with its heart. There's plenty to love about Eurovision, including an endearing turn from McAdams, who seems to be truly finding her home in Comedy, a production and costume design that is among the year's best, and Ferrell back at the top of his game. Safe to say, with many movies not releasing this year, Eurovision is near the top for me.7.8/10",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
11,Cineanalyst,Auto-Tuned,4,29 June 2020,"The auto-tuned songs aren't bad, whether they be melodic or parodic, but as a comedy-drama, ""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,"" it's a cluttered series of miscues. Even the title is an overlong and questionable attempt at humor with both the words ""story"" and ""saga."" I can can count on one hand how many moments in the movie gave me mirth. Any attempted exploitation of cultural differences becomes a lost cause. Only the anti-American ranting from the American Will Ferrell in an American production somewhat works. Trying to poke fun at homophobia in Russia, for instance, is just depressing. Besides, why every hack piece of slapstick needs a love triangle in the first place is beyond me, although, still, the drama here manages to work better than the comedy. The ghost and elves stuff is stupid (albeit, the line, ""The elves went too far,"" is kind of funny). A lot of the rest is the usual dick jokes. Perhaps, my favorite gag is Ferrell's blasé response to the beauty, leaping wales included, of Húsavík, Iceland. Indeed, ""Eurovision Song Contest"" is in stark contrast to the usual cinematic leveraging of nature in the better pictures set in the Nordics. This one spends more time in a pub watching TV than, say, beside snow-covered mountains, more time swirling the camera around actors lip syncing than on any battle between man and nature.Oh well, at least, Molly Sandén can sing--providing the voice for Rachel McAdams's character. Additionally, since the real Eurovision event has been cancelled for the first time in its history due to the pandemic, streaming this movie on Netflix may offer fans a substitute, pale as it may be, to the real thing, including cameos from several past Eurovision participants.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
12,Irishchatter,Humour and storyline was rubbish but songs in this were great,5,30 June 2020,"Just as the title of this review says, the whole storyline and humour was stupid af like I felt there didn't need to be over the top edgy jokes in this. The storyline was just too predictable and rather meh. I did however, really enjoy the whole songs in this, especially when all the Eurovision winners gathered around at a party bursting a mix of Cher and other old skool tracks. That was pretty much it, I wouldn't call it the best tbh....",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

14,Thanos_Alfie,Fire Saga...,5,28 June 2020,"""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga"" is a Comedy - Music movie in which we watch two musicians having a dream representing their country Iceland at the world's biggest song competition, Eurovision Song Contest. They succeed on taking the chance to represent their country and now they have to prove to everyone that they can win.I liked this movie because it had a simple, nice and very funny plot combined very well with some romantic scenes. For one more time Will Ferrell who played as Lars Erickssong was simply hilarious and his interpretation was very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Rachel McAdams who played as Sigrit Ericksdottir, Dan Stevens who played as Alexander Lemtov and Pierce Brosnan who played as Erick Erickssong, and they were all simply amazing. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you will like it and you will laugh a lot.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
15,cruise01,"Weird, fun, and a little too long for a comedy film.",6,30 June 2020,"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga (3 out of 5 stars).Eurovision is a comedy film about two best friends since there childhood. Had a dream about going into a singing competition in Eurovision. Lars (Will Ferrell) and Sigrit (Rachel McAdams) are a duo that sing in local bars in Iceland. While they enter a competition presenting there country. They face against Alexander (Dan Stevens) a Russian singer who has a flamboyant style. And others. While Lars father Erick (Pierce Brosnan) is disappointed with his sons talent.Eurovision is a film that feels like a stylish 1980s music video with its European celtic like music and costumes, lighting, and visuals. One wonders if the writers and director was high on something from its trippy and weird style. It does have its fair share of comical moments. I did find the film to have its charm with the performances and decent story about Lars and Sigrit trying to chase there dreams.The performances are fun and weird in a good way. Which is what it is trying to be with its stupid humor. The film does run a little too long with its running time. Running at 2 hours. The direction does have an uneven pacing. Lars and Sigrit singing and having their musical duo is a lot of fun and flashy with its songs and set design. When the characters are not in a musical moment. The direction can be a little dull and slow.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
16,eddie_baggins,A big dosage of dumb fun,6,30 June 2020,"Much like the contest of its title, Netflix's latest high-profile comedy, that re-teams Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin with that films participants Rachel McAdams and Will Ferrell, Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga is all over the top color and joy with little substance to substantiate it but delivers exactly what it promises to do, lots of silly and fun entertainment.Sharing a great chemistry together, heightened by the fact McAdams continues to prove her powers in the comedy game after a stand out turn a few years back in Game Night, Eurovision may outstay its welcome slightly at a generous two hour runtime but there's enough winning moments here to make the oddball trip we take worth it.Filled with a killer soundtrack and some original ditties with titles such as scene stealer Ja Ja Ding Dong, Volcano Man and Lion of Love, Eurovision wears its heart on its sleeve as its game cast commit to every aspect of Dobkin and Ferrell's wild ride (with Ferrell helping pen the script after being inspired by his own love for the famed singing contest), making this one of those infectiously enjoyable offerings, that despite your better judgement, you can't help but enjoy.Following the journey of Ferrell and McAdams long-time Icelandic based friends and music lovers Lars Erickssong and Sigrit Ericksdottir, as they find themselves unexpectedly representing their home country in the worlds biggest song contest, Eurovision introduces us to a wide range of colorful characters and side players from Dan Steven's flamboyant Russian singer Alexander Lemtov, Pierce Brosnan's grumpy music hater and father to Lars Erick and Demi Lovato's unfortunate Katiana but the film really shines when its simply Ferrell and McAdams alone doing their best work.Seeming a little too old for this kind of thing now, Ferrell is his usual overplaying it self as the obsessive Lars but when his playing alongside the elves-believing McAdams as Sigrit, the film finds a genuinely nice groove that it can bounce along from, especially with McAdams embedding so much charm and heart into her role, elevating Eurovision from acceptable comedy to the perfect dumb antidote to the world in which we find ourselves in now.Final Say -A big dumb overblown comedy that never attempts to become anything more than a silly and brash comedic exercise, Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga successfully reunites Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams as it delivers solid laughs and toe-tapping tunes.3 portaloo's out of 5",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

20,southdavid,That's Why Mum's Gone To Iceland,5,29 June 2020,"Although I know it's a big deal to some people, I don't really enjoy a Eurovision event that much and I worried before seeing this film that the contest was beyond parody to begin with. I think I was right and I wouldn't say I enjoyed this film, but I find it hard to generate any real venom for it either.Since childhood, Lars Erickssong (Will Ferrell) has had one dream, to win the Eurovision song contest. To the chagrin of his father (Pierce Brosnan) and the majority of the Icelandic town he lives in, this dream has stayed strong, and along with his childhood friend Sigrit (Rachel McAdams) they have submitted a song each year to be the Icelandic entry. When all the remaining options are killed in an explosion, Lars and Sigrit head to Edinburgh to represent the nation. But there, as their affection grows, the Russian entry, Alexander Lemtov (Dan Stevens) begins to make a play for Sigrit.So there are, for my money, three things wrong with the movie. Firstly, it's far too reverential of the Eurovision Song Contest itself to operate as a parody. None of the performances are that over the top, compared to what you'd actually see. This is probably because Ferrell is a fan of the show, and that it uses many of the official logos, themes and presenters of the actual event - and in order to secure that, they can't then poke too much fun at their hosts. Secondly, Ferrell himself. I know he's the only reason the film gets made in the first place, as he's the fan, but he's strikingly older than McAdams. Distractingly so and I felt the character could have done with more genuine charm or naivety that Ferrell didn't provide. But thirdly, and most crucially, it's just not that funny. It doesn't try for enough jokes to get by on the hit rate that the film has. It's not even prepared to allow for Fire Saga to be a bad band. Accidents befall every performance that they have, but they can sing as well as anyone else on the show.That said, I can't bring myself to say I hated it like I did ""Holmes and Watson"" say. Dan Steven's is great, the Demetriou siblings are both in it, though not given enough to do, and the resolution of the Demi Lovato ghost subplot made me chuckle. It's all very amiable - just not funny.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

22,jtindahouse,Ferrell's career continues to slide,5,4 July 2020,"Age has really caught up to Will Ferrell unfortunately - and I'm not in any way talking about his looks. I'm talking about his acting ability and his ability to be funny. The man was almost indisputably the funniest person working in Hollywood a decade ago. These days he can go an entire film without getting a single laugh out of me. It feels like he plays it incredibly safe these days, preferring to lean on PG-13 movies and safe scripts. I understand it's a very difficult time to be a comedian with the world being so easy to offend right now, but I really wish people like him would just ignore that noise and get back to making the fabulous movies that he was in the 2000s.Looking past the comedy, the movie didn't work for me as a narrative either. It was extremely clunky. There were many many scenes that could've (and should've) been left on the cutting room floor. Ferrell wrote this himself, and he's actually written some very fine scripts over the years, but this was not one of them. It felt like a kids movie, aimed at adults.Everything that was great about 'Pitch Perfect' in terms of combining heart, humour and fun was missing here. The music was actually okay and probably the strongest part of 'Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga'. There were some catchy singles along the way that were a pleasure to have replace the clunky dialogue. Rachel McAdams actually went a long way towards saving the film too. She gives her best in every scene, despite her clearly knowing some of the things she was being asked to do were ridiculous and not going to come across well onscreen. It isn't enough to save this mess though. I can't recommend this one.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Moments when he's not overdoing it, proves he's even more funnier. And Rachel McAdams is great, and her comedic timing is incredible. The musical numbers are also fun to watch. It has some raunchy moments but never goes to over board. It's just a comedy, and the film itself tells you not to take it self seriously.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
24,alindsay-al,A Good Silly Film,7,29 June 2020,"This film hit Netflix on Friday and being British I know what The Eurovision Song Contest is so I decided to watch this film and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees two Icelandic Musicians given the opportunity to represent their country in The Eurovision Song Contest and attempt to achieve their dreams.
Main Character
Rachel McAdams plays one of the main characters here and I thought she was really good here. She is the character that I cared about the most here and her journey is the most interesting part of the film. She is a great actress and even though this film doesn't take itself too seriously she tries too at times. Will Ferrell plays her partner and I thought he was fine here, this is nowhere near his strongest performance but he does have some funny moments and even though his story arc is cliche it does work for the film.The two's chemistry is good and they bounce off of each other well, which is good as it is the part of the film that you have to be invested in.
Supporting Characters
Dan Stevens is one of the best actors going around today and for me he was the standout for this film. He is uber charismatic and really balances on the borderline of being super cool or super annoying but he nails it and oozes style in every scene he is in. Pierce Brosnan plays Ferrel's dad and he is good here, again he isn't the most interesting part of the film but for the role he has to do he does it effectivley. Everybody else also does good jobs and it is nice to see Graham Norton have his real life role here.
Story
The story here is pretty basic, but the chemistry between the two leads is really good plus it is great seeing the song contest being played out in all of it's glory. But there is this side arc involving the Icelandic government that had potential but it feels really out of place. Plus as I have mentioned there are parts of the film that are very generic leading to it being a predictable film.
Script
The script has some funny moments in it and some nice drama to it. But there just aren't enough of those funny moments, I am pretty sure this film is trying to be a comedy but it isn't funny enough to be a great comedy unfortunately.
Style
The style of this film is absurd, you see just how crazy Eurovision is, and what is funny is that this film doesn't even make it much crazier then it is in real life. The song sequences are fantastic, they feel grand on scale and feel epic in nature. But the issue is that you can tell that every actor is lipsyncing and it does take you out of what is happening. Also I felt like the last act is rushed a little bit and it leads to a pretty abrupt ending.
Overall
Overall, I feel like this is a very entertaining film, I think if you know little about Eurovision this might not be a film for you. But if you know about the show then this is a fun if not flawed experience that could be worth a watch.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
25,CubsandCulture,It is worth seeing but it is too long for the concept,6,29 March 2021,The film ends up being rather sweet and more of a romantic comedy than other Ferrell works. But it wears out its welcome after about an hour because of the gags are invoke smiles not chuckles. I think the central problem is it is really not possible to parody Eurovision as the event is already completely out there. The film has several cameos of prior winners and I guarantee most Americans think they are throw away gags. Add in that the film contains one too many subplots and the back half of this just drag.,Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
26,r96sk,"A disappointment, to me anyway",4,31 December 2020,"Awful.I love Eurovision itself, I've watched it every year for as long as I can remember. Therefore, I really did want to like this - for the aforementioned, but because I also like Will Ferrell. Unfortunately, I found 'Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga' an utter slog to sit through.It, at least in my opinion, fails in a lot of ways. It fails as a musical, as a comedy, as a potential romcom... nothing about it works. I do like how they incorporated Graham Norton into things, but otherwise nothing else sticks out.The comedy is severely lacking, with Ferrell (Lars) giving a forgettable - at best - performance. I will say that I didn't mind Rachel McAdams (Sigrit) in this, she's alright. Dan Stevens' Alexander is boring, while Pierce Brosnan's Erick is practically pointless. There are a number of cameos from real life Eurovision stars, not that they add anything - there's one music mash-up scene with them that's cringe to watch.It takes itself way, way too seriously. There are some moments where I was expecting a punchline, before realising it's genuinely trying to be sombre. It needed to take the vibe of actual Eurovision: silly and fun.A disappointment, to me anyway. There's also a lot of errors with how Eurovision works, but that's just my pedantic side kicking in so I'll allow it.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Will & Rachel are damn funny. Good for laugh loud weekend night. It's a story of someone pursing dream since childhood, no matter how hard it works, failure still come and get laugh by the crowd.

28,Agent10,Extraordinary!,7,10 September 2021,"I will disclose this. I am not a Eurovision fan. I think it is a pretty lame exhibition of crummy pop music masquerading as something legitimate. Now of course, I am a moody nihilist from the US and find this kind of music benign and boring, but how does this thing exist? With that in mind, I kinda liked this movie.It's stupid, it's over the top and it's like a hyper realized world like Blades of Glory or Zoolander. What makes this funny is how blurred is the reality versus the parody? I'm gonna go on a limb and say not a whole lot.The story begins with the haphazard group Fire Saga, a neo-techno disco group desperately trying to make the Eurovision contest. Well at least one of them is, for it's quite obvious that Lars Ericksson is hung up on the contest while Sigrit is hung up on Lars (which is a huge reach...who would not desire Rachel McAdams!!). Lars is something of a loser, and the way he dresses and carries himself absolutely clashes with the small fishing village he lives in. But by a weird series of events, Fire Saga actually makes the Eurovision finals!!The story pretty much follows any rom com ever made once they make it to Scotland. Lars makes bad arbitrary decisions, Sigrit is being chased by another man (or is she?), Lars makes a huge mistake, comes back, proves his love for Sigrit and after all is said and done, is content with his life.There is nothing really special in the second half of the film, but the Fire Saga songs are pretty darn awesome (even if they are parodic). I mean, they trot out all these other past real life Eurovision competitors and you realize their music is equally ridiculous and benign...so is this a true representation?I will say this, the song at the end is a real banger. I would venture to say if pop music had that kind of heart, I might listen more often. But of course, real pop music is far too easily digestible to be that moving.Yea, I have taken a lot of pot shots at the movie, but I gave it a seven because of the college students. I hate Arizona State, and the portrayal of ASU male students was pretty darn spot on. And of course, they had to have a self hating Arizona student with them. All of the insults Will Ferrell hurled at them had me rolling in the aisles. Anyway, bravo film, bravo.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
29,questl-18592,Fire Saga: The Story of European Idol,7,9 April 2021,"Right up front I feel like I need to say that I normally don't love Will Ferrell movies. I can appreciate the man being brilliant at what he does but so many of his movies just annoy the bejesus out of me. Those lower expectations may have helped here though because I actually really enjoyed this movie. McAdams and Ferrell are both wonderful and hilarious here and the outrageous situations they find themselves in completely worked for me.The best part of this isn't the performances or the comedy though. Don't get me wrong, there were laughs and I think they're doing a good job here but what really sells this movie is the set work and the music. There are some gorgeous sets and locales here and it's just a wonderful movie to look at. Aside from that the music was actually really good too. I could totally see myself listening to this soundtrack later on and I do feel like those two factors bump up the enjoyment from decent to actually pretty fun.EuroVision is a weird movie but there is a lot of fun to be had here. It's a fun enough movie that I'd recommend it to most people as just a casual, good time flick without requiring a huge investment. To that end, this is perfect background material because you'll get those great songs and when you do glance over you'll probably see something pretty on screen. Definitely worth the time.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Will Ferrell's antics are getting old, but I decided to finish it the next day. There's some good heart to it. Rachel McAdams is great and Molly Sanden's voice is unreal. Some good music overall and comedy sprinkled in. It really is borrowing heavy from Pitch Perfect. Just above average though.

32,jadepietro,Euro Trash (But in a Good Way),6,7 July 2020,"GRADE: C+THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Entertaining but light-weight comedy about dreaming your dream.JIM'S REVIEW: Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga is a very long title for a very long movie. The film is a goofy and slight satirical comedy. Its easy target is an international song competition that promotes pop ditties representing various countries with lavish staging, pyrotechnic effects, and garish costumes. Call it a underdog story or an amusing Rocky rewrite with purposely bad music.Written by Andrew Steele and one of its stars, comedian Will Ferrell, the film tells its Icelandic tale of a middle age loser named Lars Erickssong whose dream it is to win the Eurovision contest, the musical equivalent of a vocal Olympics Game. His singing partner is Sigrit Ericksdóttir (a very winning Rachel McAdams), who, for some unknown reason, idolizes her bandmate. Their pairing is an imbalance, not only script-wise but as an acting team.The movie is silly fun, although, Mr. Ferrell is miscast in his own script. The actor does have some nice sight gags and pratfalls, but most of the time he belabors his character and lets his performance go off kilter. He plays Lars as if he is still performing on a SNL skit. There is no real chemistry or depth of character here and it's hard to believe his ""middle age status"". (He is a bit long in the walrus tusk for this role.) In all honesty, his performance simply lacks the light comedic charm needed to pull off this part and he weighs down all the joyous buffoonery from others in the cast. The miscasting is very obvious as he acts opposite the talented Ms. McAdams, who has a natural flair for comedy. She is a perfect fit, almost a 10. Also providing humorous moments are Pierce Brosnan as Lar's disapproving father and Dan Stevens as the narcissistic Russian crooner.Actually, the best parts of the movie are the snippets of the half-baked musical numbers. These fleeting moments are on-target spoofs with the typically over-produced staging and sexualized performances gyrating in full satirical view. Highlighting these scenes would have made a much funnier film. The filmmakers should have considered making this intriguing concept as a mockamentary instead of the formulaic rom/com that it is. If they had focused more on the outrageousness of the competition and shown the musical entries in their entirety, leaving out much of the predictable story, the movie would have been more laugh-out-loud funny than merely diverting fodder.Directed by tongue-in-cheek ill reverence by David Dobkin, Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga barely makes the semi-finals.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
33,Kamurai25,I hope the Icelanders like this better than I did.,4,29 June 2020,"Decent watch at best, I don't want to see it again, and I can't recommend it unless you just like laughing at foreigners.Imagine....Pitch Perfect, with middle age characters, but instead of the 90% of somewhat interesting or even bland characters, the movie is centered around the 10% of annoying (potentially offensive) stereotypical characters you could have written out of the movie. I don't know if the producers just thought, ""What's whiter than Iceland"" and figure it was okay to make fun of them for an entire movie, but that's pretty much what they did.I can't say if it's accurate, I don't have a lot of Icelandic jokes in my pocket, but SO MANY people had to endorse this that it is just sad this was made. This could have been a great American Idol style of movie, none of the nationalistic humor was necessary.They took the ""Off the bus from Kansas"" trope, and set it in Europe, barely anything particular to it, let alone special.Don't get me wrong, the singing is all great, but that's what audio programs are for, and they certainly had the budget to go the extra mile with this one.The writing is actually pretty good in this, it's just coated in herring (see, that's probably a Swedish joke).I'd really like to see an American version of this so we can let two top notch stars like Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams loose and not have to feel bad about it.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

40,blott2319-1,"Needed some script-cleanup, but still has some enjoyable elements",6,27 October 2021,"Add me to the list of Americans who were clueless and didn't know anything about Eurovision prior to the release of this movie. I certainly like the idea, and found it to be quite fun when we get a few glimpses at the competition. But this movie isn't really about the song contest, it's about the band, Fire Saga. I have a relatively high tolerance for Will Ferrel's silly humor, so I definitely had some fun with this ridiculous movie. I kind of wish it was a little more grounded and not quite so hammy because it feels like there is potential for a good inspirational story here. The dedication of these two characters to their goal of winning Eurovision has the opportunity to be inspiring and/or heartbreaking. But since Will Ferrell makes Lars such an untalented moron, it is hard to form any real emotional investment.I adore Rachel McAdams, and I loved what she did with the role of Sigrit. She is the heart of The Story of Fire Saga and is the one element that does ground the narrative to a minor degree. It's kind of a shame that she is dubbed on the songs, but it makes sense as they needed a truly astounding vocal talent to pull off that final number. The music in this film was a treat, and I thought that My Hometown was a beautiful way to bring the story of the movie full circle. Sadly, there's a lot of dumb time-wasting stuff that is inserted into the film just to pad the runtime, particularly when it came to the muddled romantic subplot. It feels like a half-baked script that needed some more refining before they actually started filming. The end result is that Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga feels underwhelming and predictable despite having some enjoyable elements.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Here he is determined to represent Iceland in the Euro-vision Song Contest.Will Ferrell is less Will Ferrell than he normally is and shares the spotlight with Rachel McAdams who is very good.The characters are entertaining enough and they make a cute ugly-couple.
The comedy is a warm and fuzzy pastiche of the contest in the whole and pokes around at some national stereotypes - all in good humour.Most is spot on: half the fun of watching Euro-vision as a Brit is to see the U.K flop and then spend the next day moaning about it.At one point it felt like the film was coming to a head so I paused to grab a cup of tea and was alarmed to see there was over an hour left.
I was barely half way through!This is my gripe with this film.
It is much too long.
There are only so many ways you can depict Scandinavians as reserved, polite and naive before it gets boring.This film should have got in and out before you could think too hard about it but it massively over stays its welcome.

It was very european and didn't go so much for the slapstick and nasty.
Even for Will Farrell who often does work in those tones this was something quite subtle.

His movies as cliche as they are always carry some surprise and this is not exception. You pretty much knows where it goes but still hook you up gladly.
This time Ferrell who is also a writer throw darts to politics, small town absurdities (and believe as funny as they seem are most of them real) and parents disdain about sons.
On the other hand, he increases Rachel McAdams performance who is lovable heere and with voice so angelic it will surprise you for good.

Factual errors throughout should not spoil the main architecture of the screenplay.Musical numbers are the highlight of this quasi-musical, the highlight been a track called 'Double Trouble,' which in it's own right could actually win the Eurovision Song Contest in it's own right. It really is such a poor 'music' contest as European TV audiences (and Australian?) especially UK audiences are all to comically aware.The film follows the exploits of an Icelandic entry to the contest. A pair, Sigrit and Lars played by Rachel McAdams and Will Ferrell.We are spared the indignity of Pierce Brosnan repeating his Mamma Mia! 'singing.' In this film he is cast as the rather bitter Icelandic father of the main character Lars (Will Ferrell) despite the age similarity between himself and Ferrell.In a year (so far) devoid of any good releases (indeed cinemas closed), Eurovision is a film that is a worthy crowd pleaser. Perhaps more so to the European television audiences.The film has a sequence where past Eurovision contestants participate in a 'sing-off.' I only recognised Conchita Wurst, a past Austrian winner.The film is not like a Rocky film. Without revealing the full screenplay the underdog does not win the contest but the film is better than a EBU (European Broadcast Union), who officially endorse the film and whose logo is seen broadcast throughout.Spoiler alert!

Netflix
My Rating 6/10There are some good moments I this Comedy send up of the Eurovision Song Contest if it wasn't for its star ? Will Ferrell.I was tempted to watch this film when I saw the Academy Award Song from the film Husavik ""My Hometown "" performed by Molly Sandén .Set In the small town of Húsavík, Iceland, Lars Erickssong (Will Ferrell) and Sigrit Ericksdóttir, ( Rachel McAdams) best friends since childhood, make music together as the band Fire Saga, much to the dismay of Lars' widowed father, Erick. ( Pierce Brosnan) Lars has one dream: to win the Eurovision Song Contest. Lars, in particular, is deeply into his ""art"", but at the local bar where they play, the only song the audience wants to hear is the suggestive nonsense song ""JaJa Ding Dong"". The pair apply and are randomly selected to take part in Söngvakeppnin, the Icelandic pre-selection for Eurovision. Sigrit, who believes in the old Icelandic tradition of elves, asks them to help them in the contest in the hope that, if they win, Lars will finally return her romantic feelings for him.Somewhere in this very expensive Production is good film in the style of the 1993 hit ""Cool Runnings"" but it's Star Will Ferrell ,who looks older than Pierce Brosnan who plays his father in the film ruined it for me . Even Rachel McAdams as Sigrid I thought too old for this role but she was cute in the film . Will Ferrell sang in his own voice. Rachel McAdams mimed to Molly Sandén who did sing in Eurovision.Will Ferrell's interest in the Eurovision Song Contest began when his Swedish wife Viveca Paulin took him to her cousins house in May 1999 and the family turned the competition on. Since then, he kept following it. In 2014, Ferrell traveled to Copenhagen, Denmark to watch the finale of The Eurovision Song Contest (2014), in which Conchita Wurst who appears in the film was crowned the winner.He wrote the screenplay to this film and was a Producer it's apparently his most popular movie in years but I wish he wasn't starring in it .However there is one star turn in this movie it's worth watching to see the ""Downton Abbey "" Dan Stevens star remember Matthew Crawley he's brilliant as the campy charismatic Russian entrant ( Gay dear not me dear we don't have Gays in Russia)
Alexander Lemtov . Dan has the best moments in the film and the best staged song
Dan Stevens wanted to perform in his own voice but due to COVID he couldn't get to the recording studio in time and his voice in the film is Swedish Baritone Erik Mjones.He does sing well Alexander (Dan Stevens) invites Lars and Sigrit to his party which is my favourite part of the film . Erik says says ""be my guests."" Dan Stevens played Beast in Beauty and the Beast (2017) which famously includes the song ""Be Our Guest"".The party scene at Alexander Lemtov's house was filmed at Knebworth House. Located in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, this stately home and its surrounding gardens are Grade II-listed and date back to the Tudor times.Obviously lot of people love this film I liked parts of it but Will Ferrell was definitely my stumbling block.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

In 2020 hindsight, advantage Iceland.It's heart is in the right place. On its sleeve. I think it will garner some new Eurovision fans. I won't be one of them.

I'm a fan of both these actors, but this movie was just plain bad.The acting was OK, and I don't think that was the issue with the movie being un-funny, since we know that both actors can play funny roles... it just really comes down to the plot/story/writing being bad, and it's not the actor's fault.I honestly can't recommend that you watch this movie, under any circumstances... Normally most movies would at least maybe be worth watching if you have nothing else to watch or if you just want to pass some time, but this movie isn't even worth watching if you've got nothing to do for 2hours...

Her Smell is an exception, and this is another, but I usually don't like movies of the ""Zoolander-type"" (no offense to Zoolander).Rachel McAdams was the best person they could've got for this role. I'm literally trying to think of someone else who could've done an alright job, but just can't. After I saw Game Night, I think I wrote in my review for that movie that I thought they should use McAdams in more funny roles (since she was great in that), so it was a nice little surprise seeing her in this.The song for the contest is awesome. It's like ""Never Enough"" in The Greatest Showman.The rest of the cast did an exceptional job as well, especially Pierce Brosnan and Will Farrell.I didn't even know about this movie until the day it came out, oddly enough. Netflix should really have a section that shows just the AAA movies they added since your last visit, since that's all I'm really interested in (big budget, polished, unique, movies like this).Along with Black Mirror, Unsolved Mysteries, and Disenchantment, and movies like this, Netflix has most of my favorite content now (HBO now comes in second place, in my mind -- they've been too hit-and-miss lately). At least when Netflix spends a lot on content, I usually love it.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

60,bgar-80932,Not good,3,14 August 2020,Maybe this is better if you are more familiar with the song contest as the ridiculousness is probably similar to this. I love Will Ferrell and both him and his co-star fully committed to the roles it just wasn't very funny. I'm all for the stupid comedy but this movie forgot the comedy. It's also 30 minutes longer than the majority of comedies these days and I felt it. I wouldn't recommend this one.,Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
61,mmthos,ICELAND'S GOT TALENT,6,4 July 2020,"Fun, quirky little rom-com, at 2 hours could've been cut, but I enjoyed the Ferell/McAdams's brother/sister? lovebirds' cooing, frustrated BFFs from childhood totally consumed by devotion to their one goal in life: winning top prize at Eurovision! To do so they must overcome a barrage of obstacles, the worst being Will""s disapproving father, played by Pierce Brosnan. In the end, of course, they overcome all the obstacles that really matter, and it's an enjoyable ride along the way
Including topical subject matter like the Iceland bankruptcy, Russian homophobia, and the worldwide obsession with singing contests, I think Ferell and fellow SNL alum Andrew Steele really have their finger on the pulse of the international audience",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
62,PyroSikTh,A Love Letter to Eurovision,8,8 July 2020,"I am not a Eurovision fan at all. I haven't watched it since Terry Wogan was still narrating it. It's a flamboyant, silly extravagance full of terrible music, cringeworthy performances, and hidden politics that prevent certain countries from even having a chance at winning. And too many people take it way too seriously. So Will Ferrell comes along making a movie about it. I was fully strapped in for a couple of hours of him ripping the whole thing a new one, mocking and satirising the whole endeavour, because that's what Will Ferrell does. But that's not what I got. Unbeknown to me, Will Ferrell is actually a longtime fan of the contest, and The Story of Fire Saga comes off more as a love letter to the whole thing. It embodies the same qualities Eurovision does; silly, flamboyant, and full of questionable music, but with a respectful approach that wants to celebrate this rather than ridicule it.The movie follows Lars Erickssong and Sigrit Ericksdottir, childhood friends who share a love of music ever since ABBA featured in Eurovision in 1974 (which Iceland wasn't involved in back then, amusingly enough) and inspired Lars to go and win the whole competition one day. By pure luck they find themselves as contenders, shipped off to Edinburgh to take part (why Edinburgh? Wouldn't that require a UK win?), but are constantly let down by technical issues that leave them the laughing stock of the event.The Story of Fire Saga is more of a silly Rom-Com between Lars and Sigrit than a typical Will Ferrell comedy. Lars is hyper focused on winning the event and is unwilling to let anything else get in the way of that, including Sigrit's romantic feelings for him. When fellow contenders Alexander Lemtov and Mita Xenakis start getting involved in their relationship, things start to get rockier. It takes a pep talk from Lars' father to make him realise there's more to life than Eurovision, and that he can find happiness outside and beyond his life-long dreams; with Sigrit. There's some real heart and emotion in this movie that really blindsided me, making it a movie above and beyond just cheap gags.But that's not to say comedic elements are downplayed. This is Will Ferrell after all, alongside the comedic genius of Rachel McAdams. There's plenty of lines, visual gags, and ridiculous events to keep you laughing all the way through, from the angry Husavik citizen who's obsessed with the song Jaja Ding Dong, to Lars stuffing socks down his costume to make his bulge bigger and Sigrit following suit with a camel toe, to murderous but unseen elves. There's some sly stabs which gave me some hearty chuckles as well, such as a dig at Iceland's banking crisis in 2008, the fact that the UK never wins Eurovision (despite it being hosted in Edinburgh?), or Russia's draconian viewpoint on homosexuality.The acting is a little hit and miss across the board. The most notable issue was in using Will Ferrell, Rachel McAdams, and Pierce Brosnan as Icelanders, and Dan Stevens as a Russian. McAdams manages the accent reasonably well, taking tips from Bjork interviews, and Stevens deliberately hams up his Russian accent for laughs, but Brosnan can't manage the accent at all, often letting his Irish slip through. And of course Will Ferrell is just Will Ferrell with a vaguely foreign accent. McAdams absolutely steals the show though, knowing precisely when to be funny (and often out-humouring Ferrell), and when to be serious. She'll be tugging at your heartstrings as much as your funny bones. The delivery of her lines ""The Elves went too far"" and ""I wrote that song for you"" could've been from completely different movies, but the impact is not lost from either.Of course being a movie about Eurovision, music plays a big part, and on that it did not disappoint at all. The vast majority of the music in this movie is original, written specially for it, including Jaja Ding Dong, which was written to feel like a traditional pub track that Fire Saga just cover in their local pub. Almost every single track written for the actual contest is perfect, sounding like legitimate contenders. Yeah, not my style of music at all, but credit where credit is due, they're just as flamboyant, terrible, and pandering as they needed to be, toeing that careful line between comedy tracks and a feeling of authenticity. Fire Saga's own songs are actually pretty good too. I wouldn't listen to them in my own time, but Double Trouble and Volcano Man are really enjoyable tracks. And then there's Husavik - My Hometown, the climatic song at the end. Again, not my style, but goddamn was that moving, instilling me with an Icelandic patriotism I don't have (being, you know, not Icelandic), and marking such an emotional milestone for both Lars and Sigrit. It's also a fantastic display of Molly Sanden's vocals, ending on the mythic speorg note. Honestly a part of me legitimately hopes it earns an Original Song nomination. But what was up my musical alley, fit the movie perfectly, and paid more respect to Icelandic culture, was the use of a number of Sigur Ros tracks. Untitled #3 has been one of my favourite songs for years, and its use here adds an unforeseen emotional weight to its scene as well as the tension it requires. That seamlessly bleeds into Sfeven-g-englar as well, and then we get Hoppipolla as a nice uplifting track after Husavik to feel good about ourselves and our characters' journey through the story.And damnit if I didn't feel good and happy at the end of this movie. I couldn't help but smile and feel for these two characters finally getting together. But therein lies probably my biggest nitpick of the movie. We get so endeared to Lars and Sigrit so early on that it doesn't take us long for us to root for them and want to see them succeed. When things start to go wrong in public and they become the laughing stock of the competition, it stops being an embarrassing and hilarious cringe, and starts becoming a painful and upsetting cringe. We don't want to laugh at these two lovable oafs like everyone else is. We want them to show the world who they really are and prove they're capable of achieving their dreams. I just feel like there were better ways to milk laughs out of their performances, with over-the-top costumes and effects, or humorous exchanges between them, without making us feel like we were laughing at them as a cruel jest.The Story of Fire Saga is just an all round surprising movie. It's a love letter to Eurovision, even featuring cameos from previous contestants in the fantastic Song-Along sequence (almost but not quite managing to get Celine Dion in as well), respectful of Iceland's culture and people, follows a lovable couple we can't help but root for, with some genuinely emotional moments that'll have you blubbering as much as laughing, and music that's surprisingly good and perfectly fitting for Eurovision (including a surprisingly competent Will Ferrell). It's a feelgood movie that does not fail in making you feel good. I give The Story of Fire Saga a shockingly high 8/10, would watch again.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
63,ethanbresnett,An Absolute Hoot!,7,3 July 2020,"This is one of those films where you can't help wear a smile while watching it (aside from the times when it tugs at the heartstrings and draws a tear or two). It's just one of those films that's so tongue in cheek, full of life and joy you can't help but love it.I was very sceptical of this film going in, not sure whether the satire would be too much, making the film ridiculous and cringey, but I could not be more wrong. It was absolutely spot on! Now that I think of it Eurovision is so ludicrous, outlandish and lavish anyway one would have to try quite hard to go over the top with it. There was a lot of care attention in this film to recreate the live Eurovision shows, as well as the songs. I'd be lying if I said I haven't had them on repeat since watching, its a genuinely great soundtrack with some amazing songs on it. Another huge surprise from this film.The characters felt so Eurovision, and its clear that all the writers, producers and directors did their homework on the bizarre behemoth that is the Eurovision Song Contest. I found myself really invested in their relationship and their story arc, yet again another surprise to come out of this!One thing that wasn't a surprise was the performances. Will Ferrell is a comedy goliath so its no surprise that he smashed this role. As a Eurovision fan himself I think he pitched his performance perfectly. I think he was actually eclipsed by Rachel McAdams though! She was amazing in this film, so funny, emotional and charming. Dan Stevens as well played a blinder as the Russian entry.This film is an absolute treat to watch.

65,akcenat,Utterly ridiculous but wonderfully feel-good entertaining,8,7 July 2020,"Netflix (123 min) new movie arrives with little buzz or advertising, yet in a world of COVID-19 pandemic it's quite O.K. to say that the world needs movies like ""Eurovision Song Contest"". Fire Saga's core of sweetness might just keep growing on you more and more in hindsight. The film is perfectly watchable, light and goofy funny. The kind of movie that is really built for viewing at home and the type of film which doesn't push the limits of this type of comedy. Some aspects work better than others, but inaccuracies do not affect the overall enjoyment. All of the musical segments were amazing and I will definitely look for the soundtrack on Spotify. Director David Dobkin's visiable experience shooting music videos for the likes of Elton John and Maroon 5 ensured staged spectacle. Rachel McAdams was both gorgeous and hilarious, while her sub-plot was very heart warming and her character overall was such a joy to watch with an almost childlike naivety on her journey of self discovery. Other highlights include Dan Steven's brilliant inspired Russian entry. Pierce Brosnan is absolutely brilliant choice for Ferrell father because the sheer irony of casting him following his role in ABBA adaptation ""Mamma Mia"" is genius. The film also features the BBC's talk show host Graham Norton as a color commentator. The finale is gloriously uplifting and guaranteed to make your heart Ja Ja Ding Dong, while 'Eurovision' itself would be proud, especially since there is no Eurovision this year which makes this film is a quite suitable replacement. I also hope to see the real Eurovision Competition in 2021 look somewhat similar to this, with Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams making a surprise appearance.Rating: 8",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

67,Mike_Devine,We all desperately needed this distraction,6,26 July 2020,"Will Ferrell's recent filmography has been hit or miss, to say the least. In fact, when is the last time we've been treated with an actual ""good"" Will Ferrell movie? Well, it may not be a masterpiece, but the 2020 Netflix original 'Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga' is an over-the-top take on the annual campy competition that engulfs Europe over bragging rights for the best performer in all of the land.In 'Eurovision,' we witness the unconventional partnership between Ferrell's wannabe ABBA-like global star Lars Erickssong and his partner Sigrit Ericksdóttir (Rachel McAdams in an uncharacteristically comedic role) - also known as Iceland's dynamic singing duo Fire Saga. Of course, anything can (and will) happen on the road to the big show, as we find out. Yes, there's a lot of manufactured drama here, and general silliness, but 'Eurovision' somehow manages to show it has a heart.Perhaps the most surprising aspect of 'Eurovision' is its soundtrack. Given low expectations, it's a refreshing surprise to hear tracks like the future Icelandic anthem 'Husavik' and of course the earworm that is 'Double Trouble' (we'll ignore 'Lion of Love'...yikes). The omnipresent beats and synths of Eurodance string the cliched plot along in a way that makes it feel less offensive.Again, it's definitely not perfect, but for what it is, 'Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga' is a welcome escape in a year that has been in dire need of saccharin distractions.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
68,SnobReviews,Overly long with some funny moments.,4,1 July 2020,"""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story Of Fire Saga"" has funny moments but running a little over two hours makes it hard to fully enjoy.
.
In this comedy, when aspiring musicians from Iceland are given the opportunity to represent their country at the world's biggest song competition, they finally have a chance to prove that any dream worth having is a dream worth fighting for.
.
I'm going to say it again and again, but the real buzz kill here was the run time. There were many scenes that could've been edited out and many scenes (especially the contest ones) were repeated over and over. Ferrell and McAdams were surprisingly good together. Rachel McAdams delivers a funny performance you don't often see her portray. The real scene stealer though was Dan Stevens as the Russian competitor; I'd watch a movie just about his story. Overall, a few funny moments, catchy songs, but way too long, making it an okay film.

Director: David Dobkin
Starring: Will Ferrell, Rachel McAdams, Dan Stevens, Pierce Brosnan, Graham Norton, Demi Lovato, Mikael persbrandt etcOverall rating 74/00Eurovision story of the fire sage is abut two aspiring musicians called Lars (Will Ferrell) and Sigrid (Rachel McAdams) get the opportunity to represent Iceland in the Eurovision song contest, but things don't go smoothly, and the group, their friendship and relationships with others are at stake. This movie was crazy and far from perfect, but if you accept what it has to offer then like me you should have a great time with it let's talk about it more in detail.First of all, there was great parent/child relationships and likeable characters and main performances. I thought the relationships between the two main characters was really interesting and provided good motivation for the characters, the fact that both parents didn't believe singing should be something that there kids should be doing gave them the motivation to prove them wrong and earn there respect so this was well done. I thought the main comedic performances from Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams were fantastic. They were both so odd yet charming and really loveable that you couldn't help but fall in love with them throughout. They were both also hilarious with so many laugh out loud moments during performances or Will Ferrell being his usual hilarious self. The whole film had likeable characters which made it so much fun to watch, and gave you ads an audience member more people to connect with.However, my first two negatives will sadly have to be that the movie was fairly generic and there was some very predictable set up of conflict. The movie and it's characters was definitely something we have seen been done on multiple different occasions and sadly the film didn't do much to get away from that which was a shame because it shows a slight lack of creativity with the plot. The film also had very predictable set ups of conflict. It was obvious from the beginning that Sigrid had a much better voice then Lars that came as part of the comedy, so it was obvious that her going solo and people trying to separate them was the obvious plot point and set up of conflict was going to be before it even happened.My next few positives would be the soundtrack and the set pieces. The film's soundtrack was fantastic, it provided some funny moments, some heart-warming and breath-taking moments, and some pure moments of joy. There were some really good songs as well which I was pleasantly surprised at, they had many fun scenes playing with different songs so this was great. Also, the film actually had some really nice set pieces. The location of Iceland was beautiful and well explored throughout multiple scenes. The staging of the competition was also great and as expected wild.My final few negatives would be that there was some odd creative decisions with the characters, with a lack of depth to them and the plot, whilst also having some out of place characters and conflicting tones. I thought that some of the creative decisions for some of the characters were slightly odd and didn't really fit with the desired tone of the film. The man in charge of picking the competitors for Iceland was strangely obsessed with making sure Iceland didn't win which just didn't work. And some of the decisions made for Lars and Sigrid I also didn't agree with and either made the film more generic or made you not like Lars as much. The whole plot and characters also didn't really have a lot of depth and were very one dimensional with there personalities and their development throughout. I also found the combining of musical and comedy genres at times very conflicting and not always consistent. I felt like the comedy was slightly out of place with some of the songs. Will Ferrell also felt out of place sadly sometimes as well, he couldn't sing which was funny but tarnished some of the soundtrack and his humour when used correctly was great but sometimes wasn't needed.My final few positives would be the funny set up for the competition, the heart-warming tone and satisfying ending. The whole set up of fire saga doing dreadfully and obviously not being good enough to get to the semi finals but the boat with all the other contestants on, was slightly controversial but for me absolutely hilarious and gave both of the characters the motivation to work harder. The film also had a very heart-warming tone. The charm of the characters and the bond between the main performances really made me feel all cosy inside and constantly put a smile on my face. With that being said the finale was very satisfying. When Lars and Sigrid finally reunited it was worth the conflict, it also introduced us to the best and most powerful song in the film. I also liked that they didn't win the competition, but they won the hearts of everyone in the film and I am sure everyone watching.Overall , despite issues with the tone and some creative issues. Eurovision story of the fire saga. Is one of the most charming and heart-warming comedies of the year, making me a fan of Will Ferrell once more.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

From the outside looking in it looked like Eurovision would be one of Ferrell's misses, but it stays true to his nature without erring on the irritatingly wacky. Although not hilarious, with no major laughs, it's of course incredibly light hearted, full of daft scenes and running jokes supporting the plot.Anyone who enjoys Eurovision would love this, it represents the campness of the real contest, is relatively accurate to events, and has a ton of Easter eggs for fans, with former contestants popping up regularly. The story is strong enough, with a surprisingly emotional connection created. There is really unnecessary CGI added in some areas, and certainly not Ferrell's funniest, but he has a decent voice being supported by songs which could quite easily be from the real contest.

73,themadmovieman,Eurovision fans will love it - a hilarious and loving mockery of the world's most insane singing contest,8,26 June 2020,"I really can't believe I'm saying it, but I absolutely loved this movie. A bizarre adaptation of the annual festival of insanity Eurovision Song Contest, this is such a funny movie, complete with a delightful blend of all-out chaotic slapstick and loving mockery. Narratively and structurally, the film is a nightmare, but it's so much fun you'll struggle to notice at all.But first things first: if you don't know what Eurovision is - then this film won't make a lick of sense to you. It is a funny comedy in and of itself, but the lovably chaotic fun factor of the movie really comes from its mockery and tribute to Eurovision and its many idiosyncracies.On the flipside, if you're a big Eurovision fan (like myself), then you're going to love this movie. It gets the essence of the contest exactly right, not only in the way it makes fun of Eurovision, but also in the form of its musical numbers, costume design and more.In all honesty, some of the songs in this movie are real toe-tappers - and far, far better than they have any business being in what I expected to be just a throwaway slapstick comedy.Perfectly paying tribute to the annually chaotic song contest, The Story Of Fire Saga is filled to the brim with references, cameos and more to the best that Eurovision has had to offer, all the while poking fun at its most ludicrous characteristics - of which there are hundreds.As a result, I was laughing my socks off all the way through this movie. A love and affection for Eurovision definitely goes a long way in enjoying this film, but beyond the way it mocks the contest so brilliantly, there are still countless hilarious gags throughout.Though it stumbles in a fairly low-energy opening act, when the contest really gets into gear, this film steps up to a whole new level. It pounds with the same delirious and insane energy that the real life contest does every year, and it throws joke after joke after joke at you - creating a comic momentum that's totally irresistible.Sure, the pacing may be all over the place, the screenplay might be predictable and structurally awful, and some of the songs might go on a bit too long, but such great comedic and musical energy hammering right the way to the finish, who really cares?Eurovision Song Contest: The Story Of Fire Saga is as gleefully silly as the real-life show, and it knows it.

It's a kitschy and camp annual event that is roundly ridiculed by just about everyone in Europe and is never even heard of by the great unwashed in AmericaIt's such a fine line between a funny movie and a dud. ""Blades of Glory"" had me rolling in the aisles but this one had me hitting the fast forward button every couple of minutes , trying in vain to get a chuckle. None!Almost as bad as ""The House"" but really nothing could get as bad as that one, and the problem lands squarely in the lap of Ferrell.He co-wrote the script (with another ex SNL alumni) and it's heavily borrowed from The House.A very similar plot to ""Blades of Glory"" but it missed the mark by a wide margin.Ferrell's penchant for showing us severed limbs and hacked up faces just doesn't come across as funny any more and he seems to want to use these tricks when the plot dips into a deep valley.It's a pretty good premise to spoof the Eurovision Song contest but you've got to have some good satire and parody to pull it off and this just don't cut the mustard. The scriptwriters just ain't talented enough to draw the humour out.I've said it before about other movies and I'll say it again about this one.It's like watching a horse plowing a potato field, you know there's something happening but you're not interested enough to see what's going on.Some of the scenes are so embarrassingly ""unfunny"" that they must have given the colorists extra pay to take out the red faces... just cringingly bad.Netflix never listens to me ( or at least they haven't so far) but let me give the executive some advice.
Have someone check on the project during the process, someone to look at the rushes .. because it's obvious that nobody did .
If they had a quality control system then the plug would have been pulled on this bathtub of cold water, or somebody, somewhere would have said ""hit the reset button""I know comedy films are very very hard to get right , it involves a lot of luck , a funny cast and a spoofable subject. This one only has one out of the three and you can guess which one it is.Dan Stevens is pretty good , showing that he can shuffle off the typecasting from Downton Abbey, Rachel Mcadams is sometimes very difficult to look at.
As for Will Ferrell, well his SNL type humour is a thing of the past.This movie comes across as one of those lame sketches on SNL , sketches that have you wondering how they made it on the screen.(and there's lots of 'em)I just can't watch that show any more and I wouldn't be the first in line to re-watch this movie, that's for sure.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

81,Jared_Andrews,Will Ferrell Can Still be Funny,6,30 October 2020,"I very nearly ignored this movie entirely because Will Ferrell's recent run of laugh-free pseudo-comedies, like 'The House,' 'Holmes and Watson,' and the sequel everyone asked for 15 years ago but stopped asking for five years ago, 'Zoolander 2.'Will Ferrell, one of the beloved comedy gods of my youth, had forgotten how to be funny.This reality devastated me. I had spent hours watching and re-watching his early movies, always laughing uproariously. These were movies Ferrell not only starred in, but movies he often wrote. The guy was a one-man comedy tornado. And then he wasn't.So, when I saw the promo for 'Eurovision' I was content to give it a hard pass. I was not about to let Will Ferrell hurt me again. But then one friend told me the movie was funny. Then another. I decided to give it a shot.Remarkably, within the first five minutes, I could already tell this movie was different than Ferrell's recent bombs. It was sweet, and it was endearing, and most importantly, it was funny.Granted, it is not masterpiece. Sure, Rachel McAdams' accent disappears and reappears, often in the middle of a sentence. It's okay. I accept the flaws, because Will Ferrell showed me he could still be funny.'Eurovision' tells everyone it's okay to believe in your dreams. I'm telling you it's okay to believe in your past-their-prime comedy heroes. They just might come through for you.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

87,RhapsodyReviews,I Wasn't the Right Audience,4,7 July 2020,"Review:
'Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga' is a musical comedy film directed by David Dobkin. The film follows Icelandic singers Lars Erickssong (Will Farrell) and Sigrit Ericksdóttir (Rachel McAdams) as they are given the chance to represent their country at the Eurovision Song Contest.
A movie that has a better soundtrack then it does story, that's this movie. I didn't go into it with the highest of expectations, the trailers didn't get me excited at all, but the star power of Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams was strong enough to get a viewing from me.
With me basically watching this movie because of its stars, I was hoping they would be as good as they are in other films, but they are a massive let down in this. Will Ferrell's comedic presence was very flat, and he was not his charismatic self he can be. Rachel McAdams was better to watch her work on screen, but her Icelandic accent was horrid, and it always throws me off when they get an actress that doesn't sing the material with their co-star. Will Ferrell was singing in the film where Rachel McAdams parts to dubbed over by a professional singer. This was also the case with Dan Stevens character, but he was able to provide a better and bigger on-screen presence then the two leads in the film, and that's another problem.
This may be yet another film that just wasn't made to be viewed by myself. It is getting very good reviews both critically and by audiences saying it is a good representation of how important Eurovision is. I just don't feel that it was made to be a comedy because it didn't have any jokes that landed to me and they possibly should have had actual Icelandic actors in the film. I will say that the ending of the film was beautiful and had my eyes glued to the screen, but it also feels like it should have been in a different film.
Overall, this movie was a miss for me, but am I only one of many reviewers. There are also some sad moments in the film which I love, but they are very subtle, and you will miss them if you don't pay attention. Maybe if you don't go into this movie expecting it to be funny or a typical Will Ferrell film it will come off as a better film. It was better than 'Holmes and Watson', but that's the best thing I can say about this film.

94,snowfre,A wholesome film but it won't rain any 12-points over it,5,27 June 2020,"""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga"" follows two Icelanders (probably not siblings) who dreams of entering the eponymous contest and as they do, personal problems risk tearing them apart. Featuring a more downplayed Will Ferrell with a comedic style lacking much of his trademark insanity, he and McAdams gives the film a surprising emotional weight with quite tender performances. Most Europeans will most certainly also enjoy the quite spot on depiction of what Eurovision is, a rather tacky but highly entertaining campy event, an aspect that Ferrell, an American, managed to pull off gracefully well. What this Eurovision odyssey would need to make the two hours it takes to watch it more worth the while is a few more dramatic turns, and perhaps daring jokes. This take on the pan-European music festival might satisfy hardcore ESC fans hunger for the festival slightly, but ""The Story of Fire Saga"" doesn't do much more than that.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
95,Radu_A,Not as bad and not as good as it could have been,7,27 June 2020,"As the other reviews said, it's goofy as to be expected, half of the jokes don't land, it's twenty minutes too long. But it is also a film that the world needs right now. Americans regard Eurovision as a horrible trashfest of bad music, but they also envy us Europeans for it because it is a festival of unity in the face of all that divides us. That's what it's for, and that how it works. The film brings that across quite well, especially in the singalong scene with former contest participants.The best part are the ""you stupid Americans"" jokes- it's funny because it's true! We really don't like you, and we slurp Starbucks cinnamon latte - very good roast! We are such hypocrites! Almost as much as you are! The puns on Russia are also pretty good. The worst part is Iceland. Iceland is not Ireland, so why are Brosnan and elves in it? I know it's just a one letter difference but be careful when you rip on us Europeans. Because now we can say, haha, those stupid Americans want to make fun of us, but they can't even get the island right :-)",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

100,Golden_Hope,Lighthearted Fun That Goes On and On...,5,26 June 2020,"This movie i feel is two separate movies. It is one part a Romanic Comedy/love story and then the other is a Bizarre Eurovision parody/satire. And I feel like this movie gets in the way of it's self.The most successful part for me was the Eurovision side. It just works better. It captures the silly, fun, cheesy aspects of the Eurovision Song Contest. People have been saying that this movie is ""weird and bizarre"" and I agree somewhat but I think it can take it self serious at times. It has flashes of bizarreness but then gets weighed down by other things. I think the best scene is at the big party where it is a huge ""flash mod/singing medley"". It is so strange but so fantastical.The jokes...they are not that great. Some are like fine but others just don't land at all and to make it even worse you are forced to listen to them twice a lot of the time. Characters will constantly repeat a joke that has just left another characters lips seconds ago. I don't know if they thought it was so funny that we needed to hear it twice or if they just didn't want us to not hear it and miss out.The songs are really good. They really capture that cheesy, over the top, fun energy of Eurovision. They could all pass as Eurovision songs but they are also tinged with humour so I really think they did a good job on them and someone really took the time to get that right.The start of the movie is also very pretty with the shots of Iceland, it really makes you want to go and visit it.Unfortunately this movie is also too long. 2 hours for a story that could have been told in 1 hour 20. I think they needed to trim it down and tighten it up. It also seems paced strange as there seems to be a few like climaxes where you think ""oh it must be ending soon...oh no wait there is still 30 minutes left"".So you could watch it especially if you love Eurovision. You will find something you like about this movie.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
101,rmmil,Good with one minor issue,7,29 June 2020,"This movie will probably surprise you. Yes, it's a typical Will Ferrell movie with lots of silly jokes, but it also (surprisingly) has genuine heart, and a plot that actually drew me in.Also, as it is billed as a ""slap stick comedy"" by Netflix, I was a little surprised by how much of a musical it actually is, and the music is pretty darn good!As actors, Will Ferrell does his usual serviceable work in comedies playing the quasi-jerk, and I've always been a fan of Rachel McAdams as an actress, but her performance was my only ""issue"" with this film.It always bothers me when a musical gives a major, perhaps lead, role, to someone who can't actually sing, so they get dubbed by someone who can. I honestly don't know why they didn't just cast the actual singer in the role (I'm guessing it's because Molly Sanden, the actual singer, is even younger than Rachel is).I also thought the pairing of Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams as a romantic couple was very hard to believe, for reasons that should be apparent to anyone with eyes.Disregarding potential chemistry issues, though, this was a fun movie, and far better than most anything Netflix puts out.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
102,hoernkeem,"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga review(2020, David Dobkin) Ferrell stars in a comedy as fresh as an Icelandic morning",8,12 February 2021,"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga (2020, David Dobkin)
This film was released on Netflix in June of 2020. It was originally scheduled to coincide with the actual Eurovision Song Contest but that would up being canceled due to the COVID pandemic. The film is right in the typical Will Ferrell comedy wheelhouse with him doing another take on his singular comedic schtick. You run the risk with actors like these that the similar comedy will eventually wear thin. For the most part all of Ferrell's comedic characters are different themes of the same oblivious oafish style from Ricky Bobby to Jackie Moon to Ron Burgandy. For this material and this film though I think the Ferrell comedy is working quite well. Rachel McAdams costars doing a similar form of comedy and for her it is a bit of a departure thus adding fresh and fun new blood to a comedy mold that is pretty well worn.
In the small town of Husavik, Iceland we are introduced to Lars and Sigrit played by Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams respectively. From a young age they become fascinated with the Eurovision Song Contest. Really it is Lars who is fascinated and Sigrit just follows him because she adores him. They grow to adulthood as best friends and bandmates. Together they are Fire Saga and they make money around their small town gigging but dream of one day performing on the Eurovision Song Contest. They are not actually bad singers or performers. You would think that some comedy might arise from that, but their actual stage shows always devolve into disaster through horrifying and hilarious circumstances and these productions fraught with peril cement a reputation as the worst performers in Iceland, but circumstances always twist to allow them to keep moving on in this competition. First the performers must win their own country and then they get invited to Scotland where each country has one performer and they all compete. That group is whittled down to 10 finalists who battle out for the victor's crown. Not only due Lars and Sigrit face that challenge but Sigrit is in love with Lars and hopes that after the competition they might actually be together and their will they or won't they love story sets up a lot of drama as well as comedy for the story. Pierce Brosnan appears as Lars' father who is extremely stoic and seemingly forever disappointed in his son. Demi Lovato and Dan Stevens also costar as fellow performers.
There are some extremely well shot music sequences in the film. The comedy is mostly silly, but most importantly it is funny. Much of the music borders on over the top ridiculousness, but if you have ever experienced European pop music I am not sure that the movie misses the mark by much, but for American audiences many of the songs will just add to the humorous production. The climactic scene for Fire Saga at the finals is surprisingly beautiful and touching bringing the story to its obvious yet well deserved conclusion. The film is well made and funny but also surprisingly sweet and tender. While at first it may seem like a mockery I think that actually morphs into homage ultimately producing one of the better Will Ferrell comedies I have experienced in quite some time.

103,pontus-randen,What a let down,3,1 July 2020,"What a missed opportunity this was. But no. The Eurovision Song Contest contains so much to make politically uncorrect fun of. Enormous amounts: All from the mostly bad songs to the grotesque participants and why not the fans themselves? Not a single joke about this. Not a single fun joke in the entire movie, to tell the truth, no matter the subject.Did Will Ferrell co-write this? Really? What has happened to him. Once upon a time you could count on old Will to deliver some unpolished fun. Not anymore, apparently.Maybe comedy has ceased to exist now when everybody is afraid of ""violating"" everybody and everything. And then simply no jokes can be made. As Ricky Gervais said:""""I think offense is the collateral damage of free speech, and it's no reason not to have free speech,"" That's what I'd say -- it's the lesser of two evils. Having free speech and some people getting upset by it is the lesser of two evils because not having free speech is horrendous.""""",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

I mean am I really going to talk about the conflict and the character arcs and stuff? Nothing is realistic in the film, nothing makes sense but it has heart. This film sings by its heart like Sigrit does. The Eurovision and all feels like a facade to a very simple but heartwarming love story(both for Iceland and for Sigrit and Lars). I laughed a lot in this film but not because the jokes were funny but because the film was funny. This film knows that it is dumb and it doesn't try to be serious. The songs are great especially Husavik, the reason I watched the film at the first place. Molly Sanden does a spectacular job. The acting is also so good. Rachel and Will's chemistry as best friends rather than a romantic couple work very well. In soap operas you want the boy and the girl to take a step because it becomes unbearable but this was quite the opposite. This film does have a villain who is the stupidest villain I have ever seen which is just perfect. Alexander Lemtov is a great character as well because he is actually quite likeable. Don't watch this film expecting a great film to think for days. After a tiring work/school day; prepare some popcorn, find a comfy place , open Netflix and forget about your current problems for 2 hours.

This movie is yet another mediocre comedy film from both 2020 and Will Ferrell. My biggest issue with this film is its humor and length. First of all, I really didn't find this that funny at all. I maybe chuckled a couple of times here and there but I never laughed at all. This film does not need to be 2 hours long. There is a lot here that can edited down or cut out entirely. This film also falls victim to many band movie cliches which makes it feel unoriginal and boring. The filmmaking here is pretty bland too. It's not poorly shot but it's blandly shot. It's not poorly edited but it's blandly edited and so on. One thing I did enjoy was some of the songs and performances. Although some of the songs are auto tuned to hell there are some that do sound genuine and they aren't half bad. Will Ferrell can't do an Icelandic accent to save his life but he was definitely trying which I commend him for. Same goes for Rachel McAdams and Pierce Brosnan. For his limited screentime, Brosnan did bring a lot of energy. I did enjoy his presence. If you enjoy Will Ferrell comedy movie's, then you would probably enjoy this.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

One minute someone sounds Spanish, the next they sound like Borat and in the next scene they are American! What is going on with this?! Granted, this is a minor detail, but it is incredibly obnoxious.I found the movie to be actually kind of funny at times. There were a few laughs, but I found that most of the jokes didn't land very well. Will Ferells stale crass mindless humor dilutes the often clever gags.The performances are nothing special, it's exactly what I would expect from any other will Ferrell movie. I must say though will Ferrell is looking quite poor. Which rather disgruntled me, considering his paring with the god-dess Rachel McAdams ;)There was absolutely no chemistry there.Overall, it is a mildly funny, entertaining movie with weak lazy writing, average performances performances, and surprisingly okay music.It's on the high end of a 5Keep in mind, if Rachel wasn't in this movie it would be a 3.

It's actually surprisingly emotional and simply awesome movie, with an amazing cast. This is one of the best I've seen from Will Ferrell in a long time, probably since Anchorman 2.
This movie is a creation of Ferrell, as he's the one who co-wrote, produced and starred in it, so the credit goes to him. The funny part is, that it felt that he was a bit of mismatch looks-wise, for simply amazing Rachel McAdams.
The music is perfect reflection of Eurovision. It lifts the spirit and makes you smile.

Will Ferrell is as you'd expect Will Ferrell to be in a film like this while Rachel McAdams proves yet again that she belongs in more comedies. The songs are absolute belters and there are some very funny moments along the way however, it suffers from being a tad too long, comedies running for two hours or more will always find it hard to sustain the laughs.

However, I must say, for a musical comedy show, it really makes its mark. The underlying tones of stereotype jokes and middle school humour really makes this this a very light hearted film to watch. While there are points in the film that I do not enjoy and is very unrealistic, it all makes for a very fun film. The playful use of different pop music also really adds to the comedic elements of the film.All in all, this film isn't going to win any awards anytime soon.

For example, Iceland's Eurovision candidate Katiana Lindsdóttir - who is described as the full package - being beautiful, having a great singing voice and the perfect song, is quite symbolic of the Presidential democratic candidate of the US 2016 elections, I think, who in many ways was also the 'full package' :) Regrettably she did not quite win the US elections; due to terrible and unforeseen circumstances.

I'll spare you the deets, but they go into GRAPHIC lengths (no pun intended) about their... yeah.The acting is atrocious at times and Ferrell just sounds like a generic Borat-type satire of foreign people. Side characters like Ferrell's dad and some rival character that gets killed off 10 minutes in were most likely added in for filler.Demi Lovato, while she is talented, is STILL not a good actor. She has very little lines to work with.And now, the songs.
Holy crap.Some of them are oddly good. ""Lion of Love"" is something I would totally hear Jason Derulo or even Maroon 5 singing. That being said, a lot of the songs are EXTREMELY sexual. The writers must've had their La Croix spiked Viagra. Flirting and implied sex is shown throughout... a LOT.Don't watch it. It's lowbrow and doesn't stick with you at all after watching.

116,maanikroda,Musical!,7,30 June 2020,"Even though I'm new to the whole Eurovision thing I can say with full certainty they tried their best to be respectful to the competition show.First the Pros: The songs are amazing to listen to each one has its own personality and flair, the acting for the most part is competent they actors know what they were doing and they did their roles fine, the set designs are amazing presenting what the movie was trying to go for a grand beautiful live show setting, and the cameos from the actual Eurovision contestants make the movie even better for people that watch the competition for a long time.Now for the Cons: The jokes are mostly misses when a joke doesn't land it really shows, Will Farrell's acting can be crazier then usual and for me it does not fit the movie, and the biggest crime of the movie though is the editing to me it feels clunky at times and it can be distracting from some scene that could have been amazing.All and all the movie was fine it was pretty much a middle of the road movie, but with what I've seen from Will it could've gone worst. So watch it if you are curious, if not then you might forget about it pretty soon.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Fortunately Eurovision is still a good movie and an absolute must for the Eurovision fans who did not get their fix this year. Having grew up with the competition and seen it grow it has a special place for many with its hammy songs and overdone everything, there's still a charm about it. Although not one of his best this is still captured in the movie and the cast surely seem to be enjoying themselves - McAdams is excellent as always - a goofy colourful movie just right for a bit of light entertainment in these times.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
124,shide_85,Comedy/Feelgood movie that suprisingly works well,8,12 April 2021,"In short:
As others have mentioned and i agree, I am no fan of Will Ferrell, excluded Old School (2003) and possibly parts of Semi-pro (2008) most (oh right allmost forgot Stranger Than Fiction 2006). And in fairness he's been in a few cult movies. But this is a warm movie with a handful of laugh out loud moments, it keeps it warm even when the characters are having trouble. Parts of this working out is a stroing supporting cast and the second lead Rachel McAdams doing a performance worth ot taking note of. Will Ferrells scenic comedy is put on the backburner and allowed to be released at times with buildups beforehand which works in his and the movies favour. He's never been subtle, but here it's reigned in until the moments where it is needed, which is something he and anyone planning to cast him should take note of.Overall this is a warm laugh out loud (at times) comedy that is sure to brighten a day or a couple for you if you decide to watch it.Pro's

So far it sounds nice but not really.The movie is mostly not funny, and everything is uncomfortable to watch. The production that they really capture from Iceland to the European festival stands out in a phenomenal way without missing anything.A predictable script, and mediocre directing work.Will Ferrell is the worst of the movie, his character is uncomfortable and incredibly stupid, at no time do you empathize or feel sorry for him, his performance is hyper basic and he seems to want to be funny instead of being it.Rachel McAdams is the best thing about the film, from the performances of her trying to trace the scenes with Ferrell to the scenes of her singing or more emotional of her, she was undoubtedly a compelling character and one that can be empathized.Here you can see the usual problem in the industry of taking young actresses simulating a similar age to the male character. In the first moment of the film there does not seem to be more than 5 years of difference between the children and when they grow up it seems to be 20 years, more coherence please in the choice of cast!It is an uncomfortable film, which I do not like at all and I would not see again seriously.

No No No NoOverall, 'Eurovision: The Story of Fire Saga' is a film I will definitely not be re-watching anytime song. I appreciate the effort that went into making this, but the acting from its leads and supporting cast were, as I mentioned, very disappointing which put me off watching anymore. For me the film has many generic plot points that feel as if there just put there to lengthen the films runtime and not too actually make the film better.

I'm not an american but they really needed that scene with the americans and that wall comment could have cut that.It follows the familiar plot beginning-fun-conflict-resolution-finale but it's effective.The acting is good some of the islandic accents are weird at times and not very consistant.

138,GavWaskett,"Terry Wogan: On Iceland's 1990 entry: ""This has been typified as a Eurosong... they do a little walking and bounce about a bit.""",5,19 September 2020,"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga - (2020) - Music, ComedyI'm not sure I'm going to make many friends here as everyone I speak to seems to love this film and find it hysterical. Don't get me wrong it's amusing and mostly has its heart somewhere near the right place, but I have issues with it.Firstly, to the story, Will Ferrell plays Lars Erickssong (see what they did there with the name), from the small town of Húsavík, Iceland, whose life's dream is to win the Eurovision Song Contest, in his band - Fire Saga is childhood friend Sigrit Ericksdóttir, played by the always delightful Rachel McAdams. They play in their local bar but all anyone wants to hear is their famous song (well locally) ""JaJa Ding Dong"". Sigrit will do anything for Lars as she adores him and always has and him being one track minded purely about winning Eurovision cannot see that Rachel McAdams loves him! - Donut! Anyway, Sigrit believes in the Icelandic tradition of Elves and she asks them to help them win the contest.The film is about their journey to Eurovision, how this shambles of a band reaches the heights if Saturday Night TV, how the Elves help, how the Icelandic committee help and hinder, how the tow of them come together to fulfil both of their dreams - I don't need to post spoilers as I reckon anyway who has ever watched a film, knows where this is all going - though the exploding boat and ghosts were a surprise!What adds to this film are star turns from Dan Stevens as Alexander Lemtov, the Russian entry and favourite who loves himself and has plans for him an Sigrit, though he may well be hiding a secret, well from himself, it's pretty darn obvious to everyone else! And Melissanthi Mahut as Mita Xenakis who represents Greece and is on hand to offer advice and words of wisdom, plus the odd romantic hurdle! I need to add that Rachel McAdams is also excellent, even though her singing is dubbed, her acting is spot on and she makes Sigrit likeable and sympathetic, whereas you could've just been screaming at her to wake the heck up and stop being such a doormat! Pierce Brosnan is in obvious need of some spending money as he pops up as Lars Dad who seems to lack faith in his son (and rightly so in my opinion), why Pierce why?However - unpopular opinion alert! Will Ferrell annoys me, his Lars is completely unlikeable, you don't want him to win the contest, you don't want him and Sigrit to get together, you want the Elves to take him away and gut him like the fish his father catches! I get that is what they were going for and why Will Ferrell plays Lars, because this it the type of character that he excels in, but really you need some redeeming feature and he hasn't got one, he's just a door knob!Eurovision aficionados will love this, especially when the legends of the last few years of Eurovision pop up in the middle to join in a song together and the whole cheesiness and happiness of it will appeal to many, many people. It is bright fun; the songs are catchy and the characters beyond belief - just like Eurovision.However, Lars is such a 'JaJa Ding Dong' that he ruins the film for me. So, it's not a Nil Points from me, but I'd only award them half the points - 10/20 but if you love Eurovision or Will Ferrell or Pierce Brosnan with a beard then this is for you and you'd award it all 12 points and a place in the final!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

The first one is to entertain, to keep the audience engaged from beginning to end. The second is to evoke emotions to some extend. Some movies will evoke more, some less, but they must do this at some point. I think this movie succeeds in both. I couldn't help but connect with the characters, which made me care about their journey and empathize with them, which is a strength of this film. Granted, the script has some weakish moments, like when everyone votes for Iceland just because of pity, or when Rachel McAdams finds Will Ferrell naked in bed with the Greek girl but they didn't do anything (it's hard to believe this is true, even when the movie manages it as a truth).

If you are a fan of Eurovision you will like this even more! And if you are a fan of Will Ferrell, then don't miss this! He depicts a funny Icelandic musician who is willing to give anything to win the Eurovision Song Contest, He has some great scenes together with the female lead Rachel McAdams, (also an Icelandic musician in the film), who is giving an amazingly heartfelt and sweet performance. The music in the film is great and the performances of various artists are rather notable and give that special Eurovision vibe. Also the production of this film is supported officially by EBU (European broadcast union) so the realism in the competition rules, style and overall look in the film is great. Not to mention the beautiful Icelandic scenery and some funny stereotypical comments from Europeans about other Europeans, and mentions to countries such as Greece, Russia, Sweden etc. All together, creates a kind-of magical sweet success story about true love, about following your passion and about being proud of what you do.

Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams are a match made in heaven. And the rest of the cast is great, especially Dan Stevens as the man you love to hate.
I am a little surprised that so many viewers thought that if you don't like the Eurovision Song contest then you might not enjoy this movie. OK, the main character is obsessed with Eurovision but on the basis of this film you have to think that maybe Icelanders are equally obsessed.

Dan Stevens as the sexy Lion of Love is a complete treat. His performance would easily win a real contest. There is a kind of menopausal Glee section in the middle with previous euro winners doing their stuff and there were several very funny laugh out loud moments.

However, it's exactly this bizarre, stereotypical, crazy approach and feel-good naivety what makes this film charming.Actors seem to enjoy themselves - Ferrell is simply being himself, McAdams is ultimately adorable, Brosnan typically charismatic and Stevens really shines as a homo-Russian.Musical performances reflect real Eurovision, so they are cheesy, over-the-top, catchy and horrible - all at the same time (that's important). Especially the Lordi parody (song ""Running with the Wolves"") is good and ""Husavik - My Home Town"" from finale deserves an Oscar for best original song.Objectively speaking The Story of Fire Saga is by no means great or even good, but it IS an enjoyable, heartfelt little gem for those who like Eurovision for what it is.

I saw nice acting from Will Ferell like always. Also, Rachel McAdams was great at acting. The movie shows a lot of nice locations in Iceland. However, almost half of the movie is on stage. The movie shows different plays and auditions for the contest. Those songs are exciting and fun to watch. In my opinion, comedy movies teach us important lessons most of the time.

Icelanders may have a thing about elves, I am a Brit and we have a thing about the weather and always complaining about it. No other countries understand and yet it is part of who we are and we're proud of it. The World would be a very sad place if we can't make fin of ourselves once in a while.

158,gazzalodi,"Will Ferrell is himself, Rachel McAdams shines",7,5 July 2020,"Will Ferrell always plays a doof, no matter his characters background or nationality they will be a doof. Sometimes good, sometimes cringe inducing. Lars is one of his more mild ones so the movie was not as terrible as it could have been. Rachel McAdam's Sigrit is the star of this show for me. The humor from her isn't about playing a fool, more like playing an innocent who tries to see the best in people and her running gags are never overdone. I would have rated this much lower if not for her. The supporting cast, including former Eurovision participants is serviceable and is a benefit to the film as well.

165,askeland89,Great music and great fun!,8,29 July 2020,"I watched this movie while surfing on Netflix, it was completely random. At first I thougt it was a documentary of sorts. You can imagine my surprise when I found out it was an actual movie with an actual plot. 10 minutes in and I was completely sold. The story ( tho simple ) is easy to get invested in. Couldn't help but feel a bit sorry for this Lars character and I really wanted to know how it was gonna end for him and Sigrith. I fell in love with Husavik and I'm thinking about traveling there after this whole covid-19 thing comes to an end.You don't have to be a Eurovision fan to enjoy this movie.

That being said, there are some very funny moments, fine acting, and some original ideas.

I had very low expectations for this film, but then was drawn in by the brilliant small-town feel, where people went to grade school with the cops. The characters are generally noble, the story line has a few delightful plot twists, and some of the comedic view switches were hilarious.
Under the surface of this film were a few themes: the warmth of a tightly-knit small community and the multicultural nations of the world, the comparison of casual relationships versus lifelong friendships, and the value of perseverance, Viking style.
I can not stop singing Ja Ja Ding Dong.
This movie is enjoyable for guys and gals. Sigrit's character seemed to combine Julie Andrews (Maria), Meg Ryan (Sally), and Uma Thurmond (Beatrice). This movie is bringing.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
168,cristinalinderman,A cute film with a lot of heart.,6,30 June 2020,"* There is no end credit scene *The director David Dobkin and crew brought a cute film with a lot of heart. The story is about two singers chasing their dreams to win the Eurovision contest. I keep re-watching the part at the beginning where they sing in the garage, loved it, and only the first seconds before he says Volcano Man, after this well its cheesy but before it's so powerful. I didn't felt this movie was aiming to get me to laugh but there were so many good humor lines. I like this kind of humor not too much and too little but it had too many cringe moments for my taste. The theme is clear as to always follow your dreams no matter what other people say. There were so many random moments in which were incredible making this film also kind of awkward in a very good way. The elves part was so adorable and fun, it made the story more magical. The song-along scene was the essence of this film, it gives the significance of unity.The composer Atli Örvarsson brought sweet music and it goes well with this storyline because it keeps it honest and pure.The cast was wonderful and it had two magnificent lead actors, Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams. Will Ferrell was also one of the writers, he is among my favorite actors, I love how serious he acts in a comedic atmosphere. Rachel McAdams another favorite of mine was the heart of this film, her character had a lot of sweet innocence and it made her enchanting how I loved to watch her sing. Their connection was so delightful and beautiful. I can't forget about Dan Stevens and Melissanthi Mahut, the ones who gave the film its intensity and spark with their performances.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

The US makes movies primarily for an american audience. Of course they'll make this. They have the money, the skills, and the experience to pull this off and THEY SURE DID!! This movie had it all. The songs were actually SO GOOD! The singing was amazing. The story was obviously nothing original. But it's like eating your favorite ice cream. You've had it a million times and it still tastes great!And to all the 1 star reviewers - you must seek help immediately because you clearly need a reality check.

It's a really fun movie with lots of wonderful Eurovision nostalgia. But, then there was Ferrell. I know he wrote and produced it, but he should have spared us all and not starred in it. I just couldn't get over him - his age, his acting, his being. Shame really. If you can stomach Ferrell playing a middle-aged man very poorly, then you may just enjoy this movie wholeheartedly.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
176,heratyplant,"Good, Bad & Odd, Nearly But No!",4,11 July 2020,"Farrel is apparently a massive Eurovision fan, due to his European wife, but he came to it late & with his American eye, it starts out on the wrong foot & never really recovers.That is not to say there aren't glimmers of good, or even great in fact something good happens every few minutes, unfortunately everything in between is wrong & ruins the good bits. The script & editing are the culprits & with that you have to blame the director for not fixing these problems! Every five minutes or so a scene happens & you think ""did I just miss something"" as it feels like a scene was missed out, so, either they didn't film enough, or the editor is hopeless, or maybe both.The start is great & very beautiful, shooting on location in Iceland, somewhat unusual for an American production, as they will endeavour to shoot near to home if at all possible. As the film continues you realise that they were on location in Iceland as they'd come to Europe to film at the 2018 contest held in Portugal (although much of the film was shot around Scotland). This is most apparent at the 50 minute mark & one of the high points of the film, when at a party, actual contestants from that years contest, all take part in an impromptu sing-along, many non European viewers may not realise this, but either way, it's enjoyable. Why the film never says it's in Scotland or Edinburgh is crazy, it's all you'd hear at the real thing, you even see Edinburgh Airport.One of the lowest & totally unnecessary points is when the fiery ghost of Katiana appears, it's not only a bit of a shock for a light comedy, but it's totally pointless, he could've discovered that 'he was in danger' in any number of ways without the supernatural. As the halfway point approaches & the semi finals begin, anyone not familiar with the contest, i.e. most Americans, would start to find this all very confusing & this again is a failing of the film to adequately describe what's happening to the uninitiated. Then the film puts on another good show, as we're presented with a classic mix of Euro-camp-silliness, then it snaps back to our home Icelandic village for a quick scene, just as we'd forgotten about them, thanks edit!!!The current host of the UK show, Graham Norton, is cast as himself, but his performance is very flat & humourless, it would have been funnier with someone very camp & possibly drunk. Graham's also shown talking over the song as they compete, this would NEVER happen, it would be against the rules!!At this point, 80 mins, you realise the film's too long & that there's a long way to go. It may sound silly, but I actually felt used by the filmmakers, in that they piggybacked a mediocre film on a massive event like Eurovision, in order to make their film look bigger & better.On a final positive note, the film does pick up in last 20 minutes & their alternate song is lovely, very Eurovision & could've been a winner in itself; we then get another side slap, as we're robbed of a seeing the winner crowned, but the story requires that we don't get this scene.Farrel may enjoy doing this 'wide-eyed idiot abroad' act, but as a viewer, I hope he will realise it's time to do something else.As a viewer & lover of the contest for 44 years, nothing would give me more pleasure than to rave about Fire Saga, but it really is a missed opportunity, Eurovisions big screen chance, but it is thoroughly let down by a confused, messy & uninspired screenplay, a film apparently by David Dobkin, note to self, I must try much, much harder should I be lucky enough to get this opportunity ever again.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

It a Will Ferrell Movie so you already know what to expect. He's not overdoing it in this one though. Not too much over the top. the jokes work well for me.
Of course you pretty much know where the story is going so there are not too many surprises. Except maybe at the end. They found a pretty good ending for the movie. the female lead Rachel McAdams is also great. the have good chemistry together on the screen.

185,kelvynchin,"Sweet, touching and feel - good romantic comedy!",8,28 June 2020,"This is a wonderful feel good romantic comedy starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams as a fictitious Icelandic duo ""Fire Saga"", Lars and Sigrit, who inadvertently end up representing their country in the Eurovision song contest. Although often ridiculed by even their own town folk, they nonetheless ultimately bring pride to their country and their hometown.The movie has been panned by some critics, who I felt kind of missed the point. Perhaps they were expecting a more traditional Will Ferrell comedy. But essentially, the movie is a winking tribute to the sometimes gaudy and goofy world of the eurovision contest, and also a romantic comedy (as Sigrit is in love with lars, who is oblivious to it all). Pic also features many cameos from contest winners who do a raucous sing-a-long in a nightclub, Demi Lovato and there are numerous fun and rousing musical numbers throughout it's runtime; meanwhile, Dan Stevens shows up in a slinky and uproarious turn as a Russian singer. Pierce Brosnan does a fine icelandic accent as Lars' fisherman father. There are some funny bits as well, including a laugh out loud moment involving elves. Yes, elves.The songs written for the fictional band such as Volcano Man and Ja Ja ding dong are suitably silly, while ""Double Trouble"" and especially the soaring closing number ""Husavik"" is a real show stopper and a rousing capper to a completely feel good movie.So best to ignore some of the critics; especially during these dreary times of pandemic and lockdowns, it is great to watch such a heartwarming, funny, tender and uplifting movie. Sure, it is schmaltz, but it's high quality schmaltz. When McAdams sings Husavik at the end, you will likely cheer.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

The film's best moments are about human warmth and love, plus one brilliant song and one funny song. Will Ferrell brings a genuine love of the contest to the film and it is the highs and lows of the contest and getting there that holds the film together, not the laughs in-between. The other great recommendation is that Rachel McAdams reveals herself to be a brilliant comic actor. She plays the ditzy, naive but loving partner in Will Ferrell's musical duo perfectly. The location shots in Iceland are quite beautiful and Edinburgh does not look to bad too. I finished this film feeling truly uplifted.

Several past ESC winners show up in cameos, Graham Norton (as usual) is brilliant, but really the best performance of all goes to Dan Stevens (of Matthew Crawley fame). He plays the ego-driven superstar who is alternately lovable and also despicable; really enjoyed watching him in this. If you can stomach > 2 hrs of Ferrell's absurdities and over-the-top exaggerations, and if you have any appreciation for the madness that is the ESC, you'll certainly enjoy this movie.

I give it a ten because this movie could sustain my attention during its entire length, there are several memorable jokes in it, and I like both main actors, Ferrell and McAdams who never disappoint. Regarding who sings what, I listened to Swedish singer Molly Sanden and I prefer McAdams voice (if you pay attention you can hear when she is the one singing). I had a good time, I got entertained, this is all I ask from a movie, thus a ten. I must add a sidenote regarding Eurovision. It is well known that countries do not send their best over there with the true intention to avoid having to pay for the cost of hosting the show. This is not something made up for the movie, unfortunately.

Both a tongue in cheek parody and heartfelt homage to Eurovision, it may be predictable, but it's predictable in the same sense that you know what your favourite cake is going to taste like, but you are still looking forward to eating it! Whilst there is a lot in here for ESC fans (cameos from ESC stars), it's something non-fans can enjoy too. My friend expected to hate it, but within ten minutes was completely won over. Two hours may seem long for a comedy, but I got caught up in the story and it didn't drag. Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams make endearing leads and have great chemistry as Lars and Sigrit, the underdogs who may not be as talentless as everyone thinks. Edinburgh looks great in the movie too.

Both leads are terrific and likeable and they managed to make a film about the awfulness of the Eurovision Song Contest without making fun of it. That's what so good about it. It's about something really quite corny but you get roped in and feel for the characters and it even manages to be moving as well. It's not art but it is a wonderful, funny and enjoyable film.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
209,annlevtex,I Believe In Elves......,9,16 May 2021,"I gave this movie a 9 not because it's that close to cinematic perfection, but because it's still a near perfect movie. I had never seen Eurovision and was not familiar with it, but after watching this I can see why people love it. It's just so fun, and I imagine, addicting.There are a few familiar stories embedded in this: the underdogs trying to win the big contest, the BFFs who should be a romantic pair, the way a small town can feel like a trap and a warm refuge at the same time. But it's still original and fresh because of how they capture the spirit of the Eurovision contest, and how they weave the music into the story. The score is more fun than Mama Mia and the musical scenes range from sweet to powerful to downright weird, but in the best way possible.Ferrell is himself, but his deadpan, sad sack Man Child delivery works here, and he doesn't try to make the character more than what he is. McAdams is absolutely delightful, exhibiting the kind of comic timing we first saw in ""Mean Girls"" but in a far more endearing package. She's a good decade younger than Ferrell and it's a little hard to buy Sigrid's attraction to Lars, but she makes it work because she's that good.All of the supporting actors turn in good performances, particularly Dan Stevens as our heroes' primary competition, a Russian stud with an impressive baritone and a collection of statues that look like him. Stevens is seriously funny. I don't blame him for choosing to leave Downton Abbey after three years, because he is having so much more fun here and doing it so well. And the little Icelandic home town where the action begins and ends becomes a place you want to visit.Kudos to the costume department for the whacky Eurovision contestant costumes and for the ""local"" wardrobe of Lars, Sigrid et al. You know watching that people in Iceland don't really dress that way, but that's OK, it's not meant to be realistic. It's a funny, heartwarming, sweet, sometimes cheesy comedy/romance. Give in to it and enjoy, you'll leave singing.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

She is great and hope she does more comedy type roles.Pierce always gonna Pierce with them handsome grizzly looks. Dan Stevens is Awesome.A lot of dry humour with Will Ferrell but some Big Laughs throughout the movie. Parody or not can overthink what they wanted to deliver.

I loved the Song A Long scene, had some great songs in there. Costumes were nice to look at.

216,spencergauldin,Eurovision Review,5,24 July 2020,"I have to say that this wasn't a terrible movie. But it wasn't that good either. I did like some of songs featured. But there are some issues that I can't ignore.
The middle part of the movie didn't have that much going on and I got kinda bored. The pacing can be off where it's dragging some things and brushes past some parts. Some scenes are funny but it wasn't that funny. I only had a few good chuckles from it all.
What bothers me a lot is when something happens in the movie that doesn't matter at all. Why did Demi Lovato's character kept appearing to Will Ferrell as a ghost? It did nothing to the story and it wasn't funny at all. The production is fairly good in this movie. But those scenes had bad CGI for the ghost. It just throws off the movie and It's very unnecessary.
But the movie does have a more movie redeeming arc where Will's character realizes his love for Rachel McAdams character matters more than winning a competition. But it takes a while to develop and Will's character is incompetent during the majority of it.
It can be fun and enjoyable and the songs are good, but some things just don't do well.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

What made it was the inside euro jokes were clever and funny. The characters were sympathetic, not cheesy or too outrageous but enough to make them believable Eurovision entrants.Plot was nice and this is a good movie to watch with the family, my daughter loved it and immediately downloaded the soundtrack.Recommended for a watch when you simply need cheering up.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Moreover, the power behind it is an American in Will Ferrell. Then add that wonderful Canadian actress, Rachel McAdams - both coming at this subject matter from 'left field'.
At the start you think to yourself ""is this film for me"", but it then draws you in, such that by the end you become totally engrossed. This is thanks in large part to the Ferrell script but in even greater part to McAdams playing a difficult role to perfection. What a great performer she is.
No small amount of credit is also due to the effects department - the hamster-wheel scene is both hysterical and brilliant. Oh, and the music throughout is both so Eurovision and yet great to listen to.

243,MovieNinjaGuy,"Captures the heart, spirit, fun, cheese and most importantly the craziness of the Eurovision song contest perfectly.",9,28 June 2020,"If you are going to do a movie about the craziest and biggest song contest in the world you better do it right. That's exactly what everyone involved seemed to have done.Made by Will Ferrell's production company and the actual organisation behind Eurovision (The European Broadcast Union) so the research into the song contest came from the right place and everything seems very accurately executed and this is not something what you normally get from music related movies I find. There are indeed recently a few exceptions along with this film such as Bohemian Rhapsody which had a show-stopping perfect executed finale. Distributed by Netflix which sadly means there will not be a physical copy of the one movie that I think many big Eurovision fans will be passionate about.The movie has a really decent background story (with a few iffy bizarre moments to be fair - but it is Will Ferrell movie after all). However the film seems to move along exactly at the speed required and hits all the beats that it needs to leave you satisfied at the end.The movie has the unrequited love stuff, the trying to impress a parent thing, the missing of another parent, the inspiration of those who came before (mostly the Abba part at the start), the shock of a big event changing the stakes for the protagonists, the everything seems lost scenarios (several times), the help from a surprising source and the perfect wrap up and back to normality but with the prize in the protagonists' hearts and a bright future ahead + a new start. Good ingredients!The quiet Icelandic fishing town setting, which is perfect, is the furthest one could get away from a show such as Eurovision. The stark contrast can be seen in both audio and visual beats. The shots of Iceland are beautiful. The atmosphere of Eurovision is convincing. When Will Ferrell is back in Iceland as time is running out before the Eurovision finale that contrast works particular well making you feel frustrated inside. Iceland is a country that still has to win the Eurovision song contest (although they've managed to get to second place twice) so it was a good choice.Tonnes of appearances of Eurovision winners and contestants as you would expect and it is great fun spotting them in the middle musical mash up. The movie didn't come across as patronising at explaining who is who at all which is what a Hollywood movie would probably do.Will Ferrell, Rachel McAdams and Pierce Brosnan all do a great job in their roles. Special mention to the extremely passionate and aggressive ""Ja Ja Ding Dong"" fan. Exactly the craziness that a movie like this needs. Executed perfectly. Graham Norton gave the movie some extra gravitas and authority and as a British Eurovision fan I wouldn't have wanted that any other way.The film has a real feel good factor about it and it is very reminiscent of (and perhaps musically in a one place also inspired by) The Greatest ShowmanIf you are a fan of the song contest this movie will probably be on your repeat list for a while I would have thought. I can't wait to watch the entire thing again. A good lengthy production for this type of movie I should add.The music is of quite a high production value and the songs really capture the beats one would expect from Eurovision. We have the craziness, the extreme cheese from Russia's entry executed really well by Dan Stevens and more heartfelt songs. It all seemed convincing. There is thankfully also that one show stopping moment/song towards the end that a movie of this type needed to sell itself. Ironically it harkens exactly back to where the protagonists came from in the first place rather than where they thought they wanted to be. Yes, the movie is more clever if you think about all that a bit deeper indeed.A really enjoyable movie, simply a top job from everyone I reckon, all-round excellent entertainment and escapism.For me the best thing Will Ferrell has been in and since he produced this himself (after he has been in love with the Eurovision song contest for 20 years) I have to say hats off to him, really (this coming from a Eurovision song contest fan for over 30 years).In my book this would be an Oscar contender for best movie like The Greatest Showman should have been along with classic feel good movie winners such as Chicago, Slumdog Millionaire and The Artist. But those days sadly seem over. Ironically these are the movies that the world desperately needs right now. Hopefully this will still snatch best song Oscar for Husavik next year but I'm not counting on it.If you like Eurovision, you cannot afford to miss this, especially this year. It has totally made up for the lack of a proper song contest show... but even more so I'd say.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

There is only 1 criticism that I have with the movie and that is I really don't feel that they needed to have the crass humor, the movie was funny enough without them. I absolutely love the songs and especially the voice of Molly Sanden. Rachel Addams was lipsyncing. Molly Sanden's voice was haunting and sent a chill through my whole body, it was super.

255,ian-dodkins,"Sweet, touching, fun",8,17 February 2021,"I have to admit I loved this film, but not sure exactly why. It certainly has funny moments but is not set out to be all out funny.. it is light hearted and touching and any jokes hit the spot (nothing falls flat) but aren't designed to be hilarious.Will Ferell was great as was female lead. Really it's about his desire to be in the Eurovision and their unrequited love. The filming was beautiful, when they are all singing together it was touching and emotional. Films like Mama Mia should be more like this (ie with a proper story, surprises and interesting characters). I doubt if any of them were from Iceland, but that doesn't matter as the culture, scenery and characters (or more accurately characatures) are beautiful, fun and fulfilling.I feel like it did exactly what the writers and directors set out to do, but I find it a bit outside just standard genres, possibly because it is romantic, a comedy yet set in an uncommon arena of iceland/international singers. I'm not a fan of Eurovision but it did make me realise that Europe is a pretty damn cool place.. especially in the way countries and Europeans try to move along together in one direction, although a culturally diverse milieu.At the end of the film I'd felt emotional, happy, relaxed, fun filled and overall content.

I can think of 100 actresses who would have been better suited for the role, more believable... so what's going on behind closed doors? Will Ferrel is trying to be himself, and he's bored, not a character. The story of course isn't well executed, but I never expect much from a story in this satire/feel good/comedy movies - so don't take off points for it.

""I can't stand Will Ferrell""
So does every chocolate bar get a 1 star if you don't like chocolate?
This movie isn't a gripping drama. It's not edgy or groundbreaking.
It's cute, and it's fun.
It's definitely not for everyone. Expect some classic feel goods. Expect to immediately YouTube the main songs to hear them again. Expect Will Ferrell. Expect to fall in love with Rachell McAdams and silver lip gloss. Don't expect unforseeable twists.
It's ""hallmark"" meets ""pitch perfect"" meets ""elf"".Thanks Netflix and those who made this film for some feel goods in the middle of a globally not chipper time.

262,cloudbuster63,Charming,8,29 June 2020,"It's a sweet, charming film, carried in large part by Rachel McAdams' considerable charisma. Pierce Brosnan is also good in a small role as Will Ferrell's father (despite being only 14 years older than Ferrell). To me, Ferrell is the weak link. He is just growing too old for these roles -- his usual awkward man-child. He is eleven years older than McAdams and it shows -- he looks even older than his 52 years (probably 51 during filming). The character should have been only a few years older than McAdams and the film would probably have been well-served if Ferrell had kept to the writing and producing and given the spotlight to a talented younger actor.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Great acting. Music and locational settings.Cast were great. This worked cus ferrell wasn't overbearing and his humour in spurts works so much better especially with the Americans and demi lovato. Having all the branding helped solidify it. It's also a rare event USA making a film specialising in and around British TV which was nice. I enjoyed how the accents slipped from time to time to, just made it endearing.Was a good watch cheesy as hell and makes up for no contest this year, was utterly brilliant, two hours flew by. Comedy, a genuine romance that you cared about, great characters, beautiful settings and just a top filmThe only two points that knocked it down to a 9 was not having a female lead who could sing, I loved her performance but just a preference and the other was with the fixation and mention of elves, to only get a door slam and no visual was a missed bit.

In fact, the Eurovision begs to be made fun of in a loving way and this is the movie that does just that.Will Ferrell is surprisingly not like Will Ferrell in this movie so if you have had a hard time with him in the past, do give this a shot. This is a great comedy, it takes the already camp concept of the Eurovision and amplifies it just enough to make it hilarious without ever being mean.I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did but much thanks to Will Ferrell, Rachel McAdams, Mikael Persbrandt, Pierce Brosnan and Dan Stevens, I very much did.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

I ended up watching it because a good friend said it was actually a lot of fun, and I needed a good light diversion. I'm really glad I did!If this were just a straight up comedy, it would probably have failed, or at best been pretty mediocre or forgettable. What really made this movie succeed was the way it wove the comedy into the dramatic elements. Yes, it is funny, but I think the funny moments stand out more because they often come very unexpectedly. The actual story that is told here is well written and will make you feel really good!Will Farrell is pretty much doing his usual thing, which I am certainly a fan of. Dan Stevens is also great as the Russian singer Alexander. But the real star of this movie is Rachel MacAdams. She is really enchanting here. Not just because she is incredibly beautiful, but because she brings a warmth and sincerity to the character that really sells the dramatic component of the film.Oh, and the final song is really good!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Had a smile on my face (and a few tears at times) all along the movie ... I enjoyed this musical adventure from beginning to end.
For sure a comedy, but with a big heart.Will Ferrell is a genius, not just comedic but also creative. He also is a multifaceted talent who can infuse his ideas and concepts in all kinds of fields ! You clearly can feel his passion for music & soft spot for Eurovision (and everything it means ; a competition yes, but with this sense of community around the passion of music). Also, the will to show this sheer 'togetherness' through this international event that is Eurovision, is obvious and enjoyable to see, hear & feel all through the movie.Rachel McAdams' character (Sigrit) wonderfully balances Will Ferrell's character (Lars). While Lars' only focus is music & becoming famous worldwide, Sigrit brings her sweetness and large palette of deeper emotions. Two eternal dreamers that answer to one another in the most organic way. Because the chemistry between both actors is a gem that's really pleasant to witness in every scene they are together !The supporting cast (Dan Stevens, Pierce Brosnan & Melissanthi Mahut, for the most part) all nicely serve the evolution of the plot and highlight the two leads in the best possible way. And even if the movie is over-the-top at times, it also breathes multiple realistic emotions and situations that always work in this type of movie... Making you invested, cheering and feeling moved as much as you feel entertained. The movie isn't just gonna make you laugh or shed tears, because the whole soundtrack is very catchy ! The stage performances and production value pop with radiant lightings & colors !Certain scenes are really efficient and worth rewatching (the Semi-Finals' scene is exhilarating, the Song-Along one is a blast, the Final's song,...etc).Once again a Will Ferrell movie that might become a classic.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

293,Chris-742,The best Eurovision event this year.,8,5 July 2020,"..and probably would have been even if they had had a real show this year.
For me that has watched the eurovision since I was small this was an emotional roller coaster ride. The movie is not a comedy as such, even if there are more than a handful of laughs and giggles. It is more of a feelgood drama with comedic and goofy undertones. In fact I think a lot of the movie manages to hit the goofy tone of much of the Eurovision. It parodies a lot pf Eurovision song contest, which is probably lost on a casual or someone who never watched the ESC show. Payback to the americans when we had to watch otherwise good movies against backdrops of hard to enjoy or understand stuff like american football, basketball or (snore) baseball. But as well as goofiness, there are also deeply romantic and sad parts. The music, for the most part, is excellent, better than the average ESC fare.
Good efforts from Will, Rachel and Pierce Brosnan who is great as the stern and sane father.
Bad is a stretch in the middle of the movie and any mention of p----. Why is that even there?
Ohh, and this movie makes me want to go to Iceland right now. Was there for 4 days last year and it was great, beautiful country despite having few trees and friendly people.

What is left of it is almost cute.And yes it contains the essence of Eurovision, nations trying to express themselves among tens of other nations, telling their story about the local culture... probably in vain these days, but at least they are trying.Good old days...

300,The-MacMahonian,A Song for Europe,6,9 July 2020,"Eurovision Song Contest: the Story of Fire Saga is the 8th feature film directed by David Dobkin, comedy/drama author of whose previous output I (now realize I) saw Shanghai Nights (2003), Wedding Crashers (2005) and The Judge (2014, also wrote story, but not script), the 1st being excellent and the other 2 very good.Eurovision etc tells the story of the eponymous Icelandic pop duo, composed of Lars Ericksong (Will Farrell, who also co-wrote), whose life dream is to participate in the Eurovision song contest ever since he watched Abba win with Waterloo in 1974, and Sigrit Ericksdóttir (Rachel McAddams). Fire Saga happen to be extremely bad, even for Eurovision standards, and manage to qualify only after all other Icelandic contestants die in a fire at a local after party (turns out, set by the President of the central bank of Iceland, who feared an Icelandic win, which would mean they would have to host the following year´s contest, would bankrupt a small country of modest financial means...) and so off they are to Edinburgh (the film was shot before this year´s contest was cancelled because of COVID19) where Lars hopes to vindicate years of parental humiliation by his father (Pierce Brosnan, with a grumpy mock-Icelandic accent, stealing the show whenever on screen) if only Fire Saga can beat the all-European competition, which includes Russian mega star Alexander Lemtov (Dan Stevens, stealing the show whenever on screen, which he never shares with Pierce Brosnan, who stayed back in Iceland) who is also the putative 3d side of a love triangle involving Lars and Sigrit, Alexander luring Sigrit with promises of Fabergé eggs and private jets, as if he didn´t know wholesome down to earth Icelandic girls do not care for such things.The film goes for easy laughs both by caricaturing Nordic stereotypes (Eurovision shall hold the eternal wardrobe Oscar for wool knitwear) and for making fun of Eurovision songs, which is a bit like shooting fish in a barrel, except this is accomplished with a series of songs which would fit very easily in a real life Eurovision selection and nobody would have noticed.Escapism, they use to call it. Not simply, I would argue, and nothing wrong with it anyway.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
301,Julie-C-Sherwood,A film of substance that snuck up on me,10,27 June 2020,"I was expecting a run of the mill comedy. And it starts off that way, but slowly it gets not only more unique in smaller ways, but truly meaningful by the end. It achieves a message that several other films have attempted but never quite got it perfectly.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
302,EdwardNashtonReeves,Review from a long-time fan of the contest,8,26 June 2020,"As someone who not only follows Eurovision, but also national finals and the events surrounding it, I was very curious on how this film would turn out. There are a lot of misconceptions about ESC, as well as many dated associations (for instance, overblown glitter and mockery has (mostly) been left in 2000s). I love Will Farrell as a comedian, even though his last film, Holmes & Watson, was indeed really bad. Thankfully, ESC: The Story of the Fire Saga fares much better. I'll break down my review in two parts. First, analyze it as a film on it's own merits. Second, to see how it looks like as an homage to ESC.As a film, it's your standard story of an underdog dreaming big and seeking for approval. I found Lars, Farrell's character, slightly too selfish and rude to root for, but his partner Sigrid is much more likable. Farrell is still, as always, a very good comedic actor. Rachel McAdams really gives her best and easily gives one of the highlights of the film. The other standout is Dan Stevens as the Russian singer Lemtov. He was really enjoying himself and I liked how the film treated his struggles. Some of the plot-points were fairly predictable and tad generic to the genre of comedy. Some jokes were funny, but some felt a bit flat (his ''disliking'' of Americans, for instance). Interestingly, the inclusion of Icelandic folklore somehow works well. If Lars was more likable character, I'd enjoy his redemption arc even more. Sure, he does some right moves in the end, but I think some of his impulses are still tad selfish. Even so, I liked how they ''lost the contest, but won people's hearts''.As an homage, it works okay. There are several inaccuracies of how the Eurovision, or Icelandic National final works, so here we go:
Semi-finals don't have a jury voting sequence. Only ten qualifiers are announced in random order to avoid knowing the presumed winner before the big night.Spain, as a pre-qualified ''Big Five'' country would never be in the semi-final. Same would apply to the UK, Germany, France and Italy.In the end, Lars comes on the stage and decides to change the song. In the actual contest, it would have been virtually impossible to do so, as all the music background is pre-recorded. They would indeed be disqualified for doing so, though.Both the Eurovision stage and Songvakeppnin (The Icelandic national finals) stage look really small when compared to the actual stages of the last decade.Songvakeppnin usually also has two semi-finals with six songs each.There is an astonishingly low amount of security there, as Lars could just easily go inside in such a short period of time.There are also some things regarding the contest this film does right:
The songs chosen to stand-in ESC entries are pretty solid and with a slight shade of satire (which any good comedy should have) aren't implausible to see in the actual Eurovision stage. However, perhaps with the exception of Sigrid's final song, they would probably be considered too much of a gimmick to actually win. However, a top 10 result for Russia with televoting alone would be more than plausible.Worth noting, the Belorussian band has a song and staging which is a direct nod to the winners of Eurovision 2006, Lordi (even though they were Finnish).The Greek staging is heavily inspired by the staging of Moldovan representative of 2016, Lidia Isac and Ukraine's national final winner of 2019, Maruv.There are some really nice cameos from previous Eurovision winners and contestants and are worth checking out. For instance, Portuguese winner of ESC 2017, Salvador Sobral, is featured as a street musician in Edinburgh, while his song, ''Amar pelos dois'' is playing (a hilariously mismatched song to the goofy plot which occurs during it). Also, previous contestants John Lundvik (Sweden, 2019), Elina Nechayeva (Estonia, 2018), Anna Odobescu (Moldova, 2019), Bilal Hassani (France, 2019), Jessy Matador (France, 2010) and winners Loreen (Sweden, 2012), Netta (Israel, 2018), Conchita Wurst (Austria, 2014), Alexander Rybak (Norway, 2009, also representing them in 2018) and Jamala (Ukraine, 2016) are featured in the party singalong scene.British anchorman Graham Norton appears as himself and with pretty accurate sharp irony describes what he sees.William Adams, the founder of Wiwibloggs, official Eurovision fan-site, also appears in the reporters' room.Jon Ola Sand, the actual chief executive of the contest is featured in a cameo, but isn't played by himself. Still, a nice reference.Even though nothing as huge as the hamster wheel (btw, a reference to Ukraine 2014) falling off stage did happen in Eurovision, there was an incident in 2018 where a stage invader interrupted the song of the British representative SuRie and she bravely continued to sing the rest of the song. It brought her huge respect in the ESC community.Overall, I did enjoy this film and I hope it brings Eurovision closer to the general audiences. I'd like if Lars' personality was a bit nicer. I'd also prefer if the cameos were a bit more scattered throughout the film and if they had actual characters to work on. Still, it's an enjoyable film on it's own and I would recommend it.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

I'm not a will Farrell fan at all. But I was able to gloss past his idiotic presence with all the glitter and glam of the rest of the cast.
This will be an icon movie that will be remembered for years.
Be sure to listen to the lyrics of the songs. What a laugh!Best of all keep an eye out for cameos of past eurovision winners.You won't be disappointed",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
306,eejohnston-56374,Wonderfully Weird,7,30 June 2020,"Went in with fairly low expectations for this film...Ferrell has his typical over the top emotional outbursts (just like almost every film he's ever made) and once again, Rachel McAdams plays the Icelandic version of her usual angsts character choices. And yet, for whatever reason, that combination of actors and the weirdness of the storyline made for a fairly entertaining movie. My Marianne provides the vocals for McAdams which really shine on their Eurovision performance. It's probably not going to win any Oscars, but, it's surprisingly enjoyable if you give it a chance.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

SO many great faces from the Eurovision Song Contest as well as cast members from the Witcher, The Norsemen etc. I realised by the time of the Eurovision party singalong that I was laughing out loud. The costumes, the dancing, are all insanely inspired. And as an Edinburgh native, thank you for filming here in Edinburgh!

But the main idea doesn't change).When you have, this movie makes great sense and is hilarious from start to finish.Because you can't make this stuff up.This trivia explains it:...........................
Will Ferrell's interest in the Eurovision Song Contest began when his Swedish wife Viveca Paulin took him to her cousins house in May 1999 and the family turned the competition on. Since then, he kept following it.....................................Kudos to Will Ferrell, who knows about Eurovision more than most others do, after many years of watching the contest.The movie stays true to the spirit of the competition. (The voting itself could be the topic of another movie though!)You could see all the characters in real Eurovision. You actually do, by the way.Many of the characters that do not make sense? They are actual Eurovision contestants, including some winners.Will Ferrell nails it in his portrayal of the Icelandic Eurovision enthusiast.The movie nails it.You have to see it to believe it.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
319,scarlettsdad,Trying to even things out,4,4 July 2021,"Here's the thing: When one rates a movie 10/10, this indicates that the reviewer believes it to be the BEST MOVIE EVER...or at least one of a very few in the history of cinema to earn such an honor. When there are incredulous legions of reviewers who think this silly piece of fluff is the BEST MOVIE EVER and the majority has only reviewed one movie-THIS one-simply can't be taken seriously. While I don't believe it to be a 1/10, I can appreciate those who rated it so low in order to chop the trees of 10s down to a reasonable rating, and why I hope my generous 4 will help as well.Will Ferrell looks older than Pierce Brosnan, who's playing his father, and he really needs to start playing roles in his age range. Rachel McAdams seems adrift here. She can play comedy, but there is precious little to laugh at with this stinker. It's just not particularly funny, but predictable, dull and unrealistic. I really struggled to make it to the end, but I don't like to leave a review without watching the film to the end...no matter how painful it may be.If you love Ferrell, you might enjoy it.

It is actually a very sweet movie that captured the heart of Eurovision very well. I believe Will Ferrel did the movie as he was a big Eurovision fan, and whoever wrote the movie knew the show well as all the songs were spot on for the typical Eurovision songs !It had a bit of something for everyone, comedy, romance, mystery and a moral about how not to give up when the odds are against you and how to be true to yourself.Well worth a watch, and if you are familiar with Eurovision you will spot many former winners at the party in the Castle !!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
326,szokia,A Wonderful Surprise!,9,6 July 2020,"What an amazing little movie! Full of great feeling and wonderful songs. One might argue that it has no deep social or psychological statement, but I think one would be wrong. It has a wonderful, sweet story-line, which leaves you with hope and love in your heart. The music and costumes and Eurovision presentations are very enjoyable.
Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams have great chemistry and really play well off each other. They are both very touching in their roles.
I was very surprised to see Pierce Brosnan cast as Lars' (Will Farrell) father and tagged as the ""handsomest man in Iceland"". For my money, he is the handsomest man in the world! But who would have expected to see him in a Will Ferrell movie, right?
And then there is Dan Stevens! Wow! I had to do a double take (actually, a few double takes) because he looked so familiar. Then I finally figured out that he was ""that guy from Downton Abbey - the one whose character died in a car crash at the end of season 2""...! But geez! He is slimmer and much more buff in this movie and his role is 180 degrees away from his Downton Abbey role. And he looks 10 years younger than he did in Downton Abbey. And his last appearance there was 12 years ago! So, major shocker on that count! I love the role he plays in this movie - a young, very hip, pretty gay, popular Russian pop-star, who is not quite out of the closet yet, He puts on a great show and his whole story-line is just delicious!
I highly recommend this sweet, funny, heart-warming movie! Well done, Will Ferrell! This man knows how to dream!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Once it generated some great acts, but lately it has become something different. Which in itself has a certain following. This takes the decline and puts the knife in. I am get the feeling Bjork has some influence in why they have used Iceland, which seems very mean. The key Icelandic characters are all American. Naturally Will Ferrell fits the lunatic ridiculous character.Basically it misses by a mile, it's a pathetic sad film for Will Ferrell fans. It could have been a huge hit if only they'd made it a little less over the top and with Icelandic lead stars.

And the singer that does duets with him just blows me away every time she sings, and then he sings and it just really dampers it.

356,CinemaAmazing,A watchable movie but...,7,26 June 2020,"Rachel McAdams for me, in terms of acting, was the high point in the film, but I don't detract from the work of other actors like Brosnan or Dan Stevens. The soundtrack is super catchy and has songs that get stuck in your head and you might listen them again later. And Demi Lovato's cameo is something I'm going to have a hard time to forget.
For me the worst of the movie was the screenplay and Will Farrell's performance. I thought the screenplay (written by Farrell) was completely based on stereotypes and lazy comedy. Farrell's performance, on the other hand, sometimes costs a lot to look at the screen and see him perform. In my opinion, he should stick to sketching on SNL and leave films for anyone who knows how to act.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

360,RichardBJ-1,"Brilliant, if you always watched Eurovision, but always despaired of it!",8,29 June 2020,"So this was a tricky act to pull off; Eurovision itself is so ghastly parodying it seems impossible. You could just mildly edit a version and have something that to all intents and purposes would seem like a spoof. But I watch it every year anyway as a tradition. The movie, for me successfully delivered such a parody however. It was stupid, but kept to the simple plot just fine.
To enjoy, you have got to be onside with Ferrell. It is typical Ferrell. I think you probably have to be one of those people also, who always watched Eurovision and always thought it was awful!
If you either liked Eurovision (Annually) or didn't watch it I think this would be waisted on you. So that is probably a reasonably small catchment window.
Watching the Eurovision ""stars"" popping up throughout was great. If you didn't recognise them ...this movie would be waisted on you! Sorry!!
...so I have no idea how this would go down in the USA, where, presumably you don't have Eurovision? ...but if that is the case how did Will F. Even find out about it?Go forth enjoy, may be have a few drinks first....",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

After Holmes and Watson (which my kids and I have not been able to make it more than 25 minutes into) I felt that was the best I could do.But, this movie surprised. Sure, it opens with Ferrel playing his typical idiot man child, but it goes beyond that to an honestly sincere and inspirational story. The performances are all great, the characters display some depth despite appearing perhaps 1 dimensional at first, and the music is phenomenal (honestly, have been falling asleep the past few nights with songs stuck in my head). The final song (my home town) honestly gives me chills just listening to it.I'm not a big eurovision fan, I know vaguely of it and have seen some acts from time to time, but that didn't make this less enjoyable. It's not the best movie of course, it still has moments of crude humor (admittedly hilarious at times), but it's beautifully shot and well acted and overall an enjoyable romantic comedy.It's unfortunate that it was released during a worldwide viral pandemic, as I think this film would do an amazing job for Icelandic tourism otherwise (and I'm sure their contributions to production costs were certainly hoping for this).",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

When this was released in late June, I immediately disregarded it and had no intentions of watching it especially at a two hour runtime. However, after a recommendation from a friend, I decided to give it a try. And honestly, despite a few unnecessary cringe-worthy scenes, a few misfires of dry humour, and some eye-rolling dialogue, it really wasn't an awful movie watching experience ;). There are definitely some laughs to be had and a decent third act (music and performances are fine as well) - so, in conclusion I would say it's ??probably?? worth a watch!

394,vincent_tillema,This shouldn't be good...but it is,7,8 July 2020,"As a Dutchman I really wondered why. Why would you make a movie based on the Eurovision Songfestival? After all it is a weird thing 'we' do every year that 'nobody' really likes but we all take way too seriously. So when a bunch of Americans take on this event to make a movie it can only turn out to be as bad as many of the Dutch (or British) entries to the festival over the years. Right?The answer is no. Because for some reason the director and actors actually understood what Eurovision is about better than they should. Maybe better than we Europeans do. Its in all the details. Like sending acts hoping they won't win so you don't have to host. People saying they hate the show but still demanding to watch it in a bar. The outright weird songs with their bizarre lyrics (even if songs have become far better over the past 2-3 years or so). The way the American tourists are treated in this movie is almost a meta thing for this movie.The movie itself is simple but charming. A bit predictable but with great humor. There's sort of lightness to all of it that just makes it a joy to watch. Even if it drags a bit from time to time.
Ferrell and McAdams are cast perfectly even with their fake Icelandish accents that vary in thickness throughout the movie. This movie succeeds where a European production never could do. It captures the weirdness perfectly, turns everything up a notch and delivers some of the best songfestival hits ever. Its not a perfect movie but its actually better than the real deal!Go watch it!

I was compelled to pull up stakes and plant myself in Sweden, thinking it would be a 2-year commitment. Here I am 18 years later.Leaving my art rich Brooklyn neighborhood was painfully difficult. Eurovision Song Contest made that pill triple bitter. Somehow, The Strokes, TV on the Radio, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Interpol were now replaced by The Poodles, Kiki, Lordi, and Lena Ph. I was a love hostage, and Melodifestivalen and ESC were torturous. Especially, since my SO just LOVED it.Had I not uprooted myself for Sweden, I would have NEVER known about this phenomenon (which began as a friendly competition at the dawn of European television broadcasting after WWII). However, since I did, have endured watching this spectacle yearly with my SO and kids.This film hits the spot, and it was rigorous in the way it captured the big production and money behind the campy international contest, which is like paying $100,000 for a handlebar streamer. It had all the parts I would mock, but without making fun of the effort and joy these people put into it.So, I really enjoyed the movie in a very close and personal way.

410,gallopman,Eurovision works in spite of itself...,7,26 June 2020,"This new offering from Netflix is a weird, wacky romcom starring Will Ferrell, Rachel McAdams and Pierce Brosnan.While this movie never really treads new ground, it steadily reels you in largely because of the three leads. Ferrell and McAdams play two grown childhood friends who sing together as a duo/band with aspirations(mainly Ferrell's) to hit the big time and make it to a singing competition in Europe called Eurovision. McAdams happily does most of Lars' bidding because she's not so secretly in love with Lars. Truth be told, she's a far better singer than Lars by an Icelandic icy mile(I have no idea what that means). But, it's Lars' ambition that propels them to keep it through gigs.
They both decide to enter into an Icelandic singing contest that's sort of regional qualifier for Eurovision. Through some tragic, but funny plotting they both find themselves in the big show as it were.
Once in Eurovision they find they're just small minnows in a pool of big time sharks, hungry sharks at that. Enter the lusty, sexually disoriented Russian pop heartthrob Lemtov, lustily and tongue in cheekily played by Dan Stevens of Downton Abbey Fame. Now, we've all seen the plot mechanics where situations arise that place our heroes in romantic peril. This flick also mines that well trodden territory as well.
That said, this is where all of a sudden something strange takes place. The movie creeps up on the viewer and makes them start rooting for Sigrit and Lars. So much so, it's quite perplexing to figure out. That's why as someone who's seen countless RomComs, I whole heartedly must recommend this film because towards the last third of the film you actually care for the main characters and the entirety of their whole Icelandic crew. I think you'll find this weird kinship with how Icelanders must feel about their country and their little corner of the world. 7 stars...",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Eurovision is 30 minutes too long however, and one too many jokes fall flat. A less forgiving cut of this movie could be great.

However it doesn't take long until it looses it's mojo, and the tone gets over the place, there are some melodramatic moments, cheesy moments which I didn't expect, as it does to make fun of cheesy at the same time. Also it felt like they were quickly left out of jokes to make , like Lars being late for the song, storming on the stage, it was ok the first time, but then that happens again in the final act.

Its not mean and especially Iceland, which is a wonderful unique place, and deserves the spotlight here even more than Eurovision.Rachel McAdams is outstanding and Will Ferrell allows her to shine. Its full of insider jokes and observations with many guest appearances from real eurovision. It does pack a lot in although why they chose Edinburgh as host City whilst joking correctly the Brits never win! The amazing theatre used is from Israel so why not base it there?I didn't get the anti american thing either. Presumably it was anti-trump as he mentions a wall but it didn't make any sense. They never explained why he felt this way and grouped all americans together even when they helped him. I do not hate americans and regardless this bit passed me by.But overall, i thought this would be marginal and over the top. But its far better than that although maybe knowing Iceland and Eurovision helps. Has the feel of Blades of Glory and so high praise indeed.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

This movie is filled with stereotypes, which was a little distracting in the beginning. Isn't this offensive to the people of Iceland?? Then I did my research and found out that it's actually mostly foreigners who think it's offensive to Iceland, while Iceland gets the joke and is having a laugh. Stereotypes and over the top performances ARE Eurovision, so I ended up being glad they ran with it. They had some good Eurovision classic references in there and it was just an overall feel-good movie.

I decided to throw this movie on to fall asleep to thinking it would be a usual Will Ferrell movie. You know, one where he plays an idiot man child who loves to scream obscenities. (Which I love btw. Step Brothers, Talladega nights), but this movie was way more than I had expected.A surprisingly woke script, amazing character development and solid acting. Overall sending a positive message in trying times. Will was at his best and Rachel McAdams is always a gem to watch. They worked very well together.

The real Eurovision is pretty mental, so having to sit through a film about it seemed a daunting prospect! I was pleasantly surprised that this film is majorly endearing. It has really funny moments tied in with some cracking songs! Ultimately it is a really silly film, but you will find yourself enjoying it and be singing the songs for weeks afterwards. Also of note, Rachel Mcadams is phenomenal in this film! Even though she doesn't actually do any of the actual singing, her performance is stand out here!

Solid production values, some big names - but basically past-it stars (Will Ferrell and Pierce Brosnan) and a bad story/screenplay. Ferrell somehow manages to look older than Brosnan who is playing his father.The concept of a comedy based around the Eurovision Song Contest is actually quite a good one and in better hands it might have worked well but the jokes don't land.This sort of feel-good light comedy is probably better off closer to the 90min runtime mark as well and it feels stretched at 2 hrs.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

I was wrong, it really makes a good job of parodying the European hype (which isn't that exaggerated tbh) and making fun of, while at the same time somehow praising it. No, the film won't be for everyone and some might dislike it, but it feels like most low reviews are from Americans that doesn't understand the references or thinks this is so exaggerated and silly. Have even seen a review which was low simply because Will Ferrell started in it, which is ridiculous... Just ignore the reviews, good and bad, and see for yourself if you like it or not.

I think the Eurovision Song Contest is a festival for the alphabet people, which is evidenced in the winners of the last decades and the many campy contenders (also from my own country)....And still I watch it every year even when my own country sends absolute rubbish to the Eurovision. It has something unique that I cannot describe. Perhaps it's one of the few shows that bring people and family together, as opposed to everyone watching his favorite Netflix show on his/her own screen. Yes, Eurovision is campy. Yes ,90% of the music is horrible. But each year they pull off a great show overall and it's fun for the whole family....And this movie really captures that for me. I enjoyed the movie. I liked the story and the singing by Rachel Adams is amazing. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and is making fun of things that are quite common in Eurovision: over the top songs, Eastern European countries voting for each other (but don't all neighbouring countries do that).I understand a lot of the low ratings if people are not familiar with Eurovision.

Until the great year of 1985, when Bobbysocks took our first win ever. I remember a whole country in ecstasy, and all the love and unity it brought. I really believe that this song contest, has always made Europe, and the world, a better and more open place to be who we are, and it celebrates diversity and glam. 2020 is the first time the contest was cancelled ever, because, well you all know why. In the alternative show, most of us agree that this would have been Iceland's year to win it for the first time. And here comes Will Ferrell, of all people, and gives us an amazing and funny movie, where Iceland is in the center of all this. I think the elves had something to do with it. What a great way to celebrate and show the world what Eurovision is all about. Togetherness, love and great music. And of course the crazy, but entertaining parts of it all. Love it!

So I saw it just for the cast and it's even worse than I was prepared for.

Watch the actual Eurovision song contest and you will get more than enough of the same hilarious, over-the-top, eurotrashy goodness.I like Will Ferrell and I'll always give his movies a chance. But this is C-list material at best. The jokes are tired, rehashed....tired. If anything, Will Farrell and the always charming Rachel McAdams with their fake Icelandic accents make things worse. Casting a pair of young Scandinavian actors in the lead roles might have lightened things up a bit, but of course that would miss the point that this is a Will Ferrell movie.Get hold of old Eurovision song contests.

I stopped watching because it stopped being about songs, and started being about politics2. I am not a Will Ferrell fan. I usually don't enjoy his comedy type.The review:When I first saw the ""Volcano Man"" video, I thought that I should probably see this movie. I haven't seen a good comedy in ages, so I kind of hoped to get surprised.Fast forward to today, and I started watching it, with no hopes whatsoever. Just the usual ""let's spend two hours"" mindset. I can say right here that I was surprised. The movie was a very fun watch - it had just enough comedy, drama and music. Nothing seemed forced, and all the Eurovision references were awesome to see/hear!I love the lesson the movie is trying to send into the world, and hope that as many people as possible will actually understand what it is - music should be the no. 1 priority of not only this contest, but all music-shows around the world.Surprisingly, the movie was quite emotional from time to time. They nailed the 'humanity' part of it, and I loved every second of it.I understand that the IMDB score isn't as high as it should be. Many people, especially americans, have no actual idea what the Eurovision Song Contest is, and how much it used to mean for European music, so for them this is probably less interesting and fun.
As I said in the title, they should make a franchise, and each sequel should follow another European country on their path to the ESC.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

484,huggie_g,Great mock-comedy,8,30 June 2020,"The Eurovision is one of those things that almost seems like a parody in itself. This film does brilliantly to be humorous and ridiculous without going over the top.
It's an issue with plenty of Will Ferrell movies that it just becomes completely absurd and ends up being corny rather than funny.The film has a very strong blend of ridiculousness with a strong plot line that isn't lost throughout. The assorted characters are well cast and add to the story fittingly.Dan Stevens does a great job as a semi antagonist. Also playing a LGBT character without it being over the top and in your face. Hollywood has a habit of making LGBT characters ridiculously stereotypical to fit the ""appropriate"" casting rather than making a genuine character.Overall it was highly enjoyable and ridiculous comedy. Would recommend",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Now I need to point out that I am an American whose lived in Europe (in a Scandinavian country) and I totally get Eurovision, and I appreciate all its quirks, but I can totally see how this would not be a hit with an average American audience where most have never even heard of Eurovision. I think if there was a more concrete explanation of what Eurovision is it may have been better received with more people, but it's like they assumed everyone knows Eurovision and I can assure you a lot of Americans have no clue!

I thought, knowing Ferrell it would have been more of a parody of the eurovision contest, than what it really was. It felt so warm, and with so many positive emotions towards the contest. It was funny, but without mocking either the islandic community, or as said the eurovision. I'm European, not super-fan of eurovision, but very much aware of the contest. And it felt so accurate. Very good fun flick, pacing is good, entertainment value is great, comedy is good as well, never really a dull moment. It did what it set out to - entertain the people, without making a masterpiece of movie art, in any sense. You can of course criticize the movie for a lot of stuff, namely the dull plot, and the fact it isn't very original. But i'm choosing to grade this movie, for the intentions that the filmmakers had, and for what its worth, the movie succeeds. 7/10",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

You wouldn't think that a Canadian (McAdams) and an American (Ferrell) could pull off Icelanders well, but they did it to perfection. The story was both hilarious and moving, just an overall fun movie that has you smiling all the way through. The songs and its vocals are a spectacle as well. Some fantastic vocals put together by a plethora of artists who looked like they enjoyed every second of filming this movie. I think I've listened to the songs Double Trouble and Husavik a million times in the 24 hours since this movie came out!!!

I was very pleased to see that my fears were totally unfounded.
In a year when there was no Eurovision to watch, this made for an acceptable substitute.
Whilst a viewer would not need to be totally au fait with Eurovision to enjoy this movie, I do feel that a liking for the subject helps increase the pleasure.

Rachael McAdams, however, I think should more than make up for any ill feeling for the humor/writing as she is totally endearing in her role.The music however is absolutely fantastic and some great background song choices in keeping with the Icelandic origins via Sigur Ros! Most of it is campy as you would expect from Eurovision (and I loved all of it) but there is some genuinely beautiful songs, especially one at the end (which I think will be obvious when you watch it).

I watched the movie 2 nights in a row because i was showing a friend and was still just as into it. Itll probably be something i watch alot. Over all the movie was very fun. The acting was good.

522,piperjake,2hrs3m of confusing Americans,7,3 July 2020,"Firstly, before I have even watched the film, I absolutely love the audacity of its existence. Literally no one asked for Eurovision 'The Movie', and yet what a strangely great premise for a story. I liked this even more upon learning that Will Ferrell himself is a big fan of the contest, and was a major hand in getting this film from paper to living room TV.I feel that I should pre-empt this review by stating that I watch Eurovision religiously every year, and that the date is CLEARED from my diary as soon as I learn it. The film itself does a pretty good job at explaining why Eurovision is so popular - the whole thing is a caricature of itself, and I love that Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga continues this tradition. From the get-go, it knows exactly what it is and should be - cheesy, campy and over-the-top. Eurovision was wise in seeing its own indulgence and being able to self-deprecate for a large portion of the movie, which I fully commend. Being directed by David Dobkin, who appears to have directed mainly music videos, was probably a good choice for these reasons. Also, the fact that the film has a subtitle makes me think...is this the start of a saga?! Forget the MCU, from now on I'm attending midnight screenings of the ECU...After Holmes & Watson (2018), things could really only go up for Will Ferrell, and this film has its fair share of welcome Ferrell-esque slapstick and humour. As with his other films, some of the quips fall flat and some tickle you for hours after the credits have rolled - it's always a mixed bag. Unfortunately, Eurovision had a few more duff notes than you would usually find, but thankfully the film moves on quickly enough to forget about it, unlike films by a certain Sandler that often crack a joke and leaves silence after it as if it's a comedy set, but even the tumbleweed doesn't feel like interrupting.I digress.If you're a fan of the annual contest, the inclusion of a few familiar faces is a nice touch. The effort gone into the production is truly commendable - I'm told that a full song was written and performed for every country that would usually compete in Eurovision. The ironic thing is that pretty much every song heard could quite easily pass as a winner of the contest. The 'song-along' (essentially glorified music video/karaoke) about halfway into the runtime was a fun little showcase, however did feel a little shoehorned in for the sake of a single to release with the film. Upon checking Spotify after, my hypothesis was confirmed. This could have been done better and be less incongruous with the pacing.The, for lack of a better word, 'villain' was a little bit of a concerning choice for me. Of all of the European countries to choose from for a 'bad guy', they decided to go for... yep, you guessed it! Russia. It really is a lazy film trope in 2020, made even more of a bizarre choice when the 'booing' incidents of Eurovision 2014 and 2015 are still fresh in the minds of many. Casting a person from the UK as the villain might have been a funnier choice and a little more tongue-in-cheek as, and I quote the film itself, ""everyone hates the UK"".I was told by a friend before watching this film that if I like Blades of Glory (2007), I'll enjoy Eurovision 'The Movie'. Perhaps this kept the memory of Chazz Michael Michaels fresh in my mind, but I couldn't help noticing the almost uncanny similarities between the two films throughout my viewing. For starters, both films feature Will Ferrell with long hair and a big personality, and not to mention explore the subject of underdogs in a big competition. However, even the smaller plot beats match scene by scene - one conversation that includes characters that may or may not have had sex with each other for the sake of sabotaging a rival duo could have been stripped word-for-word from Jimmy MacElroy for all I know. Yes, if it ain't broke then don't fix it - but also try not to create a carbon copy that ends up being inferior to the original!Wow. I've really written all this on a movie in which Graham Norton stars as himself. Regardless, everyone needs a feelgood movie from time to time, and truth be told, this movie made me smile a lot in a time when doing so is quite a rarity - and there's nothing wrong with that, right?Very much enjoyable Ferrell-style-flick. 7 stars.EDIT: It's the day after I've watched the film and I have listened to nothing but the soundtrack, so they must have done something right in that department. It's definitely filled my Eurovision-shaped hole in 2020.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
523,gondiken,I didn't expect this movie to be this good,10,28 June 2020,"Personally I don't even watch Eurovision that much, maybe if I happen upon it once in five years. Still when I first saw this movie on Netflix, I thought it'd be another attempt for Americans to make fun of European stuff because it's easy to sell ""different"" as a comedy to audiences that don't demand much. I like Will Ferrell, but him being in this movie was a red flag in that sense.I was absolutely wrong! The movie was funny (not in an arrogant way), emotional and it had a lot of culture! The music in the movie is in no way ""mocking"", many songs could easily compete and potentially win in actual Eurovision. The comedy comes from the naivety of the characters, absurdity and hilarious running gags. Add the beautiful views of Iceland and you have a genuinely nice movie.Since there is no Eurovision this year due to COVID19, I suggest enjoying every bit of this beautiful movie.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

534,moviereviewer6700,Dix Points,8,10 August 2020,"From a European perspective and also with one being a Eurovision fan when you hear that an American director is making a film with a Canadian female lead & a fellow American male lead despite none of these three countries having ever entered the competition you find yourself a little sceptical. BUT MY PREMONITIONS WERE OUTLANDISHLY WRONG!This film fully encapsulated the glamorous rather extravagant world that is the Eurovision Song Contest. From the tough stanced strong speaking Piers Brosnan playing Lars's father, the inclusion of some of the contests greatest performers and winners of the last decade and a little beyond or even the sophisticated touch of adding Graham Norton for authentic Eurovision commentary this movie is a spectacle.Rachel McAdams & Will Ferrell play the parts of Sigrid & Lars perfectly and for non-Eurovision watchers or newcomers could be a great introduction to the magic that this contest brings year after year. Furthermore, in these uncertain times where the great long standing competition could not go ahead this year I felt like this was the greatest substitute possible to get as close to the real thing if only for this year at least.However, the super fans amongst people would know that some of the actions and moments included would have been probably been given artistic licencing as they would not adhere to Eurovision Song Contest rules. These include things like acts singing songs longer than the mandatory 3 minute mark, taking longer than 30 seconds to clear the stage, including acts like United Kingdom in the Semi-FInal results process despite the UK's automatic final qualification every year due to their rather large contribution to the contest & also Sigrid & Lars changing their song for their performance in the grand final which results in disqualification hence the referencing from both Sigrid on stage before she is about to sing & Graham Norton providing commentary after the song has been performed.Upon review, would totally recommend if your missing out on Eurovision this year, great cast, great laugh, great story line and overall a real feel good film.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

I do understand if those who don't know eurovision would think that the movie is extreme and over the top, but believe me, this is just like eurovision.

I was surprised to see it was only just over a decade: his performance is so underwhelming and her's so en pointe that he makes it seem like twice that. If Ferrell could have avoided the ego trip and cast someone else; and the dumb faux Icelandic stereotypes avoided, this might have avoided a straight-to-Netflix demise. I'm sad. Really sad.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

I'm not sure there's a more charming country with a more charming people than Iceland. This movie reminded me of all the good times I had there now that I've graduated (go class of 2020!)The leads acting was funny genuine and sweet and I never thought Will Ferrell could make me feel this way but the love story between Lars and Rachel McAdams sigrit is one of my new all time favs.Just a really sweet and charming movie I loved it,Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

At worst, I was expecting something along the lines of ""Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping"". But this is like ""Popstar"", but devoid of any of the humor or cleverness. I get that it is supposed to be a parody...but the movie sacrifices any form of substance for over-the-top zaniness that after awhile just becomes boring. If you think Will Ferrell's cameo in ""Austin Powers"" is the funniest thing ever filmed, then you *may* enjoy this movie...but otherwise, life is too short to waste 2 hours and 3 minutes of your life.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
545,mikecosner,So good,9,7 November 2021,"Especially with what is going on around the world with the pandemic, it's so humbling and joyous to see a movie all about what brings Europe and other countries together. As a huge Eurovision fan I am impressed with how a lot of the minor stories are represented in the movie, from countries not wanting to host due to the cost of hosting. There was some bits that could have been altered for instance Spain wouldn't be in the semi finals as they are one of the big 5 who automatically qualify, and also the event was held in the U. K. but for quite some time now the host city is the home of the previous years winner, and so the U. K. would be the last place to host Eurovision. Nonetheless it was amazing to watch, especially to see so many amazing Eurovision singers come together for the singalong.

I highly recommend this film as its fun, funny, and although played for laughs is not just a corny take on eurovision, as a lot of thought has obviously gone into portraying the acts in a genuine and amusing way-loved it .",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

If you go into this Netflix production with zero expectations like my boyfriend and I (because let's face it, with Will Ferrell flicks it's either a hit or complete miss), I'm sure most viewers will be pleasantly surprised. Of course it's silly and some scenes fall a bit flat, but there's also a good portion of heart and soul in there to balance it off. What I loved most was how it captures the ESC, being a parody in the best sense without being malicious. The jokes, the acts and the music (they even threw some sort of ""Lordi"" band in there), the costumes, everything was on point and let's face it, pretty accurate. Everything we love (or love to hate) about the ESC was highlighted basically.

You really need to be in the mood to watch Will Ferrell's movies. But as the story develops and Rachel McAdams starts to shine and the music plays, it quickly becomes a very watchable movie that ends actually pretty good. If you have watched Eurovision before you may understand some of the jokes better, but even if you never heard of it before you can still enjoy this movie a lot. Just don't expect an amazing plot and and great script, it's a silly uplifting comedy with the characteristic weirdness and over the top jokes by Ferrell. The cinematography is good, the music and performances, particularly by Rachel McAdams, is excellent. Watch it with an open mind and an open heart.

I've never laughed harder than in some of his films, and others I can't even get through. This one would fall into the latter category if not for the covid lockdown, but there just isn't that much else to do right now.
You could argue that some of the supporting actors have good performances, the Icelandic cinematography is pleasant, even the songs aren't that bad (well, they're supposed to be bad, but they're good at being bad). You could criticize the film for plot or scenes that basically plagiarize other Ferrell projects (Old School, Zoolander). But ultimately, a comedy just needs to be funny and this is not. Other than one scene where he is yelling at some American tourists, there is nothing close to laughable in this film.

The film wasnt as funny as I had thought it would be, but instead found myself in tears at the end of the film. This is because this movie PERFECTLY represents what Eurovison is about, a proud cultural phenomenon that strives in diversity and community. This is a MUST SEE movie.

Jaja Ding Dong is stuck in my head since I've heard it (help me!)The storyline of this movie is weird and cute, sometimes a bit predictable, but that's ok. The jokes are great. My husband and I laughed out loud several times, which doesn't happen a lot at movies. Best joke of the movie (we rewinded it and watched it again) is a slamming door.Overall, it's just a great movie. The songs, the costumes, the jokes, the acting, the cameos and the beautiful shots of Iceland.

577,jerk-leg,A tonal mess but wins you over with heart and music,6,17 August 2020,"Not sure what to say about this movie. It's kind of satire at times, but not exactly when it should be. The music and production is quite good. Will Ferrell (who I love) is terribly miscast and I almost think his comedic voice weighed the movie down. He should have played a villain or an eccentric rather than the romantic lead. His awkwardness in the role just doesn't help when the movie is trying to be sincere. It didn't spend enough time establishing the characters and relationship which is kind of forgivable in comedy, but it's kind of not a comedy at times. I feel like if they removed all the Ferrell-brand absurdities they could have just made a musical dramatic comedy. Dan Stevens chews up his scenes and I appreciate how they subvert some of the tropes of competition movies. The final song really helps the movie land, despite all the aforementioned issues.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

He's a very funny man but some of his last few outings, like Holmes and Watson, just weren't funny films. He is a fan, apparently, of ad-libs and Impromptu work and some of the stuff that makes its way into his movies show some poor editorial choices. But this film is a lot of fun and one I could gladly watch again, and soon. The story isn't sacrificed for jokes and as Ferrell is a die-hard Eurovision fan he may have seen it as a duty to deliver something to non-Eurovision fans that honours the contest lovingly with all its colourful bombastic silliness.

The funniest, sweetest movie I've seen in years.

After watching this movie it was clear that they were just as wrong as they were with ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and all the other comedies they hated and the public loved. If you have ever seen a Eurovison Song Contest, you will love it. I recall watching on TV as ABBA won with Waterloo. This movie captures the songs and the spirit of the competition.

611,goldbarn,PG-13 Hollywood romcom that is neither romantic nor funny,5,15 July 2020,"There are actually some interesting plot ideas and the cinematography is wonderful, but that's about the best I can say about this movie. The first major problem is that it's hard to take seriously two American actors pretending to be Icelandic and speaking with an Icelandic accent. Will Ferrell was just an awful choice for the role; he's too old, he doesn't have any natural musical talent (neither does Rachel) and he doesn't come off as a credible pretend-musician. On top of that, there isn't any chemistry between him and Rachel McAdams (think about what made A Star is Born so successful). It would have worked much better had they picked an Icelandic duo that are actually musicians, but then it wouldn't be a Will Ferrell movie.More importantly, the movie simply fails at delivering any laughs. There were literally only two scenes where I was genuinely amused, one involving the Ja Ja Ding Dong guy, and another where Will knocks down a portable toilet. It's somewhat hard to comprehend how an actor like Will can be so entertaining in some films (Anchorman, Old Scool, Step Brothers) and so unfunny in others, but I think it has much to do with his narrow comedic range. Will is usually at his funniest when he plays the wild and selfish manchild, which is nothing like his character in this film.To sum it up in one sentence, Eurovision Song Contest is a forgettable PG-13 Hollywood romcom that is neither romantic nor funny.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

It takes a sort of suspension of cynicism to appreciate the Eurovision Song Contest, and once you've done that, you'll find a number of catchy songs. The final number somehow manages to be poignant and wistful while still feeling exactly like a model Eurovision song.I'm positive I'll watch this movie many more times in the coming years, and all the while I'll be humming along.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
621,francescomerlini,"Great songs, one very good scene....and that's about it",5,15 July 2020,"I wasn't expecting a lot from this film, after all I have come used to the silly humour often Will Ferrell puts on his performances. However, I have to admit this film let me down quite a bit, not only because most of the jokes didn't land or because is too long, but for the simple fact that the story, style and structure is all over the place, seriously is like having in a film instead of 3 acts have 6, that is not unusual whatsoever, the problem is that 3 of these 6 acts felt like a tiring third act that left no impact. On top of that the two leads Lars and Sigrit, I understand they want them to make them funny in a bit bizarre way and thanks to the Ferrell and McAdams experience it feels they try way too hard, but I am afraid they come up way too unlikable. I don't hate this film, in fact I would rather watch this that let's say ""The Greatest Showman"" as the songs and the Eurovision part of the film are quite well done, I could find myself listen to them on spotify, but this review is for the film and not the songs. So I would give this one a pass.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
622,catrionawatsonbrown,"A couple of hours of pure, silly escapism",7,2 July 2020,"Is this movie cheesy? With some plot holes? Yes and yes.
Did it offer me and my family a couple of wonderfully silly hours with laughs, cringes and the sort of songs that only Eurovision can offer? Yes, yes and yes!
Will Ferrell (whom I'm not normally a fan of) was great as the Eurovision-obsessed Lars, Rachel McAdam was sweet as the talented but naive Sigrit, and Dan Stevens was a revelation as Alex, the '100% not gay' Russian. I know neither Rachel nor Dan sang their own songs, but it was pretty good lip-synching!
With minimal bad language, no violence (apart from the hamster wheel and the baddy getting knifed by the elves) and no nudity (though there were a few slightly risqué references to Will Farrell's 'ding dong'), this was a film we could enjoy as a family and came away joyfully singing 'Ja Ja Ding Dong' (which my daughter (unsuccessfully) tried to put on my phone as a ringtone).
Ignore the critics. If you approach this in the same way as you would Eurovision itself, you'll have a blast.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
623,drminsc,Sweet and funny,7,13 July 2020,"I am writing this as someone who runs hot and cold on Will Ferrell - sometimes I love his work and other stuff falls a bit flat for me. But I actually watched this movie TWICE because I thought it was cute. I liked the sweet relationship between Lars (Will Ferrell) and Sigrit (Rachel McAdams), I enjoyed that Alexander Lemtov (Dan Stevens) and Mita Xenakis (Melissanthi Mahut) had just enough complexity to them to make them interesting and sympathetic characters, and enjoyed the timeliness and unexpectedness of some plot twists. Pierce Brosnan and Mikael Persbrandt are always great, and the supporting cast also made the movie fun. A great movie to watch when you don't want to think too deeply and just want something to make you forget your troubles for a while...Ja Ja, Ding Dong!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
624,LA_Musicworks,A decent romp,8,2 July 2020,"In typical Will Farrell fashion he plays the immature obtuse buffoon that somehow comes through despite himself. Rachel McAdams did a great job and carried the film's straight man (woman) role. The supporting cast was good as well.As someone who had never seen Eurovision, any little inaccuracies or creative license didn't matter - in some ways it's meant to be irreverent - though one BBC music reporter found dissecting it's inaccuracies worthwhile so if you are a stickler for accuracy and details you might cringe a bit. It's a goofy movie - loaded with little gags - perhaps not quite to the level of Elf - but anyone who usually enjoys a Will Farrell movie, will like it.The tempo of the production kept things moving along so it didn't feel like a 2 hour film. The music was goofy where it needed to be and half decent elsewhere. We've probably seen this all before in general but the familiarity is part of the appeal.As pure fun entertainment and no thinking, it's better than average but not an instant classic. Worth watching though - check it out!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
625,kkachat,To me this would make a lot more sense if...,8,4 November 2021,"...Will Farrell's character was played by a 25 year old. I'm supposed to believe that that jerky father let his son live with him for 30+ years as an adult and is just getting around to kicking him out now??? And I'm supposed to believe that that pretty woman was trying to hump him for 30-40+ years after he became sexually mature and he just decided to remain a virgin all that time?!?! I'm straight and in love with this sexy teenager who's head over heels for me but maybe she'll be hotter in her 50's. Preposterous. Now if Will was supposed to be playing somebody much younger then maybe they could have slighted that to the audience somehow... because DUDE, your face looks old. Old and saggy and super wrinkly. All around a pretty good movie with some pretty decent songs. Not really all that rewatchable though.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

627,jbdriesenaar,Pretty good watch!,7,18 August 2020,"This movie was quite good, but perhaps surprisingly the only thing holding it back is Will Ferrell. He simply looked too old for the role in my and my gf's opinion, and we are only about a decade younger than mr Ferrell. The same difference he has with the character that played his dad. It looked a little silly. We both liked almost everything else about it. It was a comedy musical, well done, with likable characters. A feelgood movie mostly.The only thing we were expecting but didn't get, was raunchy homosexual jokes. We are talking about Will Ferrell in Eurovision after all. That was the second surprise: that a movie about the gay campfest that is Eurovision, that stars Will Ferrell, was kept almost completely above the board. This movie is imo completely safe to watch with children. And a pretty fun watch. You will not regret watching this.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

635,z120511,"Not funny, but the music was good",6,5 July 2020,"Will Ferrell is pretty hit or miss in comedies and this was right in between. The jokes are pretty weak, but the songs alone made this watchable. Being not familiar with Eurovision, it was very interesting to learn about it as I watched. While there are some laughs for sure, the accents throughout are impossible to ignore. Both Will and Rachel would jump from Icelandic, to German, to Swedish, to sometimes just plain American accent. I enjoyed the story, but the corrupt city official subplot trying to randomly kill Will Ferrell in the end was completely unnecessary and added nothing. Which was followed up by a ghost warning him about the official, only for Will to say ""oh we are good, I already killed him"". As far as the music every song is catchy, and I've already got JaJa Ding Dong stuck in my families heads by playing it ad nauseam. I would definitely recommend this, it's a fun time all things considered.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Will and Rachel are hilarious and somehow believable speaking pigeon English with 'icelandic' accents.

With Iceland being the country where the singers are from, we got to see the beautiful Iceland as a bonus. It's a crazy comedy but not ridiculous.

The idea that following your passions will lead to happiness is a fine moral.More importantly, you need to realize the movie is more or less a musical. If you don't enjoy musicals you may be disappointed.The idea of Eurovision is to be a friendly, peace loving event between European nations. The way the competitors are able to be positive to each other is encouraging.I feel as if I've seen so many dark dramas these days. It's nice to watch a movie that's just trying to have some fun and feel good.You can't help but find yourself cheering on the protagonists. The final scenes leaves my heart aching.

Even cried at one point. Awesome! It felt good to return to the Eurovision world and at this point in time, that is better than anything I could imagine. So watch it, I don't understand why this isn't higher rated, because it truly is just a bundle of laughs. So watch it. I'll be watching it again soon.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

670,tglasnovic,Fun for Eurovision fans,7,29 June 2020,"I think that the songwriters did a splendid job (good songs with the right amount of parody). I wish the movie was a bit funnier and logical. Some scenes were dying for a wittier joke (for Will Ferrell and Graham Norton, at least). It looks like some scenes were quite obviously inserted (for a reason) but not blended into the story well, characters's actions are not explained or they have a rather flat explanation. I really loved Rachel's acting. I think some foreshadowing was unnecessary (e.g. Rachel's scarf). The roles of Greek and Russian characters, I felt, needed to be less superficial (especially Dan Stevens's - I liked his acting). All in all, a fun movie, especially for those who missed Eurovision this year.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

672,AemaNideot,Typical Will Ferrell movie,8,26 June 2020,"Will Ferrell has a type of humor that is definitely not for everyone. But if you like his humor, you will surely like this one, in my opinion one of his better works. Nevertheless, even if you don't like his humor, you might not have a few good laugh-out-loud moments, like I had, but it still probably is a pretty entertaining, sillly movie, worth the watch. Oh and wow, Rachel McAdams... What a damn voice, I did not know. My compliments!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

676,mollychen-42390,"TBH, better than i expected",8,21 May 2021,"Honestly, before i watched this i thought this was gonna be horrible - with bad screenplay and songs. It turns out to exceed my expectations. Screenplay is pretty good - Rachel Mcadams definitely plays a big part of it. Songs are mostly fine. ""Husavik"" is more than fine. It gives me goosebumps. I didn't expect such a wonderful song to be on something other than Disney musicals. The writing is kinda cheesy, same old thing with every encouraging autobiographical movie. But it's funny, so that evens out.All in all, not the best movie, but worth watching when you need some cheer-ups during the pandemic.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

688,markdanielkendrick,"It's good, not outstanding",8,27 June 2020,"As a die-hard Eurovision fan, I am glad that this didn't mock the contest as much as people speculated. It's good, but there are quite a few plot holes (eg when Lemtov says that no one likes UK, how did they win the previous year to host it this year)? It's funny at times, but some of them feel a bit out of place. However, Ferrell and McAdams make a very nice duo. The soundtrack is AMAZING as well.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

There is so much truthfulness in Ferrell's persistent dreamer who will go forward, no matter how much he is laughed at. McAdams is delightful and matches him perfectly. They are both such a pair of innocents and have you rooting for them right from the start. Dan Stevens is insanely good. Off the charts! I also loved Melissanthi Mahut (Mita) and thought she oozed charisma, matching Stevens pound for pound.The whole movie is a joyous, glitzy romp, just the antidote for 2020. I thought the music was cracking too and there's one particular song, beautifully presented by the gorgeous McAdams, that gave me genuine goose bumps.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

It made me smile, tap my foot and just escape a little to a happy place during a terrible time in the world.Is it the most deftly acted, written and produced movie...no, no Oscar nominations, I'm pretty sure. But that's not the point.What it does offer to the audience is a bit of fun and escapism, and a bunch of good laughs and cringe-worthy moments. It also left me a little lighter in spirit, and It reminded me to take the world less seriously. This was just what I needed during a pandemic, rampant racism, a horrible government and climate change out of control. There's so much that is wrong, that a little right is helpful. While I can't control the crazy world, I can control what I watch and how it impacts me. I choose to enjoy it for what it is and smile.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

697,DreamLighter,"Honestly, better than I expected",8,26 June 2020,"My expectations were low, I love Will Ferrel but his movies are often shallow and stupid and rarely touches you. This one is not deep and smart, that is not what I'm saying! But it is well made and has a lot of heart in it that balances the shallow and stupid quite good. Add on top of that the end performance by Rachel McAdams, the sweetest actress in all of Hollywood, and you suddenly find yourself cheering for a fictional Icelandic band in a fictional Eurovision contest in this feel good movie of crazy corona summer of 2020.

700,pepeksz,Great ode to Eurovision and Scandinavia.,8,7 July 2020,"I was a bit scared at first. I believe many of us have an understanding of Ferrel's movies and how they are usually broken into two groups: the ones that are 'hit and miss' (The House, Semi-pro, The ladies man, Get hard etc.) and the ones that are hits (The Other Guys, Stepbrothers, Talladega Nights etc). For some this is a blurry line, for some this is the same type of movies, and for others (like me) each mean something very different and often something special too. So I was eager to see what category this movie falls into.Disclaimer:
It is important to point out that those that have been following Eurovision for years, often entire lifetimes, will see and identify with things that those who have never heard of let alone seen Eurovision will have trouble with understanding.
Also, I am Danish, and as many of my Scandinavian neighbors might agree with me, we have our own special connection with Eurovision. What is more, as the two main characters are Icelandic, it is naturally very easy for Scandinavians to identify with these characters and the cultures they portray.Review:
I was eager to see what type of Ferrel movie this is but other than that I had zero expectations going in. It was laugh out loud funny. It was a silly movie, just like any other Ferrel movie would be. However, it was, great ode to Scandinavians not taking themselves too serious, the Eurovision song contest, to the singer's choreography, songs, theme of songs, subject matter all clicked with how the actual Eurovision would go down. Believable participants and solid story that somehow neatly fits with what Eurovision is all about. Well worth a watch to any that has had Eurovision in their lives at one point or another.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Well, I read other reviews and then asked my neighbor from the UK, he confirmed with me that Eurovision is a real thing. It's like watching a super karokee contest, it's cheesey as heck but so entertaining.Rachel McAdams steals the show, she is so adorable and sweet throughout the movie, it's hard not to route for her. The movie is super funny and perfect for the Covid-19 world we currently live in, hopefully the major networks pick up the Eurovision broadcasts in the future so North America can join the fun.This movie will make Eurovision a global phenomenon that it deserves, many thanks to Will Ferrell.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
703,richard-mcfarland,Rachel McAdams must be exhausted!,5,10 July 2020,"Rachel McAdams must be exhausted, because she carried this whole movie!! If the movie would've focused more on her character and less and the regurgitated and unnecessary juvenile jokes of Will Ferrell this movie could have really been something of a gem.

I haven't loved Will Ferrell this much since Elf. ( I like him but this was more youth friendly than most his movies) Rachel McAdams is always good and makes anyone smile.

708,david-bestford,"Better than i thought, could have been awesome",7,1 July 2020,As a fan of eurovision I was looking forward to this. The movie hits so many good notes and lacks in comedy with others. Problem i have is Will's character is not likeable and unbelievable a bit of an issue for a Will Ferrell movie. A different cast member for his part would be a good start. The comedy at times is on point and at others feels out of place adding nothing to the story (don't even ask about the cgi whales). Remove the spoof elements of comedy and this could have been a great movie.Worth a watch for the supporting cast and the mid movie music number filled will eurovision performers cameos.,Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

710,dimitris-karageorgos-dk,Mediocre,6,26 June 2020,"It's perfect if you have nothing else to watch. In Greece we have a saying amerikaniá which basically means classic american movie and it perfectly describes this movie. The story doesn't make sense most of the time and is always super predictable, many of the jokes don't land, the actors are super awkward trying to speak English in an Icelandic accent and even the competition of the Eurovision is portrayed wrong in the movie ( for example the points are given in thr final not in the semis ) which makes the movie hard to watch even for the fans of the competition. Some of the past winners also make an appearance in the movie but it just so happens to be at the most awkward scene ever. Anyway, it's on netflix so it might make sense to watch it with the family if you have absolutely nothing else to watch.

713,jackelkarl,It garnered the craziness,7,26 June 2020,"Will Farrell is a powerhouse of absurdity coupled with a wonderfully whistfully witty performance from Rachel McAdams, finally landing a comic performance after a failed forced performance in 'Game Night'

No. Best Comedy. Nope. What did it have? HEART. It had heart and charisma and good music. For those of you dissing Will Ferrell, it's Will Ferrell.... what did you expect from his acting? He did co-write the movie though. And he did a great job capturing the contest, a love story, family conflict, and a true underdog story people actually care about. I thought it was delightful. The music was catchy. The last song was AMAZING. Rachel McAdams was on point. It's definitely the best movie I have seen in 2020. So let's give credit where it is due.

Will Ferrel is always funny and Dan Steven brings alot to this movie that jokes about this somewhat strange European phenomenon that is Eurovision and some fun political punches to countries and people who doesn't accept that people are of different beliefs, sexualities, origins and more.Now its not amazing but hey its worth the watch. And they even use the cheap trick of music where a powerful song can wrap up most anything and whatever happened before it still feels quite alright afterwards. Cause the song Husavik is a really powerful ballad that could to be honest. maybe it should win the Eurovision.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
720,rickcorbishley,I really enjoyed this film,9,4 July 2020,"This is a typical Will Farrell film I guess; silly, funny, not so funny at times but thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining. It also captured the contest perfectly for me; I can't believe no one has done something like this before.I'm humming the Jaja Ding Dong song as I type; it is one of the stupid Eurovision type songs that gets in your head and won't go. But the song Sigrit sang in the actual competition is brilliant. Apart from being a funny film I actually found it quite moving and had a headache at the end from trying to control my emotions and not get laughed at by my wife for crying at a comedy film.It is a classic loser underdog who comes good in the end film. And a love story. And a comedy film. And a great observational film on the Eurovision; it captures the quirkiness of the competition brilliantly. I can also see why Icelandic folks would love it; I would if I was from Iceland. Made me want to go visit. And I will again be supporting them when they are next in the World Cup competition. I love an underdog who achieves great things.Bottom line is that I loved it.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Never have I felt so much pride for the wonderful and whacky traditions we have as Europeans. This was simply a feel good homage to the Eurovision.

733,Parzival_Flash,Surprisingly good!,8,25 November 2020,"So I am a fan of Will Ferrell and his silly humor. Whether it be like Anchorman or Step Brothers. I fully expected this movie to be similar.I was surprisingly incorrect!Don't get me wrong, there were quite a few silly parts throughout the movie. But overall this was a fun, enjoyable, and touching movie. The best way to categorize/describe this movie is an amalgam of Talledaga Nights/Wedding Crashers/Pitch Perfect. I watched it on a whim and I am glad I did!Being an American I knew nothing of the Eurovision Song Contest, but I still enjoyed learning a bit about it. The music, while a bit silly in its portrayal, was actually extremely good! The ending song was touching and brought out the tears. There were many laughs, a few cringeworthy moments, and some really moving scenes.Will Ferrell was very good, not great though. But Rachel McAdams and Dan Stevens were fantastic! McAdams was extremely funny and did very well lip syncing all the songs while Molly Sanden (who actually did the singing for Sigrit) was amazing! She has an incredible voice and she definitely deserves any attention gained from this movie! Pierce Brosnan was ok, and seemed a bit out of place. But overall I expected something that was silly and full of Will Ferrell's low brow humor (which I do love). But what I got was so much better and a movie that was extremely uplifting, which was even better during the dark days of the COVID-19 lockdown and the dumpster fire that is 2020.Definitely worth a watch, and I personally have now watched it for a fifth time. It was that good. 8/10 because of how touching and funny it was. Also the songs are addicting and added to the experience! -2 for the few outlandish parts and for a somewhat roaming plot.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

751,rossjames-18323,Feel good and hilarious.,9,7 July 2020,Didn't have much hope for this but it has to be one of my favourite films the past couple of years. It was so well written. They had Eurovision down to a tee. I'm not a Will Farrell fan but he did a superb job with this film. The finale song is brilliant. The costumes of Eurovision were perfect.During these crazy times this is a real feel good film with laugh out loud moments. Like Eurovision don't take it seriously. Brilliant.,Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
752,fourrealmsmusic,"Shallow, unfunny, yet oddly touching.",5,3 July 2020,"Father Ted did it better.For a comedy, I laughed very little. But overall, it's a surprisingly endearing story.Lots of unpleasant or cheap jokes that get quite tiring. Nowhere near enough of the genuine, unfiltered lunacy of real-life Eurovision. (Where are my baking grannies, singing horses and other nutty acts???)I have questions about the fairies, but I'm just gonna accept what I saw...However, all that aside, the film tackles the themes of blind determination and admitting being wrong, THEN DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT - which aren't things that come up too often in this kind of film.If Will Ferrel didn't join in the final performance song, I would have given a 6 or 7, because I really felt like that stomped all over the meaningfulness of the previous half hour of an already over-long film.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
753,imaleeirecla,"""My therapist asked me if I liked it and I just sighed.""",4,16 July 2020,Quote by my friend with whom I watched this. It perfectly encapsulates my opinion about this film.It was neither serious enough to arouse any proper emotions nor wild enough to be iconic. Just a string of events and way too much of that Will Ferret guy. It hinged on tropes I thought we as a society in 2020 were well past and every scene felt like an ad-lipped SNL sketch. So much so that even the marvellous Rachel McAdams acted as though she was either reading of hastily written placards or painfully distracted by trying to find something funny to say.The only saving grace was Dan Stevens. Please make a spin off with Russia and Greece being a MLM/WLW solidarity power couple. And don't have an American write it.ps the music was also not half bad.,Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

This movie there is nothing particularly innovative or groundbreaking here but the usual Will Ferrell antics still make me laugh. The demeaning portrayal of the Americans was hysterical. Silly, unrefined, no fascinating plot line, predictable, but charming, folksy, and funny. Worth a watch if you like goofy comedies.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

757,roberthkemmet,Who knew this was a thing,10,24 October 2020,"I have to be honest to some ignorance here...I had never heard of Eurovision before this movie. I have now not only watched this movie but watched videos of every winner in the history of the contest.This movie may not win a lot of awards but it is a triumph. It is funny, touching, and genuine.Ferrell and McAdams deliver solid if somewhat atypical performances particularly McAdams leaving behind her somewhat stoic character choices in the past to deliver a much more whimsical character.Dan Stevens is really great as a Russian contestant and Demi Lovato has a pretty funny role as well.The song-along scene that features a smattering of former Eurovision acts is worth the time watching the movie all on its own. The final song by McAdams (blended with the voice of Molly Sanden) is spectacular.I may not have been aware of Eurovision before, but now I can't wait for the return in 2021.I also came away with a profound new appreciation of Iceland. I hope to visit this spectacular place populated by a unique people who are both proud and able to handle a little lampooning.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

I watch his others and have enjoyed most of them, but they're a watch once, get a meme or two from them, and that's really it. This though... I am a BIG Eurovision fan and this just made up for it not being on this year. It was filmed so well, from the songs, backdrops, dances and camera angles it WAS like watching Eurovision (especially with the added touch of Graham Norton!). Sure there were things that weren't accurate to the real contest (like how the hell did the UK host the thing? We never win! And why were we in the Semi's when we auto go to the final) but it's a film and they needed some license to do certain things. I forgive them.My husband who will sit and watch Eurovision just to make fun of it (hey at least he watches it with me!) actually said that he had to keep reminding himself that it WASN'T the contest when the performances were on, the camera work, the staging were that accurate.I was left with a HUGE smile on my face (and Volcano Man stuck in my head) for hours after watching this.

Amusing, entertaining, with occasional forays into the familiiar offering of baudy comedy and yet it remained consistently poignant touching and funny.

If you're a Fan you love everything about it, if you're a part time watcher, you remember the silliness but forget the sublime!On hearing the announcement I felt the same trepidation. But this film manages in 2 hours to show exactly what it is I love about Eurovision.From the moment we hear the first bar of Waterloo, to seeing the smile on the sad young boy's face, to seeing the Duo stepping onto the stage for their first performance, you are filled with Hope and a desire to see them succeed.The film takes you on the ups and downs as you would expect in a very similar way to Blades of Glory does. Every chance they have to succeed they fluff it all whilst being laughed at. Then you get to the very end, when they get it right and he mutters what will become immortal words, ""Eurovision is much more than a competition, The music is not a contest, and the perfect song isn't the winning song, but a song that comes from the heart!""It is Bonkers and Beautiful and I absolutely loved it!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

The movie is a silly, campy, goofy, feel good experience, exactly like the song contest.It's not perfect, but it's great fun. The story is fairly obvious, but Will Ferrell has fun playing his usual goofy character, and Rachel McAdams and Dan Stevens provide great support.The only award this movie might get a nomination for is the original songs, which hit all of the right Eurovision notes.

I can't stop singing it in my head! HahahahaFilm wise it is not a 10, but it deserves a higher score on MDB than 6,5.

Of course this year, with the lack of the show, this felt like it could be a fun thing to watch instead.
I was really disappointed with the lack of meaning to this movie. It's all kind of a joke and I can appreciate that to some degree. However, I didn't care about the characters at all. It was all just very...meh in the end. I also just don't get this kind of comedy, so maybe that's on me. It also weirdly didn't feel at all European.

The songs are so Eurovision and would be believable as genuine entries to the real contest. The song Husavik gives me goosebumps every time I listen.The humour was funny and silly but the film has so much heart as well which really surprised me. I'm not sure if you have to be a true Eurovision fan to really feel that this film does go deeper than what's on the surface. We didn't get a contest this year, this more than makes up for it, but we did get a special on the BBC (and across the world!) where the hosts were virtually speaking to this years entries and past contestants. This programmme really moved me and it was really heartwarming to see Europe come together through this crisis, and this film gave me the same feeling knowing Eurovision fans all around the world would most likely be checking this movie out as a replacement for a show this year. If there was a perfect time for this film, it's now!The only thing missing in the film was the postcards!! They could have done something so cool with these so I wish they'd been included but either way it's still a 10/10 from me!The low scores really baffle me, you have to take this film for what it is. You're not sitting down to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, this is some lighthearted, heartwarming fun.

It had so many familiar Eurovision faces, it poked fun at all the things we all poke fun about - such as getting a dig in about Russia, everyone hating the U.K. - there was a man in a wheel, scary mask wearing rockers, Graham making snarky comments and it was just as cheesy and fun as I expect Eurovision to be. Don't get me wrong - if you don't like Eurovision, Will Ferrell and you're expecting a film with an intricate plot line and a clever twist this film is not for you - but if you just wanna have fun and listen to some proper cheesy euro-pop tunes with a romantic, lovely story underneath then this is for you.

792,elizabeth_,Uplifting with big laughs,8,27 June 2020,"Not without typical Will Ferrell movie flaws, but a very enjoyable ride throughout. Rachel McAdams is whimsical without being wearing, and so, so sweet, I really loved her in this. Dan Stevens is great, and Graham Norton as the Eurovision commentator is a perfect fit as well. Lots of big laughs, dumb humour (in the best way possible), and fun music, this is light and funny and uplifting.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
793,bryan-byl,The essence of a 'feel good' movie.,8,28 June 2020,"If you're looking for some brainless feel good content, this movie is the way to go! Not only is it produced by Netflix, which stands for a good production quality, the music used is also stupidly fun and accurate for Eurovision. The movie has a lot of cameos of pretty big celebs, including Demi Lovato. If you enjoy Eurovision, this movie will be a first class treat for you.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Funny, Sweet, Over the top music and musical productions. Especially from the quarantine couch this was perfect entertainment. It made me happy, sad, and want to sing and dance. Loved it.

798,mmeric,Fell in love with Iceland and Rachel McAdams,10,26 June 2020,"A pleasantly surprising, beautiful movie... As a spectator of Eurovision for many years, I knew I had to watch it when I saw the trailer. Although the story seems to revolve around the glamour of Eurovision, there are subtle beautiful messages of love... for people and for hometowns... I'm a Willfan, so of course I loved watching the ever-goofy Will. Pierce Brosnan was solid, but my heart goes to Rachel, oh you cute lovely lady. Can you be any cuter? Why oh why? And lastly, I now have to go visit Iceland, once the flights are back to normal. Amazing Iceland scenery in this movie... Oh oh did I say lastly? I have nothing against people of America, but your system and governors suck...",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
799,cwscooby-67545,A Will Ferrell film that didn't suck...,7,4 July 2020,"...for which I give Rachel McAdams and the supporting cast all the credit. By now we recognize the buffoonish character that Ferrell plays in every movie. What really carries this flick is the charm that McAdams exudes in every scene. IMHO, McAdams is a seriously underrated actress and her ability to make you forget Ferrell's potty humor showcases it beautifully. Now not every joke lands but there are some good bits that buoy you beyond the cringe-inducing moments. There is a good deal of fun throughout and some songs contestants sing in the contest are actually quite catchy. If you're looking for something to put on in the background while doing other things, you could find far worse than this fluffy Netflix original.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

With Rom-Com styling, the movie is a ton of fun. It's an enjoyable satire, drawing awareness to a production that most North Americans are unfamiliar with. If you're like me, it may even bring a tear to your eye! Based on the lesser reviews, I guess some people expected an experience similar to ""Schindler's list."" This isn't that, nor is it trying to be. For those who simply want to kill two hours, this is definitely worth your time. Great job, Netflix!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

I understand silliness is to be expected but this was just too much silliness with not enough funny mixed in.

811,TanneMalm,A beautiful mess of a movie that most ESC-fans will enjoy,6,3 July 2020,"I'll try and keep this short.
I liked this movie very much. It's very noticeable how much fun the cast had while doing this movie, and it's super contagious.Overall, the movie is not the most faithful adaptation of the ESC, and you should know that going in to it.
But most of the songs sound like they could appear in the ESC and their staging is very faithful to how Eurovision usually looks, and I'll admit that the last time Fire Saga sung (you know which song) it actually hooked me. I'd love to buy the soundtrack of this movie.Yet, it is not without its faults. The movie is riddled with weird cuts, deus ex machinas and plot holes, and the third act is utterly insane.
But then again, so is the ESC, and that is what we all love about this show. The cringeworthy hosts and numbers, the ridiculous middle acts etc. - and it is kind of poetic how the movie portrays that in a way, intended or not.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
812,mprystauk-96484,"A fun movie, despite Ferrell's one note performance",6,27 June 2020,"I enjoyed the movie, especially having watched bits of Eurovision over the years. It was fun to see many actors of various backgrounds take part in this comedy. McAdams' character was believable and quirky, and I enjoyed her performance as usual. Ferrell's, however, was the same character he plays in the majority of his films. He is better in a supporting role or a writer than as a lead actor.Overall, I recommend the movie, as it did make me laugh with a number of good lines, characters and interesting/silly sub-plots.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

As someone who watches the eurovision every year, I think it captured just how fun and cheesy it is, also the added humour and romance plot makes it an all round great film. Hopefully Americans will watch this and understand why we love Eurovision so much.

The quality of the visuals, the colors, the screenplay make me notice that this was something unique. I love it when dialogues are real although it's obviously a comedy you can see yourself in that situation, if you are a musician, or at least believe the story and that's what movies are all about. I think Ferrell did a great job, nothing more and nothing less, just the right amount of acting. He did a great job in the serious moments and I loved that. I also think that the casting, in general, was great. Every actor did a great job, every part was belieavable. Loved the character of the Russian singer, well played. Supervb movie, hope they win recognition with an award.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

After giving up on ""Funny Girl"" 30 minutes into that show, we landed on Eurovision. We had just been joking about Will Ferrell's ""Old School"" movie earlier that day, so we decided to give this one a go (had not heard about it before).We enjoyed it. Some sentimality, outrageous comedy, and OK, some scenes that I think were failures - but all in all, a pleasant 1.5 hours after a long day outside.We plan on performing Ja Ja Ding Dong in front of our friends now.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

827,humbo,More Than Funnily Meets the Eye,9,11 July 2020,"Starting to see this film, I never thought I would have so much to say about such a relatively unimportant piece of cinematography.Where to start?Perhaps by Will Farrell, the comedian I always so much want to like but that somehow, in my view, always falls short of ""quite getting there"".I was afraid this would just be another vehicle for his mostly crass humor but was pleasantly surprised to see him well tamed and restricted to the boundaries of effective physical and blue comedy while delivering a very pleasant performance.But the true great achievements of this film, the ones that led me to write this short appraisal reside elsewhere.For starters, it demonstrates that it is possible to make effective comedy without being insulting to anyone.The gentleness encapsulated in the effective satire of both ESC and Iceland clearly show that, far from ridiculing the country or the event, the writers intent was to make amusing but also sweet evocations of both and, I must say, they achieve it plenty.In a way, it is amazing how Canadians and Americans captured so well the way ESC resonates here, in Europe, and how incredibly friendly and engaging Icelanders are.Secondly, being that the ESC has become a huge thing among the LGBT community and political correctness being what it is in our day and age, there was the potential of overplaying that vector, maybe even slide into the ""proselitistic"" side of things.This was effectively avoided while, at the same time, performing a huge service to said community.The only message about the subject contained in the movie is a tremendous powerful one, one that truly makes us all further realize, interiorize and consolidate how absurd, anachronic and devastating some approaches to the matter can be.All-in-all, a great little movie, one that grows on you and, if the intent of the ESC organizers by helping in this production was to further expand the worldwide appeal of the contest, I think they hit the bull's eye.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
828,stevesvnguyen,Happy!,10,9 August 2020,"Great movie with catchy music. The ""song a long"" was one of the best mashups created in movies. The original song at the end is fantastic. The leads are likeable and you're happy watching it and it leaves you feeling happy when it ends.

830,odechermont,"A silly, fun and delightfully sweet movie. Worth the watch",8,23 July 2020,"I'm giving Eurovision Song Contest an 8 because although it was intended as a comedy, it turned out to be a very sweet story that made me tear up at the end. It had its classic Will Ferrell moments which made me burst out laughing, but it also catered to my emotions and brought a warmth that was truly lovely and enjoyable to watch. There was a great combination of kindness and comedy from both of the main characters.And finally, what is important to mention, is how amazing the soundtrack is in this film. The original score along with the original songs were the icing on the cake.I really think this film deserves at least a 7.5 rating.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

I hate ""The Voice"" and my wife makes me watch ""Dancing with the Stars"" whenever it is on. I hate reality TV shows but this isn't that. This is a fun romp which features Rachel McAdams being absolutely adorable and carrying the story to a majestic finale.

If not that, then what was this movie supposed to be? I can't figure it out. Judging by the amount of positive reviews on here, a lot of people like this movie - and good for them! But for me, this is a huge disappointment. Eurovision on its own is fun and silly, so the movie about it should be fun and silly too, right? Nope, it's boring and empty, and if not for Rachel McAdams, whom I adore, I would have quit the movie at the half-hour mark.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

It's really unnecessary to film so many content about the contest which is easily accessable on internet. and you can notice that some emotional scene was cut too short, maybe because too many useless view and Eurovision content.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

He's like AC/DC - it works so keep doing it - nobody wants to see AC/DC doing an unplugged session or a jazz album.Personally I find him hilarious so I loved the film. Plot-wise, despite being totally formulaic, it somehow still managed to ramble. You could tell what was going to happen and what the ending would be but none of that mattered because Will Ferrel's hilarious.

854,jesuseduardo-83998,"Eurovision being cancelled is not the worst thing, but this is",2,28 June 2020,"Ive been a fan of the ESC since 2008 and I have a good understanding of what Eurovision is. Once I heard this movie was coming out I got very excited, until I found out will Ferrell was appearing in it, and as the main character... I was expecting a big amount of screaming nonsense by Ferrell for most movie and boy, was I right... Pretty much he is in all of the scenes, hoarding the screen time with dull conversations that don't go anywhere. I felt really cringey the whole movie.. But that's not the worst,
there is more.. I believe the way xenophobia is exploited in this movie is quite big, the main Icelandic character screams (no shocking there) at Americans and telling them to go back to their country.. Now, I dont know anyone from Iceland but I'm guessing they are not particularly filled with hate towatds tourists.. I'm giving a 2 out of 10, only for 2 particular reasons: the sing along from former contestants was actually fun and enjoyable, (I wish they would have made thus a musical type of movie instead) and the 2nd reason : the songs and performance from a few countries were really cool to hear, specially the swedish one.. kudos to them... Now, going back to the main actors of this movie: I wish anybody else would have taken the Male role, Ferrell didn't convince me not even one in any of his multiples repetitive scenes that he was Icelandic or an Eurovision performer.. and Rachel, I wish they could have use her in a way to address the impossible love story between the Russian performer and Kevin Swain, now, that story caught my eye right away, but we didn't hear most of it.. overall a great idea and mediocre results..",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

This movie is really for those who have seen singing competition shows and love when the spotlight falls on Will Ferrel as he delivers own brand of comedic styling. This film is full of bits that poke fun at Iceland for the sake of fun. Also amazing camera work to capture the beauty of the country.I truly enjoyed the use of Icelandic lore throughout the film and feel that these were the funniest bits alongside the performances of mostly fictitious pop songs.A heartwarming message pulses throughout the film as well. The nudity warning also is just for a couple statues, so the humor does not get too inappropriate. What an amusing RomCom.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

We eat shark that is nasty höhö. So tired of this guys seriously.This movie does not make fun of Iceland it pays tribute to Iceland. It uses many famous Icelandic actors and there are loads of small references to Icelandic things that only people how have been to Iceland would pick up on.A part from all that the movie is great. Will Ferrel is hilarious, Rachel McAdams is hilarious. The Jaja Ding dong guy is hilarious. Hearing Pierce Brosnan try and talk Icelandic is hilarious.10/10 No problem.

The movie is relaxed, funny, cozy... And fuuull of details for Eurovision lovers. I have followed the contest for a long time and this movie was just purely Eurovision, and I can imagine purely Iceland too. It made me feel the Icelanders. The bad ratings come for sure from people who doesn't follow the show, since they re missing a lot of details. Looooved the end song, especially the part in Icelandic!!!

The trailer confused me and I didn't know what I was going to watch. I ended up watching it with my sister and it was hilarious! We were laughing so hard! It was hilarious but also adorable. I would 100% watch this movie again with friends and family. Sometimes comedies can include inappropriate scenes but this one didn't.

Comments like that today are used to show supremacy. The movie is childish and tries to use political issues in comedy, like turning the Russian singer gay and taking all the trans, gay, black etc issues into another low point.

That said, its worst crime is the outright racist depiction of Iceland and the Icelandic people. I have visited Iceland and the people there do not speak with those ridiculous accents which made them sound like half-wits. Nor is Iceland some backward 3rd world country (Farrell's character amazed by a mini bar in a run down Scottish hotel that he thought was the height of luxury). The hotels in Iceland I've stayed in have been far superior than any I've stayed in in New York.

Ferrell is funny as always playing clumsy Lars but in my opinion he plays the most important supporting role, bacause Rachel MacAdams and the Eurovision song contest itself are the 2 stars of this movie. The atmosphere of the songcontest is perfectly reproduced. The music and performances are beautiful and Rachel is sweet, beautiful and sings like an angel. The music in the movie is beautiful.

Wil Ferrel does a great job at giving us that classic Terrel comedy he is known for.

880,kymrobey,For Eurovision fans I guess?,4,1 July 2020,"After seeing the reasonably high rating on IMDB for this film, I figured I was in for a Will Ferrell comedy up there with Anchorman (which really grew on me quite a while after first seeing it), with a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. After watching it though, I feel that the high reviews must have been due to a Eurovision fan thing. I'm not really a fan of Eurovision at all so I watched this without any real investment in that aspect of the story. There were a few moments that were amusing but I felt that there was a long patch in the middle of this film that felt really un-funny and awkward to me. I was contemplating turning this off halfway though as I was embarrassed for having chosen to watch this with my family and everyone was starting to look at me and question my choice. This was sitting on a 2/10 for me but then thankfully
the film picked up with some comedy highlights and better pacing toward the end. I think if this film had been trimmed to a 90 minute run time, tightening up the story, it would have been substantially better. If you were a Eurovision fan, you may have appreciated the finer details more than I did.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

This is a warm, funny movie that takes hold of you and brings you on a wonderful and amazingly entertaining ride throughout its 2 hour plus runtime.Eurovision is huge in my home country of Sweden but I've never been one of the competition's biggest fans, quite the opposite. This movie reminded me of what the competition is about; fun, over-the-top extravaganza and silliness, but also a lot of heart. Me and my wife laughed, teared up multiple times and we absolutely loved the whole thing!The music (the MUSIC!!) is exceptionally well written and performed and fits the setting perfectly. I'm listening to the soundtrack as I'm writing this... And this from a guy who normally listens to techno and house and avoids current pop music and eurovision like the plague.

886,davedees,This movie really grows on you the more you watch it.,9,29 June 2020,"I was initially disappointed as I love when Will Ferrell has no leash, and allowed to riff and improv in all of his glorious comic absurdity. This movie is more of a slow burn. It has some lighter comedic absurdity but what it lacks in that, it more than makes up for in a fascinating culture rarely seen. There are so many little subtle lines and dynamics that are comic genius, but not in the often loud over the top antics Will Ferrell is known for. Rachel McAdams nailed her role, as well as Dan Stevens playing the utterly masterful role of Lemtov. So much great music. It did a great job of capturing the quirky characters both in Iceland and the Eurovision contest without disrespecting either. If anyone took a beating it was the American frat guys ha. A great cameo by Demi Lovato. Molly Sanden from Sweden providing the incredible singing voice for Rachel McAdams. The last song notes were hit i did not know existed.

I am and Icelander that lives in Norway and has a Swedish boyfriend that hates eurovision, but he loved this movie, we both did.. its done in a respectful manner and honering the culture of eurovision.

I believe the film was positive towards ESC & is every ESC fan dream come true. We did not have ESC this year, but we had this film! Music track is EXCELLENT loved the songs. For die hard fans of ESC, there were some triggers for them (7 onstage for Sweden-limit is 6, Spain, Germany UK in semi-finals - 4 major contributors are automatic for final), the score board, competition held in Scotland, etc.) Also one liners that are quick to catch (the comment ""nobody likes the UK"", Americans asking if it is like 'the Voice', etc.). Trivia in film that only ESC fans can appreciate, the piano used was Duncan's, Pierce Brosnan watching ABBA sing Waterloo, a song he sang 2008 in Mamma Mia, Dan Stevens stating, ""be my guest"" (he played Beast in stage of Beauty & the Beast hence the song Be My Guest), also he resembles George Michael of WHAM! whom he mentions in the film (WHAM! manager went on to manage Russian boy group SMASH!! which did covers of 'Faith' & 'Last Christmas' of which SERGEY LAZAREV participated ESC 2016/ 2019) etc. Graham Norton could have been way more snarky like he normally is, seems he toned it down for this! loved all the cameos from Jon Ola Sand to Salvador, Demi Lovato and the Party Scene was the BEST EVER!!!

I expected more stupid jokes and even more bizarre events happening when it comes to Will Farrell, but this is perfect mix of fun and absurd moments balanced with emotional peaks which few comedies can offer.
And yeah, the songs are universally great and they will stick in your head and this is coming from a guy who gets off on hardcore.

913,Theponykid,Haven't laughed so much in a long time,9,4 July 2020,"I stumbled across this movie one cold winter afternoon, knowing nothing about it, and even though I am not a Will Ferrell fan (in fact most of the time I really can't stand him), I hit the play button. I was excited to realise Rachel McAdams was in it, as she's one of my favourite actresses of all time. It just got a whole lot more interesting.
I was only minutes into the movie when I found myself laughing. A lot. At first I thought it was the accents (okay, that probably had a lot to do with it) but this unlikely pair, the way they conversed and the clumsy relationship just made for fun times and lighthearted viewing. Add to that a whole bunch of catchy original songs. I have not enjoyed a movie this much in a long time, and am actually really surprised it's a Netflix movie as most of them are very B grade.
Definitely add it to your watchlist!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
914,Luk84pl,Wasn't as bad as it could be...,6,26 June 2020,"It's a good movie for Friday evening sipping G&T when there's nothing else to do... Nothing more but on the other hand - nothing less... Beautiful Island landscapes, strange Eurovision contest + Ja ja ding dong...

915,DaneTaylorDavidson,Oddly Satisfying...,6,3 July 2020,"While this film was lacking in the hysterical comedy sketch's, the actors and storyline kept me engaged from start to finish. Don't get me wrong, you won't find a movie starring Will Ferrell that doesn't have you laughing throughout. However, this movie kept you interested in different ways despite being incredibly silly.
What I did not expect was for the songs to be actually good. Granted, it's impossible to take Will Ferrell singing seriously, but the music in this movie was a actually good. Especially the finale song in the Eurovision contest performed by Rachel McAdams.
Any movie that you mix a lovable Will Ferrell with a stunning Rachel McAdams, you are bound to have success no matter the story. This movie does not compare to the Likes of Step Brothers or Talladega nights, but unlike those it is considerably cleaner and perfect for a Netflix movie night. 6/10 (solid for a goofy comedy) would recommend!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Classic Will Ferrel movie but with more maturity. The characters while still outlandish, are better developed and much more believable compared to his past movies. It helps that it's set around a music contest with pop stars who have big personalities and eccentricities. Definitely a feel good movie ( my boyfriend and I cried a few times lol). The sets and wardrobe are beautiful, and the music is great and well written. All of the acting was spot on.

It was well received and needed in our time of need being at home, most of our time due to the covid 19. Really took me out of reality and into their dream of winning the EuroVision contest. All performances were good, some even better and some the best ever. Will Ferrell & Rachael McAdams were a perfect match for this performance. I see this show up for many awards for 2020.

I have never seen the Eurovision Song Contest because I live in Canada, but that only meant that I didn't recognize the cameos by real contestants. And I'm not a Will Ferrell fan, so I was afraid the humour might be a little lowbrow for my taste (yes, I know I'm a snob), but I shouldn't have worried.

Will Ferrell has certainly captured the glam, glitz and splendour of it all.
A little fan service has been provided half way through which should get the Eurovision fans buzzing even if they loathe this movie.
To me, this makes up for losing the contest in 2020 and roll on 2021 where hopefully Fire Saga will be special guests at the Grand Final.Big shout out to Glasgow Airport, Glasgow's SEC Hydro and the city of Edinburgh for looking so beautiful alongside Iceland in this worthy flick.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

I did not expect to cry, the movie has something a lot of Will's work lack. Heart. You really feel the character's struggle and motivations. They feel.... Real. The movie sacrifices some laughs for a genuine story and I loved it. It still has those dumb humor moments, but they are rarer than before. Hooefully there will be more like this.

It was funny as well but I think it is more of a feel-good movie than a straight up comedy. I was surprised with the low rating because everyone I talked to about the movie said they loved it.I'm familiar with the Eurovision contest and I'm not really a fan but I was worried that this movie would be making fun of it.

THIS MOVIE MADE ME FEEL LIKE A CHILD AGAIN!I watched the movie, and while it is a 2+ hours movie, I just couldn't have enough!!! The jokes, the songs, the Icelandic touch... The Greek, the Russian... Everything worked perfectly together!I truly believe that this movie will become a classic and from now on everyone will watch it the same day as the original eurovision song contest!

But it really is a bad movie. I liked seeing the previous participants (of recent years) and he got the gist of the contest down. However, the story was a bit to far fetched for me and it didn't do much for me humour-wise. I guess that's just me not really enjoying Mr. Ferrells type of comedy.

960,orinnoco_82,Has the heart of Eurovision....,8,26 June 2020,"Did enjoy this but as a Eurovision fan, I have to admit that there were some Eurovision inaccuracies that slightly wound me up. Specifically the leader board in the semi final. It included some of 'The Big Five' countries (UK, Spain, Italy, France, Germany) as competing in the semi-final when they are all automatically entered into the final. I have to admit, it did annoy me a little bit. Otherwise I did enjoy the film. The songs were the type that you usually see in Eurovision. Graham Norton was his usual sarcastic self. His commentary is the best part of Eurovision every year and he was a great addition to the film.Overall it wasn't a bad film. Sweet and full of heart. Enjoyed, just slightly annoyed by inaccuracies as already stated.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Oh and the most far fetched thing is The Eurovision Song Contest being hosted here, yes I'm from Scotland, the host city is not a random pick, it is held by the previous years winner, come on it's been 23 years since the UK last won it and back then they were still part of Europe and there was no political grievances!!!

The songs in the movie are actually pretty good, a combination of original songs made for this movie and past hits.

982,wildlushes,Americans thinking they know all about European culture..,1,9 July 2020,"Why do Americans think it's okay to make a movie.. about the most European thing in the world? All American actors, American writers, American directors? It would be one thing if you didn't notice the lack of European culture knowledge, but this... is utter trash. If anything this is cultural appropriation lol",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
983,jikkedeppenbroek,Surprisingly good!!,9,27 June 2020,"When I first saw that there was a movie going to be made about Eurovision, I was mad and felt like they were probably going to ruin my favorite event of the year. But I had to watch it and I was very surprised. It was fun, silly and heartwarming. Which is exactly what Eurovision is supposed to be. Also: there were so many cameos of former contestants!! Overall I thought the movie was great and it actually did Eurovision justice!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
984,aasgeirsdottir,Norwegian Icelanders?,1,8 July 2020,"Why was everything so Norwegian?
It was rather weird, everything from the Norwegian sweaters to the silly Norwegian accent.Apart from being overwhelmingly Norwegian it was entertaining from time to time.1/10 because of the extreme lack of respect.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

986,jcansington,Completely Breathtaking,10,27 June 2020,"You have managed to capture the spirit of what is Eurovision Song Contest. I just love the details with known ESC profiles and the fact that Sweden always get great points and is mostly always in the lead. I adore the music in this Movie and it is definitely in the greatness league with The Greatest Showman.Amazing!

987,simon-87193,I love will Ferrell but.......,3,27 June 2020,Really disappointed with this. Not anywhere near as funny as any of his other films (and I love them all).

988,esjoerik,Painful,2,30 July 2020,"The acting was painfully bad, directing was all through sub par and as far as production goes, it was a pure disaster. Apart from a couple of times where I actually smiled with the movie, I spent most of the time smiling nervously at it, wishing I could hide my face from the shame. It does have a few forgiving features that make me beleave that it could have been a decent movie. Unfortunately those features drowned in sloppy craftsmanship and the movie sank heavily to the bottom.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
989,gudmundur-hallgrimsson,Very funny and thanks from Iceland,10,29 June 2020,"Watched the film with a group of Icelanders and one American and we were laughing hysterically throughout the film. The songs very accurately and in a funny way mimic the typical Euro-vision Song Contest music. They make fun of Icelanders and other Europeans in a very stereotypical and a bit inaccurate manner, but it is funny as hell, and I think almost all Icelanders will only find it funny and not at all be insulted. Recommended to all that love Eurovision and have the sense of humor to get somewhat ridiculed for it ;-)",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
990,feliciaalsbjer,Not good,4,16 July 2020,"Some things were funny (mostly Dan Stevens and the cameos from old Eurovision-Winners) but mostly just a lot of missed potential. For example whats with the bad accents? And don't appreciate the big age difference between the two leads.

994,mattbarrett-83892,Better than expected,8,27 June 2020,The premise was intriguing but the movie overall was better than expected and had more depth than other recent Will Ferrell movies. Familiar Will Ferrell comedy with some other styles but it also had much more touching story and beautiful ending that briefly touched on and related to our cultural roots and heritage we have as different nations.,Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

It's not a deep film and it relies on some familiar tropes....yet it's mostly light and funny.If you have been a faithful watcher over the decades there are some fun references / Easter eggs and the films catches much of the fun goofiness of this annual crazy wonderful spectacle.

The story was fresh, the scenery was amazing. A light-hearted comedy that can bring tears and smiles in the same scene. I think it made the Icelandic nation look like they should prepare for a tourism explosion, and from what I hear, it's already one of the top tourist destinations. The film was made with lots of silliness and heart. Ferrell and McAdams were an awesome pair. At no point did I want to stop watching.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

As the say in the film, it's so much more than just winning. If you're expecting serious oscar winning stuff you will be disappointed but if you just want to have you spirits lifted with some good old fashioned silliness then this is an absolute tonic especially in these difficult times and especially if you miss Eurovision. This is the kind of film you will definitely return to and watch again - I'm already penciling it in for Christmas and next year's Eurovision night. It's silly, it's fun, it doesn't take itself seriously and most of all it's uplifting - a real feel-gooder (just like the real thing in fact).",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

We have enjoyed their costumes a lot, and their infantile, but beautiful, love story inspired by their hometown in Iceland.
Russian character was therific spice in this love romance, and Greek performer (Mita I believe) was a cherry ona top of a pie.

1012,mephsson,"Stupid, but fun!",8,28 June 2020,"It was fun in Eurovision way.
There's few inconsistencies.
1. People would not laugh at the chosen artists if the rest of the competitors would have died in an explosion.
2. Husavik is located in the northernmost part of Iceland, which takes around a day to get there by bus, and around an hour to get to Reykjavik Airport, from which Lars would need to transfer to Keflavik Airport - which is around 40min if travel.
3. Flight to Edinburgh takes around 2:30hrs
4. Icelandair doesn't fly to Edinburgh, but Glasgow,
5. To commute from Glasgow to Edinburgh takes around 1hr
6. Lars would have not make it to get to the contest considering that he left Husavik in the afternoon",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

let's see ...
Perfomer gets stuck in stage equipment: Spinal Tap (obviously!) and Pitch Perfect
Catty competitors disrespecting the heroic leads: Pitch Perfect again
Performer arriving late after ridiculous/epic struggle to get to the venue: Blades of Glory!!

And yes, it is still a stupid comedy - it is a rough parody, but it is pretty nice characters there. I really loved how they tried to express the core of the nations participants types in a comic way, of course.
I don't think this film will suit to those who don't follow Eurovision contest, so it is kind of narrowing it's target audience, but still, totally worth my time.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

This shows, but is funny, moving, goofy. And really captures the essence of Eurovision. But I don't think you need to be a Eurovision fan to love this.

Brilliant!,10,26 June 2020,"As someone who has been watching Eurovision every year, witnessing the enormous effort and money every country put to shine out as 'original', which is sooo unbelievable and can more often than not seem quite foolish, yet somehow charming and exciting, I would say this movie was spot on in terms of representing this exact spirit of the contest. I genuinely enjoyed every minute of it - laughed and cried. Also, having the opportunity to live in Iceland for a bit, I know most people there take this contest with quite an excitement, which makes the movie even better for choosing exactly Iceland as the main focus. Absolutely loved it!!

Like, Songvakeppnin is one of the strongest national finals and it's said like a 'joke final for TV', it's not a nice thing.But well, somehow (no spoilers here) they made it to Eurovision in Scotland, I would love to see that again, and it was 50 minutes of the movie when I actually started caring about how it would end, then I stopped again knowing the rules and how unreal they are in the movie. But well... it all a long, LONG, a little horrible and you wanna quit, road to the end.

Olafur is such an a**hole but in the best of ways. Would still love to share a beer shoe with him! And then there was Will. I have all but one of his movies, I even have his SNL skits and I'm a huge fan. But what you created this time was magical and I think one of your best performances.

I was very worried hearing about this movie because I thought it would mock Eurovision and not showcase what it's really about. However, it did the opposite!!It was so fun! Many funny moments and great cast.

The movie had my curiosity since Netflix premier's newsletter. In first five minutes it had my attention. I was afraid movie could be too goofy, but it wasn't a case. The movie has good structure, logical chain and easy to watch and follow, what makes it good choice for Saturday night. A lot of nice Eurovision style songs performances can be seen in the movie, aswell previous Eurovion contesters.

Rachel McAdams is very funny too - which was unexpected - and compliments him well. The whole cast is great and you can tell that everyone had a blast making the movie! They have captured the Eurovision song contest perfectly not to mention some of the beauty of Iceland. A real treat if you're in the mood for some guilty pleasure.,Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1049,Scooby-42122,Will Ferrell captured the true essence of Eurovision - long but brilliant. Douze points!,10,28 June 2020,"This is the thing, if you are not a Eurovision fan then you probably won't enjoy this movie as much. There are certain skits and bits in the movie that will only be funny to someone that has been following the Eurovision Song Contest and understand the true greatness of this show. Will Ferrel has been thinking about making this movie for 20 years, and he loves this show. He didn't just decide to make this movie because he needed the extra cash (although I'm sure he doesn't mind that either)
Yes, the movie is a bit long, but its nothing compared to how long the televised Eurovision Song Contest is, which is close to 4 hours and that's just the finals. I am a true Eurovision fan myself, and I loved the movie. Have a glass of tall champagne and watch the movie when you are in a good mood, just like one would be before the real Eurovision finals. I give this movie 12 points - douze points.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1050,jorgedorcasgarcia-60005,The Lion of Love,3,28 June 2020,"Lemtov's character is the only funny thing on this movie. Will Ferrell jumped the shark a long time ago. He simply isn't funny, therefore has to try incredibly hard and unlike Adam Sandler, hasn't realized that comedies are about the ensemble cast, not the individual (especially Ferrell whose delivery may have worked early in his career, but is no longer the case).",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

I thought it would be some cheesy comedic romcom, but it was so much more than that. The way (Northern) Europe, the USA and of course the Eurovision Song Contest are parodied, it had me in tears several times. I still cannot stop laughing when I think of the two whales jumping from the water. The story is not only funny, but also sweet and endearing. At first I thought it was silly the movie was portrayed by Americans (the two main characters), but it's exactly what makes it hilarious.I also liked the fact that Russia got called out for its anti-LGBT+ stance.I watched it with my friends and we had so much fun. The next day we were still rewatching clips. And I will definitely watch it again!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1052,danielsalsa,Much better than expected,8,28 June 2020,"At first I wouldn't even have contemplated about watching the movie knowing that Will Farell is starring in it. So far I've never managed to sit through to the end of his most recent films. For a comedian he simply isn't funny. But what he does play well is the role of an idiot. Anyway, after watching a dutch tv reporter (I'm Dutch) said that he'd never seen such a bad movie, as a big Eurovision fan I wanted to see for myself if that was true.And it's not. The movie isn't that bad. It actually, when Sigrit sings her song in the finale, brought tears in my eyes. The title of the movie says it all: Eurovision Songcontest and if you're a Eurovision fan this movie us a must see. And Will Farell? The role of idiot becomes him. The star of the movie though is the ""end-song"". I""d watched the movie two times in two days and will probably watch it even a couple of times more, only to hear the ""sing along"" song and the end song again...........",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Since the guy mainly makes movies that are best viewed after ingesting loads of alcohol, Eurovision is a pleasant exception. Ok it is the standard love story/struggle format, but very well executed in the Eurovision Song Content Context (see what I did there?). As an Eve Online player I can recognise the Icelandic accent, so it was pretty easy to spot the odd Swede, but overall it did not matter. I guess as long as everyone speaks funny it's perceived as Icelandic.Dan Stevens is the highlight of this movie in the portrayal of a gay Russian (purely fictional as there are no gays in Russia of course). From his bio here on imdb he seems the typical classical actor, but his accent and manners were spot on. Also nice to see all the Eurovision cameos and of course the ""stupid americans"" who do not understand this cultural phenomenon at all. As a dutchman who did not get to go to the event in Holland this year, the movie makes up for a lot.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

The genre is mixed, you can find Adventure, Musical, Comedy, Mystery, Action, Drama in this movie. The songs were catchy and funny at the same time (yes, Volcanic Protector Man). The singalong are EPIC. The mystery aspect was also good surprisingly. The adventure in beautiful landscapes of Iceland reminds me of Walter Mitty movie. The actors are amazing and very talented.

What more could you want!",10,29 June 2020,"I read the critic reviews and entered this movie expecting an unfunny Will Ferrell movie with no redeeming qualities. I left understanding that for all critics are, they're just people, and sometimes they have more bias than they do taste. This movie was excellent. It had lighthearted humor that anyone can understand, it represented the beauty of a small town in Iceland, it also didn't follow generic romcom villain story lines, which proved refreshing. Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams proved to be top tier actors, as their chemistry onscreen and their physical commitment to match the singing were fluid and in sync. All together when combined with inter-country banter, the movie proved a fun, passionate, and enjoyable experience. By the end you'll be rooting for the good guys too! I recommend it to anyone and everyone!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

As a lover of European music, I've watched a lot of Eurovision for a 30 yr old American. And Will nails it. I had the strangest sensation that this was like a sequel to the notebook for Rachel McAdams, she threw herself into this role in a delightfully complex way that plays really well off Ferrell's typically 2d comedic character which works amazingly well. Like, I actually connected with a will Ferrell character for once. And his dad was a stunningly well written character as well. Plus the numerous Eurovision contestant cameos and inside jokes are delightful.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

I loved the cheesyness that is Eurovision, my American husband didn't believe Eurovision was a real life contest so few quick YouTube videos later he quickly got the gist and could identify with how 'out-there' and cheesy the performances really are. Loved Graham Norton hosting it as he usually does, great nostalgia listening to his Eurovision commentary and as English person I absolutely loved the little UK jibe ""0 points""! Favorite quote 'the elves went to far!' only wish we would've heard a 'nil pois'. All in all, LOVED IT!

1061,dirkbelfonte,great fun and entertainment like a movie should be!!,9,30 June 2020,"This movie is just a rare joy to experience and should be successful due to its unique and fiercely nationalistic subject matter, fun locations and brilliant actors. Any pierce Brosnan makes a movie worth watching but with a very believable Rachel McAdams and Dan Stevens coupled with enjoyable music throughout, it is elevated even more.
Will Ferrell may be a tad too old for this role but his relentless anti American quips made up for it.

Even after seeing the film, that little clip is the part of it with the most production value.The best part of it was the dumbed down introduction to the Eurovision world.

It really captured the Icelandic spirit when it comes to Eurovision, and the ""insest"" jokes....well we are a small nation and we make fun of it as well.

1067,ermsie,A Nordic Triumph,10,2 July 2020,"I'm an American who's been living in Europe for 15 years and had never heard of Eurovision before moving here. I now watch it each year and think it's hilariously kitschy, spectacular, and, every now and then, there's even a great song. This film brilliantly captures all of those elements of Eurovision in a film that's both extremely funny and moving. The song ""Husavik"" is genuinely great and there are some other fabulous musical moments as well, such as the ""songalong"". I suspect that most of the bad ratings come from Americans who've never seen Eurovision before and probably haven't ever been to the Nordic countries, so don't have a sense of what's funny about the characterizations of both. I don't say that with arrogance - I also didn't know before I moved here! In any case, I hope Americans will give this gem of a film a chance. It was clearly made with love and Will Ferrell took a risk making a film about a country he must have known most Americans have no interest in. Probably the most fun I've had watching a film this year, and I watch a lot. . .",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

In America, at least I am, we are looking for an escape to all the horrible news everyday. We also have extra time on our hands to appreciate and research other cultures. I had no knowledge of Eurovision Song Contest and what a big deal it is in Europe. They have their share of talented singers and some that would only be appreciated in Europe. But a Big thank you to Will Farrell, Rachel McAdams for educating us on this part of European culture and giving us a little escapism. And some of the songs are very catchy too.

Will Ferrell was hilarious. Such a funny mix.Sadly there are ONLY white people in the movie. And about 1/3 at least of the film is set in Europe (so the excuse can't be that 'non-whites don't live in Iceland'). There is one act where there is a light-skinned black lead singer so he's on screen maybe 30 seconds.

I mean seriously people......Let me qualify my comments....my first ever review and it's for a Will Ferrell movie haha..I'm a movie buff who has enjoyed cinema for 40 odd years, and this was simply a great enjoyable easy ride, that was not meant to be taken as seriously as others have obviously done...I honestly had minimal expectations for what I was about to watch, but Ferrell and McAdams' 1st foray into the musical genre had me pleasantly surprised - in fact I absolutely loved it.
Although Eurovision Fire Saga doesn't take itself too seriously, it still delivers a very good solid storyline, a strong underlying message about life and love and topped off with a fantastic sound track that will have you blaring the speakers at all hours on repeat.....For those who enjoy Eurovision, for those who enjoy some great catchy music and for anyone that enjoys barracking for the underdogs then this is the film for you.

But despite all my prejudices, I gave it a try... And I must admit: I LOVED it.When I was a child I grew up with Eurovision. It was tradition to watch the shows with the family and friends: to laugh at the silly costumes, to mock the corny jokes of the presenters, to hate the act of your own country (but also be absolutely furious if they didn't go to the finals) and to predict which neighbouring countries are voting for each other. But all this makes it Eurovision, it makes it a great experience with lots of fun and laughter. It's something by and for Europeans (and Australia ofcourse). So when we heard Americans are making a movie about our silly songcontest, we protest!... BUT. It was done with a lot of respect for Eurovision. They threw in inside jokes for Europeans, the songs were actually really catchy (and could totally be for Eurovision) and a few familiar faces were present (like Alexander Rybak, Conchita Wurst, Loreen,... Even Graham Norton was there, with his typical sassy comments).I enjoyed every minute of this movie, gave me a lot of nostalgia and even brought a tear in my eye with the song of Sigrit. Rachel McAdams was really great and lovely in this, but Dan Stevens was the star for me.

Added to this terrific tale of an underdog fictional Icelandic entry to the Euro-vision competition are some excellent and hysterical performances from Farrell himself as well as a standout role from Dan Stevens, who really ramps up the camp! Most notable is Rachel McAdam's utterly irresistible charm and quirk that keeps the movie grounded amidst all of the silliness. The music sequences are masterfully interwoven in to the narrative and the comedy is just the right level of over the top that the satire comes across very subtle, making you admire the film instead of just laughing at its absurdity.

Filming locations around the world and great cinematography. Really really funny, great script. Anyone who has seen Eurovision in the past will see the uncanny resemblance, mixed with a healthy dose of sarcasm.What is really great that the film is built on Will Farrell's personal background, being married to a Swedish wife and having been introduced and captivated by the Eurovision phenomenon many years ago.

Absurd dance choreographies, interesting, exaggerated costumes, the firm belief that the contestants must perform their songs in English in order to win, but nevertheless, they salute their fellow citizens by sprinkling few words into the lyrics in their native languages while singing their songs... These are all the details that you can capture if you are familiar with Eurovision Song Contest. Clearly Will Ferrell did his job very well and he did extensive research before even he shot the movie.Will Ferrell is always a good comedian and has shown it in his previous work however the biggest surprise for me was that Rachel McAdams' acting performance was superb in a comedy genre and the two were a great duo.I loved the side characters as well like the decent, self-adoring and possibly gay Russian guy (even though there isn't any homosexuality in Russia!?!), loving and caring Icelanders, good hearted naïve American tourists etc.In these pessimistic depressive pandemic days I am glad that I watched this film.

It felt like it would be 2 hours of cheesy fan fiction that would be hard to stomach. However, I'm surprised how enjoyable it was.Funny of course, but most of all that it was produced with an unexpected depth and it gives you a warm feeling. But sure, at times the tempo of the film gets quite uneven and some scenes can be a drag to watch. But the positive sides outweigh the bad ones. The ""Husavik"" song gives the film a beautiful climax and every time I listen to it, it gives me goosebumps. To be fair, Will Ferrell is not the one who carries the movie. It's mostly thanks to Rachel McAdams and Dan Stevens that it gets as good as it gets. Pierce Brosnan didn't leave a deep impression on me, quite flat performance.

I am amazed that Will Farell has captured all of this so well not being raised with this annual event since 1956! This move is much better than what critics claim and great fun!!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1102,jbetteridge-57513,One of my favourites,10,28 July 2020,"I love this film. Its so easy to watch. It's funny, interesting and even moving at times. It's got some great cameo roles and is a perfect Sunday afternoon film when you don't want to think to much. You can just sit back and enjoy. It's also very well cast. I like will ferrel and this is him allover. (I realise he wrote it). Rachel mcadams is always nice to see 😉",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

1104,bye2,Couldn't finish it.,1,22 August 2020,"Now look, I'm not some holier than thou fancy film reviewer person who thinks that the only films are good have to be directed in france by a 90 year old renowned artist, and I like a lot of stuff that would be considered borderline low brow, bad humour, and as a final note many Will Ferrell films are great and he certainly can be funny. HOWEVER, this just wasn't one of those movies. I couldn't bare to sit through the entire thing as I just completely lost interest. Between two characters I didn't like speaking in very simple ways (hehe icelandic people silly dumb simpleton they speak simple because english bad) there wasn't really much I cared about, nothing to make you want to see what happened in the end; I think the major problem was that I genuinely couldn't care less about what happened to our main protagonists.
There's loads of films that can be very much enjoyable even if they're bad because you laugh at it rather than with it, but this was one of the first times I've felt so perfectly balanced in the middle: Not good enough to be genuinely enjoyable, but not bad enough to be a fun silly time, just miserable.
I can't really put into words why I'm so put off by how unfunny this was but you just gotta take my word for it, cheers.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1105,pikake-60465,Ja Ja Ding Dong! My love for this film is big and review will be long!,10,21 August 2020,"This is seriously Will Ferrell's best film. Makes me want to go to a Eurovision contest and then visit Iceland..if locals will accept me! The unique competition displays talented artists chosen to represent the different countries in Europe. We follow Lars and Siegret who have the lifelong dream of performing in the Eurovision contest. By the power of the Elves they are sent to represent Iceland. The comedic performances and mishaps, along with the development of each character throughout this film is satisfying all the way until the end. Siegret's song was absolutely stunning and powerful. I appreciate this film even more for having a happy and complete conclusion.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

But damn it hit me from the other direction and made this movie one in a million. The ending is one of the best endings in a comedy movie and would not be possible without Will Ferrell, such a great actor, also Rachel McAdams was the perfect sidekick.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

And I've never seen Eurovision (though I've seen a few music contests). And yet - I really enjoyed this film - the acting, singing, story, etc. There were some potential red flags that popped up, but, fortunately, most didn't go the direction that would make them bad and/or into an actual red flag.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

But tonight, ive watched this movie and right after sent to IMDB, as usual, to see what People thought of it... And there it is ! À 6.5 rating... I coulndt resist this time i had to say something... Come oooon guys whats wrong with you !!! Do you have that feeling that once in a while, when we watch a movie, we have the chance to witness something magical happening, something that we call Emotion. You know when you laugh, when you cry, when you have that stupid smile tharyStoryt wont disappear during thé whole movie.
Well thats what happens With Eurovision The Story Of Fire Saga.
Remember Notting Hill ? Love Actually ? Walter Mitty ? These movies that for some are random and for other are classics filled with heart laughs and Emotion that you can watch over and over. Well, if you are like me, Eurovision will be one of those movies.
Its a 10! Or 11, you choose. Ferrell is awesome, and what to say about McAdams performance... Is she the one singing in the movie ? If yes, damn...i will check on Google right away and then watch this movie again!!!Cheers",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

1116,barbaracookefield,Worst Movie,1,4 January 2021,Worst movie I ever saw. Very low budget for Rachel McAdams and Will Ferrell. I was surprised they took on these roles.

But very happy i watched it.,Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1118,waltz-28694,What just happened?,10,18 November 2020,I thought I was gonna watch just another Will Ferrell movie with his usual nonsense. It certainly did start that way and I felt it was poking fun at Iceland but it was a complete sudden turnaround with surprises. It was clearly the opposite as the story went on. The town people themselves thought they were weird. So it wasn't making fun of Iceland people to me. I was like why am I getting teary eyed watching a Will Ferrel movie wishing I was Icelandic for a sec. Coming from U.S. I hope to visit Iceland again in the future...JaJa Ding dong!,Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1119,bhuerkamp,Messy start with incredible ending.,7,6 December 2020,"I am not a huge fan of blockbuster comedies. Half the time the script is sloppy and the final edit ruins the delivery of the best jokes- two things that are painfully present for the first half of this film. However, none of it is glaring and can be overlooked. But if you are a stickler for effortless and seamless storytelling then I have a suspicion you'll turn this off in the first thirty minutes. No matter what, you'll laugh. The humor is clever and the two leads, Ferrell and McAdams, are incredible together, with the latter delivering a nuanced, believable, over-the-top character that Ferrell struggles to land every now and then on his end. The ending satisfyingly ties together the loose ends from the first half with surprising emotional weight- I won't lie I teared up but that's to be expected. Ideal for families with mature kids, middle school and up, and for any fan of comedies.
Lastly, it was refreshing to see a foreign-set comedy that equally laid into the United States, especially when the leads are Americans playing Icelanders in a tongue-in-cheek caricature.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1120,rebekatalebi,Without Will Ferrel&Pierce Brosnan this movie would bomb,5,10 December 2020,"This movie sucks. Script is formulaic. Rachel Mcadams can't act through a paper bag & a lot of the music is truly horrible.On the positive side the girl that sings Rachel Mcadams
songs is Molly Sanden. Molly is an amazing Sprano. The film has funny parts & Will Ferrel sells this movie. Daniel Stevens plays the Russian guy who is extremely funny & does such s great job playing an Eastern European.

As a Swede who has watched Eurovision every year growing up I think this movie was spot on, and I actually started an account just so I could give this movie a 10/10***, because it made me really happy. ""The elves went too far"" has become a standard catch frase in my household and I have to say that Alexander Lemtov is definitely on my top five things to ever come out of Eurovision. Lion of Love was brilliant and if every guy who brought a drunk girl home just gave her an elaborate braided hair creation the world would be a much better place.Thank you Will Ferrel for this wonderful film!*** I'm usually against giving full marks to a film, because there is always room for improvement, but the 6.5 average is an insult.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Props for using a swedish singer for McAdam's vocals, although weird since this is supposed to be the song sent to ESC from Iceland.

1136,fayerosemckendrick,A comforting and heartfelt tribute to dreamers.,8,2 November 2021,"No, this movie is not a gut-busting comedy.No, this movie is not high-minded ""cinema"".No, this movie isn't fast-paced.No, this movie isn't a cascade of visual delights.But this is a great movie, with a simple but engaging plot, gentle yet memorable jokes, and awesome original music.The casting is spot on, and offers the audience a chance to see many familiar faces in fun and different roles. For fans of Downton Abbey, seeing Dan Stevens in this movie was a hilarious delight all its own. Same with Pierce Brosnan. Rachel McAdams lends the movie her typical depth, authenticity and general loveliness. Discovering Will Ferrell's mild but real singing talent was another fun surprise.In a time when we expect SO much from our entertainment, the simplicity of this movie is refreshing. In a world of metaverses, endless sequels and remakes, this movie doesn't feel like it came out of the same meat-grinder. And for that I truly love it. The world right now is harsh. And I found the contrasting harmlessness of this movie to be both soothing and entertaining. Perhaps movie critics don't struggle with anxiety like the rest of us, but sometimes we need media that we know is going to be kind to us. That's what this movie is. It's easy to watch, the plot is not overly complicated or unexpected, and the violent moments are quickly overshadowed by the cuteness of Ferrell and McAdams.My final point is about inclusion. The song-a-long scene is a masterwork of displaying a true rainbow of talented individuals, and I give the makers a lot of credit for intentionally doing that. Ferrell and other producers could have hired a bunch of Hollywood people for the sequence, but they gave the roles to real Eurovision competitors. And that's cool. Nowadays you don't actually need talent to be famous. You don't even need to be a good singer to be cast in musicals now (looking at you, Meryl Streep). So the fact that Ferrel & Co chose to include people who are the real deal I think adds a lot of integrity to the movie.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Granted I predicted the end half way through the movie, that does not diminish in any way how powerful the movie's climax was. Love it or hate hit Will Ferrell was his goofy self, while Rachel McAdams gives a solid emotional performance. The music was great and helps elevate this movie much higher than its punching weight.

So heads up ! :)Like practically everything in life is relative so are emotions and how we perceive certain things revolves around them. Any other time I would rate this movie badly and try to point out sarcastically and with cynicism all its faults but after these hard times for many I too have changed and the message of the movie and the fact that everything we perceive revolves around emotions the solution to the great puzzle are positive emotions. And I don't mean about shallow hedonistic urges but something more than that. And the ultimate positive emotion is LOVE ! Love for others, ones close to us and for the common man who we don't know. I know this message and review is sappy, and that for many who already know and understand this I have only invented hot water, but for those who are not sure about life and are confused and frightened I implore you to discard that fear and concentrate on love and everything will turn out fine.Tomorrow I will prolly cringe on this review but I hope it will help me remember how I felt now and try to remember this message.Eurovision is in a few days, it's a cheesy competition, but as Will Ferrel said in everything around us there is something more than it meets the eye at first.Hope this review helps someone.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Best Will Ferrell flick since whatever you consider his last best one was (haha, I still love all his stuff, but for real, this one..) Be aware, it begins as more of a drama with comedic elements, not your basic Ferrell outing, and then picks up on every level and all the buildup pays off. Rachel McAdams is excellent and really gives the film the heart it excels with. Dan Stevens is excellent, funny but also has a real charisma and charm to what could be a one dimensional character. It's basically Pitch Perfect meets Norsemen meets Blades of Glory. Such a feel-good, underdog film that somehow treads a perfect line of ridiculous comedy, extremely relatable drama, and funny, yet catchy as hell pop-music.

1150,edwoodscorp,"I Hate Eurovision !!! and LOVE ""The Story of Fire Saga""",10,30 June 2020,"I had reached the bottom of the ""Lock-Down"" barrel. So I threw caution to the wind and set to watch the movie.
Immediately the opening sequence lay the plot before me. A bereaved child is lit up by ABBA and ""Waterloo"", his childhood BFF joins in with his father trying to stop his son in this ""Non Macho"" act of embarrassment to him. Lars sets his and Sigrid's future declaring to his fathers friends and family that one day he will win the ""Eurovision""
Like any good book I was hooked within the first pages. In classic Will Ferrell style the story expanded to this hapless character and his childhood BFF (who is clearly in love with Lars). Their dream to become Eurovision winners in their hearts.
Needless to say the path is not an easy one, the story flows seamlessly and hilariously forward.

1161,jonpmann-141-234232,"Camp, fun, yet moving. The whole package",9,30 June 2020,Critics may hate this film because it's fun. They're renowned for hating fun things. This has everything and leaves you feeling so joyful. While for the pedants among Eurovision fans there may be some factual inaccuracies but all those can be overlooked by the sheer joy the film brings. Throw in the world's best songwriters (who've clearly studied the Eurovision style) and it's a winning formula.,Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1162,benjamin-stein,Proof that American humor at European pop culture don't mix well,1,26 June 2020,"First of all, I love irony, sarcasm, parododies and everything that comes along with it. But, in my upinion, to make fun of something, you first have to understand it. And this movie to me is proof that American producers don't know the first thing about Eurovision. The whole way of telling is to way to american, to styled and is lacking everything that this beautiful and also camp about Eurovision. This could have been a great movie, maybe if other people would have been involved. But to me this movie just missed the mark by a mile",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

1165,benhunt78,Great escapism and the best Ferrell film in nearly a decade,9,4 July 2020,"Just the right kind of silly and inspiring escapism we need during a pandemic.PROS:
Iceland
Sigur Ros songs
Rachel McAdams is earnest, sweet and has good chemistry with Ferrell - she's simply perfect in this
Ferrell is still goofy and fun, and this is clearly his well-researched love letter to Iceland
Playful jabs at American tourism in Europe
NEW never/rarely-seen locations on film
Fun music
Elves
Inspiring, despite the sometimes-Adam Sandler level of writing
Ya ya ding dong!CONS:
A big too long, and slow in parts
No plans for a sequel....yet",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1166,metallica_94,Who is this movie even for?,2,16 July 2020,"The songs are catchy and gets a pass as maybe getting played during a party with some laughs. But the overall experience with the movie is ""let it end"". Some scenes move way to fast and skips over parts that could be interesting, with other scenes that add nothing to the plot or story gets way more screen time than needed. They've never left their hometown, we get it, a real Eurovision contester made a cameo, we get it.The bad islandic accents are cringe worthy and Ferrels jokes and humour doesn't hold up in 2020 as good as it should, seeing the cg whales suddenly emerge from the water really hits home the ""don't except anything"" feel this movie had.

1170,kbf_dan,Surprisingly not bad.,6,27 June 2020,"Il be upfront, the dialogue was poor; but I went in with my Hope's low and was not disappointed.This director deserves alot of credit, it was not a great script and he turned it into a decent movie. The music sequences were pretty fun and catchy and for a 2 hour movie it didnt come across as longwinded.The acting was also good but given the poor dialogue seemed to fell short, Special mention to Pierce as the angry Icelandic father; he was great!Overall I was surprised I enjoyed the movie and that is one of the very few Netflix original 'movies' I have enjoyed (I emphasize movies because Netflix has some great tv series).",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

The music was fun and worth listening to, the sets were lively and fun, and Will Ferrell was funny without going too far over the top.

No, it's not something that if it were on TV you would turn on for the 6th time halfway through and watch the rest of the movie. But is it funny? Absolutely. Great for a night in when you want to laugh and watch a movie that boosts your spirits. Rachel McAdams is great, and the songs are a) fun, b) funny, and c) catchy.

The final song absolutely brought me to tears.One of the paramount accomplishments in Will Ferrell's career how he gradually hands over the prominence to McAdams as the film progresses, as well as writing a genuinely interesting antagonist (don't want to say more and spoil it) in Dan Stevens. Amazing cast, and the music is unbelievably good.But what do I know, I'm an American so I'll just go now. To Starbucks.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

1184,themgoachers,Will Ferrel's best movie?,8,4 July 2020,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film.It has received quite a few bad reviews in the press. Yes it would benefit shedding quite a few minutes, but in almost every other respect the critics just don't get it.A well observed and clearly affectionate send up the eurovision song contest, which (fan or not) has been part of the upbringing of millions of Europeans like me. Lots of music including 12 original songs from the brilliant opener Volcano Man to the final touching Icelandic entry in the contest. All capture various takes on Eurovision songs over the years. The ""song along"" sequence is nothing short of joyous.Far from portraying the Icelandic people in a bad light. A caricature yes, but I came away with a feeling of a patriotic, passionate and fun loving people with a sense of community I wish that we had and hope they still do. Some nice footage of amazing Icelandic scenery also.Characters who initially seem two dimensional turn out not to be so, and there's even room for comment on some nations' semi-official attitudes to minorities. Great performances all round with Rachel Mcadam particularly shining.Oh, and it's funny, too.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

Pleased to have watched this in a year so far that has hardly brought much laughter on the film front, plus given Eurovision was cancelled this year!Don't worry about the plot too much, and leave your negativities at the door, this is a laugh a minute along with some good acting from McAdams and Ferrell not always stealing the limelight with normal roles.Great humour and very entertaining!

It would be easy for a film about the Eurovision Song Contest to be a ridiculous parody but this film was clearly made with love for the contest; there are so many references and homages to Eurovision as well as cameo appearances from past winners. The soundtrack is typically Eurovision and the storyline is believable (for Eurovision).

It totally captured the Eurovision quirkiness and added the same excitement. I found myself shouting for Iceland!!

Will Ferrell once again played an innocent bystander in a mean world and aced it, whilst Rachel McAdams did a brilliant job as the sweet girl, standing in front of a boy and asking him to love her.The songs were better than most of the songs I've heard in the actual contest too.This movie was funny, heartwarming and wasn't afraid to stick to a well worn method.

All the songs in this movie are absolutely fantastic and by far the best part of the movie, they really nailed the eurovision vibe.
The main thing that brings this movie down is the story in between the songs. If this movie was 90 minutes I think it would be much better, but instead we get these drawn out conflicts that we all know the ending of and all we can do is just wait for them to resolve it and sing another fantastic song.
I would still recommend this movie if you want something stupid and fun, but not much else.
All in all, absolutely what is needed right now to scratch that all important eurovision itch, but the story disappoints.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

How could she and Pierce Brosnan have agreed to make this low-grade movie?Poor writing made it a torture to watch........and Ferrell proceeded to take the life out of it in his portrayal of the character.

A film about a duo from Iceland entering Eurovision. It's fun, it's long and it's as cheesy as the real thing. I enjoyed it; it has cheered me up and has almost made up for the real thing being cancelled.
True Eurovision fans will love it, the story is contrived but moves along nicely. Quite a few recent Eurovision winners turn up for a sing along which is fun, and Mr Graham Norton talks us through the contest itself, so for us Brits it's a bit like the real thing.My only criticism is that they didn't get Mans Zelmerlow and Petra Mede in for a cameo; they were amazing hosting the 2016 contest and would have lent some extra sparkle.If you love Eurovision you won't need much persuading to watch this, if you don't love Eurovision, give it a try anyway, it will bring you a smile, and maybe a tear as well.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

The costume design,the sound production and casting-all on point.
The movie is Will Ferrell classic silliness. If you know you know.

Songs that could easily have been entered into the competition itself, cameos from some of the best Eurovision performers in the last couple of years and a wonderfully warm performance from Dan Stevens as a fabulous Russian with George Michael circa 1980's Wham hair. Will Ferrell perfectly plays the passion and enthusiasm that people have for the Eurovision, Capturing all the crazy but through a lens of absolute love and joy.

This was a very funny, well-written, well-casted comedy. I watched it on the plane and had to keep myself from laughing out loud several times! I actually thought this comedy was brilliant.

Fantastic Songs! Beautiful final song of the contest, and others bangers like ""Ja Ja Ding Dong""Awesome cast. I especially like Dan Stevens character, Alexander Lemtov (RUS). His final scene with the Greek entry was a good bit of social commentary.Great Tourism ad for Iceland! I want to go on an Elf tour!Lots of fan service with previous acts, winners, and lots of Waterloo!CONS:
The Scoreboard of the Semi Final annoyed me! It was totally wrong.Can drag in placesNon-British hosts, despite Eurovision being hosted in Edinburgh (little thing).Overall, I loved it!

I hate watching movies on repeat but it just came out and I've already seen it twice. Very rewatchable movie. I don't think anyone was expecting so much emotion in that last song. I felt like celebrating in the streets for Fire Saga after that last song and then had to remind myself they weren't a real band. I think it's one of Will Ferrell's funniest movies. It's also cool to go back on YouTube to listen to the songs and see all the comments saying ""I'm from Iceland and I approve!""

Because I'm not a huge WF fan and stuff, but then turns out his wife is Swedish and he's a big Eurovision fan so I was like ""hmmm, I'll give him a break. Let's see where this goes.""And then off course they involved us (Iceland) and came here and shot stuff and have Icelandic actors and stuff. :D The thing that annoys me the most really is THOSE WERE NOT ICELANDIC NAMES. lol. They were Swedish or Scandinavian, but in my head-canon it's because like they come from like Swedish immigrants or something. XDI loved how at the start of the movie it's just all in Icelandic, but oh boy, Brosnan's Icelandic is atrocious. I had no idea what he was trying to say. XD They should have dubbed him, but he tried. lol. And then everything went to english. XDBut I like to think it's like the babblefish in The hitchhikers Guide or the chameleon circuit in the Tardis, they are still talking in Icelandic, it's just translated into English. XD That doesn't explain everything, lol. But that's again my head-canon. lololI LOOOOVVED the cameos from actual past Eurovision performers. I especially loved Conchita Wurst's outfit. <3_<3And the songs are so good or dorky and totally Eurovision-y! The original songs and the use of the other Icelandic songs. <333 And all the stuff on stage? Literally all of it has happened to some degree. XD None of that was unrealistic. XDBasically I just loved the whole movie because it makes fun, but it makes fun with love. Ya know? Like you can make fun of a sibling, but no one else because you do it with love. hahah. And I love that they did it like with the EBU. <333Some critics were like saying oh it has no edge or something and like who said it needed an edge? Pfft. Give me all the sillyness and escapism. And some seem to think they need to be offended on behalf of Icelanders, but trust me, we're not offended at all. XD We love it. XDAnd like about the elves. They probably don't exist, but you never know. So you know better safe than sorry, tbh. XD Just show some respect. XDI loved Alexander so much too. lol. But feel a bit sad for him too. :(That Húsavík song was so great. <3_<3 But lol, people in Iceland the last few days have been all about the Ja Ja Ding Dong. XD It's perfect. *chef's kiss* lolol.It's just silly, and happy and dorky and Eurovision in all it's glory. XD I love it in all its wacky glory, but I also can take it seriously. Maybe sometimes too seriously. XD Because I also want a good song to win and not a too gimmicky of an act. But yes, ugh, i can't wait for ESC next year. Also Iceland could have won this year with Think about things with Daði and the ganamagn. :'( But we'll just have to try again next year! XD",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

But this movie is amazing! The humor is often goofy, but it's not as over the top as is usual for him. And oh, the feels!!! I laughed my @$$ off in parts and I wiped away tears in others. The cast is wonderful overall, but McAdams and Ferrell had such great chemistry that you can't help but love them as a couple. And the music! I was close to sobbing in my third viewing of the movie during ""Hussavarik"" because the vocals and the sentiments were so beautiful. I actually watched this one day, kept thinking about showing it to my boyfriend, and sat him down to watch it 24 hours later, and he loved it too. And it was as fun to watch a day later as it was that first time.I cannot recommend this movie enough. It's fun, goofy, and sweet with some clever surprises and fabulous music. And, oh my god, elves!

2hour of forgetting about all the stuff that is happening in the world and allow ourself some fun.This is a good old facion feelgood movie. In short its an american version of Still Crazy but with Eurovision.
It has a thin plot. Bad jokes. Great jokes. Amazing cast. And incredibly catchy songs.Its a 2hour long period of your day. Where you can laugh about the banality of the Eurovision. And still feel inspired.Beeing a Norwegian. When i grew up in the 80's in a small Village . With fishing boats. And the Artic light around us his was one of the biggest tv event of the year. And we all had the same dream as Erik.
And over the years we have seen the contest evolve in to this weirdly glitter fest.
And to be able to capture this on film. Was to me amazing. Its smart while being stupid. Its cute while being crude. And its has self irony.
I give it 10points. Not because its the best movie ever. But because for 2hours it made me smile. Laugh. Akward. And it gave me incredible goosebumps.

1294,grahamalex2001,As a proud Eurovision lover this film is everything!,10,26 June 2020,"I love Eurovision! I have no shame about this! Every year we have a get together with drinks and food and scoresheets and have the best night! This year everything changed, there was no get together, no singing our favourite songs, no voting and it was so so so missed!Tonight me and my sister thought let's give this a go, it will be a laugh. Well we were given Eurovision life! It was everything that we love about eurovision! The songs, the cheesiness, the love! Watch the film, enjoy it like a weekend of eurovision and don't take it seriously!The storyline is cute, its not forced it just flows and even if the length of the film feels long to you, you may not be a fan of eurovision (that show is long!!). I didn't want it to end and some of those songs are pure euro classics!! I have to say as a UK native we haven't won in a long long time so the only implausible part of the film is that it is in the UK and the hosts are not British but apart from that I will be watching this film anytime I feel sad as it has made my evening and made up the fact that eurovison was cancelled this year!Enjoy the film and don't take it seriously because Eurovision is just fun and meant to be enjoyed!!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

A great feel-good movie.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1297,rokmarrsemail,Shockingly Great,10,27 June 2020,I had little to no expectations for this movie. It turned out to be one of the best if not the best Will Ferrell movies. The two main characters were great and it's really a perfect feel good comedy. The music was also really good. That last song gave me goosebumps!,Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1298,sarahlupky,Good Job,8,26 June 2020,"Very enjoyable, cried happy and sad tears. Laughed through most of it and loved the song-a-long! The elves bit was cute also. This is one of the better Netflix original movies.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1299,akulapera,brought a nice mood,10,18 July 2020,"I felt depressed and wanted to watch something nice, no expectations, no desire for anything ""progressive"" (although there still was a tiny bit of it, i guess, Netflix can't help it), just a movie. Unfortunately, that's hard to find nowadays and I was glad I came across this movie.
Appreciate the beautiful scenery, it was interesting to see Iceland, very nice songs and some humor. All and all - the movie put me in a good mood and that's all what I wanted.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

1304,garrett-73870,Might be funny if you're 10,4,28 June 2020,It's not bad as far as the actors and cinematography goes but the writing failed the movie. It's watchable but not overly enjoyable.,Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1305,aevandewijngaard,A suprise from the Americans,9,28 June 2020,"As an European, with Will Ferrell, I was expecting Americans just mocking Europeans and their Eurovision. This movie suprised me, I truly loved it. The songs, the references to Eurovision, the story line, I laughed and cried. They nailed it. I don't know why they choose Iceland, but it was a great tribute to this amazing country and people. Thank you for brightening up this dark year!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

1307,cassandrapowell,"Funny , Clever ..... a great watch",10,28 June 2020,"Will Ferrell at his best, ....... probably one of his best productions. A cool story, and so cool to be able to watch a recent release that isn't full of expletives.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

1311,carljohnbovis,All heart!,10,30 June 2020,"This film really draws you in and ends up surprising you with its heart. It's the ultimate 'feel good' movie!
I love silly humour, and whilst there are a few silly scenes, the film is driven along by the wonderful characters and delightful music.
Rachel McAdams is an absolute delight in this, a shining star in a surprisingly beautiful 2 hours of entertainment. I loved it!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1312,linziellendobson,Hilarious!,10,24 July 2020,"Wow. What a much needed surge of humour! I watched this with my friend and we both absolutely loved it.

The film had a perfect balance of humour/goofiness and emotional scenes. Bravo to everyone involved. Many of the songs going in my playlist!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

1315,kamenovelena,10/10,10,29 December 2020,"The storyline touched me. the last song.. i came to tears. i moved countries at a young age and the movie was something i could relate to. i felt that the characters were well thought out and presented really well. the movie had a really funny kink to it, it's gave it just what it needed. it had me hooked onto the story from the start - the first time i put my phone down during a movie. it's really ran home for me and by the way that the movie is presented, i only hope others get touched by it too. the actors were stunning. the story was stunning. the music was stunning. the message was stunning.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

1320,marybethkidd,A new low,1,16 May 2021,I cannot ever get back the time I wasted on watching this waste of purported talent.,Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1321,welshlouise,Great watch,9,28 June 2020,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Unlike a lot of Ferrell's movies, it was hilarious because of its subtlety. I personally prefer that kind of humour.
I loved the characters, the relationships and chemistry was believable. A well written and very enjoyable movie with some fantastic music!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

1325,freyas_far,Better then Waterloo,10,27 June 2020,"Frighteningly realistic. Unfortunately, the American audience without the knowledge of Eurovision does not understand how good a movie this is.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1326,eranju,The real star was Graham Norton all along.,7,10 July 2020,"No, really. I don't know if he does actual commentary work for English speaking Eurovision broadcasts, but he absolutely nailed it with his narration of Iceland's performances. It made me miss one of our former commentators, known for his acidic wit and merciless mockery of anything he could point his finger at.The rest of the cast did a decent job too, I guess. After all, Norton's commentary wouldn't have been half as funny without something to comment on.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1327,kimheyes-29252,For Eurovision lovers everywhere!,10,26 June 2020,"This is fab! It embodies the cheese of Eurovision in the best way. Hilarious.

And there is some fantastic Iceland and Scotland scenery, both of which are stunning.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1328,jodiecj,I'm checking you out!,8,8 July 2020,"I've always loved both Will Ferrell and Rachael McAdams ( hope I spelled her name right). I wasn't sure if i was into it at first but Will Ferrell!!!! That's always a yes, so I watched and he delivered, as always, a stellar performance in his usual awkward yet lovable acting style! . Oh and Ingrit was so sweet, so adorable and so full of love and compassion and loyalty to Larrs and to her hometown. I felt like crying and it wasn't what I expected to feel. I was on the edge of my seat, at times, the feelings were overwhelming. The ending, however, was so stunning, so perfect! I don't know how they create these movies. I'm in love with these two actors. As an aside, If Elf had been made with anyone other than Will Ferrell, it wouldn't have had such charm and the child like innocence that made it what it was . I'll leave it with two very enthusiastic thumbs up! Please keep going, Mr. Ferrell, you are a genius!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1329,drtejasbarot,Amazingly beautiful movie,10,29 June 2020,"I watched the trailer before but I did think this movie could be this crazy....Man
Every time during the movie you fill omg I didn't think that this gonna come up next....

Not the funniest film, but if you're looking to lose yourself for 2hrs then you'll love this. Catchy music, silly humour, ridiculous characters, it has it all. Stock your critics head in a bag under the stairs and enjoy!!!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1331,baileyconnew,Better than expected!,10,27 June 2020,"I believed it was a film to just mock Eurovision but instead it was just a fun and really well made film. Both extremely stupid and funny but I've got to say it's a really good film in general, the storyline and cast were brilliant!! Very much recommend, especially to Eurovision fans😊",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

1333,marius_moen,Spot on for us europeans,10,5 July 2020,"This movie is more for europeans. I don't think the americans get all the irony and how europeans reccon the atmosphere around Eurovision Song Contest that takes place every year in Europe.
Movie is just great! They use artist and people from Eurovision. Maybe USA will open their eyes for the Eurovision contest. Many actuall preforming artist is part of the movie :) Just love it!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1334,laurabrown-15416,Loved it!!!,10,30 June 2020,"Absolutely adored it. I'm a major Eurovision fan, and have been watching since Dami Im preformed for Australia in 2016. My family had just learnt to deal with it, but when I forced them all to watch this film for my birthday, they actually liked. There was lots of laughter and awesome music. I would so recommend watching it again and again! (I have already seen it three times!!!!)",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1335,jellybeanuk,Cheese at its best,8,29 June 2020,"If you love the cheesiness of Eurovision then this is perfect for you. The songs are catchy, I defy anyone not to be singing yaya ding-dong afterwards. The story is funny and light. Eurovision isn't about serious musicians for me, its all about dodgy tunes, bad costumes and cheesy songs and I love it!!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga

1337,andyhanlon-84448,2 hours I will never get back!,1,14 July 2020,"I personally wouldn't waste my time watching this film, we put it on as something to watch as we knew it would be cheesy little did we know how horrific it was going to be!Setting the Eurovision in Edinburgh but pretending to film it in the Hydro in Glasgow and showing it as if it was just at the end of the street was really cringeworthy.Save yourself 2hrs and watch something else.

1339,meiscool132,As insane as Eurovision itself!,9,27 June 2020,"Eurovision is characterised by its wildness and craziness, which I feel this movie represented extremely well! I admit I was scared to see the interpretation of the contest that this movie would present, but after watching it I was pleasantly surprised how they managed to incorporate the spirit of Eurovision into everything that happened in the film, resulting in a fun, albeit not realistic, representation of a journey to (somewhat) fame.",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1340,petratuhkanen,New classic,10,27 July 2020,"I didn't expect much from this movie but it was really good. Exciting, funny, sad, romantic and I loved the music. I've already seen the movie twice and will probably watch it again this year 🙂.For me the movie is the same as Fire Saga in Eurovision. Probably wouldn't win any contest but it won my heart 🙂😊",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1341,michela-65272,Instant cult classic,10,28 June 2020,"I was only 5 minutes into the film where I had to rush to my social media accounts and tell people they needed to drop whatever they were doing and going to watch this film. Loved everything about it. One of Ferrell's best comedies, in my opinion, which I will cherish next to Anchorman. Loved the effort put in showcasing some of the nuances of life in Iceland. Ironically, the night before we had started watching ""The Valhalla's murders"" a Netflix drama detective series, but as it is set in the same city of Húsavík including some of the interior sets, now I can no longer watch it with a straight face.😆
Enjoyed the chemistry between Ferrell and McAdams. And shout out to Croydon-born Dan Stevens whose character Alexander Lemtov gave me some of the biggest laughs and I'm sure it will do for everyone who can read between the lines.Also...my 12 points go to:
Ja Ja Ding Dong
PLAY IIIIIIT!!!!",Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
1342,junk-42762,Appreciated by Europeans and Will Ferrell fans alike!,10,28 August 2020,"My husband is from Europe, and grew up watching the Eurovision song contest. Then, he introduced it to me. This movie TOTALLY captures the spirit and the essence of Eurovision. If you haven't, I highly recommend viewing a few year's worth...and then watching this movie again. You may even spot a few former Eurovision ""stars""! I'm a huge Will Ferrell fan...my husband, not so much.
