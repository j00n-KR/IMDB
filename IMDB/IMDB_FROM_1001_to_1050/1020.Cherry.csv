0,nogodnomasters,Warrior Medics,4,2 May 2021,The film opens with Cherry (Tom Holland) as a bank robber. The bulk of the film takes us up to that point and then beyond. Summary plot spoiler: Cherry goes to college. Meets Emily (Ciara Bravo) Joins army. Married. Iraq. PTSD. Drug addict. Bank robber. Prison rehab. Happily ever after. While it had some good scenes for the most part it was tedious to watch as the film dragged on. I was way too long. Tom Holland just wasn't that good or interesting.Guide: F-word. Implied sex. No nudity.,Cherry
1,CinemaSerf,Sad indictment of a throw away society...,6,18 March 2021,"It's a bit of a tough film to review, this one. On the one hand it is an incredibly downbeat mix of depression, drug addiction, wholesale societal neglect and human deficiencies that make it very difficult to empathise - on any level - with the characters. On the other, it offers us a truly enthralling performance from Tom Holland as the eponymous character. The premiss being that ""Cherry"" is a bit of a drop-out whom, but for his love of ""Emily"" (Ciara Bravo) has little of value in his life. He enlists in the US army and finds some succour in the camaraderie and discipline that offers - despite the horrors of the war in Iraq, during which he serves as a medic. When he returns, and reunited with his now wife, he struggles to get to grips with a community that neither needs nor wants him. His jobs are few and far between, unchallenging, and as his obvious PTSD begins to dominate his personality which all creates the perfect Petrie dish for the spiralling vortex of anger, despair and hard drugs involving both of them that starts to take charge of their lives. Funding their expensive habit proves little problem for him - he merely takes to, almost comically, robbing banks. At times this is dark and gritty offering us a really potent assessment of just how thoughtlessly a nation treats those who travel the world fighting in it's name, and it is not devoid of some pretty sardonic humour, but for much of the rest of the time the story has a relentlessly bleak and predictable nature to it. I could have been doing with more of Bravo's character, too - her frustration as an emotionally invested bystander who is dragged into this abyss could have seen extra development, particularly as she is the lone stabilising influence on her wayward husband. I haven't a puritanical bone in my body but please, when will writers stop assuming that expletive-ridden dialogue provides some sort of substitute for character development or tension? It doesn't - it merely demonstrates a lack of skill on their part to allow rich (rather then ripe) language to help develop the characters. Though I did not expect to love them, and ""Cherry"" himself isn't inherently a bad man, the decline into their narcotic stupor is thrust upon us to quickly and all too easily - curious given that this film is very (far too, in my view) long. Newton Thomas Sigel has worked well with the Russo's to create a film that reeks of authenticity, but I am afraid it's just all been done before... It does demonstrate ably, though, that young Mr. Holland has more to offer than just a cute bum in Lycra, and like Dan Radcliffe - that he is not afraid to take his career in radically differing directions which has got to augur well for the future of his career and our entertainment.",Cherry
2,ferguson-6,he likes trees ... and drugs,6,1 March 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are known for their work with Marvel, including, AVENGERS: ENDGAME, and AVENGERS: INFIINITY WAR. This time they tackle a stylish crime-thriller based on the Nico Walker novel, and adapted for the screen by co-writers Angela Russo-Otsot (sister of the directors) and Jessica Goldberg. The Russos reunite with Tom Holland (Spider-Man in the Marvel universe), and he proves quite capable of carrying the heavy load in a bleak and somber drama.Opening a film with a Van Morrison song is always a welcome move, and then it cuts right to Holland as our lead character narrating as he executes armed robbery at a local Cleveland bank. He admits it's not his first and that his face has been caught on camera a few times. Oh, and he discloses to us that he likes trees. It's not the last time we ask, ""Why?""The directors break the film into segments, beginning with Part 1: 2002, ""When life was beginning, I saw you."" In English class, he spots Emily (Ciara Bravo) and soon the romance is in full bloom. A too-quick decision has him joining the Army, and the two lovebirds tie the knot before he heads out. In this segment, we learn that he takes Xanax for panic attacks, and his best friend is James (Forrest Goodluck).Part 2 takes us through Basic Training, where Holland's character pushes through the brutal Drill Instructors to become a medic, which transitions into Part 3 known as Cherry (the name given to Holland's character after his first battlefield action. His time in Iraq finds him watching as his Army pal Jimenez (Jeff Wahlberg, Mark's nephew) dies from wounds.Part 4 ""Home"", shifts the film from a character study to a case study on the extremes of PTSD. Even though he is back with Emily, the love of his life, Cherry simply can't function as a normal person. The medal for his heroic war efforts means nothing to a man who can't sleep or find peace. His self-destructive actions include drinking, drug addiction, and a series of bad decisions ... all dragging his lovely Emily right down with him. This leads to Part 5 ""Dope Life"", which is without question, one of the most depressing and difficult to watch segments of any movie I can recall. It's every bit as much of a downer as THE BOOST (1988), LEAVING LAS VEGAS (1995), or REQUIEM FOR A DREAM (2000). The film becomes a sea of drugs, bank robberies, and needles in arms.Long time cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel (DRIVE, 2011; THE USUAL SUSPECTS, 1999) assists with the horrific sensation that these situations evoke by capturing the desperation of the characters and squalor of their environment. The Epilogue covers an extended period time through present day, and though the ending is not really a surprise, we do wish a bit more context had been provided. The initial bank robbery we see basically bookends the film leaving us trying to recover from this Romance-War-Mental Health-Drug Addiction-Crime thriller that saps our energy. This is not one for those who prefer light-hearted cinema or get annoyed by cheap filmmaker tricks.

3,deloudelouvain,"Great performances, drugs are bad m'kay...",8,7 July 2021,"Second movie in a row for me featuring Tom Holland. After Chaos Walking, that was quite enjoyable to me as a fantasy movie and that despite the low ratings it got, this time Cherry, a powerful movie about PTSD but mostly about addiction, heroin addiction to be more precise. Not as powerful as The Basketball Diaries but certainly good enough to keep you far away from heroin after watching it. Tom Holland just nailed it here, very good performance playing his character. Ciara Bravo also did a good job. The destructive relationship they are in, the issues that both have, it's all well filmed and keeps you interested in the entire story. A long movie but never boring. Good to excellent cinematography, great cast, great story, what else can you ask for? Again an underrated movie with Tom Holland.",Cherry
4,FeastMode,zero entertaining,2,14 April 2021,"This movie was sooooo boring. There was no intrigue. The story was just a random sequence of disjointed events that felt like 3 different movies.

5,Thanos_Alfie,Outstanding Tom Holland...,7,21 March 2021,"""Cherry"" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a young man going to Iraq to serve as an army medic after he drops out from college. When he returns back he suffers from PTSD and his life changes since drugs and crime are getting into it.I liked this movie very much because it was very interesting, consisted of many dramatic scenes that lifted even more the movie. The direction which was made by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, was simply amazing and they did an excellent job on presenting not only the plot but also their main characters. The interpretation of Tom Holland who played as Cherry, was simply outstanding and with this interpretation he proved that he can play whatever role they need him to play. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Ciara Bravo's who played as Emily and Forrest Goodluck's who played as James Lightfoot. Finally, I have to say that ""Cherry"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",Cherry
6,cruise01,Powerful crime drama about addiction and struggling with ptsd.,8,17 March 2021,"4 out of 5 stars.Cherry is a good crime drama film about a ptsd former army vet struggling with addiction. Strong performances by Ciara Bravo and Tom Holland. Powerful moving drama. For Anthony And Joe Russo next direction effort post Avengers films. Going back to the grounded serious drama roots.What worked?The plot was strong moving. Following Cherry (Tom Holland) whos feeling lost and wanting purpose. He fell in love with Emily (Ciara Bravo). When dealing with her wanting to move away. He joins the army. Going through boot camp and sent to Iraq. He faces loss and traumatic moments that changes him forever. Emily and him still keep in touch with there love for another. Once home, Emily notices Cherry is dealing with ptsd. His addiction with drugs becomes worse. Which leaves him struggling for money to robbing banks.Great performances with the cast ensemble. Lead by Tom Holland and Ciara Bravo. From there moments of young love to dealing with addiction that over takes them both.It is a powerful direction that does move at a pace with Cherrys college life. Meeting Emily. Than the military experiences. And his ptsd struggles. The film does build a strong emotional connection with the characters and there performances.Henry Jackmans music score is also good with the film.What did not work with the film?The films narrative structure works until it breaks the fourth wall barrier which gives an uneven tone and style for this kind of film.Overall, it is a good film to check out with a strong moving drama. And great performances.",Cherry
7,eddie_baggins,"A wasted opportunity, all flash no substance",4,28 June 2021,"The first film they've directed since the one-two double smash that was Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, Marvel heroes Anthony and Joe Russo have barely sat ideal since their global box office dominating hits landed, with their newly launched production company (responsible for last years overrated Netflix hit Extraction) keeping them on their toes and this high profile Apple release showcasing their lives away from the Marvel wheelhouse.Adapting Nico Walker semi-autobiographical book that deals with PTSD, war, addiction and bank robbery, Cherry is a film loaded with ideas, situations and opportunities but this over-long and over-stylised affair that is the very definition of all flash no substance is a disappointing affair from the directing siblings who manage to squander a game leading man and a potentially loaded narrative on an end effort that is notable only in its ability to disappear from a viewers memory almost instantaneously.Going the Fight Club dark comedy meta route that also tries to mould together with some type of Jarhead like vibe (with Tom Holland's Cherry even directly addressing the audience on more than one occasion), the Russo's seem obsessed with never letting Cherry sit back and find its own voice or reason as they mess with aspect ratios, on screen text and odd filming/editing choices, with Cherry feeling like a way too show off how ""cool"" and inventive the director's can be, rather than a film made to capture an audience in a tale of one man's downfall in the midst of traumatic experiences he faced fighting for his country.Once more doing his best to shed his innocent Spider-Man boy wonder image, Tom Holland gives it his all here as the Russo's leading man.In almost every single scene of the film and getting a lot of time to work with a multi-dimensional character we never truly feel an affiliation towards nor a true understanding of what drives them forward, Holland is the main reason to watch this flashy exercise in self-excess and its his most wild performance yet as Cherry goes on a life-changing experience through war, drugs and the dealing with ones bad decisions and its through no fault of this talented performer that the film his in fails to make a mark.In some ways Cherry may be the type of film that finds itself reevaluated in the years down the track with alternative views lending their voices to a film ahead of its time and one that pokes fun at the American way of life but as it stands right now at this day and time Cherry feels like a self-indulgent and over confident affair that manages to say very little about a wide ranging group of topics as its confident nature gets lost in a procession of scenes and situations that never join together to create an overly cohesive or fulfilling tale.Final Say -A major step back for the Russo brothers from the behemoth's that were the last two Avengers films, Cherry is jam-packed with ideas and potential but its obsession with its own style and showmanship can't make up for the fact its weak storytelling and character development leave a lot too be desired.2 safes out of 5.",Cherry
8,Tweetienator,Mediocre,5,24 March 2021,"There are those movies where the production company tries to boost their movie with lots of fake reviews. I dare to say that 8 out of 10 reviews claiming Cherry to be ""best movie for a long time"", ""best movie ever"" and so on are fake. I personally look first at the ratings of the top 1000 voters - many times it is the most accurate rating you will get on Imdb. At the moment me writing my review the rating of Cherry by the Top 1000 is 5.4 and I totally agree. Cherry is no bad movie but most we get we already watched in other movies and better done. On top the movie is ""oversized"" and got a lot of lenghty parts that put me almost to sleep, all that talking by the main character worked almost like a lullaby on me. For Tom Holland fans Cherry may be a epiphany (he does well) but for me Cherry is one of those mediocre movies that are produced en masse these days and in a few weeks I won't remember at all. For Tom Holland's fanbase.",Cherry
9,southdavid,... bomb.,4,14 April 2021,"What I struggle with, having finished ""Cherry"" is that having made the most profitable film of all time (at the time) I can't figure why this over familiar, pedestrian tale is what they chose to make when surely anything and everything was on the table.Struggling at college, 'Cherry' (Tom Holland), believing that his girlfriend Emily (Clara Bravo) is moving away, so decides to join the Army. He serves his tour in Iraq but the horrors of what he's seen over there stay with him and though he returns to Emily his is a changed man. Wracked by PTSD, he soon discovers that drugs are the only things that will calm his mind and eventually escalates to become a heroin addict and drags Emily into the grip of the needle too. With money short and needing the next fix, Cherry starts to hold up banks to pay his debts.Though I didn't enjoy the film, and I'm going to get to why, I do think that it's a good central performance from Tom Holland. He's never particularly convincing with the aging aspect of the film but is believable in the rest of the role and it requires a lot of him.""Cherry""s problem is one of over familiarity, plenty of films have covered exactly the topics explored in the film and with greater detail. The film, rather grandiosely, cuts itself into chapters that cover his college, army and addict years respectively but there's nothing new, or unexpected, that's said in any of them. I also think, and this is perhaps the most startling thing, it's actually quite badly made. Long lingering shots that I imagine are supposed to portray depth just bloat the running time and odd little quirky moments, like the names of the banks or the anus shot undermine the films dark themes.Again, don't want to sully Holland's performance, but I can't believe that with all the clout they must have had, this was the film the Russo's decided to make.",Cherry

11,arthur_tafero,Better Than Average Drug Film - Cherry,6,28 October 2021,"This film supposedly has five parts, but it appears as if the longest and most important part of the film is the drug life (dope life). Some parts of the film are very well done, such as the basic training part of the film and the war zone part of the film. After that, it gets bogged down in the drug scene. Not a bad try, and good acting by the leads. Worth viewing.",Cherry
12,yusufpiskin,"Worst performance of Tom Holland, which I admire...",4,12 March 2021,"Cherry was a miss for me. I don't think it's the worst movie of 2021 like some people seem to think, but for a movie about heroin and robbing banks it sure isn't all that interesting.I think the main thing is that there is a mismatch between the story and the presentation. The narrator of Nico Walker's Cherry (which is himself, in everything but name) is purposely limited in characteristics and motivations. The author can say that he's just recording his life as it was, but what makes it interesting to me is that this could have been anyone in 2005-2010. So many people went into the military for stupid reasons, so many people were over-prescribed opioids. Cherry isn't a character study; that's..kinda the point. It's about a very average guy getting tossed around by a failed state. The Russos try to amend this to a moral tale about how love can bring us back even when we stray from the right path. But to conclude that is to miss that ""the path"" is exactly what led him and thousands others here.I enjoyed elements of the movie Cherry. There are some nice little details here and there (the girlfriend's ribbon later becoming a way to tie up her arm). I think the two leaders performers in particular did really well here, although they definitely don't look 36 by the time the movie ends. I'm shocked that the boot camp scenes survived unedited. But that doesn't make the whole piece, in my opinion. Cherry is a trashy book written by hand on loose paper in a prison cell. It's not Goodfellas, it's just some guy. That sort of everyman quality is not conveyed when the movie shows Spider-Man shooting up on a closed-down street with opera playing.",Cherry

14,masonsaul,Really good drama,7,15 March 2021,"The narrative is extremely formulaic, the narration too overbearing and the Russo Brother's style feels like it's trying way too hard to be serious and pretentious but Cherry still manages to be a really good and affecting drama that pulls no punches. Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance supported by Ciara Bravo who is also incredible. Jack Reynor and Forrest Goodluck are both really good. It's well paced, well filmed and the music by Henry Jackman is amazing.",Cherry
15,arungeorge13,"Tom Holland shines in a messy, dope-driven crime drama! [+49%]",5,13 March 2021,"The post-Avengers-era Russos come with a truckload of directorial weight. We've almost forgotten their filmography prior to Winter Soldier. So, when they adapt Nico Walker's semi-autobiographical novel into a film with Tom Holland playing the protagonist, it's natural to have raised expectations. The outcome, however, is a mixed bag. Holland comes up with a mostly credible performance. As a college dropout and later, a drug addict, he delivers the goods with aplomb. The army scenes are where his performance seems a bit off. That could also be attributed to weak writing. Stylistically, Cherry is on the higher side. Several scenes play out like music videos. The jarring genre shifts (from romance to war to stoner to crime drama) between chapters affect the emotional payoff in the viewing experience.The fourth-wall-breaking narration is also something I didn't enjoy. This is because the narration doesn't add any further nuance to what we already see. Here, it comes across as spoon-feeding and a bit self-indulgent. The editing too leaves you scratching your head. With one too many bank heists happening in a span of minutes, it becomes difficult for the viewer to treat this stretch with that much-needed sense of underlying tension. The Russos seem to be trying a tad too hard to get their storytelling point across in this film. The epilogue may or may not enhance the film's overall mediocrity, depending on your tastes. I personally found it needless and that phoney-looking moustache didn't do the scene any favours. In short, if there's one solid reason to watch this flick, it's Tom Holland.",Cherry

19,kjproulx,Great Content in a Visually Exhausting Film,6,30 March 2021,"Joe and Anthony Russo (also known as ""The Russo Brothers"" on most of their projects together) have obviously made a name for themselves in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, directing four of their biggest films to date. Not only have they made a name for themselves in terms of audience appreciation and box office return, but also in the fact that every film they've worked on as directors has been praised, aside from maybe You, Me, and Dupree. I have been a big fan of their work since the series Community and have followed most of their producing work with films like 21 Bridges and Extraction. They've always been a duo to me that works really well together. For all of these reasons and more, I was looking forward to their first outing as directors outside of Marvel. Cherry is now streaming on Apple TV+ and here are my thoughts.After dropping out of school and falling in love with Emily (Ciara Bravo), a character by the name of Cherry (Tom Holland) chooses to join the army as a medic. After experiencing horrors in war, he is discharged. Suffering from extreme PTSD and trying to keep his life together with Emily, he turns to drugs. Eventually leading to bank robbings and dangerous situations, this film is really just the downward spiral of a person's life and whether or not they will make it out alive. The second half of this film had me feeling extremely uncomfortable, which is, I'm sure, was the exact intention. For that, I give the film major props, but it's also too unfocused as an overall movie most of the time.The first act of Cherry sets the stage in terms of the style, which didn't work for me right off the bat. Honestly, I'm all for narration and slow motion, but it felt like nearly every other shot was either in slow motion or was being overly explained by Tom Holland. This became a distraction for me. Yes, both of these do lessen as the film progresses and focuses more on the dramatic aspects of his life, but I didn't find myself as attached to this character as I wanted to be. I felt like I was being told everything instead of experiencing it. As I was watching Cherry, it became apparent that the directors seemed to think it was a very clever and stylistic choice to have a lot of slow-motion to accentuate certain moments, and although it worked sometimes, it began to feel redundant.The absolute biggest strength of this film, at least in my opinion, was Tom Holland. Ever since his appearance as a much younger actor in the film The Impossible, I knew he had talent that wasn't going away. Whether or not he chooses the best projects, he always gives scene-stealing performances in them. That description of him is absolutely in the forefront here as well. From his nearly innocent performance in the first act to finding and ruining his life in the second, I genuinely felt like I was watching someone spiral out of control. Holland sold the movie in many more ways than one in that regard.Overall, the impact of the story is very much there, but there were too many creative choices that didn't work for me here. Both Holland and Bravo's performances deserved a better screenplay, but they worked with what they were given. Joe and Anthony Russo are terrific filmmakers, but this one felt like they stepped out of their comfort zone in some strange ways. I never fully connected with the film, but I enjoyed the story. I can't quite recommend this film because this subject matter is dealt with in much better films and other than some good performances and a solid story, Cherry just didn't feel revised enough.",Cherry
20,kuarinofu,Almost great,7,11 May 2021,"While Cherry is heavily underrated and deserves a higher rating, I still felt somewhat let down by the ending. I'd give it a 7.5 but IMDB won't let me.At first, it felt like a style over substance type film, mostly cause some scenes didn't contribute too much to the story and there is no overall theme, or maybe I've missed it. I did expect more voiceover reflection from the main character since this is his story, and while the beginning of the film had a lot of it, as the film progressed they brushed that away. I wanted him to reflect more on his life, especially at the end.Surprisingly enough, in such a dark story the humor worked every time, as well as all the bizarre casting choices and downright weird scenes.The film is well-directed and the acting is strong, it never feels boring besides some scenes I've mentioned earlier (when their purpose is unclear). It doesn't feel artsy or pretentious and I appreciate that.I strongly recommend Cherry even though the ending left me incomplete, and the lack of a realistic resolution (the type of ending they've chosen) left me more confused than actually immersed into the story.",Cherry
21,Movi3DO,A Roller Coaster,8,14 March 2021,"Russo Brothers trying out new stuff after the MCU. The story is about the life of Cherry: his love life, military life, post-military life, and his demise.The first part of the movie was the weakest. It was loaded with voice over, breaking the fourth wall, and other styles that was meant to engage the audience. Even though I didn't mind them really much, I agreed that these stylistic choices were just there for the sake of substances. They didn't do much to enhance the meaning or themes of the movie.However, the second and third arcs became significantly better. They showed Cherry's life in the military and his use of drugs. Even though the plot type was done countless times before, I thought the Russo's brothers' execution was great. The third arc had a big Requiem for a Dream vibe, and it was pretty hard for me to watch some of the scenes.Tom Holland was marvelous at his role and he sold his character very well. At around the second and third arcs, he became much more serious and this is where he shined the most.Even though the movie was almost 2.5 hours, I didn't feel it was too long and I was hooked into the story. However, I wouldn't watch the movie again because of the length.Overall, an entertaining yet bit rough to watch at times. Quite a roller coaster. 8.5/10",Cherry

23,Alexander_Blanchett,Good Tom Holland outing,8,12 March 2021,"Overall a decent film. An interesting follow up for the Russo Brothers after directing the most successful film of all times (Endgame) and finding new roads after their Marvel experiences. It is also an ideal film to showcase the great talent of Tom Holland who gives one of his best performances here.
You can criticize the film for being all over the place which is a bit distracting at times but I respect the ambition behind it. Showing the downfall of a promising young man who suffers from making wrong decisions. It kind of reminds me on a modern ""Trainspotting"" in a way, just even darker. As mentioned Tom Holland is fantastic and breaks out of his ""good boy"" stereotype easily. He really developed the character and wonderfully made it his own. Next to him the greatest revelation is Ciara Bravo. A very promising actress who will have a bright future if he keeps up the quality the showed here. Bravo was able to steal many of the scenes and showing us a charismatic performance of a woman on the edge of a breakdown. Great work. The rest of the cast is fine. I really loved the score, which is simple but fitting and adds a lot of the atmosphere. The cinematography is great. Not the biggest fan of the editing because it hurt some of the most emotional moments of the film. Its worth to see. Not the awards hit it was expected to be but still an interesting watch that shouldn't be missed. What it achieved was really making me care and putting me into an emotional rollercoaster.",Cherry
24,sweidman-28016,Stylistic Approach Like No Other,7,15 March 2021,"""Sometimes I feel like I've already seen everything that's going to happen. And it's a nightmare.""A young man drifts from college dropout to army medic in Iraq - anchored only by his true love, Emily. But after returning from the war with PTSD, his life spirals into drugs and crime as he struggles to find his place in the world. Cherry has been something many of us have been looking forward to - specifically to see Tom Holland's performance and the Russo Brothers ""unique"" approach as it has been a main source of advertisement. Some were able to see this early with screeners. That's when the concern came in. Many noted how messy it was and therefore hated the movie for what it had to offer. With the poor reception, my hopes started to die out. I watched it on Friday with its release on AppleTV and just finished watching it for a second time tonight to sort out my feelings. The deciding factor whether you like the movie or not boils down to the stylistic approach. For me, it worked. I think Cherry, though not amazing, is something special. It has some sort of hold on me that I can't quite explain. But that seems to be the case with some people. You either despise this movie or see that quality to it. I don't think anyone has thought it as a masterpiece, but there's a fine group of us who think this is a good movie.The movie is split into five parts with a prologue and epilogue. Many of the ads for this have described it as a ""modern day epic"" with the structure. I wouldn't go as far as to describe it like an epic, but rather experimental. Cherry is heavily experimental. Part of this is because of the cinematography. Newton Thomas Siegel shot this beautifully. Some of it is over the top (which is the point) but you cannot deny that this is a gorgeous looking movie. There's a blend of ""colorless"" (I put it in quotes because it's not exactly colorless), aspect ratio changes, and this strange feel to it that's disorienting and thrilling. It got a surprise nomination at from the ASC - a good predictor for the Oscars - so I wouldn't be surprised if it gets nominated for an Oscar tomorrow morning. Back to the experimental aspect, the first part uses most of this. It takes some getting used to, so if you can't get used to it quick enough it may ruin the experience. I can't say it always works. There's some breaking the fourth wall that's only used occasionally. I would've preferred if it were used consistently since there's much voice over, or just taken out as a whole. Another part has to do with the character Emily talking about her hometown. It goes into a shot with a background looking like it came out of a storybook. That just didn't fit. Sometimes it shows characters with what looks like a set which is cool, but again with the consistency. And finally, my last example goes to random characters out of the specific scene. To describe characters, there's a technique to show a brief few second clip of their life outside of a particular scene even if they aren't shown in the movie anymore. Only one of those worked for me. Some tried to be comedic and didn't fit the tone. Most of that happens within the first act so it's not too bothersome.Going onto the story, I think it's very interesting. Like I stated earlier, there are those five parts with a prologue and epilogue. A typical movie has three acts, and it does follow that. For me act one is the prologue, part one, and part two. Act two is part three and part four. Act three is part five and the epilogue. This will help with my explanation of things if you've seen it. I will be discussing main points in each act, but these aren't spoilers as they've been advertised to be this way. Act one is interesting but messy in the sense of finding it's footing. I didn't mind it as much as others because I was more focused on the story, but it did need a little tweaking. The second act is when it goes right into it. That act goes into the war sequences and takes a darker turn. What they did with those scenes is so effective and the best of the movie. When he returns home, the PTSD discussion begins and I like how it's portrayed here. It's unnerving to watch and builds character. The final act, where the drug addiction takes place, has its slow spots but still took my full attention. This act really hit me. I was reminded of Melancholia and Requiem for a Dream. It's hard to watch for all, but if you're good with how the movie has played out by now, it hits so hard. I got so emotional during the last 20 minutes. I cannot describe it but it felt like having a mental breakdown for me. To make sure this wasn't a one time thing, I watched it for a second time. And it still hit. I consider this a good thing. This ranks with the movies that I like but will have trouble watching in the future because of the emotional impact.The acting here is great. Ciara Bravo as Emily surprised me. I hadn't seen much from her before and I found her acting to be good. Tom Holland carries the whole thing. This is quite a performance. His character, who is referred to as Cherry, goes through so much and this must've been a hard role to portray. On social media and many interviews he's discussed how proud he is to have done this movie. He's always been in ensemble pieces but he proves he can lead a film. In a different year or universe where the movie got mainly positive reviews, no doubt would he get recognized for his acting. This is something to be proud of. Henry Jackson's score is so hypnotic and works perfectly in this case. I see the score as its own character here. There's something reassuring and scary while listening to it.I can't say that this will be for everyone. The Russo Brothers did something out of the ordinary here that will either click with you or just not work at all. I don't think Cherry deserves such negative reviews. Lots of them are just mixed and put down as negative, much like Malcolm & Marie. I've seen some people actually enjoying the movie and agreeing on much of what I've discussed here. If you can handle the style and dark story, this might just be for you. Cherry isn't perfect, but I will remember this as something that really impacted me.",Cherry
25,PedroPires90,Scorcese was right: a mess.,5,14 March 2021,"📽 What a mess. If this is Russo Brothers (Infinity War, Endgame, Winter Soldier, Civil War directors...) answer to Martin Scorcese, they just proved the old man is right: real cinema is not that easy to make.✅ Cinematography is good, in the city and war scenario.
✅ Tom Holland tries, not sure if it was always convincing, but tried very hard to show us all his range.
✅ Some very good scenes in every chapter.
✅ I was interested to know how it would end, so I guess that's good.❌ What it really wants to be? It's about PTSD? About drug addiction? About love? About mafia? About war? It tries to be so many things, that we don't feel the depth in any part. The script is bad, with childish dialogue.
❌ It tries to copy The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, and so many other films, and fails to deliver, being worse than any film it tries to copy.
❌ Over-stylized. It looks like a videoclip. I've never seen so many zoom shots and aerial shots in a movie before. Some other weird shots also.
❌ Feels overlong. Way overlong. Even if it's not that long.",Cherry

28,fciocca,"Wonderful cinematography and stylish photography, at times the plot is disjointed.",5,12 October 2021,"I have a lot of mixed feelings about this movie. I genuinely think that it had potential and he could do much better. The cinematography is amazing and very creative; there are some incredible shots. The film starts off with a dreamy mood, there is an excellent use of anamorphic lenses to represent romantic and intimate moments between Cherry and Emily. The second act depicts the raw reality of the war in Iraq, and it is filled with dramatic and explicit scenes that made me uneasy. The final part feels surreal, showing the total disconnection of the two main characters from reality. The editing style changes with the story and I think it was a wise decision.The plot is overall brilliant and deep, but at times boring and watered down. There are entire sections that could have been cut out, because they feel so disjointed. This film suffers from an identity crisis and cannot really decide what it wants to tell. At first it is a romantic teenage drama, then it becomes a movie about war and PTSD, and finally about a junkie robbing banks to get more dope. While the first two parts are well connected, the third and final act seems randomly placed. Screenwriters needed just to show how a young man that joined the army slowly descended into drug addiction because of the trauma experienced. It would have been more coherent.The movie is not scared to show where it stands and it is clear that it is profoundly against war and joining the army; it states this explicitly several times. As a person that is anti-war, and thinks that armed conflicts just harms people psychologically and physically, I agree with its perspective. With that being said, in my opinion this message would have been more effective if it was subtler, instead of being slapped right in your face. Do not treat your audience like silly kids that cannot understand implicit messages. ""Cherry"" is a movie full of flaws, but still enjoyable. The acting, especially by Ciara Bravo, is surprisingly good and the score is composed by a wide range of different genres that blend well with sequences. If you are interested to see what the Russo brothers are up to in recent times (besides the Avengers), this could be a nice pick.",Cherry
29,DeBBss,Improves With Each Act,7,5 April 2021,"Cherry was such a strange watch for me. For the most part, the film was a 5/10. I was generally uninterested for the most part; but then the third act happened. The film spent so much time developing the characters and relationships, and when everything came together, it was just great cinema. The pacing was iffy, it was rather quick in the war portion of the film, but then slowed a lot in the third act. I think that when the film was finally doing what it was supposed to do, it was at its best. And the amazing soundtrack gets played so much more at the end; seriously, the soundtrack carried a lot in this movie.The acting was flawless too. I never really took Tom Holland seriously as an actor until I saw Cherry. He's got tons of talent and I'm looking forward for what he's got next. The makeup was also very well done. When you pair great makeup and great acting, you get a level of realism that's just unnerving to watch. Tom Holland and Ciara Bravo genuinely look sickly, and it really shows you the horrors of addiction and PTSD.Overall, I think this is a film that you have to watch for yourself. Some might really hate it, others might really like it. It does get a little hard to watch at times, because of its 2hr20min runtime, but I think it was well worth it.",Cherry

Director: The Russo brothers (Anthony and Joe)
Starring: Tom Holland, Ciara Bravo, Jack Raynor, Forrest Goodluck etc
Overall rating 36/100Cherry is about a college dropout who becomes an army medic in Iraq, anchored only by his true love Emily (Ciara Bravo) but after returning home from the war he starts to suffer from extreme PTSD, his life spirals into drugs and crime as he struggles to find his place in the world. I was really looking forward to this movie but unfortunately it was an absolute, it had a few good moments mostly with the performances and visuals but for the most part I was extremely disappointed, so let's get started.Let's be nice and start with a few positives the cinematography and performances were great as well as the movie having some good character background. This movie had insanely creative cinematography which I absolutely loved, there was a lot of creativity and thought that went into so many shots it was often beautiful to look at, the movie was definitely visually very pleasing and they clearly spent a lot of time perfecting this. I also thought the performances here were fantastic and my favourite parts of the movie Both Ciara Bravo and Tom Holland took on a much more darker and mature role here and they were both absolutely fantastic, they did the best they could with the material they were doing and delivered powerful, authentic and emotional performances especially from Tom who deserves a lot of praise for how brilliant his performance was here. I also thought the movie did a decent job at giving Cherry some good character background, the movie set up his life before he met Emily well, establishing his character and the story world around him fairly well.However, lets now go into some negatives and unfortunately there is a lot. Firstly, the movie had a badly structured beginning with a lack of character background or set up of story world, a massive over usage of voiceover and odd character and creative decisions, as well as awkward and clunky dialogue. The movie opened very badly, having a poorly executed bank robbery scene with no background to Cherry's character or any form of setting of the story world was messy and just pure laziness, the audience will not care or empathise with a character if they know nothing about them. I also thought that the movie had some odd creative decisions and a complete over usage of voice over. The movie overelied on this creative technique and it caused way too much exposition, the movie relied way to heavily on it in order to advance the plot or develop the characters and it didn't work whatsoever and this needed to be shown within the actions of the characters or within the script, I also thought splitting the movie into different parts didn't work as well as perhaps the Russo brothers were hoping but I will develop that point more in future paragraphs. I also found the film had very odd character decisions, the movie had this attempted development to Cherry and Emily's relationship where they broke up so he applied for the army, but when they got back together he still went anyway, for me this didn't make sense and didn't really align with Cherry's character and how in love he was. I also thought the script and mostly the dialogue was absolutely terrible, it was clunky and felt robotic and every single interaction between the characters was just poor, the dialogue just felt so out of place and unrealistic, the script as a whole for me was very mediocre and messy and never truly went to the depths it could of done with some of its themes.My next few negatives would be the pacing issues, the lack of believable chemistry between the leads and the general lack of character depth, as well as a lot of tonally conflicting moments and offensively handling some deeper themes with certain characters. The movies pacing was all over the place, there was often either scenes that should have been exciting but really dragged or scenes that needed more time for the audience to digest that felt too rushed, this in part was due to the clunky script and odd narrative structure as well. I also thought that the characters of Cherry and Emily never really had a lot of chemistry, both Tom and Ciara tried there best but I never connected with or believed their love for each other and never connected with either of them and both characters just lacked any form of development or depth to their relationship, they just stayed in the same place and the conflict just felt forced, therefore I never truly cared about them as characters. I also found that the movie was very tonally conflicted, it at first felt like a romantic drama but then the war aspect and then the crime aspect of the movie happened, for me it never truly blended very well and it often felt like different movies. I also found that the movie often offensively handled its deeper themes especially with PTSD, the movie portrayed the character of cherry as very selfish when he was having it, refusing help and not letting go of Emily when he was very obviously a bad influence really didn't help the movie with trying to go for more depth with something as sensitive as PTSD, and then the movie was very hypocritical by making one of the army generals who suffered from PTSD the butt of multiple jokes which I found insensitive and in poor taste.My final couple of positives would be the great uncomfortable tone achieved and the emotional weight of the movie. The movie truly didn't hold back when it came to the effects of PTSD and drug addiction, it managed to achieve a very unsettling and uncomfortable tone with how normal it became for both the leads to take and the cinematography often representing the effects of the drugs was very effectively and uncomfortably done. The movie did also have a good amount of emotional weight, it did so some things right with the effects of trauma and PTSD with the character of Cherry especially when he went to war, the trauma of seeing your whole crew being killed in front of your eyes was horrifying and Tom Hollands powerful performance really helped the movie convey its emotions well for most of the movie.My next few negatives would be the bland and boring tone, the unlikeable characters and negative representation of the army, and also the lack of sympathy towards the characters. I just found the movie for the most part extremely boring, they somehow made bank robberies and being in the army seem incredibly bland. I also thought that the movie negatively depicted the army with making most of the characters unlikeable, the depiction of them just felt unrealistic and all the characters were complete idiots and it just painted the army in a very negative light. And I also lost complete sympathy for both main characters, after they stayed together despite obviously being bad for each other and never getting help I found it extremely difficult to care or sympathise with either character so therefore I just lost interest in the movie.My final few negatives would be the unrealistic bank robberies, repetitive plot points, and the unsatisfying and undeserved ending. I thought that every bank robbery scene was extremely unrealistic, the reactions of the characters felt very forced, and the lack of reaction just felt very fake to me and they never connected. I also thought that there was a lot of repetitive plot points, it felt like the movie was hitting the same story beats when it came to Cherry and Emily's relationship there was no development or change to their relationship and just when you thought they would let each other go they went for the same repetitive plot point of them staying together and doing similar things. And finally I thought that the ending was very unsatisfying and undeserved, I just didn't want both of the characters to be together, so when they reunited unfortunate the movie didn't get the reaction out of me that they were probably hoping for, and the way Cherry handed himself in felt very sudden and jarring for me and just ended the movie in a very mediocre way.Overall, Cherry does boast a fantastic and much darker performance from Tom Holland and Ciara Bravo, some creative cinematography and achieves a good amount of emotional weight. But structurally it's a complete mess, and completely misses the mark with its characters and themes. With a script that just didn't work at all it's a shame but I was massively let down.",Cherry

33,Brooklynsmagicmike,It has its flaws but overall its a good movie.,7,19 March 2021,"I almost skipped this one due to varying reviews. I've noticed most viewers either loved or hated it, not really anything in between. However for me while I diddn't think it was masterpiece. I still thought it was good movie.First off lets start off with the cons. I wasn't huge fan of some of visual aspects in the movie. From section interludes, to red screens, and even the screen narrowing in it became awfully frustrating at times to watch. The audio wasn't that much better either and at times I had put volume drastically up just to hear what was being said. The movie also suffered from what in my opinion was inconsitent pacing. While it is long movie at 2hrs+ sometimes it felt even longer. With scenes that added virtually no value to anything bogging down the film.With that said though there were alot things this movie did well in. The acting mainly from all parties for me was great and I enjoyed the performances. The story was definitely engaging and kept me wanting to find out what was going to happen to the main character. I also felt like the movie painted light on various serious topics from drug usage, crime, and post-military life. Which while this in recent years has been done in quite few movies. It never gets old in my opinion and thought they did good job with the dramatization.Overall I think this is good watch and would recommend it. However this most definitely isn't movie for teens even though Tom Holland is in it. I would recommend for strictly adult viewing only.",Cherry

35,TheCorniestLemur,And then I said...,5,1 October 2021,"Is Tom Holland trying to be typecast as ""tortured guy who turns to violence to make his world feel right"" or something? I mean, if it weren't for the different time periods these films take place in, this could fairly easily be a sequel to The Devil All The Time, only directed by people who were trying waaaaaay too hard to be artsy without much purpose behind it.But we'll get to that soon, and I don't want to disparage Tom Holland in this film at all. Quite the opposite, he's by far the best thing about this film, and if he impressed me in The Devil All The Time, here he's bloody mesmerising. And he has to do quite a lot to be convincing in this: he has to be convincingly in love, terrified, suffering from trauma, a heroin addict, a soldier, and more, and he pulls it all off beautifully.Unfortunately, he can only carry it so far, because the rest of this film consists of a really humdrum narrative we've all seen before god knows how many times, and the directing, to me at least, positively reeks of the Russos being very aware of how boring the script was, and deciding to try so desperately to fix this with their direction that it came out straight on the other side of the spectrum and ends up feeling pretentious.However, this is still a really well shot film, and it's not even that the shots they came up with aren't potentially interesting - it's just that in this particular film, they often feel quite out of place and awkward. And I describe it as pretentious because for every interesting shot that works, there are three more that seem to have no purpose whatsoever, like the black and white in an early scene, the text that appears on screen in the boot camp sequence, the aspect ratio changing for that whole chunk of the film, etc.And this isn't limited to the cinematography either, the banks seen in this film all seem to have names that I can't say here or IMDB won't accept this review, but you'll know them when you see them, and I'll be damned if I have any clue why.The soundtrack also gives off a similar vibe to me - a lot of classical music set to scenes in slow motion, you probably know the type I mean.And sweet Jesus the narration in this film - there's a lot of it, and therefore there's a lot of useless fluff to wade through if you're watching this. I'm talking about fluff like Tom Holland's voiceover saying rubbish like ""this character said..."" and then that character says their line. As well as him just describing multiple things you can clearly see happening on screen that don't need explaining at all.If I'm honest, I'm kind of surprised that at no point did I notice (it could have happened though) any symbolism which the meaning of is, and will only ever, be obvious to the Russos, because for as well as they've proven they can direct giant Marvel movies, I don't really feel like simpler, more character-driven dramas are quite their thing.But I could have dealt with all of this try-hard directing quite easily if the story wasn't so much of a bread sandwich as it is, but unfortunately it is, so while I'd recommend it for Tom Holland's performance alone, don't expect to be really wowed by much more than that.Unless that shot inside his bum was legit, because goddamn that thing is clean.",Cherry

39,Golden_Hope,Trying Too Hard to Be Smart,5,14 March 2021,"Wow.I don't know where to start with this movie really. It was everything and the kitchen sink.I will start by saying that the actors did a fantastic job. They were all believable and really sold these characters. I think without them this movie would honestly be unwatchable, they really deserve credit.The rest of it is something else.The best way I can sum up the direction is, you know that person that thinks they are smarter than everyone in the room and they keep trying to convince you that they are the smartest. This movie is that person.The directing doesn't let you just sit and watch the movie. It is constantly shouting in your face being like ""look over here isn't this the best thing that you have ever seen?"" And it just isn't. Breaking the forth wall isn't something new. Using different lighting to spot light something isn't groundbreaking but this movie wants you to think that it is. It is honestly so distracting and takes away from the story.This also goes for the score. It was so annoying and out of place and once again it was screaming in your face.The pacing and runtime were also an issue. 2 hours 30 is a long runtime for any movie but I don't think this story had enough to support that. It had drawn our scenes and lingering shots that just bogged it down. I also think that half of this movie is shot in slow motion. It was just constantly happening for no reason other than to show off.The other biggest disaster of this movie is the narration. It's is literally like they had Tom Holland read action lines from the script. It was just like ""I'm in a bar and the bar is red and there are people here, it's 3 o'clock but soon it will be 4 and then I will go home but first I poured a drink and then I drank it"". Why include that, it is utterly pointless. It isn't a radio programme, we have eyes. Just show us what is happening we will understand it.And I think that once again comes back to this movie thinking it is insanely clever. It thinks the audience are idiots so they need spoon feeding ever piece of information.In someways I appreciate that they took swing and tried a different approach, I think they just needed to give the audience more credit. It is a well made film it just is so over produce and over directed to the point were it. Ruins the whole thing.",Cherry

It's trying very hard to be something it's not, and if they just changed the way this movie was directed, I think this could've been up there as being one of the best movies of the year. I'm heavily disappointed with The Russo Brothers on this one, I was excited for it as I love the Marvel movies they've made, but this just isn't it. I guess on the flip side of things, both Tom Holland and Ciara Bravo are great in this, and you can tell, at least on Holland's end, that they're giving it their all.

I'm not really into superhero films etc so this is the first time I've seen him in something and I'm very impressed.The second half of the film turns on its head. Very powerful. Heartbreaking when Jimenez dies. 'Suddenly there was nothing interesting about it anymore' The way it shows how addictive and life ruining heroin is alongside a soldier struggling with ptsd is outstanding.I thought it was all over for him when he robbed the bank, and took his last hit and waited for the police to get him but it was a great positive twist at the end when he serves his time and Emily is waiting for him, both sober.Great to see Pooch hall (Daryl from Ray Donovan) even if only for a cameo.Don't think I'll see a better film this year.",Cherry
45,joker-4,"The ""True Romance"" of the 2020s",9,15 March 2021,"Cherry stars the jubilant Tom Holland as a PTSD-ladened vet who becomes a bank robber to support his junkie lifestyle. And dig this, True Believers. Cherry is not a career reset, nor is it a cinematic gilding of the ""true artiste."" Nope. This is What Comes Next in the lives of professional filmmakers and actors, and wow is it good.The Russos have come a long way in a relatively short time. From their Woody Allen-esque debut, Welcome to Collinwood (2002), through the aforementioned ranks of Marvel Studios, the Russos expanded their craft into a thing of beauty. Cherry looks slick, and the tricks employed serve the story at hand. The slow-mos; the split screen work; quick flashbacks; breaking of the fourth wall. The Russos blend Woody Allen's neurosis with Spike Lee's street sense and Quentin Tarrantino's style into a movie that will no doubt be looked upon as the True Romance for the 2020s.Cherry is ironically beautiful with its aerial drone shots and sweeping color. Even the iron fire escapes in back alleys look inviting. Of course, this is all a lure. The Russos want Cherry's lifestyle to be accepted. They highlight the normality of life as it hides the obvious pain within.Cherry has all the makings of a must-see classic, particularly for young men attempting to find balance in life. Cherry's dialogue is a breath-taking modernization of Holden Caulfield. His strut is Clarence Worley. Life's indecision wears down in a Dante Hicks fashion. The sickness imprisons him like Renton. Through all this sadness, the movie teases at hope. Like the sun filtering through the leaves.The Russos have created an epic tale with all its indulgences: lost love, battles in far away lands, and the uncertainty of homelife. As with all epics, this one might be too long, too cautionary, yet is a worthy tale to be told with lessons in strength and humility. That hope does exist.

I thought the cinematography was beautiful and helped portray the story in such a unique way. I especially loved how the movie was slowing down in the 3rd act. Not going to tell you how, but it almost feels that way, as if to prepare you to get off the very intense ride. The Russo brothers manage to direct some of the most graphic depictions of drug abuse, war and PTSD without romanticising or overdoing it. The film is both a dramatic yet tragically mundane story that all who can stomach it should most certainly watch!",Cherry
49,stephenstephenbyrne,Holland absolutely carries this,6,29 April 2021,"Lol at trying to make Tom Holland look like a man in his 30's by giving him a moustache. It's the equivalent of 3 kids in a trench coat trying to sneak into a cinema, it ain't fooling nobody.Jokes aside though, Holland is a very likeable actor and without him this movie would be a much tougher watch. In fact, he's the best thing about all of these so-so movies he's been in lately (chaos walking, devil all the time). Please, can we get this man a better agent.",Cherry

52,RJBrez,Not for everyone.,9,15 March 2021,"Some movies can only reach or touch a particular kind of audience. I never robbed banks. But I was an addict. I could identify with the hopelessness these characters were facing. The awful behavior and the treatment of those who love you the most still haunt me to this day and always will. I was also never in the military, but I was in law enforcement for 7+ years. Some of what I dealt with, had to do, etc also still haunts me to this day.I say all this to tell you that Cherry will be misunderstood by most, but it's realistic. It's heartbreakingly true. If you didn't like it, I hope it's because you are lucky enough to have never hurt like these characters did.Tom Holland, Ciara Bravo, and the rest of this cast portrayed this pain in amazing fashion. I'm blown away by their performances.",Cherry

54,Waedliman,Worth seeing with some flaws,7,31 August 2021,"Most of the time, films that last over 2 hours are too long for me and not worth the time they take. This was not the case with Cherry, I wasn't bored for a second, but I think that was mainly due to Tom Holland, who got everything out of this difficult role that the script was able to deliver. Sometimes I would have liked more depth, but I definitely don't hold that against him. ""Cherry"" is a film you can get into unconditionally, but it doesn't make it easy for the viewer to identify with any of the characters. Cherry (Holland) himself is an actually likeable young man who, however, doesn't know what his life might have to offer him. The decisive tragic point is the encounter with Emily, a young woman who buries her feelings and initially pushes Cherry away, leading him to make a momentous mistake that will determine the rest of his life. It would now be easy to blame this Emily for Cherry's failure, but she is ultimately the second main character of this film and remains strangely soulless. A good director should have made an impact here, what remains is a character I couldn't stand throughout the film and who doesn't really offer any motives for why Cherry doesn't break away from her. But maybe that is also due to Ciara Bravo's somewhat one-dimensional play. That the film is very well filmed has already been mentioned enough, so I would like to say something about the music, which I sometimes found illogical. Cherry uses two excerpts from operas, one from Verdi's Masked Ball and the other from Puccini's Tosca. Especially Tosca's aria, edited for the film, makes little sense to me here, except that it's about mood, because she sings about living only for art and love. Well, we see that Cherry doesn't care for art and that he doesn't really know anything about love, either, because otherwise he wouldn't end up in the drug swamp with Emily and go off the rails. And what the Verdi quote is doing here is also a mystery to me (the opera is about conspiracy and the prophecy of death by a witch). But maybe I'll get the right idea one day. Conclusion for me: A film worth seeing with small weaknesses that don't make it a contender for major prizes, but it is definitely worth seeing. By the way, I find the ratings in some countries questionable.",Cherry
55,pronitmallick,Only the actor's performance,5,16 March 2021,"Cherry is a movie that starts and ends like a documentary of life through struggle. Right in the first few minutes cherry dumps a lot of elements that tries to make us connect with the movie but fails dramatically. Tom Holland as well as Ciara Bravo's performance worked like an oxygen mask for the whole film. The story of the movie had a preloaded punch to knock us in the face but couldn't get it through totally because the direction, screenplay and specially editing didn't quite work in harmony. The Russo brothers could have pulled a really good movie with all the elements they have but that didn't quite turn out right. In the end there are some scenes where you try to connect with the film but can't get through cause overall it's a movie that straight outta falls into the one time watch club and not only that but it falls into that club of movies which you will not recommend anyone to watch.",Cherry
56,PerryAtTheMovies,Tom Holland's masterful performance makes this a must-watch....,7,13 March 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
I'm not entirely sure where to start, but one thing for certain is that this movie is one of the best you'll see this year. Tom Holland gives a masterful performance in a role you would not expect him to be good at. He even questioned if he was right for it because the lifestyle of the character he portrays is something he's never had to deal with. Ever!I loved the story and felt that it was nearly perfect. As this movie has some basis to true events. It does tell like a book and it defines each chapter as it wants to be. We start with a fresh faced kid trying to find his place, to an Army medic saving lives, and eventually a veteran who has seen some stuff and his demons haunt him harder than he could've imagined. Therefore, it doesn't develop into a jumbled mess as I would've imagined.From the outset of the movie I felt like it was poetry in motion. Everything felt fluid until the end of the film started to set in. This is perhaps my one big negative to the film. The run time is nearly two and a half hours, and I don't mind long films, but with this one it started to slag a bit before everything was said and done.While Tom Holland may not have felt like he was the right man for the job. He still gives it his all and gives a masterful performance. Never did it feel like Spider-Man fell off the wagon and started doing drugs. No, this was definitely Tom Holland playing Cherry every step of the way. Though I didn't find anything special about her performance, Ciara Bravo, does complete the puzzle piece in the film. The chemistry between Tom and Ciara is fluid and doesn't feel forced as they both journey the rabbit hole together.Ultimately, it does suck watching this guy have some much potential only for life events to tear him, and everything around him, down. The heartstrings are tugged at on occasion throughout the film giving this movie it's wholesome worth-while watch.Overall:
A movie I would definitely watch again and will most likely buy on home release. Tom Holland gives a masterful performance. If not for the commitment he brings to the table this movie could've fallen flat on its face. The story is poetry in motion and breathes as a beautiful book. A little too long by the time two hours shows up, but still an excellent movie.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'Yes'.Enjoy the show!",Cherry
57,andreascaloni,INTERESTING MOVIE WITH STORNG PERFORMANCES,7,14 March 2021,"Cherry is a fairly standard drama that hits the expected beats, but is well directed and boasts of Tom Holland and Ciara Bravo's strong performances.

I even stopped watching it, and resumed it only a few days later. But even then, my opinion hasn't changed.The latter part of movie became more intense as it went on.VERDICT: Not recommended if you like action movies.

Holland's come a long way",9,30 May 2021,"Cherry (2021), Tom Holland, and the Russo Brothers from a Marvel experience, coming into a movie based on the war on drugs, is a smart move throwing into Holland's acting career. Holland kills it in this fast-paced drama picture, and his role so far away from Peter Parker and his other non-fiction roles, this one is the most unique. BAFTA and Oscar, I think that's a bold move don't you agree? The way the story connects in six different settings; from college student, to war veteran, to drug dealer, to bank robber, the storytelling was genius. The Russo brothers are on the road to even more ambiguous success level, and I cannot wait for their next movie, whether fiction or non-fiction, it'll be a great ride, even if Holland is involved again.The story is very deep, and disturbing. It's impactful and very hard to watch at times, when the screen fades to red, it's mesmerising and gives the audience chills and thrills, to be in Holland's shoes and to let the audience understand what type of movie it wants it to be, it's great.Great movie, great acting, great directing. 9/10.

Why do movies these days have to be long drawn out slogs that end without any real feeling of a conclusion? We watch movies to feel something, but I don't watch movies to feel like crap for 2 hours and then just shrug in disbelief when the story just ends with nothing really to write home about.

The movie starts of a bit shaky. I had a hard time getting into the story and there were some weird conversation and decisions being made. The entire first act felt a bit off for me. They went to far with the technical aspect in my opinion. I think the directors made some poor decisions that did not work. For example, in the first act there are some fourth wall breaks from are leading character, but that aspect gets completely abandoned after that. They were not bad, but really random if there are not going to be in the rest of the story. But one's Cherry starts to leave his happy life and get into darker places, that's where the movie really shines for me. There are some scenes that left real and got really under my skin. After his life is completely changed, that's where the power of the movie lies. Especially in the final chapter where we see some incredibly good scenes, it just took a long time to get there. I think the directors were trying out some new stuff in the first couple chapters, but ones they really start to let the movie tell its story, that's where it starts to shine.

PTSD takes over, ruining his relationship with his wife. Doctors prescribe oxy, furthering his decline as a human being, now an addict.

His performance is outstanding. He really draws you into the character. However, the downside is that there is no plot with this story. Its just a sequence of events. In the first hour hes in college and meets his girlfriend, they break up, leading him to enlist in the army. They get back together but he still has to go. He comes back with ptsd and is prescribed addictive medication. His wife and him become junkies. And that was just the first hour.In the second, hes a junkie who robs banks because he needs the money. In the last 10 minutes he goes to prison and changes.There are a lot of things that didnt make sense and i dont think thats something to blame the Russo brothers for. His name is never said. The places like banks had weird names. The Russo brothers dont have a specific type of style to be critiqued on so that is not a factor to fit in. I think the film was shot beautifully, they just dragged the second hour and 20 minutes too long. We didnt need an hour of then shooting heroin.To be honest, it felt a lot like the Basketball Diaries, except Cherry never felt like it had a message it was trying to convey. And that just might be it, but if the movie is going to be 2 hours and 2 minutes long then it deserves a point.",Cherry

At times it had imperfections, but overall it was a memorable film with excellent performances.Some additional editing could have fixed the flaws. Too much time was spent on several unimportant scenes and not enough on other significant scenes that would have further driven the narrative. Individually both lead actors were great, but I didn't feel that their chemistry was a perfect fit.All in all, this will surely elevate Tom Holland and showcased his versatility. I felt that the film and story were familiar but done in a way that was fresh. When it ended, I was torn if it was a great film or a slight let down.

Honesty, it was very depressing, and this is som ething you don't want to watch if you're already feeling sad. I'm not sure why films like this keep getting made, if just to intentionally allow in misery. The film is based upon a book apparently, but i'm not sure it's a story that needed to be translated to film. There's the romance of youth, then a fatal decision that drives the rest of the film down a road of drugs and self-destruction. Can the ending be considered redemptive at all? I'm not so sure. If the film says anything, it is that war is hell.",Cherry
99,russelldresearch,"This movie has a cherry on top, but not enough underneath",6,14 March 2021,"The acting in Cherry is generally average to quite good, with only the titular Tom Holland excelling. Having said that, he does fail to pull off the appropriate intensity of emotion in a few places, like when his army pals get blown up in a car - the stress shows but not the shock. The story mostly manages to hold your interest, but it wasn't original enough to be gripping because too many similar movies already exist - and I don't just mean messed-up people getting more messed up with drugs. For instance, the army part reminded me too much of Full Metal Jacket and all the derivative movies which followed it.The drug scenes are generally authentic (kudos to the specialist adviser), though it's unlikely that anyone would try to rob a bank while in the puking stage of opiate withdrawals - when you can hardly stand up or see. Cherry would have needed a hit (or at least some methadone) to even think about getting the job done, because the awful, disabling withdrawal symptoms would have overcome the feeling of desperation by this point. Another drugs glitch is when Emily ODs on heroin, and the hospital doctor checking her vitals says she has a racing heartbeat - when opiate poisoning almost always leads to the heart slowing right down (death occurs when it reaches a stop). Last, most heroin users would try detox or rehab before they became desperate enough to get themselves sent to prison in order to escape the Groundhog Day of an opiate habit. It would have been more credible if the police had simply caught him after a car chase. I prefer realism to fantasy.The cinematography is classy - probably the best aspect of this movie. It's main fails are that it's too long and too sentimental. The excessive duration arises from poor editing, too much slow motion, and a hefty wedge of narrative padding (notably the endless bank robberies). And while the Russos were clearly trying to achieve a deep emotional tone in the movie, it often came over as emotion-jerking and romantically cliched (notably the final scene). The over-done musical score plays a large part in this.This movie was OK but unoriginal and flawed, and I wouldn't give it two hours and 20 minutes again.",Cherry

101,kevinleenorwood,Tom Holland Is Headed For Big Things!!,8,24 March 2021,"The movie was pretty good overall. What I can not get over is the performance from Tom Holland. After watching him play Spider-Man, I figure he set his type-casting standard but WOW. The dude has range. His acting in this movie was over the top. He has proven himself to shoot across the range and mark my words, within the next few years he will be the #1 actor in the movies.Congrats Tom!!",Cherry
102,alex_m-05629,Absolutely meaningless and at the same time terrible movie,1,12 March 2021,"Absolutely meaningless film for a young man who is so bored that he is even confused. Then the film takes us back to the early 19th century. The same young man decided to join the army because his girlfriend had reflected him. Of course, this happened in the 19th century, but not in the 21st century. Haha!
We understand from the young man's story that there are complete idiots in the army. Only he knows how stupid everything is. A little later he returned to his wife or girlfriend, for which he joined the army, but he already has PTSD. So he began to cram in drugs that didn't help him, and even his wife became addicted to drugs. In fact, the film is so fake that it's even funny. Tom Holland is not for this role at all. It's like watching a child with PTSD. And he and Ciara Bravo, who plays his wife, are just incredibly pathetic. It's like watching two kids play with a family. One sentence from the film describes it all when the narrator, who is also the main antagonist, says, ""That's how we became drug addicts.""
The Russo brothers' script is under criticism. It seems that the two brothers directors and Tom Holland can only make ""good"" films under the Disney / Marvel hat. In which there is nothing unexpected. The same goes for many other directors and actors who, if they make a film that is beyond the shadow of the Mouse, then their true ""qualities"" are immediately apparent.Overall, this is a terrible movie. It is no coincidence that his ratings continue to fall in Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. Only on this site do Tom Holland fans give 10s to rate the film just because they are Tom Holland fans. Haha!
The script is too implausible as far as the two alleged protagonists become drug addicts. And then the film shows us a toxic love that doesn't have to exist for both characters to survive. The last scene before the last chapter ""The Epilogue"" is the most telling of how strange this film is, and how awful its message is. The protagonist, who is definitely an antagonist, takes another dose before the police arrest him because he loves drugs too much ?! Terrible movie, horrible script!Some people even compare the film to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet ?! But Romeo and Juliet were not drug addicts who loved drugs more than they loved themselves. So the comparison is more than funny.
If you want to watch a good drug movie better watch Trainspotting (1996)! Cherry(2021) is just ridiculous, even pathetic in quality. There is nothing memorable in it.",Cherry
103,logancrane-71337,Great Acting,8,15 March 2021,"Tom Holland's performance in this movie is amazing, he can really pull off having PTSD, the deaths were very sad, and you could really tell how much pain he was in just by looking at his face.

110,samslaydon,An Emotional Journey,9,17 May 2021,"Holland really stood out here. If your kids are fans of Spiderman, this isn't even close to that, so I wouldn't recommend it for family movie night because it's gritty. I mean Holland is great as Spiderman, but thank goodness he's been willing and successful really to branch out and not be pigeonholed into the Marvel stereotype. I'd rather see movies like this than the super hero played out genre anyway. This movie is a great character-following story much to me like ""Goodfellas"" where we're along for the ride, which includes all of the good and bad that the character endures, even though a lot of it is due to the character's own fault and disastrous decisions. But we still sympathize with them because the actor can successfully reveal the flaws within humanity that we all have through the character. I imagine this reverberated with Iraq war vets and although I did not go to Iraq, I did serve in the military and a lot of the inferences were spot on. I'd even say that the war portrayal was better than ""Hurt Locker"" (gasp!), which I have always thought was ridiculous and overblown and never understood why it garnered so much fanfare. The cinematography and subtle scene inferences in Cherry as the characters endure Iraq were awesome. The story flows very well, is quite funny at times, and I wasn't sure how it was going to end, but I thought it overall very satisfying.",Cherry

The Russo brothers finally show something else besides the marvel movies and it is great. they have the hability the turn a heavy scene into to a comic relif in a matter of seconds.

Sure, it's a book adaptation which already sounds like a red flag because many of them aren't as good as the source material, however Cherry can be called an exception to an extent. The film definitely boasts a beautiful style in camera work and craft because of how smart these techniques are used. The Russos definitely make their mark and do it ever so boldly. The real issue with Cherry however is the way it explains itself. The pacing and tonality tends to be misguided by an almost TOO formulaic approach, however doesn't make for a bad viewing experience either thanks to Holland's gut-wrenching performance as Nico Walker. Holland loses himself in the role so masterfully, I nearly forgot that this was the same actor that helmed the Spider-Man throne. I'd never felt more sorrow for a character since John Coffey in The Green Mile. Ciara Bravo also steals the spotlight constantly with her transitional performance that quite honestly surprised me. Onscreen together, both Holland and Bravo, is nothing short of perfect chemistry. Even if the writing gets cheesy sometimes, it's a relieving cheesy rather than a revolting type. This film did away with itself and it shows.Verdict: Cherry is a solid attempt at something different for the Russos and a great excuse to give Holland and Bravo a good taste of grueling acting. The film may not have been what we wanted it to be, but I feel that it still has something good, if not special, to offer.",Cherry

It gets you soaked it so much, despite knowing the movie could go either of two directions, you still want to watch it get to that destination. Probably because you want to see the performance that will lead there. However, it's not as predictable as you may think along the way.

122,wafflepenguin,Mixed Bag,7,12 March 2021,"Overall Cherry isn't a bad movie but it's definitely not perfect. Tom Holland gives a phenomenal performance along with the rest of the main cast. The cinematography and sound design work effectively while Anthony and Joe Russo for the most part do a great job directing however it can come off as overly stylish at times. To give an example would be the use of bold red text that flashes over the screen occasionally as characters say certain phrases for about 10 minutes of the film. This never comes back into use however. The movie also tries to balance a lot of themes and ideas which creates an uneven feeling in the plot. The character arc at the end of the film for Holland's character also feels fairly rushed as if there could have been more to the story. Despite its flaws, the film is pretty solid and still worth checking out if you're wanting to see it.",Cherry
123,katish7,"Very ""collage""-ey",6,9 August 2021,"I love Russo brothers for everything they did for and with Community. They have amazing pacing and timing for comedies, which is even harder to get right than pacing for action movies....but it seems that their talent for faster pacing has a ""lighter"" effect on dramas. Like I did catch myself on a lot of chuckles in the beginning of the movie (especially on the drills, it feels like actors can barely hold their laughter), perhaps it was intentional. I also can see how Trainspotting and other ""junkie"" movies from the 90-00s are homaged here, but... it's just something is off, the movie, stylish as it was didn't touch my soul. Also the message is kind of muddy. I wonder if that's from the book or they just didn't get it right.",Cherry

I first heard about this movie when my boyfriend had to remove some wires that were in the way for a scene they were filming back in early December of 2019. As Tom Holland fans, we were eagerly anticipating the release of this film. It's gritty, hard to watch at times, and highly emotional. The acting by Tom Holland and the rest of the cast was very well done.
I've read reviews with titles saying if you're a veteran you're going to be angry. But again, this is based on a real life account of an Iraq veteran dealing with his PTSD after coming home to Cleveland.
As a Clevelander, it was also interesting trying to recognize where some scenes were shot. The Russo brothers love their home town and we are grated they filmed it here, not elsewhere.

Tom Holland is a very talented young actor and it's good to see him move on to some challenging dramatic roles like this and ""The Devil All the Time.""

There are some stylistic elements that I do believe the directors didn't quite nail as hard as they thought they were going to... If you don't pay attention to them all the way, they are easy to miss and can come off as awkward or out of place. However, the true story, script, excellent acting, crisp sound, beautiful/yet terrifying locations, all make up for the artistic direction trying just a tad too hard. it's definitely sad people porn, but it ends well and it's certainly a heart wrenching story that's entertaining and worth its time.",Cherry
138,joshuarenealvarez,Cherry (2021),6,29 March 2021,"Cherry is a crime-drama film which is based
on the auto-fictional novel of the same name written by Nico Walker. Produced and directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo whom are best known for their involvement in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The storyline focuses on
a college dropout turned army veteran who is still unsure about his purpose in the world.Tom Holland completely shines in his role
as the cynical and morally-conflicted, Cherry. Rather than spectacle from the superhero genre this time around, we witness the grim reality of exposure to war and how it can
lead a human being on a downward sprawl
towards drug addiction to utilize as a coping mechanism. His only solace amidst the
confusion lies in his relationship with Emily (portrayed by Ciara Bravo) who delivers
a noteworthy supporting performance
as the love of his life. I am sure that the narrative can be relatable to ex-military officers who suffer from post-traumatic
stress disorder. And it was refreshing to see Holland in a different light then what we are normally used to. I am looking forward to more portrayals where he can showcase his
acting range. But the issues that I have
with this motion picture are rooted in the lack of connection to the characters and the
script which falters in the second act mostly due it's overlong runtime. It would not have
felt as tedious if certain scenes were
removed in the editing room.Once the film reaches it's climax, the viewer starts questioning what the whole significance of the experience was as it's never fully conveyed to the audience. This leads me to believe that this is a feature that should be taken at face value for the majority of the duration as there are minimal to none hidden meanings other than awareness for the opioid crisis amongst veterans. I liked Cherry for what is was because there were moments that stood out but it honestly could have been better.Follow me on Instagram: @joshuarenealvarez

This is in every sense an epic, the sheer scale of the film left me awe, the fortunes surely spent in some cases must have been enormous for mere seconds of final film, but epic film making does noth make an epic, so we turn to the cast; excellently acted, throughout, brilliant.
soundtrack; I want the OST so big tick there too
Direction; easy to follow, maybe a little long ok then.
So why haven't I given this top marks then, well I don't really subscribe to the whole concept of films must have meaning.

Thanks Russo Brothers,9,5 May 2021,"As Danielle Bisutti said in a god of war making of interview "" Art reflect life reflect art the real life and that's what we have it, so we don't feel so alone..."" In these hard times of lockdown. I replaced the war with the coronavirus and the drug addiction by social media addiction... there you have my interpretation. It's personal. This is the deep layer of the movie i choose to feel but without that it's an excellent movie, it's go from teen to war to a crime dramatic movie in one. The editing the music is nearly perfect. Tom holland exploding the screen also the other characters. Very visual and music top notch.I'm a video editor but i want to actually live my life instead of working to make storytelling for other so i'm processing to make a carrer shift. This movie help me in that important process and cope with extreme loliness due to lockdown mesure still in 2021.Keep faith, quit your own prison and live your life.",Cherry
159,redbulltp,Right idea and potential. Lacking something...,6,27 March 2021,"It was a decently lenghthed movie. They tried to develop the characters closer but something still felt shallow and rushed. Half the acting was great, half was superficial. (That stereotype hollywood feeling) It was 2002 - 2007 mainly and you could feel that millennial style kind of acting which was out of place.I loved the audience being addressed directly and the funny props and names around at times. It started out also quite humorous too. No complaints with the photography/film shots.I like Tom but something didn't suit him, casted girlfriend didn't match as well as I think it could have. Would have liked more depth on the war pieces and a different take on the drug chapters. On various parts I found it to be unrealistic also.

163,matthew_hoh,"Captures the anger, despondency and addiction post-war",8,16 March 2021,"A very well done film, with terrific acting, sly humor and excellent production. However, the triumph of this film lies in its capture of the PTSD and moral injury suffered by so many veterans of these f'd up wars.As a combat veteran myself, I found Cherry clearly and capably depicted the anger, the misery, the hopelessness and the addiction that so many of us have suffered through because of these wars. I am recommending this film to family and friends so they may better understand.18 years since the Iraq War began, a whole generation of men and women, and their families, friends and communities, devasted by that war based on a lie. That our nation produces so little art, and even less conversation, about the consequences and costs of these wars helps to explain why such wars happen and continue to happen.The only shortcoming of this film is it does not adequately address the crimes done to the Iraqi people.",Cherry
164,bookwormeoghan,OMG this movie is so good,10,16 March 2021,"I just watched it, and it was absolutely amazing. The whole movie was a rollercoaster, and I was not expecting some things in this movie. For example, when Emily ended up being a dope fiend caught me off guard. It was so crushing all the way through, and it never ceased to grab all of my attention. NEVER. This is probably the movie that grabbed my heartstrings and pulled them out of my chest the most. Watch this movie now.",Cherry
165,josseanrivera,The movie that gave me a panic attack,4,19 April 2021,"Cherry is a very well done cinematic film: Tom Holland's acting is unbelievable and the general production is very good. The production is so good that I could not finish it in one set since I started feeling like I was having a small panic attack as I saw Cherry go through so much agony. And I even feel that agony might be an understatement for the protagonist's journey. In part, I feel it's my fault because every time I watch a movie or show, I give my undivided attention to everything that I see, hear, and read. It is almost like I amplify what I am supposed to feel whenever I watch a story. Considering that I didn't read any review or search too much about what the movie is about to not poison my opinion, I was definitely not prepared for what was coming.The problem is that the story is incredibly fast-paced and very intense in my opinion. You receive so much information in just one minute, enough to feel that you are running through chapters of a book that describes hell. Minute after minute, I kept feeling more and more uncomfortable. Almost like the space that I was sitting on was getting smaller and smaller and after around a hundred of those tedious minutes, I had to get out. I endured a relatively long period of misery because I was hoping to catch a glimpse of satisfaction from this story as it progressed. And the more that I kept hopelessly waiting for that satisfaction, the more that I forced myself to continue because it would be like I had done much work for nothing. After finally being in a better mental place, I was able to finish the last 45 minutes and began to ask myself the big questions.What is my purpose for watching this? It's certainly not entertainment as you could infer from my experience. Is it to raise awareness about what veterans go through? Maybe, but I don't feel Cherry focuses too much on this and there are probably better ways to understand veterans than through this fictional story. The more I kept watching, the more I asked: Why am I watching this?! The synopsis describes a young man that after returning from war, falls ""into drugs and crime as he struggles to find his place in the world"". This is what was stuck in my mind throughout the movie: ""finding a place in the world"", as I can easily relate to that. I hoped to see Cherry fight many obstacles before he was able to find his place, his purpose, yet this never came. His existence and life just gets worst every time you believe it can't, to the point that you are convinced that the movie has nothing else to offer. It's not that I tragic story is a bad story to watch; many of the great tragic stories offer a feeling of hope at the end, or a sense of reflection, or bring awareness, which makes them incredible. Cherry doesn't deliver any of these.This is a deranged, unpleasant story that somehow I am supposed to find joy in. Clearly, I didn't.",Cherry
166,zoaeroark,A masterpiece...,9,23 March 2021,"Started off a little slow, then picked up pace and turned into an emotional, absolutely riveting work of art. Each new part builds on the previous while still telling a new story at the same time. Tom and Ciara's acting is superb.

167,LilbigMedium14,Style over substance,3,11 August 2021,While most of the actors are doing a great job with material they are given it can't distract you from the messy execution of the script. The Russo brothers have definetly done a good job in the visuals departement but there is no substance to it exept for it looking nice. The stylistic choices in this movie like the aspect ratio change in the middle of the film among other are completly superfluous. There are many other movies that convay the massages of this movie in a much more compelling way and sadly they don't do much to stand out from the sea of extremly similar films. Tom Holland's preformance can't save this movie from it's own script.,Cherry
168,yoo-64130,Underwhelming,6,23 March 2021,"Looking at the trailer this movie sounded pretty sick, well I mean the movie did have puke in it so does it count.
On a real note this movie isnt as bad a critics say but it's still not great, I loved the camerawork in military scenes, And tom Holland's acting was great, I also loved his grey suit and hat he wore near the last part of the movie, he looked pretty badsss ngl.
The dialogue was cheesy and unrealistic in my opinion, Plus the acting of the person who played the girlfriend really annoyed me.
What does she expect bringing another guy into a bar when it was supposed.to be a ""sad moment.""
This movie nearly got me crying do I will.give it that I guess.

Second...this film was written with such passion and comitment you will watch it twice.I will have to say that during some parts it looked as if they were just looking for something to fill in the blanks with,but the overall message was there and forget what the criticts say and the low score they gave it.THIS FILM KICKED MY ASS!!!",Cherry

176,mommyplum,See this one and decide for yourself,9,5 March 2021,"Spoilers follow- I kind of feel like I've been living with the saga of this movie, based on the quasi-autobiographical novel of the same name for a long time. I read and then re-read the novel by Nico Walker when it came out in 2018 and loved it - it was painful and heart-breaking, tragic but so extraordinarily written. Then I heard a film would be made under the helm of the Russo Brothers and would also be shot at many of the real locations from the book and I was intrigued. Like everyone else, I expected this to be a blockbuster and an award contender. Then, of course the pandemic came and it's original big release date was put in limbo, then moved to Apple+ for March 2021 and I was thrilled to hear it would have limited theatrical release starting 2/26/21. I bought tickets in advance for the opening day. The day I was set to see it I read the cavalcade of reviews slamming it from minute 1 to the last scene in every way imaginable and I thought, oh no. I expected it to be bad. I wanted to see it anyhow and met a group of friends and family (triple masked, all socially distanced) at the theatre nearest us showing it. The lights went down, the movie came on, I was loving it, I could tell by the rapt faces of everyone around that they were loving it and I was confused...did all these big outlet and small platform critics see the same movie I was seeing? The story of Cherry is basically the devolution of the formally unnamed protagonist (Tom Holland) from an ordinary Ohio college student already troubled by obvious deep seated and unrecognized mental health issues (in the movie, as in the book, he is functioning but detached, often numb, passive, depressed, nihilistic and already into taking party drugs and prescription relaxants gleaned from friends or peddlers) into a painfully young war vet with severe ptsd, amplification of his pre-existing mental struggles and a heroin habit. The last complication is what eventually sends him on a trajectory to begin robbing banks to pay for the drug before eventually being apprehended and slapped with more than a decade behind bars. Along the way he marries his college girlfriend, Emily (Ciara Bravo), and thinks they'll live a suburban dream, only to have her join him in junkie-hood. Their whole life as a couple becomes scoring, using, withdrawing and scoring again. Nothing else. In the book, their relationship was intensely more dysfunctional than portrayed in the movie - in the novel, Emily divorces him almost immediately after he rotates out of his war service and they never remarry, even though they live together later and break up and get back together for the remainder of the book. Holland and Bravo put in powerful and skilled performances as Emily and Cherry - a nickname sometimes used on the narrator signifying when he was a newbie to a warzone. Their love is messed up and tragic at the same time as it is moving and the only real anchor either has. Emily is from an abusive, broken home and sees him as her soulmate and he can't form a truly intimate connection with anyone else anymore, so he clings to her and loves her even as everything he does further degrades their lives. The Russos masterfully put in visual clues to the protagonist's profound alienation as the movie goes on - we start to see people and places as he sees them - they have generic names that mean nothing, ""The Bank,"" ""Sgt Whomever,"" ""Dr. Whomever."" I thought it was the perfect sly repeated nod to how far Holland's character is unmoored from society. Many critics seemed not to understand the symbolism and called it heavy handed. I found it pitch perfect from the book's tone. Then the narrator turns to bank robbing with such nihilism he doesn't even bother to take an actual gun the first time, he just pretends to have one, and doesn't bother to cover his face for most of the heists - another circumstance critics guffawed at. If they'd been familiar with the details of the novel, they would have known this is exactly what happened in the book, Cherry is ambivalent about being caught even as he fears it because he's beyond hope or reason at that point. I also know many critics screeched at the almost 2 and a half hours running time. Honestly, it did not feel even near half that long. Holland's character seems to rocket to his rock bottom and I cried in the crescendo scene where he really, finally gives up and accepts that he gave up long ago and never realized it. And even worse than that, he maybe never had the tools to do anything buy be destroyed by existence and his own worst instincts.I admit, if I could change anything it would be the soundtrack, I thought a lot of the choices almost came off as belonging to characters from a much older generation than young adults a few years past the shock of 9/11. Also, showing Cherry's time being pummeled by the horrors and depersonalizations of basic training and combat were very brief. More brief than I think the audience needed to see how the duration finally pushed him over the edge into a trauma induced time bomb ready to blow or implode. But, I can see where hard choices had to be made in order to keep the full running time to a reasonable limit.In conclusion, it's an overall really good film and I don't understand at all where the trashing of this movie by almost every outlet came from. Everyone I know who has seen it so far loved it, was heartbroken and moved by it. The performances are really good, the direction is good and the story stays with you.",Cherry

The only thought that clobbered by the end of this movie was how long it was stretched like a chewing gum. After chapter 3 it slowed down to put colony of sloths to shame.

190,SergeantReview,Dark but good film. Incredible acting from Tom.,7,13 March 2021,"Ultimately, this is a dark film with an even darker story about incredibly serious subjects, mainly PTSD and drug addiction. There is little to laugh at in this movie and for good reason. The serious tone was set at the very start and this theme continues right till the very end.Cherry was an interesting film in more ways than one, it's storyline wasn't particularly original but the way it was told and how it shot certainly was. There is only really two main characters in this Russo film (Nico & Emily) and they were developed with great thought. Nico's character especially, not the typical 'Jarhead' in most movies which was refreshing to see. It was a good call to focus on jut two main characters and give them the depth they deserve. I personally wasn't sold on this film until about 2/3 of the way in, I thought it took a while to get going but when it did boy did I enjoy it. Additionally, I would have loved to have seen the further character development in the latter stages of the film, especially in the end.It's important to mention Tom Holland. He has quickly become one on my favourite actors and this film puts his skills on great display. He was the perfect choice for this role and gave an incredible performance. I have also seen Ciara in the TV series Wayne, she was great in that and very good in this film.This film is a good watch and definitely a new take on topics done to death. But Tom's performance definitely made it better than it would have been without him.",Cherry
191,MindOfPaul,Review- Cherry (2021),9,17 March 2021,"This movie without doubt deserves your attention, the performance from the actors is great and Tom Holland performed as expected, deeply described the horrors that soldiers are experiencing and the struggle of PTSD after coming back to the states, how his life changed suddenly from a simple choice that he made in his youth, in this movie we learnt that if the bond between two people is
strong enough nothing can break them apart and they will stand again together.",Cherry
192,maila-81326,Disappointing and soulless,4,3 April 2021,"Holland's recent venture with the Russo brothers is a hot mess. The plot is promising but the execution is far from effective failing to create a cohesive whole. Result: The emotions get lost and even scenes meant to be sad appear to be unintentionally funny. There are far better films on the Iraq War and the horrors that PTSD leads an individual into. Cherry seemed a lot like it was borrowing ideas from American Sniper and Hacksaw Ridge but what those films managed to accomplish was a sense of compactness, the horrors of war felt tangible in those. I still recall the scene where Bradley Cooper's Chris Kyle has to get over a dilemma as to whether he should / should not shoot down the little boy who apparently was rushing at the American convoy with a grenade. I still recall the haunting set design of Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge where the blood, entrails of the wounded and the deceased made the experience so heartbreaking that we felt the horrors with Garfield's Desmond Doss. The trio in Bigelow's Hurt Locker gave us moments to remember and those moments made the film worthy of the Oscar it won. Unfortunately in Cherry there is hardly anything to write home about. There are very little takeaways except the cinematography which is by far one of the best of the year. The rest is forgettable - the dialogues are meh, the scenes at the Academy unnecessarily hilarious, the plot lacked depth, the narrative was shallow, the performances were poor (barring Holland who was quite good). I tried hard to like it as I do like films dealing with war of any sort but this just didn't engage me. 2/5.",Cherry

And an ending that was completely unbelievable that she would've gotten herself clean after waking up alone and needing another hit.

199,bookadog,It's definitely NOT Cheery.,6,14 May 2021,"This is a hard watch. Probably not a film to watch if you are feeling down about the world we are currently living in, unless of course seeing people more miserable than you is how you make yourself feel better.Tom Holland in an effort to shake his Spiderman persona (much like Daniel Craig and his forrays away from Bond) really does act his socks off. It's an incredible performance where he manages to equally draw you into his plight while simultaneously repel you and make you recoil from his behavior. You are rooting for him almost as much as you are rooting against him. The film is bereft of light heartedness, save for the casual conversations on his bunk with his army buddy and the cast of supporting characters are, for the most part, contemptible.Warning - if you hate needles - this film has them in spades, be prepared to look away multiple times.It's a long film too, so strap yourself in for the ride.At the end you are left wondering if he did find his place in the world and if we must all struggle like he does (and boy does he struggle) in order to eventually gain redemption and the life we want.From someone who has returned to old depths of depression courtesy of this pandemic I found this film didn't make me feel any worse BUT it didn't make me feel any better either.If this movie typifies the struggles that all veterans face from the lack of help and understanding ,to the nightmares and terrors then you have my utmost sympathy and respect for battling on.This film won't win any oscars and you probably won't sit through it twice, a popcorn flick this isn't. A truly human story that shows the truth of addiction, loss and personal trauma that the world doesn't want to look at.....this is that movie.",Cherry

204,arstone-09757,Cause and effect meets Romeo and Juliet,8,13 March 2021,"I believe this all could've been prevented if ...That's the ""Butterfly Effect"" or cause and effect. Had Ciara Bravo's character not feared for being loved, she would not have lied about moving to Montreal, and Tom Holland's character, thus, would not have joined the Army leading to the PTSD and drug addiction, etc.Such is life. But, what caused her to fear love? Who knows...but it's where these two meet, and the strength of his love for her, that breaks he fear and allows her to be loved. That's the most beautiful part of this.Because throughout the entire movie, up to the end, it never fails. Neither he, nor her, from being apart for great periods of time, in the face of death, drug addiction, prison, they remain committed to one another.The end of the film was a happy ending no question. And fitting for the story. I don't think any other way would've been acceptable after selling true love with such tenacity.I can only say that the part of the movie that I criticize the most was the military aspect. It felt a bit like I was watching ""Jarhead"" again. Too many nuances between branches of service are available to utilize when describing how they operate so I think that could've been done differently.But, the R and J reference is undeniable. To fall so deeply, but do something so irrational as young lovers might, that ends up in tragedy...I think that was well placed here.All around great performances by the actors here. I enjoyed and bought each of the main characters. Well done.",Cherry
205,sofiapanicker,Misdirection of Potential,5,12 March 2021,"Cherry is a movie that has a lot to offer but can never fully commit to its themes and messages. While there is much to admire in terms of its stars and subject matter, it's mostly underwhelming, because it's handled in a way that doesn't do its story any favors.In regards to positives, the performances across the board are all fantastic, especially Tom Holland in the leading role. The movie certainly asks for a lot out of him, and he's never seen falling short of that task. There are moments when he's barely recognizable -- for a young actor of his status, I'm beyond impressed with the work he's put forth.Where Cherry is really lacking is in the choices made behind the camera. There are too many risks taken stylistically that limit the film from achieving any kind of greatness. It's clear that the Russo brothers were trying to approach each chapter of this story -- from love, to war, to PTSD, to addiction -- with a different lens. It's a bold move, and one that could've worked had the movie been executed in a more seamless manner. Even once a chapter ends, it still feels unfinished, but the story moves on anyways. Also, for a film as gritty as Cherry supposedly is (and definitely should have been), the directing and cinematography is overly flashy. A story that centers on one man's downfall does not need multiple aerial shots, and it certainly doesn't need that god-awful glossy, slightly blurry look used in the first chapter. It's a shame really, because even with such strong work from Holland, the film itself cannot rise to his level.By the end, Cherry becomes a movie that has so much to say that it ends up saying little to nothing at all. Because there's so much content, many facets of the story are never fully realized, and the gaudy execution is distracting to a fault.While Holland shines in a role that showcases his range, he can't save this film from being too boiled down in its technical misfires and just overall lack of consistency. Cherry is ultimately a disappointment, because for a story as relevant as this one, everything is done in such poor taste.",Cherry

210,sailorman-12617,I don't understand the low ratings.,8,12 March 2021,"Very briefly: Cherry is a brilliant movie and a fitting translation of the story of a real person. The pacing feels chaotic at times, compared to traditional movies, because real stories aren't paced like screenplays. The cinematography is nothing short of stunning, and most of the events are ugly to give a hint of the ugliness that is being translated from real life to a book and to a movie.
Tom Holland once again flexes his range as an actor, and the Russo Brothers continue to elevate cinema. Ciara Bravo didn't have too much to do in the movie, but I personally believe she aced her tonally contradicting scenes.",Cherry

Because I was expecting the typical slightly above average, predictable type of movie. Now, after watching it it feels like I've discovered something new in movies in Tom Holland. Last time saw him he was Spiderman. Now he is a complex character I can relate to and sympathize with. This movie needs to be watched at a time you have said time to really invest in it.

On the good part again the acting I believe is exceptional and it shows how unsupported war veterans are in the U.S and how drugs take you on a roller coaster ride that will only end really bad, I think if you appreciate films this is definitely one to watch",Cherry

Tone-deaf like I said in the title of my review.The main character was already dabbling in drugs before he even joined the military, this just pushed him over the edge.Everyone experiences PTSD/trauma differently it's not a one size fits all, whether you are in the military or not.Looks like they didn't even have a consultant besides the guy who wrote the book, needed a second consultant.It feels like their trying to romanticize peoples struggles without actually acknowledging the root cause.",Cherry

It's one of those movies that you probably will only watch once. There's really nothing and no one to root for in this movie. You find yourself hating all the characters, and you're just ready for it to end. When it finally does, you may feel like you need a shower to wash it off of you.

229,francisangelone,I'm a Iraq war veteran living in Cleveland,10,8 July 2021,"Luckily I waited to 2012 to check into the VA (which in the last decade made massive improvements). The war zone location was so real looking I had to check on locations. Now I'm a Marine so can't speak on behalf of the Army training scenes but the war part was pretty spot on. It took me a minute to also realize this film is in Cleveland my home city. I can't speak for the drug usage but the PTSD was very accurate. I was infantry and saw what the Navy medics had to do and was glad not be them. Much respect. I'll have to read the autobiography to see the difference between movie and book. The rest of the film is heavily on robbing banks and drug use at a very R rated pace. The movie is divided into chapters which could be there own episodes in a mini series.I quite liked everything about this film. It's going to be hard to watch Spider-Man back in high school after this but I'm excited for Tom Holland's future acting career. The movie sprinkles in a little unnecessary hidden humor and a lot of it runs off a little Good Fellas-ish with the 4th wall being broken as the lead talks directly into the camera. I highly recommend this movie but please go into as if you are about to watch requiem of a dream meets platoon.There's been major advancements in the VA, at least Ohio's. If you have severe PTSD, there's help both mentally and financially.Now I need a stiff drink, thanks for reading.",Cherry

Big mistake. I started to watch films that I wanted to watch(with low ratings) because I have watched a lot of movies with 7.5 or more ""stars"" in IMDB and I didn't know what else to watch. Then I realize that I enjoyed many of those films, and this one it's an example of that. Cherry is a great film, is entertaining, has great acting, good photography and show us the decay of a war veteran amazingly, don't miss it. You're the only one that decides what is good or bad for you, what are the type of films that you like or don't, but stop trusting these ratings, just watch what you want to watch and then you decide, if you do this you won't miss the opportunity to discover amazing films.",Cherry

Normally I wouldn't watch movies of this particular genre and I knew this movie would be pretty dark and emotional. However this movie was an emotional rollercoaster with amazing performances by the actors. We are used to seeing Tom as our friendly neighborhood Spiderman which was very weird to see him in such a mature role that strays away from the movies he's known for. Tom delivered a jaw dropping performance alongside his co star Ciara Bravo. They both really faced their roles head on and really helped tell this story. Now being a huge Tom Holland stan this movie was not really easy to watch considering I'm used to seeing him as Peter Parker. I could feel the dedication and heart he put into this movie through his performance. Toms performance felt so real I had to pause the movie multiple times and take a second to collect myself. Needless to say I was speechless. His performance was not forced and felt so real and authentic. I cannot praise Tom enough for his performance in CHERRY.

I would have to disagree with most of Cherry's actions, but that's not what the movie is about. The movie is to show you the struggle one can endure in such situations and not necessarily for people to put themselves in the character's place, especially if the viewers has no relation to this.

This movie contains a lot of messages about the army and the war and how that hell effects the soldiers during the war and after getting home, also this movie shows us the war in a more realistic way. This movie also talks about how a single mistake can ruin your life. This movie also describes a pure love between two complicated lovers and how they gonna fight for each other .

Unfortunately they forget this is a symptom of meth addiction, not opioids. They also seem to imply she becomes an addict because she is bored and her boyfriend is, so why not?The characters are all one dimensional and no one, is sympathetic. I keep hoping Tom Holland will get killed in one of his oh so fake bank robberies (the banks have apparently no security guards by the way).At one point Cherry hears someone knocking at the door and presumes they are cops, flushes his whole stash (after first dropping half of it on the floor, only to discover it's his friend.

I didn't feel anything when the army people died since the army men are just a bunch of unlikable characters. I felt like this movie trying way too hard to be R rated coz there are too many swear words, and my final problem with the movie is that when cherry fell, the music that went with it is horrible. But the good points are really great. Tom Holland's performance is amazing, The second half redeemed it for me, The drug addiction in the movie is really believable and the R-rating is really good.

It's such a simple thing to do to make sure your movie doesn't completely lose all credibility, but very few military themed movies take that necessary step... unfortunately. The guy is supposed to be a PFC during his deployment, but in the ceremony when he gets home he's wearing PV2 rank, which is a rank lower, but they're calling him a Specialist, which is a rank higher than PFC... totally confusing since anyone familiar with rank thinks the guy has been demoted for something at first.

The story telling is obnoxious with the ""parts"" in red and word highlights and the drug scenes are soo overdone. Contrary to news speculation but neither ecstacy or oxy makes you feel like that. And for the anti military expose they try to push during the 2nd qtr only makes you wish for a Stripes redoux. I honestly cut it off about halfway bc the directing and scene flows were getting on my nerves and I kept thinking of other movies (I'd already seen) that I'd rather be watching instead.

300,prosserheromanfilms,A decent film which serves as a lesson that style isn't always a good thing.,6,13 March 2021,"Cherry, the Russo Brothers latest endeavor, is a testimony to the fact that stylizing a film has its limits. The story is a little cliche and shows it's flaws up front. The film tells the story of a war vet who deals with his ptsd by riding heroin highs and robing banks to afford the drugs for him and his wife. The films stylization, however, takes away from the overall story and becomes more distracting than pleasing to the eye. This film is well acted but Holland and his counterpart, Ciara Bravo, however the screenplay is far too drawn out into several parts which make the film seem longer and longer. All things said, the film is worth the watch and shows the negative side effects of the harsh evils of war. This being said, it is not by a long shot in the upper 30 percent of films this year.

So addressing this in a more in depth was great.
Secondly the perspective of how a solider felt about the war was also handled very well. Way different than the movies like Jarhead.

303,OhItsStefan,Great movie with flaws,8,13 March 2021,"Emotional movie that tries to adress real world issues, falls short in some areas but excels in others. The movie does not have anything we've not seen before but still has just as much impact as the ones that released before this.The story is told in a very stylish way with these red highlights and it being told by Cherry to someone else. The movie is unstructured in a very structured way if that makes sense, split up into different chapters that all take place at a different point in time. The start especially goes into these little side paths and jumps around a lot but I guess that goes with the idea of the story being told to someone else.Holland is great, even in a more mature role. Supporting cast ranged from alright to decent but some of the dialogue felt a little unnatural while other bits were really well written, mostly the banter.Music was absolutely beautiful when the scenes needed it, tense when the scenes needed it and emotional when the scenes needed it.I dont really understand why the movie got such mixed reviews but I really enjoyed watching it and I think you will as well",Cherry

305,arcidiaconorobert,Russo Brothers give us a solid but far from perfect film.,7,12 March 2021,"He also did a great job in his collaboration with Spike Lee in Da 5 Bloods. Sigel's most impressive work is his project with Nicholas Winding Refn in Drive, but his work in Cherry is a close second. Sigel does a terrific job here and continues to be a fantastic cinematographer. In terms of performances Cherry has some great ones from Tom Holland and Ciara Bravo. Both shined as they put together the best performances of their career. Overall though I thought Cherry is a better film that it is getting credit for as some critics have really disliked this film. Not only is Cherry enjoyable for most of the film's runtime, but it also carries some important connections to the real world. From our poor treatment of veterans to our misguided views on rehabilitation, Cherry does not shy away from these difficult subject levels. I think most audiences will both enjoy and take something away from Cherry. While Cherry is no masterpiece it is certainly better than many other films that have been coming out recently and I would recommend a view. Follows me on IG @arcmoviereviews",Cherry

312,spiritgrave,Destined for cult status,8,19 March 2021,"Like most divisive films, this one will most likely gain a cult following. Scrolling through the reviews it's pretty clear it's not for everyone. It's such a weird, dark, and emotional film with fantastic performances and experimental storytelling. For the most part, it's faithful to the novel and even fixes some issues I personally had with it, while also adding minor issues that didn't work for me, particularly with pacing. You also don't stick with the characters long enough to really learn about them, except for Cherry, and some moments with him even seemed rushed. But there's so much I liked about the film that all of that didn't matter much to me.
Tom Holland and Ciara Bravo knock it out the park! The Russos did a great job and its honestly great to see the types of stories they're interested in telling outside of the Superhero genre. I'm excited to see their next project.
Overall, ignore critics. See it for yourself and be the judge. It all depends on the type of movies you like. It's a film that's so different compared to most that have been coming out during these times and while very heavy throughout, there's still a lot of fun to have, with a bit to learn about PTSD and how dangerous addiction can be.",Cherry

My main concern before watching was that I'd have a hard time seeing Tom Holland (who I obviously relate to Spiderman) and Ciara Bravo (who I've only ever seen in Big Time Rush) in such serious roles. I was worried their baby faces would take me out of the movie, but I am happy to say that once the movie got rolling I really didn't notice how young they both look.Ciara was amazing in the movie, this being the second thing I've seen her in I was very impressed with her acting.And Tom really carried the film excellently. He really pulled off the more mature content well, and I think he proved that he is capable of doing serious roles outside of Spiderman.Overall, I give this movie 8/10 stars.

I've never experienced the kind of mental trauma he was going through, but it happens and I've seen what PTSD can do to people. And although crime is never the answer, until you're in that situation you won't understand.It's a true life story, so I personally only look for 3 things in a film like this.1. Was it believable? - 100%, Tom Holland is incredible, he put everything into the role and it shows.2. Was I entertained? - Yes, everyone has the right to their own opinion, but i was hooked throughout, including emotionally.3.

It highlights the need in our nation for mental health, for our Veterans, and people struggling with addiction. It's incredible. I grew up in a city like the one depicted in this film, in Ohio. Heck, it may as well have been shot on my street. The feeling of no other option but addiction, military, crime, is all very real in those places.Tom Holland performs on such a high level. His performance hits deep in my soul and very close to home in many moments.

Several elements of the plot could make up a good, layered story, interesting to watch, but instead it's just a bunch of stuff thrown together, hoping that it doesn't fall apart immediately.There is the love story, there is the war story, there is the PTSD story, there is the drug addict story, there is the bank robber story, everything getting worse and worse minute by minute as the movie drags along, but then fixing everything with a freaking 3-minute montage of a miraculous prison-rehab is just cheap and a coward's solution.Making the main character overdosing before getting arrested would've made more sense and fitting for the overall theme of hopeless, helpless lonely victim of society. But having him get better 'for some reason', having his wife just get better off-screen and hanging in for him for probably years again, just 'cause, is simply stupid.

Tom Holland truly deserves an Oscar for his performance in my eyes.... so many movies out there that are just straight BS propaganda, but this brought to light a lot of the issues going on today(and have been going on for the last decade) that some people don't want to face. Amazing movie! Def worth watching",Cherry
339,bmeissn2,It's worth watching,9,18 March 2021,"Being a military veteran myself but not a combat veteran, I have spent much of my time in the military working with service members pre and post deployment (re-integration). I have seen examples of this type but the program I worked for, worked to combat these type of scenarios by getting service members the resources they needed upon return home. This movie is not horrible but at times was quite painful for me to watch and I almost turned it off but I forced myself to finish it. The main character in this story reminds me of a friend of mine that had similar issues but did not end up robbing banks. He did end up taking his own life though. At times I kick myself for not trying to do more to help him. I try to live my life in a way now where I try to do all I can for my friends in their dark times as seeing what happened to my friend.The actual review
The Basic portion of this film and the combat scenes seem to really be hollywood's take but the at home portion seemed to be spot on and as it's painful to watch, I suggest anyone to watch this to get an insight to what actually happens to some people, not all, when they return home from having experienced combat.",Cherry
340,hockeylass-134-929537,I enjoyed this film - but I know it'll be divisive,8,1 March 2021,"You will either love this film, or really dislike it, and I very much doubt there'll be an in between owing to the subject matter and style choices - but I for one really appreciated this film and it's one that'll stay with me for quite some time.I can't use the word ""enjoy"" because the story is so desperately sad overall, and some of the scenes are so harrowing that it makes for uncomfortable viewing.The first half an hour of Cherry struggles to find its place. The longer I think on it, the more it feels like that was an intentional choice. The character himself is drifting through his life, never really going anywhere and the feel of the movie at the start is much the same. As it finds its footing though, what becomes abundantly clear is that the systems Cherry puts his trust in, fail him. And as he scrabbles to find some sense of normalcy, bad decisions lead him along a path that way too many people have found themselves down.The Russo Brothers take a lot of stick - and I feel cannot win. It's as though film critics are not willing to allow them to move away from the blockbusters they made. Not that they want them to make those blockbusters any more either. Here, they're clearly indulging in their passions, and though I didn't like some of the style choices, and I wish they'd given Emily a slightly deeper character arc, I respect those choices and I understand why they made them.Cinematography is everything I would come to expect from Newton Thomas Sigel, the chapters ""Basic"" and ""Cherry"" my absolute favourites. Critics have slated the script - again a criticism that I feel is a bit harsh given a lot of the text is directly lifted from the book of the same name.Tom Holland is transcendent in this role as the titular anti-hero. To start with he acts as you would come to expect (especially if you've seen his work in The Devil All The Time) - but as his character descends into the deepest pit of despair, he knocks it out of the park. There's times you lose the fact it's actually him - by the end he's a shell of a man. He really leaves it all out there, and criticisms that he's miscast are, to my mind, absurd. Ciara Bravo is excellent too as his wife, Emily, and the supporting cast do their jobs well as wasters and chancers who enable Cherry's demise.My overwhelming sadness by the end of the movie is stemmed from the fact that while this is the story of one man, there's so many more out there facing the same struggles, so many people out there who could so easily fall down the same hole.",Cherry
341,hockeylass-134-929537,Watch it for yourself,8,3 March 2021,"There's a lot of critics out there. And a lot of them seem very keen to slate this as much as possible, beyond what seems objectively reasonable.What I would say is this - ignore them all (good and bad) and make your own mind up. And remember this is very close to a true story, written by a man who fell down the darkest of holes having been failed by the systems and freedoms he swore to protect.Cherry is just an ordinary guy. There's nothing remarkable about him. And the disordered start of this film (which I struggled with to be honest) reflects the erratic nature of his drifter existence.As the film progresses the style falls into order and then back into disorder, reflecting the rollercoaster ride of Cherry's horrific wartime experience and descent into drug addiction as he struggles to erase what he saw. The Russo Brothers together with DOP Newton Thomas Sigel, use a range of clever tricks to put you in Cherry's boots. From colour tones to aspect ratios, it takes you from soft warm love to cold hard conditioning in an instant.I personally really enjoyed these choices, and look forward to watching it again to see what other details I might have missed on first viewing. I understand some people might feel that there's too much movie going on, but it was more than fine for me (all personal taste I guess!).The acting from Tom Holland is exemplary and, at times, frightening. I cannot think what it must have been like to have to go to those places to portray the pain and fear he did and he should be applauded for taking such a leap with this role - he will always carry the weight of Spider-Man on his shoulders but he should be at least respected for wanting to branch out into challenging roles such as this. Ciara Bravo was excellent too, although I think I would have liked a bit more character arc from her (not her fault of course). I thought the supporting cast did well too in their roles - none of them particularly likeable (Jeff Wahlberg's Jimenez a rare exception) as they support and enable Cherry's demise.Overall, this is a movie which really stayed with me, it still does. It's eye-opening, it's desperately sad, and it's incredibly powerful.",Cherry

A much, much better film than its current score suggests. Definitely watch this under-appreciated film!",Cherry
344,geaneyciara,Great Acting. Editing needed improvement,7,22 March 2021,I will start out by saying the acting from all actors was phenomenal but Tom Holland and Ciara Bravo in particular were exceptional. The concepts of PTSD and Drug Addiction are hard to pull off if you have not experienced it yourself but the actors really had every detail down to a T. I liked this movie but it lacked coherency. I felt I was left with a lot of questions and some parts of the movie next to each other just didn't make sense. It's a shame because I think it has serious potential to be a 10/10 kind of film.,Cherry

This movie, in my opinion, managed to portray PTSD and addiction in a way that it kept my whole attention from the beginning to the end. I even got goosebumps at some of the scenes, thanks to the music which is truly a masterpiece. Haven't read the books, but my advice is that the movie is worth watching at least once, the atmosphere of it is incredible!",Cherry

I thought the scene where he finally gets caught by the police would have been the perfect ending but again they ruined it with the epilogue.I couldn't even really appreciate any of the performances because everything else was just so distracting, they somehow managed to make Tom Holland unlikeable and unwatchable.I really just can't say anything good about this film, even the music was distracting.Leaves you feeling unnecessarily depressed and unsatisfied, again the whole thing was just so unnecessary and this is a film that I sadly think should never have been made.",Cherry

The music makes all the intensely awful and beautiful scenes even more so. I felt all the things throughout this movie, cried multiple times, and after it was over, I was like, ""Damn, that was depressing but so amazing and beautiful at the same time.

I wanted this to be good, the topics are super relevant, I liked Tom in that weird Netflix movie with all the serial killers. This was maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. Absolute garbage. Written by idiots who didn't care to learn anything about the people they're attempting to portray. I don't know how out of touch with drug addiction you'd have to be to find this film interesting. None of the characters are well developed, so we have no idea why they're doing anything. What a missed opportunity for Apple.

Great emotional story, you can feel the struggle and the true love, that is so hard to find and to keep. Tom and Ciara did an amazing job, there are some details that are very difficult to describe with words. It's been a long time that I was impressed like this. It is my first review on IMDB and possibly my favorite movie so far.",Cherry
364,saulybobs,"CHERRY: A movie that spills, War, Addiction & Adolescent Love all into one.",9,12 March 2021,"Cherry is an Oscar worthy film in my head. Tom Holland & Ciara Bravo's performances as Junkies are insane considering their intense 27 pound weight loss for the dope life section of the film. The film has some amazing songs from Mountain & Henry Jackman's fantastic score. The amount of famous quotes from the book that are incorporated into the 4th wall breaks from Tom is baffling. There are some amazing sequences of one shots scenes all the way throughout (like the one in the car with James, Roy & Cousin Joe) The hospital scene really stayed with me for hours later after my first viewing, it was so hard to watch and I felt with Tom's character all the way throughout the scene with him so worried for Emily's safety and wondering if she will live. It's phenomenal. The bank scenes are very intense with Tom screaming at the top of his lungs saying ""ALRIGHT NO ALARMS, I'M A WANTED MAN"" really shook me. The ""BASIC"" & ""CHERRY"" chapters in the film are quite enthralling. The last 20 minutes with Cherry seeing what he did was wrong right in the middle of a robbery and lays his disguise down on the counter and tells ""Vanessa"" to sound the alarm and get him caught. Realising what he is doing is for the greater good. Finally with him about it stab himself with a needle full of heroin right in the middle of a street in Cleveland as the police come up to arrest him really got me, then going into Cherry's incarceration gave me some ""Wolf Of Wall Street"" vibes. Once the credits hit, I felt like it was open ended like The Devil All The Time with Cherry & Emily seeing each other after 14 years of Cherry in prison. In my opinion, I feel like the ending with Cherry leaving prison should have ended with Cherry getting a guard telling him ""Good luck"" as he starts to walk out and Cherry breaths in and realises what he and Emily did was just a bad decision that they made as children. The film is one hell of a ride, with many great jokes and scenes that made me laugh my socks off. The whole film made my heart realise what addicts do as a living and what they must have to live with every day, as their number one priority. As my first viewing, it was really something, sure it may have minor bumps and cracks on the road but overall I found it an amazing project to watch as an eagle eyed viewer of Tom & Ciara's.",Cherry

I'd say they made it pretty accurate for what it's like to be an addict. Now, I didn't rob banks, or even my parents, but the way they looked, talked, got sick, and obsessed about dope really takes you in to how it FEELS to be an addict. Misery. A love/hate relationship that you always get screwed in the end, unless you quit. This movie reminded me why I need to stay sober and try to help other addicts! They aren't bad people! They're just like everyone else. They need love and support.",Cherry

387,niklasmarxreiter,"Good story. Unfortunately, the implementation is below average.",6,12 March 2021,"Story: The story is really very appealing. A young man who goes from student to soldier and finally becomes a drug addict because of his experiences in the war. He shares this addiction with his girlfriend and finances it with bank robberies.
Realization: The realization by the Russo Brothers unfortunately failed.
1. the battle scenes in Iraq were unfortunately not authentic and far too unspectacular. The viewer was not carried away.
2. there were far too many unnecessarily complicated scenes with which the Russo Brothers wanted to show what they were capable of.
3. the story is much too long. Half an hour less would have done the trick.
4. the biggest point of criticism is the film music. Much too much and unfortunately poorly chosen and after the first half hour at the latest just annoying. Acting:
Tom Holland: Holland managed to convince from such a multiple role, with which one does not actually connect him. In this film he could show that he can do more than Spiderman and he did. But it's probably not enough for an Oscar yet.Ciara Bravo: Also a convincing performance although she couldn't really convince with her portrayal as a drug addict. Maybe she is just not the right cast for such a role.Conclusion: Good story, good actors, but unfortunately too much intentionality and thus screwed up.",Cherry

389,sarailr,A fan of the book and a fan of the movie,8,13 March 2021,"A year and half ago, when this film was just announced I decided to read the book before going into this story. So I did. And I think everyone who has read it can agree that it is a masterpiece.Now, this movie, an adaptation, did a really good work with telling (roughly) the story that Nico Walker birthed. I say roughly because the character and story itself has been trimmed and switched in many, many ways. That makes it bad? No.I think they kept a lot of the key moments from the story and as performances go everyone is unbelievable. There are so many heart-wrenching moments that just come from the performance of the actors and the score that give so much depth to the story. Big standing-o for Tom, Ciara, Jack, Forrest and Jeff, absolutely mind-blown. From the photography and art direction, I can't really say anything else than it is beautiful and I love the incorporation of the color red to the minimum to give it a symbolism throughout the story. Kudos to keeping the chapter format in the movie as well.Now, there were some things I didn't like, hence the 8/10. As a reader and fan of the book I wish we could've seen more the duality of Cherry, at the end of the day, he's only human, and we're not perfect. The book really makes you hate the character at times, but it also makes you feel all of his pain and all of his anger. I think adding this WAY darker side would've made an even more interesting character. There's a part from the book that I feel is rock bottom for Cherry (no spoilers): it happens with this 19 yo girl Libby and I feel like it would've added more humanity to the character's arc. I understand there are obviously very little to do if you don't wanna make a 4 hour film, but I feel there were part from the story that were essential to keep as they were. Another thing was the character of Emily, which also wasn't a sweetheart and would've given even more weight to her decisions to staying with Cherry. In general, keeping more genuine moments from the book and traits from characters would've been mind-blowing.SPOILERS AHEAD!I also know this movie was made as a way to say ""this is not about Nico, this is about hundreds of veterans"" but I really wish we could've known the reason why he got parole because, again, it would show the depth of his character. If you didn't read the book or know anything about the real-life Cherry, Nico Walker, then you don't know he got interviewed while being in jail and started writing the book (which is implied in the movie I guess). When his book is published, he uses the money he starts receiving from the sells of the book to pay back to every single bank he ever stole from. That's why he got parole. I feel like telling that part of the story is ESSENTIAL, specially after they decided the character was going to let police caught him (which doesn't happen in the book).
SPOILERS OVER.And yet again, none of that makes this movie bad, they tell a tragic story and it meets its purpose. It tells the sad part of ""fighting for your country"" trope that americans love to sing so much. I hope that with this movie veterans, PTSD and drug abuse are more visibilized and that it is demanded that they get ACTUAL help and not just say ""thank you for service"" because that's no use.
I recommend this movie and I will definitely be watching again.",Cherry

395,bhynson-85513,Incredibly Confronting,9,15 March 2021,"Cherry is a film that you wish you could go back and experience for the first time again after finishing, for me at least. I watched this movie with my mother at home on Apple TV, and I'm not sure she appreciated it as much as I did. When I first saw the trailer for Cherry I had no idea what it was about. All I knew was it had Tom Holland in the lead role, and that it was going to be a dark and gritty story about time in the army, and bank robbing. Cherry started at a slow pace that I was disappointed and almost bored by, but after making it to the later parts of the movie I realised that this was clearly intentional on the part of the Russo brothers. It intentionally starts slow as a representation of the characters' lives at the time. You may also be bored by it but try to push through, it gets better, I promise. The style in which each section of the movie is a representation of that part of Cherry's life. Nico Walker (the author behind the semi-autographical novel that the movie was based on) said that he didn't like the movie, and found it ""too artsy"". This is the very reason I love Cherry. If you enjoy great cinematography to conduct a scene then you'll most likely appreciate this movie as I have. The use of colour and in-world sound, along with the brilliant score composed by Henry Jackman feels so intimate and deliberate that you form an emotional connection with the characters that so many movies struggle to get right. Tom Holland's performance in this movie is probably the best I have ever seen for him, topping 'The Devil All The Time' and 'Spider-Man'. Borderline, this movie is brilliant and an emotional rollercoaster. I would even go as far as to say that it changed my perspective on a lot of aspects of life.",Cherry

She kept talking about how she loved the movie, so I just decided to sit down and give it a shot, not expecting much. Let's just say, I ended up being shocked. I'm not going to say much because I don't want to spoil, but please just give this movie a shot. The cinematography is amazing and the acting is honestly incredible. Sure, I dislike some of the stylistic choices in the movie, but they ultimately didn't hinder my enjoyment to the point where I'd rate it a 6/10.

421,facebookjohnvi,Well Laid out movie with excellent acting,10,7 November 2021,"Amazing cast, incredible acting by Tom Holland. This is based on things that we more do now, tend to ignore (PTSD, Abuse). While some say ""the story is hard to follow"", perhaps something in the crayons and construction paper would be better. I think this shows how diverse Toms acting can be. It takes you on a storyline not following the standard (and sometimes boring) plot flow. It's a good solid movie.",Cherry
422,evgenyfeldman,They just do not know how to make this story into a movie,3,15 March 2021,"Look, Tom Holland's performance is really good and the story itself could have worked.
But then it comes to the way this story is being transformed into a movie. This is directors' job, right? Well, they are truly terrible.
This is the most pretentious movie I've ever seen. Endless slow-mo sequences and unnecessary breakings of the fourth wall are combined with a sudden school-theatre-scene intermission (twice) and inappropriate opera score. This is extremely tasteless and what makes it absurdly bad is that this is the way they show a local little love story of two students. Come on!
If you power through a terrible starting third you'd be somewhat awarded with the war part of the movie. And there it gets tricky. There are awkward homages to Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket but directing suddenly becomes less mannered and more on par with seriousness of what's actually happening on the screen. This part would be almost great and Hurt Locker-level if it was not for a really straightforwardly dumb depiction of the horrors of the war. As a documentary photographer who actually been to a war I know that you don't have to show the charred body in order to make your viewer feel the horror of it being there. Given that, and having PTSD myself, I was really shocked with their decision to show a close-up of a charred body.
But the reason for all that is simple. This desperate attempt to use every single Make It Look Important tool is just an inevitable result of not being able to make a complex story work in a movie.
The premise of this movie was really great. The unability to actually make it is sad.",Cherry
423,ItsAlwaysSunnyInLA,"Unexpected, hidden gem",8,18 April 2021,"An unexpected experience based on the rating and the brief synopsis.

I've seen other films with Tom Holland in but this just gives the impression he's still Spider-Man and his girlfriend hasn't matured at all.A story about PTSD but it skims over it a bit and just throws it straight into an addiction with no one around them wanting to help",Cherry
428,theodor-j-sandaker,"Beautiful, dark and engaging",7,13 March 2021,"I loved the cinematography. It was a bit much here and there (doctors office, I'm looking at you), but all over it was beautiful and captivating. The story was engaging, and made me feel like an emotional train wreck. I was invested in the characters and really felt their loving relationship, their heartbreaking spiral into misery and their way out again. The way the movie split the story up into different parts worked for me. I think the middle part/war part could have been a bit longer, or at least showed us more of what he went through, as that would have made it easier to picture all the traumatic memories that haunted his mind afterwards. It would have made the movie even darker though, so maybe it was a good decision after all.",Cherry

Tom Holland & the rest of the cast did a superb job of telling the story in a way that kept me engaged & invested in each character.Maybe the darkness of this tale & it being based on a true story explains the negative reviews by critics. I find it suspect the majority of non-critic viewers such as myself that have left reviews on the web left praise for this film, while the majority of the critics left horrible reviews. Either way, if you're a movie viewer, not a critic, & don't expect all movies to be puppies & rainbows, chances are you'll be moved by this movie.",Cherry

I've always liked Tom Holland, but always saw him as the squeaky clean boy that everyone loved and could do no wrong, the quintessential spider man in reality.This movie though, Cherry, WOW did that change my perceptions of his abilities as an actor and leading man. This movie brought up emotions and pain I thought were long buried in me and brought back my love for for the antihero's of cinema.When I first heard of this movie and what it was about I thought it was horrible miscast but I owe a HUGE apology to Mr. Holland for thinking this and would love the chance to thank him for his amazing performance.Outside of the stellar leading man I thought the story telling, cinematography, and directing played perfectly into the story. All across the board from the leading man, leading woman, director, A. C.

The whole movie was much more centred around Tom as a 'Junkie' and became frustrating to watch as lots of similar scenes repeated.I ended up having to forward some parts halfway through as it becoming clearer that it wasn't like I was going to miss anything vital. The last twenty minutes ('epilogue') was unbelievably slow and definitely could've been filmed better to at least end the movie well, but no.Despite the plot, the acting was the one thing holding it up- the crying was great and Tom's American accent is pretty good, as we all know.Overall do not recommend, or at least go into the movie with low expectations.",Cherry

Not something for the background while the kids are running around!The story felt complete and included closure, and there is no doubt in the message being delivered, which was honest, impartial but hard-hitting. There was a constant feeling that the issues presented are true life, and is also based on a semi-autobiographical novel.Well worth a watch, but brace yourselves!",Cherry

451,bethrachel,Dark but great,10,13 March 2021,"I never write reviews but after seeing negative reviews I thought this movie deserved one.
This is not a feel good movie, it's not supposed to be. It's oh so very dark and emotional.
In short, it's about a character that joins the army without realising the consequences he would experience. Severe PTSD turns him into a drug addict robbing banks to make money for more drugs. And, not only is it about him, it is also about his devoted wife, who is determined to stick with him despite struggling with his PTSD and drug addiction behaviours. This struggle turns them both into drug addicts in a heartbreaking story.
All actors were great. But, in particular, Tom Holland outdid himself. He was phenomenal. Despite thinking I would only see Peter Parker, I completely forgot his fun persona and was engrossed in this dark and damaged character. It really makes you feel for him, and wonder what people are going through in their own lives.
Like I said, if you're looking for a lighthearted movie this isn't for you. But it is definitely recommended otherwise. 10/10",Cherry

Personally, I think it's beautifully shot and acted, but the storyline is not going to resonate with many. Now, I just happened to have been involved in a number of traumatic moments in life which have led to struggles with addiction, so much of the film absolutely clicked with me. I wonder though, if I hadn't experienced PTSD or addiction, whether I could have any empathy for the main characters. So, if you're an addict with PTSD, give it a red hot go. If you're not, I'd suggest giving it a shot to see if you can understand why some of us end up turning down the road of substance abuse.",Cherry

Some tropes and trite things about war, mental illness, and drugs, but the two lead performances and the actor's chemistry makes up for that.The format runs in ""parts"" and some of those parts could've been shortened to delve into more of what the five minute redemption in the epilogue only hinted at.Still, powerful and lovely performances.

The acting and cinematography and writing for this film are amazing. This touches on a huge problem in America and it portrays it in such a true fashion.
