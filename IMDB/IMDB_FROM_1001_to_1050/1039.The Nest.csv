0,SnoopyStyle,like the idea,6,12 April 2021,"It's the 80's. Ambitious commodities trader Rory O'Hara (Jude Law) returns to London taking his wife Allison (Carrie Coon) and their two kids. He is pushing for a big deal with a big payout. He is spending beyond his means and moves the family again to a country mansion. It causes friction with his wife and exacerbating their money trouble.I like the idea of this family descending into dysfunction. I find a lot of it very compelling. Law and Coon are delivering intriguing performances. Filmmaker Sean Durkin, who made Martha Marcy May Marlene, is trying to give this film a quiet, naturalistic feel. It does need to be a bit clearer with the beginning. It's just too slow until the money troubles begin. That really raises the intensity and the movie picks up steam. Quite frankly, the start bored me to the point of passing out and I had to start over again. The passive filmmaking style is not conducive to paying attention.",The Nest

3,kosmasp,Not for everyone for sure,9,7 July 2021,"It is tough to describe actually and it is far removed from a popcorn movie. Which either makes for a great Sneak Preview movie (surprise film) or a bad one. Because some people would definitely not choose to go watch this. As I can attest and was witness too the other day. Especially with the popcorn crowd ... they are not the best audience for this one - and some of them were quite the talkers! It's ok with movies that have a lot of ... noise, but not with this.So a very slow movie that warrants and needs patience from its viewers. A movie that is not entirely clear on its purpose on its goals. It may seem like a horror movie at times and in a very wicked sense it sometimes is too. But it does not really transcend into that genre, even if that creepy feeling may snek up on you.Awesome acting all around and a throwback to the 80s that I reckon is close to American Psycho, but without all the flashy bits that would make this be a popcorn movie ... and not nearly as violent as that. But the vibe is there and it is really well done ... for those who are into the drama that is.",The Nest

5,CinemaSerf,It's a lovely house....,6,15 September 2021,"Jude Law is ""Rory"", an ambitious deal maker nearing the end of his Wall Street earning potential. He convinces his old boss in London to take him back, and soon he with wife ""Allison"" (Carrie Coon) and two children are living in a creaking old manor house in rural Surrey or Sussex whilst he tries to pick up where he left off, and make his millions. Sadly both his manner and his methods are now well out of date and he begins to struggle - and as he does so, his life and marriage soon follow suit... Meanwhile, his missus - who is a riding instructor - is less than pleased nor are his children as their supposedly idealistic lifestyle starts to look a little less certain. I struggled to know just what this film was trying to convey, to be honest. Is it a swipe at (dis)loyalty or greed, if so whose? He wants the money badly, but so does his wife - and, indeed, she is prepared to put up with quite a degree of beastliness from her increasingly odious husband until the penny drops and you know about the famous dish that is best served cold... Law isn't the man he was on screen; the cheeky charming chappie has now been replaced by an older man whose acting is pretty unremarkable. This film is equally unmemorable - and maybe because the trail gives away too much, any elements of deception or suspense as to the outcome are pretty well telegraphed to us fro the outset. Maybe ones for fans of Jude Law, or for those who take pleasure in the brutal decline of a rampant capitalist - for the rest of us, it's all rather dull.",The Nest
6,evanston_dad,Slow Burn,7,15 July 2021,"""The Nest"" was totally preaching to this choir.The older we get, the more my wife and I find ourselves drifting into the life philosophy of minimalism. Our focus is on cutting all the junk out of our lives, not just material junk, but psychological and emotional junk as well. This means deciding where are priorities are, what's important to us, and eliminating things and people that interfere with that.The patriarch in ""The Nest,"" played by Jude Law, is pretty much the exact opposite of that. Never content with what he has (which is a lot when the movie starts, and more than most people on the planet will ever have) he insists on moving his family into a giant and decaying mansion in England in order to take a job that he knows will give him his big break. But it doesn't, and the effect his greedy lust for more, more, more has on his family comprises the plot of this movie. Law is very good, but Carrie Coon, as his wife, steals the show. Her character arc is the film's most fascinating element, a woman who's allowed herself to become subservient to her husband but for whom subservience doesn't come naturally. A couple of scenes, both set at dinner tables as it happens, where she asserts her dominance over her husband, are the film's most uncomfortable and memorable.Some symbolism involving a pet horse is broadcast with all of the subtlety of a tornado siren, and the sheer unpleasantness of being around these miserable people may turn some viewers off, but I mostly found myself engaged with this one.Grade: A-",The Nest
7,ferguson-6,it's the family that haunts themselves,7,17 September 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. I'm not sure how to officially protest, but this is writer-director Sean Durkin's first feature film since the excellent and thought-provoking MARCY MARTHA MAY MARLENE in 2011. Okay, he directed a TV mini-series (""Southcliffe"") in that span, but there really should be some kind of ordinance mandating (or at least pleading with) Mr. Durkin to share his art more frequently. His approach is not conventional, and it challenges the eye and mind. The story doesn't move at the pace we've come to expect, and the characters - though quite believable - don't always act the way we expect.Jude Law stars as Rory O'Hara, a business man with big dreams ... dreams far bigger than his work ethic. Carrie Coon (""Fargo"", GONE GIRL) co-stars as his wife Allison. This husband and wife couldn't be more different. Where Rory is the big-talking blow-hard who, Allison is the down-to-earth horse trainer. Oona Roche plays teenage daughter Samantha, and Charlie Shotwell (CAPTAIN FANTASTIC, 2016) is the younger Benjamin. Durkin does a nice job with the family set-up in the first few minutes of the film. We get a sense of each, as well as the family dynamics. There is a great shot of Rory sitting idly at his desk, and soon after he wakes up Allison with a cup of coffee and the announcement that they need to move to London.The film is set in the 1980's (the Reagan-Thatcher era), and Rory's desperation to prove his business acumen is on full display when he meets his old (now new again) boss Arthur (Michael Culkin). Rory is a social climber, intent on keeping up with the Joneses (or whatever they're called in London), and he's referred to as ""Old British - New American"". He takes it as a compliment, but we soon witness Rory as little more than a fast-talking salesman. A restaurant scene featuring Allison, Rory, and his co-worker Steve (Adeel Akhtar) is brilliantly played, as Rory's professional life begins to unravel at a pace matching that of his family life.We see each of the family members cut loose in their own way, in an attempt to deal with the strain. Timid Benjamin lashes out at school. Samantha throws a wild bash at the family home. Allison guzzles gin and lets go on the dance floor. Speaking of the family home - it's an old mansion that is the loudest symbol of Rory's stretch to impress. The film seems to tease us a couple of time in regards to possible paranormal activity within the home, but that's simply Durkin's misdirection. The only thing rotten or haunted is the make-up of the family. Their domestic dysfunction is horror in its own right.Rory's delusions of grandeur and worshipping of money are finally thrown back in his face during a tremendous scene of Taxicab philosophy. When asked what he does for a living, Rory answers, ""I pretend to be rich"", in what may be his only moment of clarity. Jude Law is superb as the charming guy we don't really like, and Carrie Coon goes toe-to-toe as his polar opposite, and she's exceptional. Mr. Durkin and cinematographer Matyas Erdely (SON OF SAUL, 2015) keep us off balance with the fascinating shots within the mansion, and startling close-ups that make a point. There is certainly no abundance of light, but this isn't the type of family that the spotlight tends to find. It's likely to be a divisive film not embraced by mainstream audiences, but adored by those who crave projects that are creative and different. It played Sundance prior to the pandemic, and now we have to hope we aren't forced to wait another 9 years for the next Sean Durkin film. Although I will I have to.",The Nest
8,malcolmgsw,Waste of a bank holiday afternoon,3,30 August 2021,"It was raining so I decided to take a chance on this film. I shouldn't have bothered about it. It was slow and boring. The disintegration of a yuppie marriage. That was it,nothing more and a total bore.",The Nest
9,lasttimeisaw,Film Review - The Nest (2020) 7.4/10,7,21 November 2020,"""Allison takes the cushy offer with a pinch of salt, as the family has already been relocated several times, but Rory doesn't really ask for her permission, but compliance. Once there, he immediately lavishes the family with luxury, renting a capacious mansion in Surrey, building a paddock and buying a new horse for Allison (because she is a cowgirl born and raised), enrolling their two children, Samantha (Roche) and Benjamin (Shotwell), in expensive private schools. But soon a crack appears on their ostensible easy street, but it is not as we are lead to expect, no, it is not a haunting mansion scare-fest, but the shattering distress it reveals is no less emphatic.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",The Nest
10,Cineanalyst,Haunted Genres,8,13 August 2021,"Never mind those ""drama"" and ""psychological thriller"" claims, y'all just watched a horror movie--more precisely, an old-dark-house, or spooky-mansion one. Well acted, darkly photographed and expertly, if ponderously, edited, sure, but most of all, it's an odd roundabout way to make a haunted-house genre flick. Clever, though, this, as the subgenre tends to be about some graft concealed as something supernatural--ghosts an' such--and ""The Nest"" is felicitously a genre picture disguised as some arty or prestigious indie release, even one with perhaps a socio-political message--Reagan and Thatcher-era deregulation or something, maybe. Writer-director Sean Durkin even tricked the U. S. distributor for the movie, it being released under the general IFC Films label instead of their Midnight one specifically for such genre pics. I'm going to rate this highly it's so conceptually interesting, albeit not so much in execution, as it does require it, after all, to look a lot like some dull indie film.Granted, there's a realistic relevance to the most frightening thing for a family uprooted to an old dark house being that they can't financially afford it and all the other underlying problems including loneliness, lying, lack of communication, power imbalances, reputation, and even the father haunted by his upbringing and the rest of the clan's culture shock moving across the pond that central horror exposes. Nothing supernatural here--not the house, not the horse. Indications otherwise are mere abstractions of the real fear--the real 1980s threat from not paying the landline phone bill.This isn't played as some sort of silly M. Night Shyamalan twist, either. It's ""Wall Street"" (1987) with Jude Law's Gordon Gekko as the costumed madman sneaking through secret passageways to terrorize his family with his reckless market gambling, but instead of some literal mask characteristic of the genre since parodied in Scooby-Doo cartoons and, yes, Batman ones (see the 1926, 1930 and, if you want, 1959 adaptations of ""The Bat""), he's a poor man disguised as a rich one. I appreciate the beginning New York scenes in this respect, of the sort of placid domesticity one often sees at the beginning of scary movies before moving to a drafty old castle where one travels between rooms through secret passageways, discovers money behind hidden panels, where windows and doors seemingly open on their own, to the point of the usually-a-woman questioning her sanity, where corpses reappear, a party that may be full of vampiric threats, seemingly trapped in a room, and, yup, the phone line is cut. The only thing missing here is a stormy night, which is curious given the London-area setting. And, he would've gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for his meager bank account.",The Nest
11,westsideschl,Aghhhh!,3,2 June 2021,"First, IFC & Shout productions, again as usual, greedily force DVD users to sit through their many ads on their other releases.Second, still another overused, worn-out script of a self-centered, self promoting financier suddenly not having his speculations go his way with consequences in his family life. Really, nothing creatively interesting happens.Third, the main script oddity was for being a broke family why not sell something or better still what happened to the monthly paycheck.",The Nest
12,ops-52535,a good film,8,19 November 2020,"Even though there are quite a few storystrains that spins out in nothing. but it tells a familystory that elaborates and gives a real touch of how life was in the 1990's, with extreme mobility, the start of ''globalisation'', crystal palaces, and utopian dreams and abilities, that ultimately crashes into a cataclysmic shakedown of selfsurveying, and retrospectiveness.the actors do a good job, and its a fairly good production apart from some story parts unfinished/vanished. its best said to be an introspective psychosocial analysis of family dynamics in a world on hyperdrive, where the winner takes it all...and the looser is a looser like the 99% of the rest population.so if you want to feel a touch of european 80/90's filmmaking try this. you will either love or hate this drama. the grumpy old man thought this was a forgotten filmgenre and had a good time.recommended",The Nest
13,paul-allaer,Hard to classify film kept my attention from start to end,7,7 October 2020,"""The Nest"" (2020 release from the UK; 106 min.) brings the story of Rory and his wife Allison and their kids Samantha (14) and Benjamin (10). As the movie opens, we are in New York and watch ""a day in the life"" of this family. Next morning, Rory has news: he has a great job opportunity in London (where he hails from). Allison reluctantly agrees, and soon the family arrives in the UK at their new place in Surrey, a massive 17th century mansion. It's not long before tension rises... At this point we are 15 min. into the film but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it al plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second feature-length film from writer-director Sean Durkin, who previously gave us the excellent ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"". Here he examines the consequences of uprooting a family from their familiar New York surroundings to a brand new and unfamiliar environment in the UK. This movie is plot-heavy and hence I'm not going to say a whole lot more, although I will say this: I found this movie classify, as it covers a number of different areas, although a generic 'family drama' could cover it. Also, the movie is set in the 1980s: there is reference to ""President Reagan"" on the radio, and 1980s music is a-plentiful including the Thompson Twins, the Cure, and many others. What I thought at the end of the film was this: ""Money's Too Tight (To Mention)"", the 1985 hit by Simply Red. Why? Just watch! Jude Law (as Rory) is excellent once again (he currently stars in the HBO mini-series ""The Third Day""), and the same goes for Carrie Coon (for Allison). Beware: there are a few scenes in the movie involving horses that you may find difficult to stomach (I looked away).""The Nest"" premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival (yea, pre-COVID-19) to good buzz. Then of course movie theaters shut down. The movie finally was recently released in select theaters, including my art-house theater here in Cincinnati, fully adhering to all COVID-19 protocols. Not that it mattered, as the Tuesday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly: 2 people (including myself). If you are interested in a hard to classify 'family drama' or simple a fan of Jude Law or Carrie Coon, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",The Nest
14,GiraffeDoor,That cab driver was still kind of a douche.,7,12 September 2021,"Hypnotic and low-key snapshot of a family at a certain point in history with an under-handed commentary of how so many people were almost undone by their conviction that things would only get better.It's great to see Jude Law still getting work though I usually try not to fixate on star power. His interpretation of the white collar family man lost in his own hubris at his own family's expense is increasingly disquieting.Executed with a slow rhythm, it doesn't pull any punched but errs on the side of restraint rather than soap opera yelling. It is a thoughtful comparison of varying kinds of fragility.It depicts my homeland as a sort of alienated corporate wasteland which I low-key adore.",The Nest

16,yusufpiskin,One of the year's best films.,7,31 December 2020,"Very much like a horror film without the horror aspect, and a masterfully made one at that. Sean Durkin's long awaited follow up to his 2011 film Martha Marcy May Marlene has finally come this year, and to say that he's lived up to the potential shown his exceptional first feature is an understatement. The writing and directing are top notch, especially in how Durkin and cinematographer Mátyás Erdély (whose previous work as a DP includes the masterpiece SON OF SAUL) create a richly unsettling atmosphere. Aided by wonderful, career-best performances from Jude Law and Carrie Coon, The Nest makes for a bleak portrait of a deeply f!!! up marriage and toxic masculinity.

20,jadepietro,Family Matters,7,13 February 2021,"IN BRIEF: A well acted but inconclusive psychological study.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Change is not always a good thing. A little known independent film called The Nest proves that point rather well. Director / writer Sean Durkin sets an ominous tone from the onset in this psychological study about a family coming undone with their abrupt relocation from America to the UK. To say that the move does not go well is an understatement.Rory O'Hara and his lovely wife, Allison, live the perfect storybook life. He is a rich trader and she is his pampered trophy wife caught in 80's opulence and living the good life. All seems well enough on the surface with the O'Hara's until Rory decides to head back to his hometown of London and uproot his family. One small problem: Rory is a grifter and liar and he and his family will be forced to make the ultimate sacrifices due to his overt actions.The family dynamic is odd from the start. Unexplained circumstances occur with some subtle but mostly heavy-handed symbolism (a dark horse buried and suddenly exhumed, an expensive fur coat showing personal greed and wealth, doors unable to lock, hidden cigarette butts indicating rebellion, a wool sweater showing character enabling, etc.). The on-going tension slowly builds and personality traits morph these characters into totally different individuals,: Samantha (Oona Roche) becomes the defiant teenage daughter, Ben (Charlie Shotwell) morphs into a introverted young boy and the husband/wife tag team, expertly played by Jude Law and Carrie Coons, become a warring tribe sorting through all of their self-centered behaviors. Mr. Durkin's screenplay establishes its tone most effectively, but only hints at the betrayals and destructive behaviors of this family. Scenes of more direct conflict could have created to produce a more concise family portrait.Still most of the film is atmospheric and engaging due to Sean Durkin's fine direction and the acting of Mr. Law and Ms. Coons as the battling spouses. They are very good in their roles and bring their characters' self-indulgences and bitternesses centerstage. Their explosive scenes are terrific when they finally arrive as they snipe and rage at each other, but they are rarely viewed. Most of their inner anger stays within, always simmering to the top, yet rarely brims over. As their children, both Ms. Roche and Mr. Shotwell are totally convincing as pawns in their parent's gamesmanship.The Nest is a special type of film, more for those moviegoers interested in psychological tension, creepy atmosphere, and well-define characters than a plot-driven story with definite results. Despite much to admire, this nest is a tad empty. (GRADE: B-)",The Nest
21,trinaboice,Artistic and devastating,8,23 September 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
This is basically the directorial debut of Sean Durkin, although he has done other projects. His style is very unique and different in writing and filmmaking. It might not be to mainstream taste, but cinephiles will adore the artistry.
It offers a haunting and heartbreaking look at an American family imploding after moving to England where the entrepreneurial husband chases fortune and success, oblivious to the toll it takes on his family.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Profanity (some uttered by kids), including quite a few F-bombs
Sex scene showing skin, body parts, and sound effects
We see a woman topless a couple of times.
Teens party with alcohol
Adults drink alcohol and some get drunk.
You see a dead horse several times.
Parents will feel sorry for the kids in the film who are practically abandoned by their parents.THEMES:
Family disfunction
Marriage: communication, expectations, teamwork
Image vs. substance
Power, money, prestige, and what is sacrificed to get it. How much money do you really need to be happy?
Dishonesty with yourself and othersTHINGS I LIKED:
Jude Law is pretty much great in everything he does. We expect that, so the surprise performance for me was Carrie Coon. I hadn't remembered seeing her in anything before, although she has been in plenty of very good films like The Post, Gone Girl, Widows, and even Avengers: Infinity War. She was recruited to play soccer in college before she studied at the American Players Theatre. What is soccer's loss is the Big Screen's win.
The two kids did a good job too, especially young Charlie Shotwell.
The filmmaking is different from a lot of things we're used to. Different is good!
The absence of light in many scenes shines a light on movements and causes our eyes to see intriguing things.
The close-ups on facial expressions are intimate and telling. I heard one critic say, ""When their life closes in on them, so does the camera."" Good point.
You'll feel uncomfortable as if you're a ""Peeping Tom"" spying on a family's day-to-day life.
The one funny moment is when the wife takes a swig from an open bottle of wine at a restaurant and says, ""It's fine. We'll take it.""
It's so sad that Rory hasn't seen his mother in many, many years.
The story does a great job contrasting a wife who is relatively down-to-earth and loves horses with a husband who is willing to sacrifice his family for money. The story takes place in the 80s when the economy was booming, headed for a crash.
It's fascinating to watch how the various family members react to the feeling of being trapped in life's situations.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
There is an element of the movie that suggests there is something paranormal occurring in the English manor, but this is not a horror movie, contrary to what the creepy music at the beginning of the movie suggests. Some are saying this movie is a horror film, although it definitely doesn't fit into that traditional genre. The horrifying part of the movie is watching the family fall apart before our eyes.
Some viewers will complain it's too slow-moving.
This is not a feel-good film but a cautionary tale.
Feminists will protest that the Alpha husband says he's in charge of the family and that the wife steps back to let him lead. There's no real teamwork in the marriage.
Some people will be confused by the scene of the horse in the shallow grave.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.",The Nest

Slow story about a man who pretends to be something he's not and drags his family thru the process. Interesting because it slowy reveals the ugly truths about wannabees and that you can't keep up a facade for so long before the real you manifest. I totally got the point of the story but for some, this movie will go right over their heads and they will label it as a boring film or just say it was bad.

Until he decides to return with his family to settle in a huge rural house in Surrey to reformulate the London company in which he worked before his departure to US. The early 1980s and Thatcherism are beginning to blow, and the neoliberal winds of deregulation and financial and economic globalization are beginning to blow.The Nest is more than just the story of a marital crisis, as it actually describes the development of related personal crises that unfold in parallel and follow a collision course. Rory is bold and ambitious, and his Americanized view of the economy and business is met with resistance from the more conservative practices (so far) of British firms. Rory's portfolio includes a significant dose of simulation and some self-deception.Her wife Allison had to leave her job as a horse trainer behind and start managing her own stable and her first horse (which will acquire special resonances) in the same field as the house where they live. . He has been enduring several moves and trying to preserve some financial independence.But it is in this English adventure where the marital problems that had been denied under the facade of a perfect and successful family begin to prevail.I would dare to say that the protagonist of the film (or mostly her point of view) is Allison's; her crisis is more evident since she is a less denier personality. Carrie Coon (who is already coming from great roles in The Leftovers, The Sinner 2 and Fargo 3) performs an extraordinary performance, with the necessary nuances for each of the scales of her emotional journey. Jude Law is doing great too, painting the edges of his excruciating character.A success of the film is the relevance that the empty mansion takes as a setting, perhaps as a metaphor that allows the story to glimpse into suspense and even terror.",The Nest
27,TuesdayThe17th,If ur a fan of Sean Durkin's previous film you will like this one even more,10,19 May 2021,"I cant say enough good about this movie. It caters to a certain crowd of viewers. A selective crowd. A crowd of deep seated movie goers who appreciate the craft over the money. I am part of that crowd. I am a huge horror fan but I equally enjoy dark and haunting dramas. I think this genre is growing at a steady pace these days and I hope to see more of them. Sean Durkin has proved him already on my eyes from his producer credits for a string of his friends involved films to his very own ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"" he is one of the handful of mumblecore directors I truly love.""The Nest"" has many good things about it. The casting from the leads to the extras, the acting is top tier especially from Carrie Coon, the tone is utterly uncomfortable and the pallette and direction are just what i was looking to see in this movie. I own about 4500 movies on physical media so I can kinda see how a film plays out in my mind before watching it and this was one of those. I knew itd be exactly this way but that is ok because I was HOPING itd be like that. I was honestly over impressed with it. Many will complain that nothing happens but in actuality, a whole lot happens as this is a simple layout type story about subtle yet very creepy happenings. It almost feels as if you shouldn't be watching It. That's a successful film right there, when you can evoke such emotions in the viewer whether the on screen visuals are ""dazzling"" or not. Films lile this often go underappreciated but I'm here to tell ya'll that this is a properly managed and put together masterpiece that us well deserving of a 10 star review. It reminds me of one of my favorite haunting dramas ""Magic, Magic"" directed by Sebastian Silva btw, which you will love if you liked this movie.",The Nest

29,js-66130,DECEPTION,8,30 September 2020,"Hoo boy, let the discussions flow.It is rather lovely to soak in a well made piece of cinema that will no doubt elicit a bevy of experiences depending on the audience. ""The Nest"" has a basic mid-life family implosion crisis plot at it's core, but just how rotten is it?Jude Law (Rory) is a slick talking investment advisor, living a comfortable New York life, with a pretty horse-training wife, and requisite two children. Yet he yearns for more. Soon the quartet are off to his England, to live in an isolated ancient mansion filled with too many rooms, a table so big it cannot leave the premises, and secret doors. Sounds like a horror movie, and in a sense, it is. Just not of the supernatural variety.Law owns the screen as the flashy business stud, pushing all his chips into the middle of the table, dragging his reluctant dependents along for the ride. Carrie Coon (Allison) is his American match, willingly embracing her husband and his white lies until breaking point, then unleashing a vindictive, cruel yet understandable side in their escalating partnership.Is this a family drama? An allegory for greed? A warning? A husband and wife coming to relationship climax?A riveting turning point, actually one of many, has Allison beaming beside her man at a posh dinner party, as the boss welcomes him back to the English fold, revealing a devastating lie. Her smile doesn't break, but it is clear that there is trouble a foot. Much trouble. The husband and wife dance continues, but as finances spiral out of control, the tight solitary quartet starts to crack.Every act is punctuated by a primo British new wave nugget from the likes of the Cure or Psychedelic Furs as a reminder we are in the eighties. It is a rather odd reminder, as the movie really doesn't depend on an era, other than referencing the greediness of the Reagan and Thatcher right uprising. It does elicit a weird alarm bell of nostalgia for anyone of that age, and perhaps was a bit of directorial self-indulgence. Not unwelcome mind you.How and not why this plays out is the strength of this film. Blame is easy to hurl, but sometimes life is the problem.A moody a piece of cinema, both visually and thematically, ""The Nest"" is a film that leaves an odd, bitter aftertaste, long after the main course is digested. A burner.hipCRANK",The Nest
30,hunter-friesen,Ambition or Deception?,8,8 February 2021,"Similar to the calculated and observational style of Stanley Kubrick and Yorgos Lanthimos, Sean Durkin's newest feature is a drama/horror tale about the dangers of greed and ambition. Jude Law and Carrie Coon each give career-best performances as a couple that is forced to come to terms with their increasingly meaningless lives. With the gap between the haves and the have nots becoming wider every day, this social critique is timely in the present and I suspect it will continue to be in the future.",The Nest
31,howboutthisone_huh,"really unusual, depressing film with no ending",5,25 November 2020,"I doubt most people read the reviews before watching but just in case, you can sum up this movie pretty simply. The movie starts off with a family of four living the idyllic life and then their life goes downhill as the story peels off the veneer of each character. It's not about a house or anything supernatural. It might have been an interesting story if the director didn't seem preoccupied with the mundane. Okay, yeah, parents pick up and drop off their kids at school. Doesn't mean there is much meaning to it so why repeat these moments over and over, along with other equally mundane moments. This is one of those cases where you've got a director that has simply gone amok and wasted some of the best talent in show business. Most of the movie is like watching your friends or neighbors squabble about money and responsibility. Both cringy and depressing... and then the movie just ends with the characters standing at the cliff. Hope this doesn't mean a sequel.",The Nest
32,bastille-852-731547,"Well-made, understated drama with powerful performances",7,6 October 2020,"Sean Durkin's new film is a modest yet searing drama about a family that relocates from the United States to the English countryside after the father (Jude Law,) an entrepreneur, moves his job. The move eventually brings out a variety of conflicts between him and his wife. The film works best as both a layered character study of the two leads (Jude Law and Carrie Coon.) Both of them are very well-developed as characters, with their strengths yet deep-seated flaws thoughtfully communicated. Viewers are able to feel for both of them, and will understand their imperfections while simultaneously sympathizing with some aspects of their daily lives.The film's aesthetic, including the score, are beautifully understated. This isn't a flashy film, but it's not trying to be. The score is ominous yet powerful and moody in the best way possible. The screenplay goes a great job ratcheting up dramatic tension between the husband and wife, while also providing careful context to the narrative on many levels-Jude Law's character's work situation, the characters' relations with others they meet while settling into life in the UK, and how they respond to difficult and adverse events. The main couple's children are also thoughtfully depicted in the script; the writing shows them to be dynamic yet shaped by a variety of external circumstances in their personal and familial lives. The acting is terrific across the board, as the main characters are able to clearly convey raw grit and anguish as their interpersonal relationships end up getting increasingly muddy and dysfunctional. All in all, this is a complex, smart and well-made look at the the impact of greed on our lives, as well as the intricacies that govern how we respond to each other during difficult and uncertain times. Despite all of these positive qualities, the third act is a bit underwhelming and fails to completely satisfy or pack the expected emotional wallop. Instead, it leaves us with a feeling that doesn't quite add up to the sum of its previous parts. As a result, the film is not a home run. Yet I do recommended it without hesitation to patient viewers who can appreciate challenging, slow-burn cinema. 7/10",The Nest
33,babyjaguar,Durkin's Nest: Social Climbing Hasn't Change Much,6,26 September 2020,"Durkin's The Nest tries to recreate an economic portrait of the late 80s, via an US family living in London. Jude Law this cast, as the English father of American children. But the strength of the film is Carrie Coon playing Law's wife. Many have said this feature is study of character.Coon's performance helps the film's often pretensions of depicting classism. Her appearances are strong with emotional wealth, look out for the horse sequences. The other cast members were not as strong, even the film's production worked hard to recreate London in the late 80s. It's equipped with pop culture reference to Britian and UK then musical trends.Beyond there's a mist of emtpiness, here is where the film offers some strength, ironically when it was not intended. Other times when it's intended, it comes off very superficial. But as a contemporary look into white middle class, it's definitely a good study.Truth of the matter is that this film maybe had been more stronger if it was set in the present time, with the pressure of social status on platforms would have strengthen Jude Law performance, luckily Coon was able to translate the film's emotions.The shots of a decaying mansion were actually done well to show the process of the family's disfunction.",The Nest
34,jaimemedina-36288,Cowardly story telling.,3,22 May 2021,"This isn't going to be a good review. And the insanely maddening part is that there is so much power in this movie. Law and Coon absolutely simmer. They both do a beautiful job at keeping the strings tense and understated. Tension definitely builds in a way that kept me riveted. There is some truly great story telling here.And then it goes nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. Like a teenager blowing his wad into a sock, Durkin seems lack the balls to take the story to its logical conclusion. It is a sadly flaccid third act.There are a couple of over long reviews that seem to say that this film only can be understood by those that truly appreciate ""cinema"". Of them I'd simply ask: what flavor is the Koolaid?",The Nest
35,LiveLoveLead,This might appeal to a small few but read this for an idea of what you're getting into...don't say you weren't warned!,2,8 June 2021,"I rarely give 2 stars but this movie was painful. There is pretty much no dialog in the first 20 minutes as you just watch snippets of the family wake, eat, work, play, and then out of the blue, the dad says their moving to London (I promise I'm not exaggerating). When they get to London the family's dysfunction starts to emerge but, even though hardly anything really happens, there are so many plot holes, and paths that lead no where that it's just confusing...you keep waiting for something to happen. For a moment it seems to hint at a possible haunted house scenario with a locked door that inexplicably opens but that's it, nothing becomes of it and nothing else weird happens, so I question, what was the point? The movie is excruciatingly slow and dark and moody, just watching characters drive, work, stand, fight, smoke, and very little dialog throughout. Although the acting is decent, the characters are extremely unlikable so you don't even care what happens to them, nor can you relate to them. Scenes get thrown in with no explanation or follow through (the horse, the mother) which makes for many unanswered questions, and then it has an incomplete and abrupt ending. If you are able to finish the film you'll probably know the moral the writer/director is trying to convey, but most people won't enjoy the way he chose to illustrate it. This one is a hard pass IMHO!",The Nest
36,julieshotmail,"Good start, middle, but highly unsatisfactory ending",7,19 December 2020,"Pre-pandemic, I didn't bat an eye when spending money at movie theaters. Now, with so many shows available in steaming format, a new-release movie would have to be worthy of my $4.99 to rent it. The premise of ""The Nest"" seemed worthy enough. The beginning and the middle parts offer a good study on mundane life and human desires as they unfold mysteriously, with great acting from the always-dependable Jude Law and his British accent. Carrie Coon is also impressive and unpredictable, reminding me of a mixture of Emma Thompson's sophistication and Diane Lane's housewife-y vibes. The ending, though, leaves a lot to be desired. It's a disservice to the great efforts of the actors and the production crew to just abruptly end it like that, like a kid giving up on homework. So yes, I want some of my $4.99 back.",The Nest

Just fizzles. Yes, there's a moral resolution, but it takes 15 minutes too long to even get to that. It's well acted, well shot, but more filler than feature.",The Nest
38,catfanatic888,THE FIRST JUDE LAW MOVIE I HAVE LOATHED,1,24 November 2020,I was not really enjoying this movie already and then this piece of garbage calling itself a thriller disgusted me through and through. I find NOTHING THRILLING about abusing and basically murdering an animal for ANY reason. Despicable and unnecessary! I would have rated this much higher if not for this garbage! Animal lovers will HATE this or anyone with a kind heart towards them. I wish I could give this trash ZERO STARS because I would!!! I watched it again to make sure I wasn't being too harsh on this movie. No I think I hate it even more. Such a waste of a terrific cast.,The Nest
39,varun-25071997,Impressive,8,20 November 2020,"Sean Durkin's latest film ""The Nest"" is about Rory (Jude Law), a trader who in his own words pretends to be rich. He keeps moving from one place to another and one day he informs his wife Allison played by the brilliant Carrie Coin that he got a great job offer from London. His family including his son and daughter hesitatingly move to the new place and struggle to adapt there.The core plot of The Nest is about greed and false prestige. Rory's sweet talking and his high class lifestyle appears charming initially but as time passes we cringe at how miserably he fails to appear like a socialite and how his selfishness affects the entire family.The scene at a fancy restaurant towards the end of the film where Allison calls out Rory for being a fake infront of his potential clients is the most important part of the film. The ending though not very conclusive gives us an idea about what happens next. Does Rory change now after hitting new lows or will he go back to being greedy again? One can hope it's the former.I found this to be far more impressive than Durkin's previous outing ""Martha May Macy Marlene"". The two lead actors Jude Law and Carrie Coon are brilliant throughout the film. The pace of the movie is quite slow for a dysfunctional thriller but nonetheless the scenes are so well written and beautifully edited.",The Nest

I have to admit there are a few scenes that I did not understand the meaning or how they contributed to the story. Sometimes a straightforward approach works the best.We all know what it was about...family and home life is the most important, that is where your riches lie...do not put on airs or try to live outside your means...people can easily spot what you are about if you are full of b.s. etc. etc. etc. BUT a bunch of random thoughts pieced together do not make a movie.",The Nest
42,severindringel,Outstandig lead performances rescue an underwhelming story,6,7 June 2021,"In this family drama we see much that we have seen in many other films. The O'Hara family of four, who on the surface lack nothing - they are wealthy, live in a large house and are happy together - is shipped off to his native England by their greedy father. He does not feel welcome in America anymore and wants to prove something to himself and others. This behaviour causes tension with his wife and presents the family with seemingly insurmountable hurdles.If the film can pat itself on the back for anything, it's that Jude Law delivers arguably his best performance since the early 2000s. His character Rory is a bitter and selfish demon on the inside, taking on almost narcissistic traits. In the first half of the plot, you don't understand his actions at all and just frown at why anyone would put his perfect life at risk like this. At a later point we get a little backstory that explains his nature a little. Still, Rory is someone you would never want as a friend. He is pretentious, conceited and completely lacking in solidarity with his family. Law plays him with his usual charisma, though, which is why the antagonist, clear on paper, isn't really one. For his wife Alison, played by Carrie Coon, is also spoiled and in a way obsessed with herself. She has a great passion for horses that almost borders on an obsession. That's why she hardly knows any limits and then overdoes it in a certain scene. Unlike her husband, however, Ali is capable of remorse and knows how to admit her mistakes. She also always puts her children first and these two insights are enough to make her a definite sympathiser. Coon has a few moments where she breaks down and has to show real emotions. You totally buy these, apart from a somewhat bizarre scene at the end, which is why her acting can definitely be classed as great. The couple's two children are also involved in many storylines, though at no point does their presence really feel relevant. Law and Coon single-handedly carry the film.The Nest is a film that thrives on its acting performances and aesthetic sheen. It doesn't have exceptional cinematography, but the ancient castle in the English countryside is quite handsome and exudes the elegance that the film certainly has. What director Sean Durkin has also nailed is the build-up of tension. You often get the feeling that something could happen at any moment that you don't expect. It is therefore difficult to take your eyes off the film. Unfortunately, the thriller-like build-up only pays off to a limited extent, because the result is completely inadequate. Thus, the film unfortunately comes across as a rather generic family drama that tells a story, but it is never really tangible. It lacks entertainment value, which is why critics and audiences will clearly be divided on this one. I'll sit in between, The Nest is neither fish nor fowl.",The Nest
43,soundoflight,A rare cinematic film,8,24 November 2020,"In an age where everything seems to resemble a made for TV movie, ""The Nest"" declares itself, right from the first shot, as a return to something more cinematic. This feels like a real film. It's shot beautifully, with wonderful locations and with a great cinematic gaze that lingers on its subjects.This is what films should be. They are a visual medium. Too many movies today are ""talkies"" that endlessly explain with a sea of words and dialogue. The Nest instead shows a long outside shot of a horse kicking the door of its tiny barn in rage and let's that do the explaining for it. As it does this, it builds an incredibly atmospheric world that created a real feeling of dread in me, similar to watching a horror movie, and as other commenters have noted, in some ways this actually is a bit of a horror movie of an unconventional kind.My only mild critiques of the film are that the 80's theme seemed tacked on for some reason. I'm not sure why, but it seemed a bit anachronistic, like it wasn't the real 80's but some idealized version of it, which is not necessarily a deal breaker either. And my other comment, that may surprise some, is that I actually wish it had turned into a more outright horror film at some point. I think that may have actually taken ""The Nest"" into the realm of a masterpiece, or at least a cult classic. Never before would there have been such a well acted, serious, and believable build-up to a horror climax, but in 2020, I will take what I can get.",The Nest

63,brent-27849,the horse deserves an Oscar,1,26 April 2021,"I think there was a mistake in the version of the movie I got - I think I accidentally got somebody's home videos, and not the good ones with people on vacation but the really bad ones watching them eat and wet the bed and throw up and, well, talk to each other.I'm reminded of Hitchcock's famous quote that movies are basically just real life with all the boring bits taken out. This movie is where all the boring bits ended upOn the up side, the acting... by the horse, was just amazing. I couldn't believe how good he was. He was a total professional, hitting his marks time and time again. And his death scene, that was awesome, I can't believe how he slowly dropped to the ground and laid down his head, he couldn't have done that in one take. And then when they dropped him in the hole, the way he managed to stay frozen, I swear he must come from the Method form of acting. Then at the end, when he rises from the ground and I realized it it was all about the horse, he was responsible for everything, I just about lost my mind.The Oscars were on last night. I didn't watch them and I don't know, or care, who won, but all I know is if that horse wasn't at least nominated, there is something seriously wrong.",The Nest
64,johntheholder,This is one of those times when one has to point out the obvious. This is a Great Film !,8,31 December 2020,"I guess the austere title is a mocking attempt to illustrate my annoyance/disbelief of so many reviews against this fine specimen of a film.It is a slow paced drama. All shots in it are a product of meticulous design and thoughtful planning , it's a film of -superior to great - direction , so I was even more shocked by reviews stating things like "" good acting , bad direction"" what are you talking about people?!I dont want to preach , but I'm pretty much forced , am I not?
I mean , okay , the people who say that "" nothing happens in this movie"" , I am not going to be so cliche-like and accuse them that this means they are of the ""popcorn-adventure-explosions all the time"" - type of people. No , but maybe it means something like "" they are the ""streaming -platform"" type of people,the scroller type of people. They scroll down their TV streaming menu , they look at the pictures of titles and they try to grasp some easy hint of a likeness, so to start watching that. They are the people who play tetris on their mobile phone , they are the type of people who want pictures to change , and the color to change too.Well this film has pictures in it ,where the color doesnt change like the tetris game on your cell. Okay? It has specific color patterns , and maybe this is too hard for your brain to focus and not get bored. You 've become totally impatient , you want to scroll your instagram instead, check what's new over there , instead of staying with the film and let it absorb you.Because if you gave it a shot ,you may have realized this film is an Auteur's film , its quality, it's pure cinema , it's just plain old good. And I'm not even being snob , I watch guilty crappy pleasures too , but when I 'm watching something good I tend to notice.I won't even bother to describe the plot or the film , I 'll end this by congratulating the director , the photography, and the two leading actors for this great work.",The Nest

He's always delusional and probably has a modern day undiagnosed personality disorder. The wife is admirable and gets a job helping a farmer while her husband goes off to try to impress people he doesn't even know or care about with his non existent wealth.I could never decide if this was a story about ghosts or zombie horses as the characters heard doors slam without explanation and the young boy ran away from the horse's grave amid a rolling fog.

This film certainly holds your attention with the excellent cinematography and foreboding soundtrack, but really nothing happens in this film aside from showing a family dealing with issues of moving abroad. It really felt like I was watching a mid-season episode of an acclaimed tv series that I'd never watched before. The recommendation I had heard mentioned that it all builds up to a fantastic ending, which this doesn't. I was expecting some sort of reveal or at least a climactic conclusion that would explain why the film's storyline was so basic and uneventful. But it just sort of fizzles out.

In my opinion, it seemed that they could've been a little bit more creative with the ending. It wasn't bad, but, it did seem to be lazy. A few questions were left unanswered.

95,balintkinga,The law of attraction going real bad..,10,2 January 2021,"I usually check out the genre before I watch a movie. The Nest, we're being told is a drama, romance, well, for me it was a tragedy, literally.
The acting is nothing than exceptional, also the sound usage which includes lots of nuances of silence, mostly that kind of heavy silence that induces the feeling that something very bad is about to happen, it kind of made me feel for the characters from the very beginning.
Most of the basic story line can be called predictable, the situation of the chachters has been already experienced by most of us, in other movies, books or/and real life but.. The Nest has achieved to make it surprising, entertaining, gripping.
It amazed me that from the first moments of the movie, with the seemingly happy and idealistic, cozy routine line of family life the creators achieved to send signals that this is not the real thing, it's not the story because more is going to be reviled along the way.
It's also a romance, yes but not your average kind, not the kind that one would expect, for me it was a romance with everything from one's surroundings, people, animals, nature, objects, feelings, the nest one builds from and for love.
I watched The Nest yesterday, on the very first day of the year and I remember I had my notebook close to me, with a blank page (naturally since it was January the 1th.) so I can write down whatever comes to me about the movie but it remained quite blank until the fallowing day because I couldn't make out what I could say about it, I needed time to organize this experience. I guess it's mostly about how not to confuse one's self confidence and abilities with greed and blindness because there's only a thin line there like the case between love and hate, also present here by the way, and, of course gratitude (it can be a difficult one to spot and to hold on to).

I thought Jude Law would turn everything around with the big deal ... that never happened.The wife simply and finally realizes at the end that Jude Law is just a liar and complete phony putting on a fake show of wealth for all. That was the twist that wasn't. No big climax occurred. That is very much how real life is.The movie started out as a 10 for 10, but continued to decline until the denouement.

102,neurocore,Underrated. Dont listen to the haters. A story to learn from.,9,3 October 2020,"Yes the plot is simple and some people say it had many scenes that added nothing to the experience and I disagree. I think the movie achieved what it wanted perfectly.First of all. Live within your means. People in the west and increasingly all around the world live in a fairytale. They want the latest iphone, a brand new gucci bag and high maintenance car just because it's out there, just because they think it will add value/meaning to their life and give them the opportunity to post something on Instagram. If you cant afford it- dont buy it. Learn to say NO.Either make more money or be content with what you have. Invest in your skills/hobbies instead of a fancy lifestyle you cant afford.Are you honest and real with the person that you truly are? Who are you trying to impress, yourself or others? Look at Warren Buffet. He's a billionaire and lives in a modest home, drives his rusty car ,and gets breakfast at McDonalds. If you walked past him you would probably never tell that he is one of the richest men in the world. Thats because his biggest asset is his mind and not his bank account. Find something you are passionate about and stop trying to impress others.And finally family is number one. Your kids dont need to attend the most expensive school and live in the biggest house possible. They need love and attention. They need something to look up to. Yes a man is a provider , but as long as your kids have a roof over their heads and food on the table its gonna be fine. If they get less they get less, people who accomplish biggest feats usually come from poor background because they learn very early what it means to struggle. You get out of life what you put in. Its far more important to have a father in the house than live without financial struggle.The acting was great and i really loved the way filmmakers used Richmond in this movie. There is a heart breaking scene when Allison comes back home after drinking. She desperately wanted to get her life back(horse). Life in New York wasnt perfect, it wasnt without struggle but at least the family was happy.My english is not the best but this movie is very well worth watching.

I was invested to see how it would work out for everybody. I found the acting believable and the setting interesting. There was a looming darkness throughout the film that made me wonder if it would turn into a horror movie. It didn't, it actually doesn't reach any real clue other than that the family is no longer a functioning one after the move.I did miss a bit of credibility on why the wife agreed on moving one more time, even though she seemed smart and capable. I also struggled to believe that these two characters were actually THAT negligent and damaging towards their children even though they seemed loving and invested in them. But that didn't stop me from having a good time seeing this film. Me and my boyfriend turned to each other smiling/laughing quite a few times in disbelief of the characters behavior (in a good way). We enjoyed ourselves seeing the parents we never want to be.",The Nest

Really painted the picture of mental exuastion and despair, as the colors and tone made me sad pretty much the entire time. There were some pionts where your just like ""oh come on"" to the dad, and his ridiculousness sense of denial, and I think the ending was well-played , uneventful is somtimes what is needed. To the people saying it was a whole lotta nothing, yes, but it wasnt necessarily boring nothinness, as the lack of real drama only contributed to the gradual depletion of the characters sanity.",The Nest

128,mholleronsilk,Underrated and under appreciated.,8,29 August 2021,"This is a brilliant piece of cinema, depicting the fallout of familial bliss and the breaking down of the American Dream. In a world full of exclusively sequels, prequels, and remakes, this stands out as an example of fantastic acting, original plot, and cinematic skill. I believe it is being dragged through the mud because people expected something more than that, yes it is slow but if you allow yourself to sink into it is amazingly gripping.",The Nest
129,tinachabot-49877,"As real as it gets, finally an amazing drama.",10,20 December 2020,"Finally something that touches you in every way. So many feels with this one. Tension, pain, worry, irritation. I fell in love with the main actress in this movie, she is incredible. Jude Law is always great at playing a Peter Pan type of character that resists maturing, much like his character in Talented Mister Ripley. I feel that the parts in this movie that touched me the most was the relationship that the wife had with her horse. I watched this movie twice and both times I saw something new. It is the best movie I have seen in a long time if you are someone that likes to see the how deeply flawed many of us are in an age that we lose touch with what really matters and forget that we never heal externally but only internally. I believe that the wife was so much more aware of what life really means than the husband. But without giving anything away, I will say I liked the movie all the way through to the end, feeling that on some level, that the end of this movie, maybe marked the beginning of transformation for the family that was involved. Great movie!",The Nest

136,mihaigurei,Jude Law and some horsing around,4,19 November 2020,The cinematic landscape must be really boring if a big name such as Jude Law would choose to act in a such a waste of time (for the cast and viewers) and money (especially for the producers). Why this movie was even made? What was the reasoning behind? Target audience? The director seems to lost his touch since the rather good debut Martha Marcy May Marlene. The characters are behaving in random manner in a very obvious timeline of events. It's impossible to relate to any of their decisions because we cannot understand and emphatize with them. And what about that horse? What happened with him? What about the scene at the end? What is happening there? Anyhow it is pretty hard to see the details because of the poorly lit scenes. Did they spent all the money on the rental of the huge (and pointless) manor? A positive mention would go to Carrie Coon that look (when one can see her) absolutely gorgeous in this movie.,The Nest

143,jasondbecker,Mesmerizing,9,8 June 2021,"This is reminiscent of Ordinary People although there a death is the catalyst for the breakdown of the family unit. Here it's the father's (Jude Law) greed and a move to the UK to feed it.It's really hard to fit this movie into a genre - it's almost like a horror movie but nothing supernatural happens. Domestic Horror?Carrie Coon isn't quite a household name yet but she is one of the most talented actresses working right now and she gives a terrific performance. Jude Law is good as well.This is an authentic, well-acted, well-directed mature film. Those that are impatient probably will bail on it but every scene and bit of dialogue contributes to responses from the characters that are at once recognizable and real. Terrific filmmaking.I've seen some reviews that say they didn't like the ending. I won't spoil it but I thought it was great. A straightforward recognition of what led to their current predicament. This movie is so relevant to today's mentality of get rick quick schemes and pursuit of money/fame/power instead of what's important
(knowing what's enough to be happy). All told it is a bit of a morality play but it doesn't hit you on the head with it - the filmmaker hopes that you'll come to that conclusion on your own.",The Nest

Pretty good camera work that builds this weird ghostly and sometimes even horror-esque atmosphere. There's a lot of tension in this movie, mostly emotional and here is my biggest, and probably only, problem - that tension is never really resolved or fully blown. It seems that all of characters anger, ups and (mostly) downs went for nothing so in the end all of that sadly makes this movie an easily forgettable one.
