0,Leofwine_draca,A surprisingly hollow experience,4,18 April 2017,"THE NEON DEMON sees Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn coming a cropper with a spare, stylish, thinly-plotted horror movie set in the world of modelling in Los Angeles. It's as slow-paced and stylish as his previous movies DRIVE and ONLY GOD FORGIVES, featuring a funky soundtrack, lots of powerful colour in the visuals, and scenes that go on a little while too long.It's also over-obvious and predictable, being nothing more than a twist on an old-fashioned vampire-style story that goes back hundreds of years. For the first time in a Refn film, I found myself counting the minutes that passed, aware of a growing sense of boredom rather than unease. The film takes ages and ages just to get anywhere, and it only shocks and provokes right at the climax. Up until that point, we get stuck with Elle Fanning's bland lead, some typically bitchy supporting characters, and a whole lot of emptiness. I found it rather vapid, although tastes may vary. Refn tries too hard to make something unique and arty and instead makes something predictable and empty; for a true slice of weirdness you need to go to Europe and check out something in the style of DER FAN or SUSPIRIA instead.",The Neon Demon
1,SnoopyStyle,surreal static style,5,16 December 2016,"Naive small-town sixteen-year-old Jesse (Elle Fanning) is new to Los Angeles. She starts work as a model. Makeup artist Ruby (Jena Malone) brings her to a club where she's introduced to other models Sarah (Abbey Lee) and Gigi (Bella Heathcote). Roberta Hoffman (Christina Hendricks) signs her and sets her up with photographer Jack McCarther (Desmond Harrington). Roberta gets her to lie that she's 19. She goes on a date with Dean and returns to find a mountain lion in her motel room. Mikey and night manager Hank (Keanu Reeves) go and see the cat in the room.Director Nicolas Winding Refn's surreal static style can leave a movie feeling slow. His movies can feel more style over substance. I like his previous movie because Ryan Gosling and the extreme violence kept my interest. Fanning has the required beautiful innocence but she doesn't keep my interest. I want this to be a horror movie but its deliberate visuals take away the intensity. There is no tension and I'm left with a beautiful empty mystery which I'm only partially interested in. In the end, I'm more bored than compelled.",The Neon Demon
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Beauty is a beast, but this film is neither",4,30 April 2017,"""The Neon Demon"" is a co-production in the English language between the United States, France and Denmark and the latter is because the director is Nicolas Winding Refn, maybe Denmark's second most known and second most controversial behind Lars von Trier of course. The movie here runs for almost 120 minutes and stars Elle Fanning playing the central character. Familiar faces like Malone, Reeves, Hendricks and Harrington (to ""Dexter"" fans) appear in supporting roles. But this film is at no point about the performances unfortunately. You can very easily structure it into two parts. The first is the audience being introduced to the modeling business at the same time the central character is introduced. We basically experience everything related to this tough business together with Fanning's character. Unfortunately, nonetheless it is never a good or interesting depiction of events and circumstances. It is really much more on the level of a generic soap opera. We witness almost every female character being jealous of Jesse or exploiting her magnificent looks. And the men all either want her or want to turn her into a star. And so we won't forget how amazing she looks we have scenes like the first one with Harrington or the one with Nivola or the one with Hendricks which are all basically the same. They show us how tough they are by ignoring or sending out less brilliant models, but they all love our ""heroine"". As if we would not see ourselves how amazing Fanning looks in here with that pale blonde (almost princess-like) appearance. Admittedly she is not 100% more stunning than the other models/actresses, even if the film wants us to believe she is.Then the second half. And people who have seen other works by NWR maybe already expect what is about to come, namely the possibly most pretentious movie hour of the year 2016. It is a collection of shots that were intended to be stylish and admittedly some are, but others also not so much. Light and color are in the center of it all, but the action and the plot certainly aren't. It's basically like watching a catalog of photos, maybe videos, made during a session. Yes there is a major event happening towards the end and it is a bit on the brave side admittedly in terms of the script, but it just isn't enough to be honest and there is also not really any justification for the blood lust in here towards the end. Envy and hurt feelings / rejection alone won't cut the cake. So it needs to be said that the ways in which this film tries to work as a character study or as an elaboration on the modeling world are not successful at all. Not even close. The only approach where the film is somewhat successful is seeing it as a(n admittedly really absurd) fantasy story of over-the-top characters. I cannot take it seriously as a thriller or drama or horror film. Then again, maybe you can see it as a splatter horror of some kind with all the stuff that happens in the last 20 minutes. Final verdict though is that this one is totally close to one star out of five and giving it two is still fairly on the generous side. It shows that Nicolas Winding Refn is obviously far far away from his career-best. Highly not recommended and way too long for its own good too. Final note: It's quite a shame an actually really talented actress like Elle Fanning, in my opinion among the most gifted from her generation, is wasted like this here being basically nothing but a doll, despite having the screen time to really make a difference. That's a definition of bad writing.",The Neon Demon
3,claudio_carvalho,Another Overrated and Boring Film by Nicolas Winding Refn,3,2 September 2016,"The sixteen year-old aspiring model Jesse (Elle Fanning) arrives in Los Angeles expecting to be a successful model. The aspirant photographer Dean (Karl Glusman) takes photos for her portfolio and dates her. Jesse befriends the lesbian makeup artist Ruby (Jena Malone) and then the envious models Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee) in a party. Meanwhile the agency considers Jesse beautiful with a ""thing"" that makes her different and she is sent to the professional photographer Jack (Desmond Harrington). Jesse attracts the attention of the industry and has a successful beginning of career. But Ruby, Gigi and Sarah are capable to do anything to get her ""thing"". ""The Neon Demon"" is another overrated and boring film by Nicolas Winding Refn. This filmmaker is specialist in making shallow films with beautiful cinematography. The long and annoying ""The Neon Demon"" is no exception. The storyline is ""naive aspiring model goes to LA and is devoured by the system"" is disclosed along 1h 58 minutes running time. Elle Fanning is not a beautiful teenager to justify the hype from the industry; therefore her character has ""a thing"" to explain her success for simple mortals like most of the viewers. The most impressive are the positive reviews and the conclusion might be the following: Nicolas Winding Refn is a darling of the cinema industry; or Nicolas Winding Refn has a strong team of people to write positive and overrated reviews of his films in IMDb. The fake horror genre misleads the viewers and fans of the genre. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Demônio de Neon"" (""Neon Demon"")",The Neon Demon
4,nogodnomasters,Beauty isn't everything. It is the only thing.,6,15 October 2017,"Jesse (Elle Fanning) an under-aged waif comes to LA to model. She is aided by Ruby (Jena Malone) the make-up girl to go to the top. Everyone loves the overly pale Jesse who ""has that thing."" She is ""a diamond in a sea of glass."" She stays in a sleazy motel which provides a few WTF moments, with Keanu Reeves playing the motel owner. Jesse claims she ""is not as helpless as she looks"" and the film turns weird after an hour or so and continues to go down a path until you don't have closure. Okay. It's a metaphor.The film seems to be making a statement about the fashion industry and 15 minutes of fame every nubile gets until they turn 20-ish and there is always one coming along, same as the old one. They used real models as extras. I could have gone four stars had they cast Susan Dey (is she still alive?) as the casting director. I think that would have made for a stronger message. Listed as a ""horror"" film and that is a bit of a stretch until the last 10-15 minutes.Guide: F-word. nudity. necrophilia.",The Neon Demon
5,kosmasp,Beauty and the Beast/Demon,9,23 February 2017,"Is innocence the pure beauty? And what would happen to that Beauty once the innocence was gone? And how do you measure Beauty or innocence for that matter, anyway? Who is to say, which of many many models who are trying their luck, is the ""best""? Who actually ""deserves"" to be a top star? These are just a couple of questions that are not spoken out in the movie. But they linger in the air.They linger there with dread, as is the mood of the movie. And while many rush to belittle the movie by just looking at the obvious (style), they might be missing the points Refn is making. But then again, his movies are never easy to digest are they? And one that has been described as horror, because of certain scenes is not different. The movie may have despicable characters, but it also has a foundation and something to say. So while I do not agree by many things that are being done here, I was mesmerized. And yes there is a different dimension within this ...",The Neon Demon
6,gavin6942,Not Your Typical Horror Thriller,7,19 September 2016,"When aspiring model Jesse (Elle Fanning) moves to Los Angeles, her youth and vitality are devoured by a group of beauty-obsessed women who will take any means necessary to get what she has.Although classified as a ""horror thriller"", this categorization might throw potential viewers off. The horror elements are relatively few and far between, and the thrills are rather subtle. This is not to say the film is in any way a bad picture, simply that it defies conventional categories.The plot is nothing spectacularly new. In the last few years, we have seen films about the dangers of beauty and fame with Debbie Rochon's ""Model Hunger"" (which has some coincidental parallels) and ""Starry Eyes"". But ""Neon Demon"" is very much about a certain look and atmosphere and not so much about any deep, well-crafted plot or character development.At almost two hours, the film is paced in a more casual way, and this easily fits into what we call the ""slow burn"". Those seeking action and excitement will be bored, so please enter with the proper mindset. Instead of action, we are sumptuously provided with a feast of color, neon that can only be compared to ""Death Spa"" or perhaps ""Inherent Vice"". This rarity of color is even more striking given that the director claims to be color blind.The overall tone is weird, or as some have termed it ""alien"". You can never put your finger on it, but something is off, which (for me) makes it all the more appealing. Today the term ""Lynchian"" is criminally abused and overused, but it may be apt here: I kept thinking this was a perfect companion for ""Mulholland Drive"", though I would be hard-pressed to actually explain why.The music is electronic, occasionally atonal. This is a growing trend that I hope continues to grow. Artists like Diasterpiece (""It Follows"") have picked up the mantle left behind by John Carpenter, Tangerine Dream and others. In this case, the music is even more jarring than ever before and really takes on a life of its own.Elle Fanning is incredible, and she is quickly overshadowing her sister. Perhaps it is not fair to compare the two, but it seems inevitable. Keanu Reeves is very reserved, which is quite refreshing. His name may suggest an ""over the top"" approach, but that is far from the case here. And special mention must be made of Jena Malone, who is perhaps one of the top actresses in the business today (though her scenes seem to keep getting cut from films). Malone delivers what is likely to be the most disturbing love scene of her career, but given her propensity for strange films, you never know.Broad Green Pictures is releasing the film on blu-ray on September 27. It is a must-see and probably only gains in power upon repeat viewings. The disc includes an audio commentary with Fanning and the director.",The Neon Demon
7,jboothmillard,The Neon Demon,5,4 November 2019,"I remember seeing the poster for this movie, it had a terrific use of colour, and it reminded me of a classic 80s or 90s poster, I was most interested to see the film as well, directed by Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson, Drive, Only God Forgives). Basically, following the death of her parents, sixteen-year-old aspiring model Jesse (Maleficent's Elle Fanning, Dakota's sister) has relocated from small-town Georgia to Los Angeles. She meets photographer Dean (Karl Glusman), who does her first shoot, and makeup artist Ruby (Jena Malone), who introduces fellow models Sarah (Abbey Lee) and Gigi (Bella Heathcote). The three women are intrigued by Jesse's natural beauty and curious about her sexuality and experience. Jesse is signed by modeling agency owner Roberta Hoffman (Christina Hendricks), who tells her to pretend she is nineteen and refers her to a test shoot with notable photographer Jack McCarther (Desmond Harrington). Jesse goes on a date with Dean but holds back on his advances. Jesse is staying in a motel, owned by the lecherous Hank (Keanu Reeves), and one night she is shocked to find her room ransacked and occupied by a mountain lion. Jesse is extremely nervous undressing for the photo shoot with Jack, who covers her naked body in gold paint. The shoot is successful, and Gigi and Sarah begin envying Jesse's youth, while Ruby is fascinated with her. Jesse goes to a casting call for fashion designer Robert Sarno (Jurassic Park III's Alessandro Nivola), where Sarah is also present. He pays no attention to Sarah but is entranced by Jesse. Sarah is distraught and asks Jesse how it feels to be the one everyone admires. Jesse replies, ""It's everything"". Sarah lunges toward her, and Jesse accidentally cuts her hand on glass. Sarah immediately sucks the blood from Jesse's hand. Jesse returns to her motel and faints, having strange vision, and Dean arrives to treat her wounds. At Sarno's fashion show, Gigi tells Jesse about all the cosmetic surgery she has had done and cannot believe that Jesse has not used casting couches to achieve success. As Jesse is closing the show, she sees a vision of the glowing triangle she saw before in her hallucination. After the show, a visibly changed Jesse goes out with Dean to a bar. There, Sarno criticises surgically enhanced women, referring to a humiliated Gigi, and he praises Jesse's natural looks. Jesse is now displaying a narcissistic new persona and rejects Dean when he tries to convince her to leave with him. Jesse has a nightmare of being forced by Hank to sexually swallow a knife. After waking from this nightmare, Jesse is terrified by an attempted intruder, the stranger leaves her door and instead assaults the female occupant next door. Jesse calls Ruby to come over. After calming her down, Ruby tries to initiate sex with her, but Jesse rejects her, revealing herself to be a virgin. Ruby draws a lipstick face on Jesse's mirror, and leaves for her second job as a makeup artist at a morgue. There she satisfies her urges and pleasures herself with a female corpse. Ruby returns home and finds Jesse now unabashed in her narcissism. Sarah and Gigi appear at the house, and attack Jesse. Gigi chases her with a butcher knife, while Sarah pursues her with a fire-poker. Jesse is cornered outside by the three women, and Ruby pushes her into an empty swimming pool, breaking her leg. As Jesse lies helpless, the three women approach her with knives. After they butcher Jesse and consume parts of her body, Ruby bathes in a bathtub of her blood, while Sarah and Gigi wash themselves with it in the shower. Later, Ruby, who is revealed to have occult tattoos on her abdomen, sprays the sidewalk with Jesse's blood. She lies in Jesse's unmarked grave, and later, nude in her living room, a torrent of blood gushes from her genitals. The next day, Sarah drives Gigi along the Pacific Coast Highway to one of Jack's photoshoots. Jack sees Sarah in the living room, enthralled he fires another model on the spot. During the shoot, Gigi feels ill and leaves. Sarah watches Gigi regurgitate one of Jesse's eyeballs. She screams with regret, ""I need to get her out of me"" and stabs herself with a pair of scissors. Sarah watches Gigi die and eats the eyeball and returns to the photoshoot. It ends with a woman, who does not show her face walking alone in the Mojave Desert (it could be Sarah). Also starring Charles Baker as Mikey. Fanning gives a good performance as the initially nervous and slowly turned young beauty, Malone, Hendricks and the other actresses also do well as the fellow models who have daggers for the leading character. The title of the film is not really explained, I guess it has something to with the use of colour, which is fantastically vibrant. This could be a seen as satire of the fashion industry, the scary elements include the themes of deadly jealousy, cannibalism and necrophilia, it is visually impressive, even the graphic material, and the trippy electronic score by Cliff Martinez is brilliant, a stylish and interesting psychological horror. Worth watching!",The Neon Demon
8,Tweekums,A film that does for modelling what 'Black Swan' did for ballet,8,2 July 2017,"Sixteen year old Jesse has made her way to Los Angeles where she aspires to become a model. Here she meet photographer Dean and makeup artist Ruby, who befriends her and introduces her to models Gigi and Sarah. Jesse is quickly snapped up by a modelling agency what thinks she could be the next 'Thing'. Inevitably other models are jealous of her natural looks and the rapid success. Things quickly turn strange; she returns to her motel room and discovers that there is a mountain lion inside! She gains confidence as she gets more work and clearly believes the adage of a designer that 'beauty isn't the most important thing about a person that matters it is the only thing'. As the end approaches it becomes apparent that not everybody she trusts is good for her and that those jealous of her really do want a piece of her!Having watched writer/director Nicolas Winding Refn's earlier film 'Drive' I was rather expecting something disturbing. This film didn't disturb me as much as 'Drive' but it shocked me more there were a few things that I really wasn't expecting such as Ruby getting intimate with a corpse after being spurned by Jesse and Jesse's ultimate fate. The cast does a fine job; Elle Fanning manages to make Jesse simultaneously vulnerable and confident. Jena Malone is equally impressive as Ruby; a character who initially appears to be the most normal character but proves to be anything but. Other cast members, including Keanu Reeves acting against type as the creepy motel manager, also impress. The story is intriguing as it gradually changes from a believable look at a young aspiring models first steps in the industry into a disturbing horror. This is hinted at early on in Jesse's first photoshoot. The story is very stylishly filmed, almost echoing the unreality of a photoshoot, something I found really effective. Over all I'd say this certainly won't be for everybody but if you enjoyed films like 'Black Swan' I suspect you will enjoy this.",The Neon Demon
9,LeonLouisRicci,"Vibrating On its Own ""Dangerous"" Frequency",8,21 October 2016,"A Horror Film by Title and Motivation but it is so Layered on Top with Gorgeous Models, Striking Color, Vibrant and Pulsating Images, and a Bizarrely Numbing Tone, that the Horror which is Horrifying to be sure, is almost Incidental and Covered Up.It is Covered Up with something akin to Graveyard Dirt, a Dense Layer that gets in the Last Word.

11,neil-476,"Utter drivel and, what's worse, boring drivel.",2,5 August 2016,"This film starts promisingly with an eye-catching and unsettling image: then the first dialogue (or should I say ""direlogue""?) scene starts, and two things happen. One, the dialogue is awful. Two, the instruction in Acting 101 ""Make the most of your pauses"" has been translated here into ""Leave 5 seconds silence before replying to anything which has been said."" The self-consciously clever-dick direction, at its worst, leads to an interminable sequence which is supposed to represent a catwalk show in which nothing happens (and it doesn't happen repetitively, too) for what seems to be half a day. Refn thinks he is being clever in his direction: he isn't.The first 80% of the story is trite and obvious: the final sequence is ludicrous. Refn again. Perhaps it's supposed to be a metaphor or some sort of metaphysical commentary. It's still ludicrous.Lesbian necrophilia and cannibalism?

12,FlashCallahan,Status will consume you.....,10,5 September 2016,"An aspiring 16-year-old model moves to Los Angeles, where she quickly finds success after she is discovered by a makeup artist and signed by an agent. However, her beauty also draws the attention of lecherous men, and provokes the jealousy of other women in showbiz......The Neon Demon is one of those films that splits audiences right down the middle. And these are the sort of films that I love. They strike debate, letting others express their opinions on what they loved/hated about the film.I for one think its one of the most striking, beautiful films made in a long time, and for me, it's going to be pretty hard for a film to come to brilliance that Winding Refn has delivered here this year.For me, it's all about the imagery and the attention to detail that pollutes every frame of the film. The use of the titular demon brings a sinister element to the film, as if it turns the film subliminally into a horror film.The film appears to be heavily influenced by the work of Bret Easton Ellis and Dario Argento. The use of colour (especially when Jesse first meets up with Ruby and the rest of the coven) is wonderful, and makes the initial meet up with them quite cold, but inviting for Jesse and of course, us.Whatever you perceive the films message to be, it could be a warning sign for all the potential wannabe models being attracted to the Bright Lights of the Big City, like a fly to those exterminators (hence the title The Neon Demon), and it shows you that if you get in with the wrong crowd, it will literally consume you of all your innocence and all the elements of what made you pure.The cast are wonderful, and Keanu Reeves is wonderful as a ghoulish motel owner.The film definitely isn't for everyone, but it really hit the spot for me. It's definitely eccentric, but like all things that have eccentricities, it begs to be seen, as it gives you something so much different.It's a vibrant masterpiece, with one of the best scores of recent times.Well worth your time.",The Neon Demon
13,zetes,"Terrible script, but the fantastic visuals, music, and all-out craziness of it win out in the end",7,26 June 2016,"Simultaneously one of the best and one of the worst films of the year. Refn is one of the most talented visual directors around, but his writing straight-up stinks. When this movie is silent (or at least just focusing on the images, because it's usually backed by a sweet-ass Cliff Martinez score), it's stunning. The plot is a very lame one about an ingenue (Elle Fanning) who enters the modeling world in L.A. and becomes consumed by its vapidness and competitiveness. I'm honestly not too bothered by the clichés. It's the dialogue that really harms the film. It grinds to a halt anytime anyone opens their mouth, and none of these actors can make Refn's tin-eared dialogue not sound like garbage. The movie gets more and more fun - and more and more disgusting - as it goes on, with the final act descending into really crazy Grand Guignol. My theater even had a walk out! People may whine about the overabundance of crappy sequels that no one wanted and the umpteenth X-Man movie, but I thank God I live in a time when I can watch a woman menstruate torrentially at my local mall cinema.",The Neon Demon
14,trashgang,failed story wise,7,5 September 2016,"Have seen Drive (2011) from the same director which I found a surprising good flick with excellent shots and score. When the promotion started for The Neon Demon I wanted to see it as quick as possible because it was stated as a horror thriller but once it came out it was booed at a lot of festivals and the reviews weren't that good after all. In the theaters over here it only played one week is I couldn't attend it but it did said one thing, controversial again. Now that it is finally out it was time to pick it up. On part of the way it was shot and directed Nicolas Winding Refn did another excellent job and the way he used the lighting it remembered me of those Giallo's made by Dario Argenta in some way. The score is also one great thing to hear but to say that I liked it like drive I must answer in a negative way. This isn't a horror after all let's even say a thriller. It's only at the last minutes that the real blood and eventually some horror comes in but even that was shot in an arty way. It's a slow mover but I don't mind that, the performance were above mediocre but it's the story itself that is a bit weak. We all know about jealousy at the fashion parade and that's the main story here. Somehow the story failed and even I lost my view towards the screen watching the clock. The flick tales two hours to watch, maybe too long and made in the wrong era. If this was made in the eighties it would deliver, remember Body Double (1984) or The Hunger (1983), sadly it's low on so many things for nowadays norms but still it can shock some viewers with the nudity shots.

15,christopher-underwood,Essential cinema.,10,13 July 2016,"(Re-write 17/7/20) So beautiful to look at, so dangerously attractive, so hypnotic a combination of picture and sound, that we are drawn, willingly or unwillingly, into a world we at once long to be a part of but also dread. This is a meticulously constructed film concerning the nature of beauty and its affect upon both the watcher and the watched, which includes those who want to be watched. Beauty as anyone will tell you is in the eye of the beholder, so we can all sit back and relax as each expounds upon the look of this building, that painting, this old lady and that pet animal. But is there a beauty, a beauty that is so profound and so indisputable that its very existence makes it vulnerable? Is fragility an important element of beauty, or are we straying into the area of youth and (presumed) innocence? Director, Nicolas Winding Refn, who has made a modest number of very different films, seems not to have set out here to make a genre film, although this could easily pass as a 'horror', so visceral and frightening so many of the scenes are. Instead it would appear that he is more interested in the universal acceptance of beauty in a young girl. This is dangerous ground indeed but Refn has warned us with an emphasis upon the child lying about her age before her fashion shoots so we should be prepared and yet we are still seduced. We cannot help ourselves and can understand that others in competition might go so far. The beautiful young thing is all anyone can see. Spellbound and caught in a dream of young flesh we share the horrific but inevitable lurch towards possession and vampire like absorption so that we might too take on this perfect state. My feeling is that Refn has successfully made a film that, whilst being intensely seductive, is also a warning of the terrifying consequences of allowing youngsters to be destroyed in the name of 'fashion'. There is also more than a hint that with the associated hierarchy being non heterosexual, matters might be made even worse, but I shall not allow myself to be seduced down that particular path. Great film by the way!",The Neon Demon
16,lasttimeisaw,from auteur to provocateur,8,9 November 2016,"Danish taste-maker Nicolas Winding Refn's tenth feature film, THE NEON DEMON premiered in Cannes earlier this year as an entree of the main competition and was met with mostly negative feedback, which inveighs against Refn's self-indulgence in his aesthetic choice and flagrantly macabre themes, it is the second time, Refn's work has been booed in Cannes, the previous misadventure is ONLY GOD FORGIVES (2013), so he seems to stride on the same auteur-to- provocateur path preceded by his compatriot Lars von Triers. The film starts as a conventional tale about a parentless,16-year-old girl Jesse (Fanning) from Georgia, comes to L.A. in pursuit a modeling career, stays in a scruffy motel run by an objectionable manager Hank (Reeves). She befriends an amateur photographer Dean (Glusman), who takes her first photo-shoot in the prescient opening scene. Jesse is approached by the makeup artist Ruby (Malone), whose first-line is ""you have beautiful skin"", and later they go to a party, Jesse is introduced to two stuck-up professional models Sarah (Lee) and Gigi (Heathcote), who take her for granted being a wide-eyed rookie, but Jesse is born to be the cynosure, and Ruby knows it (with an ulterior motivation). What Refn hammers home here is Jesse's youthful, ""it"" girl, star-on-the-horizon quality, which might sound like an overstatement, but effectively channels Fanning to bring about a resolute personality transmutation from an unworldly next-door-girl to a paragon of narcissist garnished by haute couture and skin-deep make-up. But things turn perilous and hallucinating pretty soon, a panther surreally appears in her motel room, a neon-lit triangle motif repeatedly invades her dreams, peer pressure starts to encroach her unwarranted success where jealousy and intimidation lurks around, and her relationship with Dean also hits a dead end after she is chosen to close the show of celebrated fashion designer Robert Sarno (Nivola, uncredited in a facile character), where she finalizes her a-phoenix-is-born rite-of- passage under the trippy delirium of a triangle prism. At that point, she achieves what she always wants, but what distinguishes her from the rest bevy of young girls? Her unsullied countenance, her physical pliability, or her unfeigned rawness? In a business entrenched in immediate and eye- pleasing attractiveness, the strain of perpetually in danger of being sidelined, is so deleteriously consuming, it poisons one's body, twists one's psyche, and pervert one's impulse, what happens next is a startling manifestation of Refn's polemic on that business, a friend-in-need call to Ruby, will invite Jesse to a sepulchral residence, and fall prey of cannibalistic predators who are coveting her success, where lesbianism, slasher, gore, occultism and necrophilia altogether served to shock and provoke. Not everyone can stomach all the perversity on the face value, which certainly explains the polarized reactions and its limited box-office potential, but if you can overcome the knee-jerking uneasiness, the picture will eventually emerge itself as a visually-striking, conceptually-challenging treatise taking no prisoners in disclosing what an insider must endure in face of this cut-throat line- of-job, and further tees off on its superficial, pernicious viewpoint in regard to the whole human society and gender politics, although, if Refn can temper its female-skewing emphasis with a dash of male involvement (some comeuppance should have justly befallen to those heartless snobs with a middle leg too), the film itself could be shaped into a more well-grounded equilibrium. Fanning's strong presence aside, Jena Malone, Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee all give transfixing turns in this mythic horror, Heathcote's Gigi is a surgery-altered commodity, an icy facade yet inwardly she is the weakest after ingesting something she shouldn't; Malone leaves us flabbergasted in her bold move when moonlighting in the morgue, she has the most tactile sexual urge among all the characters, yet, she also retains a mist of impenetrability which is uncannily vampiric. But the most incredible work is achieved by Lee, the former Victoria's Secret model, her Sarah is unpicked to be starkly alien both in her make-up free states and in the final sequences, a robotic being with a futuristic get-up, a slinky figure projects that bone-chilling gaze, resembles a soulless husk of human, why would anyone be willing to get to that point is perplexing, but THE NEON DEMON itself is an unconventional cautionary tale unabashedly suckles on Nicolas Winding Refn's colorblind disposition to thrives with glossy, variegated sheen, its content is not wholly salutary, but tantalisingly panders to those who always keep an open mind to something idiosyncratic and contentious.",The Neon Demon
17,KineticSeoul,"Sort of reminded me of the Korean film ""Beautiful"" except more Nicolas Winding Refn",8,31 August 2016,"Nicolas Winding Refn is a director that films things that HE want to see on screen instead of just focusing on what the mainstream viewers would want to see. And I give the guy some props for that, which is one of reasons why I like the way Gareth Evans directs his films. The two directors seems to have very different taste, with one focusing on the artistic side of thing while the other focuses in on the action. Nicolas Winding Refn is a director that likes to show it instead of relying heavily on the dialogue. And it really shows in this film and his previous films as well. The imagery, the symbolic colors, the music, the cinematography in general which includes the subtle details makes this film stand out. This film delves upon what the power of beauty, vanity and narcissism has upon the world and how success and the environment can change people. The consumption of beauty and the dog eat dog side of things when it comes to the modeling and entertainment business. Where jealousy, envy and backstabbing run amok. The Metaphor and foreshadowing is done really well in this. Which makes the 3rd act which brings about the shock factors that can elicit reactions from the viewers which is something Nicolas Winding Refn was aiming for. This film sort of reminded me of the Korean film ""Beautiful"" which came out in 2008 except more Nicolas Winding Refn which isn't a bad thing. I wouldn't be shocked if he was inspired by that film. Overall, if you like art-house films that uses the imagery to tell the story, you just might enjoy this one. Also check out the Korean film ""Beautiful"" which is a really standout film with a message. And is equally as haunting. This is suppose to be a artistic horror movie that revolves around girls. It's like watching a glossy music video that leaves a bad after-taste at the end. And I think that was Refn's intention. Although it isn't all that scary, but it is disturbing and to a certain extent it's impactful.8/10",The Neon Demon
18,Hellmant,One of the most memorable films I've probably ever seen!,10,5 October 2016,"'NEON DEMON': Five Stars (Out of Five)Nicolas Winding Refn's newest masterpiece, about a young aspiring model trying to make it in L.A.'s blood thirsty modeling world. Refn directed and co-wrote the movie; with Mary Laws and Polly Stenham. It stars Elle Fanning, Jena Malone, Bella Heathcote, Abbey Lee, Karl Glusman, Christina Hendricks, Desmond Harrington, Alessandro Nivola and Keanu Reeves. The film received very polarizing reviews from critics (like nearly all of Refn's movies do), and it was a bomb at the Box Office (also like nearly all of his other films). I loved it!16-year-old Jesse (Fanning) moves to Los Angeles with dreams of becoming a famous model. Her parents passed away, and she's having to make it in the big city alone. Once there, she meets an aspiring photographer, named Dean (Glusman), who takes pictures of her, for her portfolio, and begins to date her. Everyone Jesse meets sees something special in her (in her appearance that is), and she has no problems getting modeling gigs. This causes a lot of jealousy among the other models, which makes it a very dangerous business for Jesse to fit into. As the film shows us, the modeling world is extremely cutthroat; and people will eat each other alive just to make it (figuratively, and perhaps literally). The movie, like all of Refn's films, is definitely not for everyone; it's the type of flick that most people will either love or hate (that's why it's reviews are so polarizing). I loved it. It's definitely disturbing, gross, messed up, bizarre, and completely insane; but I love all of those things (in movies, that is). It's stylistically awesome; and it's filled with mesmerizing visuals, and an awesome soundtrack (which is very nostalgic, 80s sounding electronic music). The film is reminiscent of David Lynch's 80's work (but better); and it also feels like a much darker (and more messed up) 'BLACK SWAN' (but better). The movie also has great (and very insightful) commentary on the looks obsessed society we all live in; which is a topic I'm very much interested in (having always been made fun of for my unique appearance). It's something that a lot of people deny, but nearly everyone is guilty of (either in a knowing, or unconscious way). I don't buy that Elle Fanning is the most beautiful woman around (she's not my type, besides the fact that she's way too young), but she plays the part well. Jena Malone, Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee are all scene-stealers though; and I read that Malone helped Refn improvise a lot of the film, including one really messed up sex scene. Of course Refn's direction, and his co-written script, are masterful as well. It's one of the most memorable films I've probably ever seen!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/MPT8bbqblmM",The Neon Demon
19,thesar-2,All About Evil,1,5 September 2016,"I have no one to blame but myself for wasting two hours of my life after I found out this was directed by the slowest, style-over-substance and shitty Nicolas Winding Refn.His kind of movies move at a snail's pace and it's no wonder since there are about 2 pages of actual story in his ""screenplays."" I understand he's one of those love him/hate him kinds of ""filmmakers,"" like Terrence Malick and I definitely fall in the latter halffor both.I don't mind a slow-burner so much, as long as there's something behind the scenes. Something to build upon, some sense of reality, someone to root for. Here we have incredibly terrible people – all of them, doing incredibly blasphemous stuff for, I'm guessing, the sake of art? Get ready for it (and yeah, this is spoiler-territory, but I have a feeling you'll thank me instead of criticizing me): here, in the meek ""script,"" you'll be served up necrophilia, cannibalism and an unhealthy amount of pedophilia. A pretty girl – not gorgeous, not a supermodel and not goddess-like as they constantly tell us, is getting her immediate break in the L.A. fashion industry. Others are jealous. She seems innocent, but lives up to the movie's title. Oh, and she's 16, but that's okay for all the adults wanting to seduce, kiss, see her naked and make love to her. Really, that, plus a bunch of random artistic and nail-biting deliberate scenes make up the rest of the incredible two-hour run time. What makes a Nicolas Winding Refn ""experience"" so frustrating, is that it's so pompous. It's like being in an art gallery and telling your friend you don't like the train wreck painting you're trying to look away from. Immediately, your friend's clichéd response is ""Well, you just don't get it! It's aaaaarrrrrrt!""Well, I do get it. I got the whole movie. It just felt as hollow as the characters they're portraying. And funny enough, it's labelled as a ""horror."" Not really. I mean, horrible stuff happens, but it's like watching the downward spiral of the U.S. thanks to the political season we're currently in and calling that ""horror"" as well.OK, fine. It did remind me a bit of Suspiria in mood and ugly women doing bad things, but without witchcraft. Oh, and sure, you might find them attractive here, but they are so wooden, one-dimensional and horrible individuals, they are absolutely ugly to me. Not to mention, they all look so similar, it was increasingly hard to tell who was who, including our ""heroine."" I imagine if you liked his other slow-ass films, you'd be one of those ""But, it's aaaaarrrrrrt!"" people and like this. Fine. To each their own. I just appreciate cinema that's not just a 2-hour screensaver.***Final thoughts: Drive wasn't terrible, but Only God Forgives and this crap was. I just can't take anymore NWR. Mercifully, this one didn't star NWR (I'm tired of writing his self-important name out) regular and highly arrogant partner, Ryan Gosling. Definitely no room in here for him, but I doubt even he and his big head could save this travesty.",The Neon Demon
20,FeastMode,my notes,3,30 June 2019,"Cool style and tone. was interesting for a while. but as the movie went along, it became obvious that this was another prime example of style over substance. the entire basis of this movie was the style, and there was almost no substance. there is a bunch of stuff that is supposed to shock you, but it's only there for that purpose. this movie is just really weird, and not in a good way. halfway through the movie i still had no idea what it was about or what was really happening. i liked drive, i hated only god forgives, and i hated this almost as much.

21,richardchatten,Young and Thin,5,8 November 2019,Rather obviously patterned after 'Mullholland Dr.' with added necrophilia.

22,bowmanblue,I obviously didn't get it,4,25 July 2017,"Sometimes when I watch a film and totally dislike it, I feel really bad. 'The Neon Demon' is one such example. I've checked out other people's reviews and there are those out there who clearly loved it. And I can see why. It's visually amazingly and disturbingly creepy. And yet I still found it a chore to sit through. In short I found it dull.It's about a young girl getting into the seedy underbelly of the modelling industry and encountering the sleazy men who dominate it and the catty women who already exist in it. I know a deliberately slow pace can be used to great effect in order to create tension, mood and atmosphere. However, as I said above, I just wanted something to come along and 'properly' move the story along.So, I sat through it and berated myself for not liking it more. It's very tempting to have a go at modern cinema audiences for only wanting 'simple' films with plots that involve car chases, punch-ups and a damsel in distress. I like to think my taste does incorporate a little more than the next Michael Bay disaster film. However, there are times when a more 'linier' story is needed. I felt that this is one of those times. And, it's a shame. I'll say again how much I enjoyed watching the shots. They truly are well crafted to perfection and intensely creepy. It's just not much happens quickly enough.There are nice moments of satire in the dialogue between the models, but it wasn't enough for me. Basically, if you're thinking of watching this, you need to be aware that it's very 'feel' over story. It's like an 'art movie' where it leaves you to fill in a lot of the action yourself and interpret characters' actions as you will. It does look great though and should be shown to anyone looking to get into film and create artistically-awesome shots which create mood and atmosphere.",The Neon Demon
23,dromasca,beauty and gore,6,21 August 2016,"I liked director Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive. I read it as a love story disguised in a violent action movie, an uneasy combination that worked perfectly, to a large extent thanks to the presence in the lead role of Ryan Gosling, one of my preferred actors. From the same director comes now The Neon Demon a film that confirms the fame of Refn as a director who does not hesitate to create violence on screen in a manner that would almost make Tarantino blush, but yet has always another different message that provides substance to his movies.'The Neon Demon' begins as the innocent-girl-in-LA genre, with Jesse (Elle Fanning) landing in California and finding pretty soon herself engaged on a stellar modeling path. All is due to her looks, she has the charisma and innocence that makes the room light and warm up when she steps in. Her beauty is her strength, but may also become soon her main liability as she becomes a threat to the other beautiful women around and they may fight back by all means. And 'by all means' indeed means 'all means' - we are in the beauty industry, and the demons can be as dark and scary as in a haunted mansion.Much of the rest of the film is in almost pure horror genre. Some will love it, some will hate it, some will exit the screening theater at some point. My impressions are pretty mixed. I am not intimidated by explicit horror or sex on screen, I have seen worse horror in some Korean movies for example, and these actually fall within the logic (or un-logic) of the story. The film is visually striking, with plenty of beautiful video art elements, too many actually, and this is one of the aspects that I did not like. There are so many beautiful filmed scenes and they are so long that at some point the whole experience smells of narcissism. Same about the usage of electronic music. Elle Fanning is an excellent Jesse, beautiful and vulnerable, threatened and threatening. She is actually one almost sure bet for the list of the stars of tomorrow, with no less than 54 roles on record, three for each of the 18 years of her age (her first one was 'Lucy 2 years' in I Am Sam!). Keanu Reeves makes a short appearance, but his fans should not go to this film just to see him. The last 15 minutes of the film put in context all that we have seen until then, but I have seen better endings.'The Neon Demon' is not a film all will like, and it's not easy viewing even for those who will like it. It's worth being seen despite its problems. For dully warned audiences only.",The Neon Demon
24,ThomasDrufke,Diamond Among a Sea of Glass,5,26 June 2016,"Nicolas Winding Refn never fails to bring something gaudy to the big screen. He also tends to bring heavy themes and thought provoking ideas to his films. With The Neon Demon, however, neither one of Refn's aforementioned talents ended up impressing me.I knew absolutely nothing going into this film in terms of its plot. I knew it starred Elle Fanning and it was directed by Refn, so in turn I figured it had to be a thriller of sorts. Right from the opening few scenes, I felt the comparison to David Lynch's masterpiece, Mulholland Drive. Both feature young women moving to Los Angeles with high aspirations of making something of their lives. Both films take a neo-noir-ish approach to L.A.'s landscape making for a rude awakening for each respected main characters.One of the issues I had with The Neon Demon was its tonal choices, particularly in the final act. Now, the opening shot of the film features Fanning covered in blood as she poses for modeling pictures, but the rest of the film went into a more eerie and mysterious direction rather than blood-filled drama. Much like Crimson Peak from last year, the final act takes those smaller bloody elements and turns the entire film into a grotesque take on obsession filled Hollywood.I can certainly appreciate the attempt at creating an unsettling story so that the mistakes of the 3 models and makeup stylist aren't duplicated in real life, but I just thought the tone of the film could have had a more fluid. Something The Neon Demon does very well is complement is visual flare with a brilliant and addicting soundtrack. The electronic sound that composer Cliff Martinez brought to the film was as good if not better than the score he produced for Drive in 2011. Not only does it have tracks I could listen to in my car, but it also has quite a few tracks that gave the film the thrills and horror jumps that make this one unique film going experience.Elle Fanning is also quite good as the lead character, Jesse. She's supposed to play a barely 16-year-old girl with growing confidence that may or may not get her into a little trouble. I couldn't have thought of a better fit for such a character, especially having seen Fanning early in her career, I bought into the innocence of Jesse. Overall, The Neon Demon is a visually impressive and has a little bit to say about obsession and greed, but the inconsistent tone and its overbearing style proved to be too difficult to grapple my interest.+Fanning+Visually appealing+Great score/soundtrack-Tone shifts towards the end-Didn't completely buy into the themes/ideas5.5/10",The Neon Demon

This supposedly minimalist, artistic horror thriller fails capture a sustained and defining moments of horror-filled satiation. A beautifully photographed movie with nicely edited scenes that are enveloped with an ethereal and acoustic soundtrack is eventually let down by a fragmented and mentally tortured ending series of sequences. The director uses elements found in David Lynch's strange weirdness, enhances on the electronic visualization found in Galaxy of Terror (1981), and the strong, solid colorification of the B-Noir Liquid Dreams (1992). Even with the incorporation of a few horror themes usually off-limits in most horror movies really don't sustain the suspense and pacing of the movie. The Neon Demon doesn't rise to Lars von Trier's the sharply photographed Melancholia (2011), the nice cinematography of Walter Salles' Dark Water (2005), or the well-crafted psychological thriller Black Swan (2010). A much better, well-rounded and psychologically themed horror film with a similar tone and deliberate pacing is Scarlett Johannsen performance in Under the Skin (2013).",The Neon Demon
27,Reno-Rangan,"It's not anymore a competitive world, but jealousy!",3,4 November 2016,"It started off very well and in the half mark, it completely lost. In the initial part, it looked like a normal film and then I think even the writer does not know what could happen, they just improvised with whatever they had. Writing was totally messed up. When they had the great characters, it becomes nothing in the end. I'm not a fan of this director, and all his films are average, but this one is the worst among them.I'm not an art film hater, though I hate wasting scenes without any developments and this one had many like them. If you trim them all out, the overall film is around 45 minutes. The rest of the film was just music, colourful lights, and sometimes totally idle, which definitely drag the viewers to the boredom.Whenever there was a scene with the story, like dialogues and developments, I thought it was going well. But then those useless, dialogueless segments turned me off. Especially the conclusion was absolutely crap. Elle was good, like a character made for her. Keanu Reeve was useless, his addition was just a marketing strategy that did not click.This is the story of a teen girl aspiring to be a model, but surrounded by the jealousy people because of her fast growth. How it all goes between them and in the fashion world is what the film talks. The film is watchable, but mostly the second half onwards it gets boring. In the end, I don't think anyone would be satisfied completely with their watch, maybe very, very few, but if you consider the majority, this does not deserve to be suggested.3/10",The Neon Demon
28,sol-,Leaving the door open,7,18 January 2017,"Plagued by strange nightmares, a teenager grows concerned that something is amiss as she tries to make it as a fashion model in this stylish thriller from Nicolas Winding Refn. The film opened to mixed reviews, and between the lurid imagery and self-absorbed characters, it is easy to see why some might not warm to it, but there is a lot of interest here for those willing to bear the film out. A wide-eyed Elle Fanning is perfectly cast in the lead role - in her own words, ""I'm not as helpless as I look"" - and as photographers and fashion moguls constantly praise her natural beauty (versus others with extensive plastic surgery), Fanning credibly transforms from a ""deer in the headlights"" ingénue to a confident and even arrogant young lady. While this results in a hardly pleasant fate, 'The Neon Demon' is a parable first and foremost. A mountain lion that wanders into her motel room early on is a potent metaphor. As the motel proprietor points out, it was her who left the door open for the animal to come in and likewise Fanning's character is undone by letting certain others enter her life. Regardless of whether one gets all the symbolism though, the film makes for a magnificent audiovisual achievement, shot in rich, intense colours with an atmospheric music score. There are some particularly effective sequences where the characters are only illuminated by strobe lighting. Some have criticised the overt horror turn that the movie takes towards the end, but it actually makes perfect sense; the fashion industry does, after all, seem to chew up all new talent and spit them out.",The Neon Demon

It is most certainly for an acquired taste and not for everyone.As the film, well done visuals and the camera angles and set pieces are nice to look at but after a while the story line becomes predictable and cliche. There are some intrigue at first then suddenly flares off a little. There are certainly several bizarre and more disturbing scenes towards the end which stand out.This film isn't perfect, yet isn't completely awful.

30,leonblackwood,Waste of time and money! 2/10,2,10 November 2016,"Review: What a load of rubbish! For a whole 2 hours, the movie is about a group of girls who are jealous of a new model on the scene, Jesse (Elle Fanning), because of her innocent beauty and the fact that she easily moves up the ladder, without having to sleep with anyone. Her vulnerable attitude soon gets noticed by famous photographers and a make- up artist, Ruby (Jena Malone) who also falls for her beauty and charm. Whilst constantly getting abuse from fellow models Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee), Jesse becomes friends with Dean (Karl Glusman) who tries to help her settle in Los Angeles after leaving her small town in New York to become a model. She also has a creepy landlord Hank (Keanu Reeves), so her work and home life is a struggle for poor little Jesse, who finds it hard to feel confident were ever she goes. I understood that part of the movie, which was extremely boring most of the time but the ending was just SO weird. The only interesting scenes was with Keanu Reeves, which didn't go anywhere, and it seemed like the director was only interested in the look of the film, more than the actual plot. There were loads of unnecessary scenes which didn't lead to anything and Elle Fanning was drifting from one scene to the next, with her head in the clouds, which made the film really dull. Anyway, I really didn't get the point of the movie and the script was terrible. Disappointing!Round-Up: It seems like the director, Nicolas Winding Refn, 46, isn't in this business to make money, because a lot of his movies aren't that appealing to a mass audience, judging by his movies takings but he still chooses to stick to the look more than the plot. I was really impressed with Bronson, which made Tom Hardy a star but I didn't see his Pusher trilogy so I can't comment on them. He also directed, the weird, Only God Forgives with Ryan Gosling and Drive, which also Gosling, and was a much better movie. From the beginning of this film, I struggled with the pace and the colour palette, and once the modelling world was introduced, it really did show how cutthroat the business is. The fact that it was based around a vulnerable 16 year old, was quite interesting but the movie went down avenues which took away the interesting elements, which would have made the movie enjoyable. Anyway, I won't be watching it again in a hurry but I'm sure that there are critics that will find it a great piece of art.Budget: $7million Worldwide Gross: $3.3millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/thrillers, starring Elle Fanning, Karl Glusman, Jena Malone, Bella Heathcote, Abbey Lee, Christina Hendricks, Keanu Reeves, Jamie Clayton, Charles Baker and Desmond Harrington. 2/10",The Neon Demon

I've watched the red band trailer for this film about twice a day (seriously, no joke!), the music, the mood, the mystery, the god damn cinematography...and that's just the trailer. Does the film live up to the trailer? Yes, an overwhelming yes! Never have I seen a film so hypnotising, so psychologically disturbing and so jaw-dropping. Elle Fanning gives the performance of her career, Jena Malone gives the performance of her career, heck everyone does. The cinematography is gorgeous, the shots are just effortless and the visuals used throughout the film are so entrancing. The soundtrack is straight up my kind of soundtrack (it's so good, I've already downloaded it), electronic/trance tracks that match the psychedelic modelling world the film conveys. I do have to talk about the final third act of the film...literally so disturbing that I had my hand to my mouth the whole way through. Extremely brave, definitely warrants the 18 rated certificate here in the UK. Overall, an experimental film that I can only imagine some viewers will love and some will hate but with fantastic performances, beautiful cinematography and jaw-dropping scenes, I highly recommend you watch this one as it deserves to be watched (even just for the sheer bravery of Refn's work).Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",The Neon Demon

This film really cuts glass with the the cutthroat world of modelling, and what happens when you approach your use by date. TND is a very glamorized, mesmerizing film with an awesome fitting music score. A real reality told in a surreal way, where innocent newbie, and natural beauty, Fanning (Dakota's sister) just pass the age of sixteen and never been, arrives in L.A., signed on the spot, and moves up fast in the model world. She, she's got that something, where her peers, one (Malone) who falls badly for her, become deeply envious, one specially (an Aussie model) How that. It's first twenty minutes is so specially, but with an uncomfortable aura. Out of all the washroom scenes with girl's chatting, chilling, the one in this, in the first twenty minutes (and there are other familiar scenes) has never unnerved me more. You'll love Keanu Reeves, as a seedy motel manage/scumbag, who rapes young and sweet tenants, with his piece of s..t buddy, again one short line is overacted, showing him for the fool actor he is. Unfortunately the last twenty minutes, it's after ending really goes into weirdorama land, and kind of devalues it, depending on how you take it: literally devouring your competition, etc. TND is a different and very visceral experience, with some graphic violence, corpse fu..ing by Malone (really good in this) and a raging tiger, that somehow got into Fanning's room. May'be her competition. I really liked the wide street nightshot too, outside Fanning's motel room, with her ride. This is one of those films, that will leave an impression on you for nights to follow. If your a model, or aspiring model, you should aspire to see this movie.

33,paul-allaer,"Style over substance, and beware the second hour (no spoilers!)",6,29 June 2016,"""The Neon Demon"" (2016 release; 117 min.) brings the story of Jesse, an aspiring model who just arrived in LA (from Georgia). As the movie opens, we see Jesse at a photo-shoot where at first it seems she is dead in a pool of blood. There Jesse befriends make-up artist Ruby, and they decide to go to a party, where they meet other up-and-coming models. ""Are you food or are you sex?"" asks one of them (referring to Jesse's preferred lipstick). It becomes clear that in this cut-throat competition that is the modeling business, Jesse, barely 16 but instructed by a potential agency to tell everyone she's 19, doesn't know what she's up against. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Danish writer-director Nicolas Winding Refn, who blew us away with ""Drive"" and also brought the ambitious ""Only God Forgives"" (both Ryan Gosling-fronted). As was already the case with ""Only God Forgives"", here again Refn brings a movie heavy on style (and beautiful at that), but alas too light on substance. It might've helped had the characters been given some depth so that we have an emotional connection or reason to care. While the first hour is vaguely entertaining, the movie unfortunately derails badly in the second hour (I won't spoil specifically why). I simply couldn't buy into it all, and instead enjoyed the screen for the eye and ear candy that it brings. Yes, I said ear candy. Once again, Cliff Martinez, who also scored the previous 2 Refn movies, brings a mesmerizing electronic score that is one of the better aspects of the movie. Can't wait to check out the soundtrack. Ellie Fanning is okay as Jesse. Is she beautiful? Sure. Is she so stunningly beautiful with an obvious ""it"" factor that people left and right clamor for her (in the movie anyway)? I honestly don't see it, but that's just me I'm sure. Also keep an eye out for a barely recognizable Keanu Reeves, who has a small (less than 10 min.) role as the manager of the motel where Jesse is staying.""The Neon Demon"" premiered at this year's Cannes film festival with considerable splash. The movie opened this past weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Tuesday early evening screening where I saw this at turned out to be a private screening, as in: I literally was the only person in the theater. I can't say that I was surprised, as this movie hasn't created any type of a buzz nor was it marketed aggressively. As you have garnered by now, this was not the best of movies, but if you liked Refn's previous movies, I'd suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Neon Demon

Especially after seeing his follow up film, Only God Forgives, which like this movie, all his movies as a matter of fact, were shot with such style and beauty.The Neon Demon started off slow for me and I was thinking it was going to leave me dissatisfied like Only God Forgives , but that's not what happen. The confusion of the right turn this movie makes made it worth the watch. Truly like a piece of art, the overall product touched me and became very indulging.Elle Fanning leads a well done cast of character performances, even Keanu Reaves was great. I think this is Elle's first adult role playing an underage model struggling to make it in LA. The movie explores possibly the best and worse case scenario of what could happen to a young girl alone in that city.Definitely a great movie to watch. It's not Drive, but loved it far better than Only God Forgives.",The Neon Demon
35,jtindahouse,"A unique, captivating and memorable film",8,6 August 2018,"Nicolas Winding Refn has a way of making you feel inadequate when you watch his films - but in a good way. What I mean by that is that they're extremely complex and layered and even if you have a theory on a particular element of the film there's often no way to know if you're right. But isn't that great? Cinema that make you think is a thing of beauty. Of the three Refn films I have now seen ('Drive' and 'Only God Forgives' being the other two) I'd have to say 'The Neon Demon' is probably my favourite. Not by a wide margin, but it was certainly the one that I had the most fun watching. I honestly had no idea where the story was going to lead. I was trying to predict how it would pan out as the film went along, and to say I was way off would still be an understatement. The last 30 or so minutes of this film were so far out of left field, and yet so captivating, that I suspect I will remember them for a very long time.Even before that though the film had me hooked for the most part. The thing with Refn is that he creates these intricate and fascinating scenes, and yet you have no idea whether any of it is really important to the outcome or not. You hang on to every word though, both because it's interesting and because you know you may reflect on it in a very interesting way later on. Refn is notorious for his love of gore and violence and 'The Neon Demon' is no exception. It doesn't have perhaps the extreme levels that 'Only God Forgives' does (at least not in terms of what is actually shown), yet what is implied is still pretty horrifying. So there's no doubt this film won't be to everyones liking. Even if gore doesn't bother you I could see a lot of people simply not connecting with this film. Refn will always have a very much love/hate opinion held over his films I suspect. I enjoyed this one though a lot more than I even expected it to (it took me a long time to get around to seeing it because I had a feeling I was going to hate it). My advice would be to give it a chance and even if it's not your thing stick around to the end just to see what all the fuss is about.",The Neon Demon
36,jadavix,"A strikingly filmed, silly parable",6,13 January 2017,"""The Neon Demon"" is a movie which is at first held together by a flimsy plot but eventually plays like a series of R-rated perfume ads. There is material that might otherwise be shocking, but because we have come to expect the movie to make no sense and push the envelope for no reason, it just plays as silly, pointless provocation.I think ""Only God Forgives"" rubbed a lot of people the wrong way because it seemed to actually be about something, but degenerated into ridiculous affectation that seemed like a cop out, like Refn didn't know how to finish his story so he just threw some weird, disturbing material at us and hid behind the projector with his pockets full of stones.""The Neon Demon"" doesn't even really do that. The plot quits much earlier, so you're not really disappointed in the lack of a conclusion. You just sit, patiently, waiting for the movie to finish. The plot is something to do with a young ingenue who comes to LA to become a model. Everybody is very impressed with her and she appears to meet some hostility from the surgically enhanced, Australian models she meets in a nightclub. She also gets some support from a makeup artist.The idea that youth and beauty are enviable qualities that people in the fashion world will do anything to acquire is hardly news to anybody. Something as well made as this, with as many striking, shocking images, should have put them to the service of more interesting ideas.Further, Elle Fanning is wrong in the lead role. She doesn't look like a top model; she's too natural. If that's the point, why doesn't her character SEEM more natural? She's not really the babe of the woods you might expect.The bottom line is, whereas ""Only God Forgives"" hinted at more around the edges you weren't getting, ""The Neon Demon"" seems comparatively more empty. At least you won't waste too much time looking for hidden meaning.",The Neon Demon

38,parry_na,Stylish but incomprehensible ...,6,3 March 2019,"This is the story of a nice girl who enters into a nasty town and a dark business: of course, her modelling career is superficially bright white and pink neon. But when Jesse (Ellie Fanning) wanders into a studio photo-shoot, all fairy-tale dress and golden locks, and the Neanderthal photographer Jack (Desmond Harrington) tells her to take off her clothes, the awkwardness is all consuming. She is 16 years old, has been told to tell anyone who asks that she is 19.Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn takes his time with the atmospherics and gives us plenty of reason to feel for naïve Jesse. Cliff Martinez's music is very Eighties, very electronic. But where is all this going, I wonder as I watch?Smiling turns to sneering as other models become increasingly jealous of Jesse's natural beauty and un-cynical personality. This is a cut-throat, production-line, cattle market catwalk trade. With that leisurely established, events are free to become more and ever more disturbing, gory and surreal. Previously dependable characters reveal themselves to have strange depths and perversions that border on unreality.This film ultimately could be many things: a comment on the fashion world, the vagaries and obsessions with beauty and perfection, or simply the superficial silliness of human beings. What started as a fairly coherent story slides sideways into weird set pieces rather than going forward in any traditional way. The lack of depth to the characters and plot could be said to mirror the superficial business about which events revolve, or it could be attributed to a project that is more style over substance. It is not easy to categorise, nor is it meant to be, I suspect, but I quite enjoyed it as a horror film along the lines of David Lynch or JG Ballard. It doesn't need to take so long to tell its story, I think, but the acting is first rate. Keanu Reeves, never a huge favourite of mine, is great as the deeply unpleasant landlord Hank, and Fanning excels as the burgeoning central character.",The Neon Demon

I cannot give the visuals enough praise. Honestly this is one of the best looking films I have ever seen. It's a five-course meal for the eyes. Also, the soundtrack/score is incredible. I RARELY buy a film's soundtrack and when I say rarely I mean never but I have already purchased the soundtrack from Amazon. Elle Fanning and Jenna Malone were both fantastic.

40,drownnnsoda,"A feast of several kinds, one of which is to its own detriment",7,25 June 2016,"""The Neon Demon"" follows Jessie (Elle Fanning), a runaway teenager attempting to make it big in Los Angeles' modeling world. Her natural, ethereal beauty gains her quick successes, but a trio of industry veterans twice her age descend on her and her youthful allure.This film had been on my ""must see"" list for months now after having seen the dazzling, subtly creepy promotional materials, and unlike much of the film's audience, I am a newcomer to Refn's films, which have divided critics and audiences alike. The film is, needless to say, fantastic on a visual level. It is steeped in a profoundly well-conceived aesthetic, a characteristic that apparently defines Refn's films. It is a cinematographic wonder to the eyes, bathed in darkness and the neon lights of downtown Los Angeles. Set to a pulsing synth score, the film is at times reminiscent of a late '70s or early '80s horror movie, and comparisons to ""Suspiria"" are well-earned.The second area in which the film excels is its symbolism and concepts, which are equally rich; the premise is terrifying on a base level, and the audience can feel a disaster coming down on them as it lurches toward its twisted climax and denouement. It manages to be satisfying and chilling in its final statement, which is a potent cocktail of metaphors meeting harsh (and macabre) realities.Where the film fails to live up to its visual and thematic vigor is in its characterization. Fanning's performance as the doe-eyed, nervous teenager-cum-vain runway darling struck me as a bit of a tough sell. This is partly due to her insouciant performance, which is initially convincing, but slowly begins to buckle as the film gains momentum. It could also be because the characters surrounding her are so vividly realized, even in spite of the fact that they maybe have one quarter of her screen time. Jena Malone's performance as the obsessive makeup artist is profuse with lust and longing, while Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee turn in phenomenally understated performances that are nuanced, skillful, and completely entrancing. I don't say this to undermine Fanning's talent, as she does a solid job overall, but as the film plunges into its second act, her character slowly becomes a void around which the women circle—the show is stolen from her, which may be an intentional thematic move on Refn's part, but it does leave a sense of imbalance. I frankly found all three antagonist's performances (especially Lee's) to be far more interesting, which seems counter-intuitive to the emotional groundwork that Fanning's character should be implanting, but never quite seems to have the chance to.In spite of this, I feel ""The Neon Demon"" is a worthwhile effort, and certainly one of the more mature experimental horror offerings in recent memory. It is above all an aesthetic achievement that manages to entrench its dark thematic material in a beautiful package. Fanning's characterization leaves the film a bit disproportionate as she descends into her vaingloriousness, but fortunately there is enough visual and symbolic material here to feast on with the eyes and ears as she grows peripheral to the characters around her. This eclipse may certainly be thematically appropriate to what is transpiring in the narrative, but I couldn't help but feel that it was to the detriment of the film's emotional core. 7/10.",The Neon Demon

She invites her to a party where we meet two attractive models, Gigi and Sarah. One of them, who knows which one, is a just a mean b@#$% the other one is friendly until Jesse questions her obsession with plastic surgery.Next Jesse is interviewed by a modeling agency. For unknown reasons, the agent is awe-struck by her. She's hired for some shoot with a famous but bored photographer. Again, we are led to believe this guy has some very bad motives, but he doesn't.There are some pointless scenes at the motel, and as a result Jesse has to spend some nights with Ruby who also works doing makeup at a mortuary.Things improve dramatically for Jesse when she's cast for some runway show by a fashion designer, who again, for no good reason, finds the dull Jesse fantastic for some reason. And there Jesse is chosen over on her two more attractive friend-models.This is a turning-point for Jesse, because now her good fortunes go to her head. She's been dating some equally innocent guy but Jesse's new-found arrogance puts an end to it. And it will also get her in trouble with Ruby and the other girls.The Neon Demon is one long dull movie. Just like its characters it's empty but offers superficially something to see. And I guess some people did fall for the visuals. I didn't. I found this movie visually obnoxious and ugly. Not a single second or scene was stunning or striking or special. The movie is visually exceedingly dark, with some unreal neon-like blues and reds. Big deal. I didn't care for it at all.Story-wise, there's not much here either. Yeah, the innocent young model arriving in the lion's den of LA. How original. And everything here is presented as being nothing but menacing. There are the sinister photographers, the violent motel manager, a mountain lion attack (!?), huge egos. Even Ruby is presented as some predator surrounding Jesse when in fact she turns out to be quite helpful and kind, till the final scenes of course.What was surprising was the horror aspect. That I didn't expect, mainly because I had given up on this movie long before the horror starts. This movie is after all a tedious drag. Every scene is filmed in slow motion and during most of the movie there is no motion at all. Sure there's the synth music which has become fashionable with retro-themed movies. Except that The Neon Demon isn't even retro-themed. But here it doesn't complement the movie, rather it seems out of place.I'll give this movie 3 stars for the daring horror and nudity. There's nothing else worthwhile here. The fast-forward button is your friend here. This movie is so empty that it allows for all sorts of interpretations, as other reviewers have done.

First up, the photography and composition are beautiful and intelligent. Lots of mirrors, and the lighting is so interesting, with angles and reflections sending us to all kinds of depths.I had mixed feelings about the story, until the end really drew me in. At first I was impatient with the pace, and the dialogue was too spare and failed to give depth to the characters - lots of Q&A passages and unpregnant pauses. Also I found it hard to sympathise with skinny girls who take themselves so seriously when the writers provide no satire or humour. But the performances are good, especially the make-up artist (although her story wasn't wrapped up), and the choice of a girl next door for the lead made sense. Plenty of memorable scenes - favourite was the paedophile rape heard through the wall as the camera recedes. But also a morgue rape and some sunbathing in a shallow grave.This does have a Mulholland Dr vibe, and uses geometrical shapes to signal the moment it moves through the looking glass. Not sure that works entirely, but I did feel myself drawn in deeper as the weirdness increased.Music was excellent.Overall: a stab at greatness, let down a little by the dialogue and pacing.

47,bkrauser-81-311064,Was Trying for Kubrick But Ended Up Looking Like Zardoz,5,22 June 2016,"""She's a diamond among a sea of glass,"" says Alessandro Nivola's unnamed fashion designer. He says this to describe the virginal, Bambi-esque Jesse (Fanning) whose arrival in Los Angeles has turned many, many heads. Before her entrance, Nivola and a few models sit idly on the leather backs of a upscale restaurant booth. He's reciting passages of Macbeth and waxing poetically about how ""beauty isn't the most important thing, it's the only thing.""The Neon Demon is a Russ Meyer-inspired Hollywood sleaze fable if it were told from the dour sets of the Grand Guignol. Jesse comes to Tinseltown to become a model and despite being only 16, she lands a deal of a lifetime with a major agency. In-between shoots she lives in a trashy motel headed by the irredeemable Hank (Keanu). Seemingly her only allies are kinda-sorta boyfriend Dean (Glusman) and makeup artist Ruby (Malone) who first ferries her to her first professional shoot. Everyone else seems to either want to be her or want to eat her alive.Due in large part by reexamination of director Nicolas Winding Refn's Only God Forgives (2013), critics seem to be pulling their punches concerning this nasty little fairy-tale. It seems that everyone (including yours truly) is trying to look for deeper meaning under the grotesque giallo horror set-pieces and delirious fretwork. After all, Refn keen eye was once heralded as comparable to that of Stanley Kubrick.Kubrick however never sacrificed narrative for the sake of a nice shot. His frames always has an economy of style that balanced strong cinematography, thematically salient storytelling and unbridled experimentation. Refn's Neon Demon on the other hand is much like it's protagonist, pretty and rather shallow. There's nothing thematically that you can't pry away from the film that isn't already skin deep. It's about vanity; it's about pride and the literate references to Shakespeare, Elizabeth Bathory and Kubrick himself are but filler.Of course what is on the screen is pretty breathtaking; recreating the same gloss and sheen that covers high-end fashion magazines. The hallucinatory horror that dominates Jesse's warped and lonely world conjures comparisons to the sexual cavalcade of Walerian Borowczyk's oeuvre. Then there's the lateral tracking shots which accomplish the same uneasiness captured by a Kubrickian zoom only drawing less attention to itself.Yet every attempt at technical subtlety is completely pulled apart at the seems by Refn's on-the-nose symbolism. Within the first fifteen minutes of the film, models discuss at length the meaning behind the names of lipstick contrasting the fractured female identity with the blunted phrase ""are you food or sex?"" The consistent use of the color red and the triangle as an emblem of the fairer sex are so painfully, abstrusely obvious that the film honestly would have been better served if Jesse spontaneously grew Icarus wings.It's a shame that Refn couldn't give the same nuance deconstruction of femininity he gave to masculinity in Drive (2011) and to a lesser extent, every other film he's ever done. I admire his temerity but I question his choice to use the same narrative pacing and visceral bloodletting we've seen in his other works. While exploring new themes he makes no attempt to bend in their direction. He doesn't create a new world, he simply adds a wing to his old ones and expects you not to notice. Despite a visual sophistication, every frame is loaded with the judgment of a five-year-old trying broccoli for the first time. It's a movie that's less of an exploration than a house of horrors; Refn being the carnival barker that yells ""Isn't this gross, isn't that gross, aren't you gross for enjoying it?""In an interview discussing her role for the film, Elle Fanning compared the themes of the film with the idle hands of a generation ensnared by Instagram. ""If you think of dead, altered images as beautiful, how do you relate to a real person?"" It's an idea worth exploring; are we really more in love with images than people? With the hilarity of Popstar (2016) and the arrival of Nerve (2016) later this year, it's good to see the movie industry is willing to skewer self-absorption. In the case of Neon Demon, I ask why we need to retch while doing so? Frankly I was expecting something more than a monstrous and excessive retooling of Zardoz (1974).",The Neon Demon
48,tomsview,To die for,7,28 February 2017,"Hmmm, this isn't what I thought it would be at all. I was expecting an inside look at the modelling world with maybe a bit more edge than ""America's Next Top Model"".What we get though is something that is hard to describe. It is indeed a look at the world of modelling but it paints it as beyond superficial and very creepy.Jesse (Elle Fanning), a young girl, very young, just turned 16, arrives in LA looking to become a model. She is incredibly shy, but very beautiful. Nearly everyone she meets is either jealous of her beauty or lusts after her – or sometimes both.She meets one nice young guy, Dean (Karl Glusman) who tries to look after her, but the peer pressure is stifling and she is absorbed into the modelling scene as the fresh new look.She encounters more than cattiness from the other models, and at various stages I wasn't sure if this was actually a vampire movie without the fangs. There is even a bit of the old necrophilia to really creep the whole thing out.It is a horror film of course and taken on that level it is stylish and disturbingly effective.The film is dark metaphorically and literally; other than the brightly lit photography sessions and the strobe effects for the catwalk scenes, the stars inhabit a dimly lit world. The darkness and stillness of the whole piece tends to kill any erotic energy in the film although it is full of sexual attraction in all its forms.I don't view things like the halo of blood from a traumatic head injury as a study in beauty, but this film finds art in unexpected places. David Cronenberg's ""Crash"" and Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" come to mind, but ""The Neon Demon"" is hard to pin down.I have always felt that the best horror movies don't have a supernatural element, which means we don't have the safety net of knowing it couldn't really happen. As long as you accept that just about anything goes in a genuinely edgy horror movie, then ""The Neon Demon"" definitely delivers.If you are expecting an inside look at the modelling industry in the same way that ""The Devil Wears Prada"" took an inside look at the fashion magazine industry, ""The Neon Demon"" isn't that movie.",The Neon Demon

50,Screen_Blitz,"Nicolas Winding Refn's visual methodology does very little to redeem this grim, incoherently directed gorefest",4,28 January 2017,"What Nicolas Winding Refn proved in the neo-noir thriller 'Drive' is that he has a hefty hand to both powerful directing and visual storytelling. It is too bad that his following feature 'Only God Forgives' severely lacked the narrative compulsion and characters needed to qualify for an alluring psychological thrilling experience. Following this project is a dark, nihilistic psychological horror thriller that improves upon a few of the blemishes that tainted 'Only God Forgives' from being a quality entry, while maintaining a dazzling visual methodology and cinematography by Natasha Braier. Unfortunately, what lies below Refn's eye-soaking visual heft and gratuitous blood and gore is a direction that lacks certain coherency, and an absent sense of character development. As the story greatly tackles on the dark side of a girl venturing through the modeling industry, Refn's grisly execution is already absurd enough from beginning to end. The problem is the execution is far too depraved of substance to the point where it feels vastly misguided. This stars as Elle Fanning as Jesse, a sixteen year old girl who moves from Atlanta to Los Angeles in a motel run by Hank (played by Keanu Reeves) to embark on her career in the modeling industry. Upon her entrance, she instantly wows modeling manager Roberta (played by Christina Hendricks) and makeup artist Ruby (played by Jena Malone) with her visual beauty and believe she is the ""one"" the industry. As she escalates on the modeling ladder, her success evokes extreme jealously among her fellow competitors Sarah (played by Abbey Lee) and Gigi (played by Bella Heathcote) who stop at nothing to get what she has.As the title greatly suggests, things get pretty ugly, and even describing the plot as ""ugly"" feels like an understatement. Blood and guts are spilled, teen females are exploited, and the film explores the ventures of an adolescent girl through the modeling industry in an aggressively bizarre manner. Similarly to 'Drive' and 'Only God Forgives', the film strolls at a significantly slow pace and explicitly shows how style over substance seems to be Nicolas Winding Refn cup of tea. Refn makes a dashing achievement and flourishing a dazzling, surrealistic visual flair which is beautifully demonstrated in one particular dream-like sequence shot with alluring cinematography. And it sounds Refn really knows how to set the tone of each scene with Cliff Martinez's eerie electronic music core. It's too bad though, that the film takes character development and a sharper story for granted. Front and center of the story is Elle Fanning's Jesse, an aspiring model who brings vast fascination to members of the modeling industry with her striking natural beauty, but nonetheless never amounts to anything beyond a dull, one-dimensional character surrounded in a sea of equally underdeveloped supporting characters. And Elle Fanning's stoic performance brings little justice to the mix. As the story moves on, it slogs through a long tedious (occasionally uncomfortable) stretch of ambivalent storytelling before building up into a preposterous, exploitative gorefest. By the end, it leaves you nothing other than a solid message about the tragedy of turning your natural beauty into an overbearing obsession. The Neon Demon is a nihilistic psychological horror picture that may boasts an inspiring visual methodology, but sadly falls victim to a lack of substance and comprehensible writing, with very little to offer beyond its aberrant psychological material. It is certainly not comfortable to watch especially for those with a weak stomach to excessive blood and gore or overwhelming misogyny, nor does it bring intellect to it's grisly content. In other words, it at least reaches a higher quality than Nicolas Winding Refn's previous entry.",The Neon Demon

Yes! But boring!There are many beautiful visuals! But cinema is not just about the visuals. That is only one aspect. I'm sure there are people who appreciate this film for the visuals alone.

52,lambiepie-2,"Nice Visuals, But the Art is Up to Interpretation",6,3 May 2021,"For me, this is an ""art house"" film, and I view them on a different level than a Hollywood Blockbuster or even Independent film. I enjoy the challenge of watching and figuring out what was created, and my interpretation of it. I've seen quite a few ""art house"" type films to know that there will be reviews from the ""what the heck was that?!?!?"" to ""spellbinding and brilliant!!"". The Neon Demon is no exception.The visuals in the film were stunning. Of course that attracted my attention to watch this all the way to the end. Now a warning: parts of my review may upset quite a few readers but that's the thing about art house films - ""call it as you see it"". This is my call:The Neon Demon (2016) is a very artistic view of a dog-eat-dog modeling industry set in Los Angeles. It could have been set in New York or Milan as well with the same outcome. You have a young innocent arriving in Los Angeles (Elle Fanning) and gets lucky very early with modeling. Of course this upsets a close group of other ""used to be top"" women models who have had a bit of success, but know how it's fleeting when a new, young, innocent girl comes on the scene and takes their work. The women ""befriend her"", because as they see her rise, they have ways to take out such competition.While Elle's character is becoming the toast of the town, the ladies - two models and a makeup artist, start their plot of taking her out - and taking her essence and youth to, well, live on. This is where the film gets artsy, horrific - but to me - a bit familiar.What you have here is a tale of a young person coming to Hollywood and the group of older people luring them in to kill, drink their blood, and that keeps being 'famous' (Ah, now ... that's a bit familiar of a recent 'political' theme being pushed as a reality that crossed my mind while watching this too).Regardless, this 2016 film is full of striking artistic visuals, shapes, lighting, framing etc. Set against the modeling industry to get to the meat of the tale. The photographers/employers seem very artistic -- but quirky. Elle's character starts innocent, but gets a spine real quick as she grows more successful, buys into the facade of 'being beautiful and using it'. She also gets involved with the usual Hollywood Crazy Hotel with the crazy Hollywood owner (Keanu Reeves) that's full of crazy symbolism (hint, the mountain cat isn't a ""cat"", the knife is not really a knife, etc.) so taking it literally will throw one off, maybe.It all leads up to an ending that, at least to me, either has a moral, such as: ""that's what you get, ya can't do wrong forever"" or a ""what kind of mess is this?!?!"". I got another perspective of that to add such as: no matter who you are, payback is horrible and you can't trust anyone in Hollywood because they'll step over you even though they seemed they'd be by you when given the chance. A wild, grossed-out way of getting to that if that is what it is, but that's how it was ""artistically"" presented.With all that is in The Neon Demon, it works as an art film telling the same tale...young girl goes to Hollywood, enters entertainment industry, gets messed over. But the telling this time is much more artistic, way out at points, and wild.",The Neon Demon

54,aciessi,Skin Deep,7,22 August 2020,"Elle Fanning is Jesse. Jesse is a model. The other girls would kill to have her looks. Well, that's essentially the premise of The Neon Demon. A gory psychological thriller by Nicolas Winding Refn. It's an allegory for the vein, selfish world of modeling. At times, it's a bit too on the nose, but that's got to be the point. It's hard to know whether or not this film is relevant now, or if it will be in 10 years. America's perception of beauty is ever changing. As a horror film, many people were taken aback by it's disturbing nature and visual grotesque, but I'm pretty sure Ari Aster has this beat. As with most Refn films, dialogue is not the strength. The characters are stunningly vapid, yet in the world of modeling, that fits like a glove. You'll enjoy the film on a superficial level, certainly. Even the grossest scenes are delivered by an expert hand in cinematography and editing. Whether or not you find this film to be genius or junk depends on the person, but make sure you are in earshot of a shower.",The Neon Demon
55,rockman182,The Neon Demon (2016),10,9 December 2016,"I've already seen this twice and went to see it on opening day because I knew I would love it. Very pleased with the film. Right from the opening credits and the first shot of Elle, I was drawn in. Touches of Refn everywhere. As usual the soundtrack and film score are ace. The lights and color in the film are so in your face, absolutely gorgeous to watch. As expected, characters and plot depth is sacrificed for the atmosphere that is set in the film. It really works though. Characters are meant to be shallow, they are pretty models in a cutthroat environment of the fashion/modeling industry. Its a survival of the fittest environment, where the new cat comes along and threatens the survival of the more seasoned models, with her simplistic beauty and innocence that everyone just fawns over. I got some real Black Swan vibes from the general plot and grim nature underneath something meant to be pretty. In this world of ""beauty"" there is some serious visceral horror. Love how the seediness of Los Angeles is captured, as exemplified by the dull sleazy looking motel. I'm not sure everyone will love it. I can see many people disliking it. There were some shock horror bits I could have done without that I feel got included for the sake of the shock value. I can't complain much about it though because it fits right in the psychotic realm of the film.Could the characters have used more development? Yes. I think it would change the experience though. Also it would spoil what the film leads towards. First half of the film is just visually beautiful and alluring. The next half I'd say the horror of it really kicks in and everything comes at you fast. Overall, as far as Refn films go I'd say Drive is still his best (and will be hard to top) but TND was for me much better than the others I've seen.",The Neon Demon
56,cultfilmfan,The Neon Demon,10,19 October 2016,"The Neon Demon, takes the world of fashion modelling and not only critiques it, but does so in what is one of the most intriguing and fascinating ways I have seen in quite some time. Here we are introduced into the world of young women fashion modelling. The models are all extremely thin and conform to what the photographers, or their agents deem as beautiful. These models will stop at nothing to achieve their dream of being the top model and the most beautiful one of all. Kind of like Snow White, right? Anyway, these models are so obsessed with their bodies and the overall image they convey to others that they go about having numerous plastic surgery operations done where either fat is removed, or added to their body, or with different nip and tuck routines their isn't too much that is actually genuine in them at all anymore, but rather they resemble the plastic Barbie doll figures and image that you can buy at your local toy store. These models are also vain, selfish and completely devoid of any actual sense of feelings, remorse, or apathy whatsoever. As long as they are on top of the world in their very peculiar yet unfortunately popular business, that is all that matters to them. The film raises wonderful ideas and cautions about how one should view their body and ultimately between the very surrealistic and completely avant garde nature of the film, somewhere lying in there is a message about one's true worth and how not everything revolves around looks and for those who base their whole lives upon being perfect, or conforming to what this world's society deems as perfect and what the perfect look and body is, there is ultimately trouble and your ultimate downfall that will soon come hereafter and that this is not a glorious, or happy industry to be working in. Take the main character of Jesse, played by the always great Elle Fanning. She is just a teenager and new to the whole world of modelling and fashion in general. At first everything seems so totally new to her and as one character deems it, she looks like a deer in the headlights with her fear and overall apprehension about the whole thing. And yet while the industry and those running it look to be shady characters whose intentions are the furthest thing from good, Jesse continues to persevere and is then introduced into a world of a bunch of models who completely envy Jesse for her looks and what they fear will ultimately be her fame at their expense and Jesse receiving all the big jobs and them being left far from the catwalk. The film shows that how naive and vulnerable Jesse is at first will unfortunately not last long when she gets into the cutthroat world that this entails and that she is willing to step over anyone, or anything to achieve this dream and yet the other models who hate her and are jealous of her have not forgotten about her yet and the rest of the film will prove to be quite interesting. With, The Neon Demon the stylish and provocative Danish director, Nicolas Winding Refn is at it again. With his film Drive, it was a film that I admired very much although sometimes I found the softer, quieter and more stylish elements of the film were quite strong and the second act where it turned more violent and more of an action film were not quite as to my liking as the first half. Still, Drive turned out to be a critical hit for Refn and I can certainly see why as it was a very strong film in all departments and with it Refn seemed to have totally reinvented the modern concept of the action film. Since then he seems to be trying to be even more adventurous as a filmmaker and truly doing films and scripts where he does not care if he isolates, or turns off an audience and instead he is focused on making art and whether it appeals to the masses or not he does not care and that is the attitude all serious filmmakers should have and Refn is by no means a sell out and that is very applaud worthy and something I respect him for. The Neon Demon, will certainly not appeal to many, or maybe even most people, but I found like he did with Drive and the action genre that here Refn totally reinvents the horror genre and gives us one of the most original and fascinating films of the genre in years. The film's look with it's bright neon colours and black backdrops are absolutely gorgeous and the colour palette they use here is amazing. This is the best use of cinematography I have seen this year so far and if it is not nominated for an Oscar it would truly be a disservice and would bring further contempt against the academy. The music by Cliff Martinez is great as usual and he gives us a great electronic score that is very much akin to the story and overall mood and feeling it generates while you watch it. This truly is a film for the senses. The acting is probably different than what you may be used to, but give it a chance and see how good everyone is at either acting creepy, vain, or having no emotion whatsoever. This is one of the best looking films in years and that is truly original on all it's own without copying others and it truly is it's own glorious beast and I mean that sincerely. This film will unfortunately turn off much of it's viewers, but those who are interested in the abstract, or the different will find much to love here. It is basically a fusion of Dario Argento meets David Lynch and then introduced to the wonderful talents of Refn.",The Neon Demon

58,bryank-04844,'The Neon Demon' is like Kubrick come back to life.,10,23 January 2017,"Nicolas Winding Refn has given us some fairly memorable images on the big screen over the years. 'Drive' might be his most successful and most main stream film to date. That film was critically acclaimed and praised by almost everyone. He followed that movie up with 'Only God Forgives' and it didn't do so well, both financially and critically. Refn and his wife even made a documentary about it, but Refn left a sour taste on the film community, at least for a little while. This might have been a blessing in disguise though, as Refn has decided to completely do his own thing from now on.Sure, he has usually never compromised his views or style really, but with his latest film 'The Neon Demon', he does exactly what he wants, how he wants, and when he wants. The result is brilliant. Refn of course is one of those filmmakers who just passionately loves film at its purest state. He's considered one of the big fans of all movies, perhaps with a slight pension towards the bizarre and grindhouse-like style. Refn has pushed the bounds of filmmaking and story-telling with 'The Neon Demon' and has made us excited that we crossed that line with such originality and beauty. For sure, 'The Neon Demon' is a one-of-a-kind movie and dare I say that Nicolas Winding Refn is Stanley Kubrick come back to life.Refn has made a beautiful horror film and satire all at the same time that takes a look at the fashion model world in Los Angeles. It's as if he took what we were all thinking and actually filmed it. Kubrick would have been proud of this film, as Refn perfectly framed and captured every single moment on film that told a story and meant something. The film follows a very young model named Jesse (Elle Fanning), who ends up in Los Angeles by herself, with no friends or family. She is a natural beauty and has just landed a top agency. When she's not out impressing the designers or photographers with her looks, she stays at a seedy motel run by a scum-bag named Hank (Keanu Reeves).Jesse seems like a timid girl, but she has more up her sleeve than she lets on, and not always in the most positive of ways. Due to her natural beauty and innocence, she wins the gigs of all the top magazines, which causes the other older models to lose out on the spotlight and make them bitter and jealous, including Gigi and Sarah (Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee). A makeup artist by the name of Ruby (Jena Malone) takes young Jesse under her wing, but there is always something off about her in her presentation and demeanor.Through this visual paradise of elegance and ugliness, the story unfolds in a direction that you really won't see coming. When it does happen, Refn goes all out and never stops or flinches away with any of it. 'The Neon Demon' is truly a beautiful yet horrifying film for all the right reasons. The score by Cliff Martinez is fantastic as well and always adds to each moment of the movie's unpredictability and suspense.Elle Fanning is simply fantastic here too, as she portrays someone you really never root for, but at the same time want her to succeed. Keanu Reeves provides some great entertainment and comedy too with Malone, Heathcote and Lee delivering top notch supporting performances. Refn has made an visually stunning film with one hell of a story that could be all too real in this day and age. Again, Refn would have made Kubrick proud with this one-of-a-kind movie experience.",The Neon Demon
59,oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx,Golden,10,2 September 2016,"""So I asked myself, of all the melancholy topics, what, according to the universal understanding of mankind, is the most tragic? Death. And when is this most tragic of melancholy topics most poetical? When it most loosely alludes itself to beauty. The death, therefore, of a beautiful girl is unquestionably the most poetic topic in the world."" So spoke the ghost of Edgar Allan Poe in Francis Ford Coppola's movie Twixt. These words are a paraphrasing of Poe's own writing, from his essay ""The Philosophy of Composition"". Coppola and Refn both seem to have taken some interest in using Elle Fanning in films about the death of a beautiful woman. The topic is insanely fascinating in this presentation.The Neon Demon is about a girl who goes to Los Angeles in order to become a top model. The work, compliments, admirers and envy all start to roll in. The movie is essentially thematic, largely relying on the visual and on atmosphere.NWR is an extreme addict of beauty, and the movie contains some staggeringly voluptuous photography. The message is that physical beauty is superficial. But there is no sanctimony to be had from Refn here, on the contrary he goes for full immersion, a beauty-holic on a bender. The film is a testimony to the power of beauty, it is a mesmeric, galvanic glory. The tail end of the beast mutates into images you see only in rare dreams, a mix of the abject and the byzantine. A judgemental reaction to this dreamworld would be a nonsensical act.",The Neon Demon
60,mahmus,"Disappointing, but worth a watch",6,9 November 2020,"I was expecting this to be more like Only God Forgives (which despite its negative reception, is a movie I really like), so I was a bit disappointed by how (mostly) straightforward it was in comparison.I also think it might've gone a bit too far in its attempts to shock the audience. Drive and Only God Forgives had violence, but they didn't have... that.
(I did really like the ending though)What makes this movie work for me though are its beautiful visuals and its shock factor, which as I said, can go too far, but I really respect when a director dares to put stuff like this on the screen, even if it makes me want to unsee the whole thing.Its criticism of the beauty industry is clear, but it really works better on a pure audiovisual level.I may not enjoy it as much as Nicolas Winding Refn's two previous films, but I definitely see a lot of appeal for fans of the beautiful and the messed up.Also, Keanu Reeves plays really againts type and he's suprisingly really great at it.",The Neon Demon

It is very beautiful, what happens is that I do not know what it is for.I guess it's about being psychological, but these things have to be done very well or you get ridiculous and this time you fell into ridicule.It is especially misdirected, it has ugly and poorly composed planes.

62,CANpatbuck3664,Crazy Visual Style Can't Overcome How Aggressively Bad and Boring The Neon Demon Is,3,5 November 2016,"I decided to see this movie more because of the reactions to it than the subject matter. This seemed to be one of those movies that people either insisted was a cinematic masterpiece or the worst movie ever. I'll admit ahead of time that I haven't really liked most of Nicolas Winding Refn's movies. I didn't like Bronson despite the great job by Tom Hardy, I thought Drive was alright. I haven't seen Only God Forgives and after seeing this, I don't have any desire to. I can't say that there's nothing here and I have seen worse movies but unless you're a big Winding Refn fan or a cinematography junkie, I don't know if anyone in the general audience is going to get much out of this.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After the opening credits (which start with Nicolas Winding Refn's name) we join Jesse (Elle Fanning) when she's wrapping up a small scale photo shoot in an L.A. apartment. She's cleaning herself off when Ruby (Jena Malone) introduces herself. Ruby is a makeup artist working in the studio that night. She welcomes her into town and tries to make small talk with her. Jesse is nervous and isn't very forthcoming. Ruby tells her how beautiful she is and invites her to a party. They meet up with 2 of Ruby's friends Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee) who are also models. They're industry vets and their explicit conversations kind of throw Jesse off. Everyone is impressed by Jesse's beauty and wherever she walks, people turn and stare. After being signed by Roberta Hoffman (Christina Hendricks) she goes on a date with the photographer from her first photo shoot Dean (Karl Glusman). They seem pretty at ease around each other and Jesse tells him some of her story. She's actually 16 when she's been lying and saying she's 18 or 19. Her parents have unfortunately passed away and that one of the reasons she came was because she felt she had little talent other than being pretty. At the end of the date, Dean tries to make a move but Jesse brushes him off and heads up to her motel room to get ready for a shoot the next day.Nicolas Winding Refn's movies usually have one thing in common, they're visually impressive. I'll give The Neon Demon something, it's one of the most beautiful movies I've seen in a while. There's a bunch of scenes that are just visually insane. The movie gives you almost zero context on what they mean or why they chose to do that but they are pretty.As much as I didn't like the movie I don't want to blame the actors and actresses. I don't think anyone was especially good but the whole vibe of the movie is so sterilized and lifeless, it really seems like they were directed or told to act that way. Elle Fanning was fine, she seems well cast but there isn't much subtlety to her performance. She goes from a shy newcomer to a arrogant %^&*# almost instantly at the half way point. Jena Malone, Bella Heathcote and Abby Lee seem appropriate for this movie but they're also so robotic they don't seem like real people at all. Christina Hendricks is in the movie for so little time it's almost worth not mentioning. Keeanu Reeves is appropriately creepy but that's not so much do to his acting as it is his character being just so disgusting.Getting to the heart of the matter, I found this movie to be really boring and all the insane visuals in the world couldn't save it. The movie also seems to have an ego, it's done in a really stylistic way to seemingly distract from the complete lack of substance. People have defended this movie saying it doesn't have to seem like reality because its meant to be more like a dark fairy tale. If that's the plan, give me some remotely likable characters that I want to see succeed. I really didn't give a crap whether Jesse made it or not, sure the gruesomeness of what happens to her isn't earned but when it happened I did think to myself that she probably had something like that coming. Or how about a deeper story instead of flashing symbols in neon when there isn't the proper explanation to understand what the movie wants to get across? There's really almost nothing to this movie from a plot perspective. Its almost ironic because the movie turns out to be as shallow as its characters. When the movie finally switches gears and puts the pedal to the floor for the finale, it's not only stupid but kind of gross and needlessly violent. I'm not saying that the direction that they took was wrong because I knew it was a horror movie going in. The problem is that it turns super dark on a dime and the depth of the horror aspects doesn't seem to work with the rest of the movie.I was ready to give this movie a chance. The polarizing opinions on it actually gave me some hope, I didn't like some of Refn's work previously but even some of the critical community seemed to turn their nose up at this. Maybe that meant it might be my kind of thing this time. I did appreciate the quality of the visuals but while that normally helps the grade that your going to give the movie most of the time, when a movie is aggressively bad it almost makes you dislike it more. I had the same reaction when I saw The Spirit (which is one of my least favourite movies of all time). I think the strong art-house crowd will dig this and they're welcome to it. For me, this will probably be one of the worst movies I've see this year.",The Neon Demon
63,Rickting,A work of art,9,30 December 2016,"I cannot understand all the hatred for this movie. Nicolas Winding Refn bounces back from Only God Forgives with this dark, twisted and nightmarish horror film about a young model in Los Angeles who attracts fascination and unwanted attention from the modelling industry and her fellow models. Admittedly, it's only a good movie on a story level. The plot is relatively thin and the characters are underdeveloped. As a piece of art it's an utter knockout. Every single frame is a painting and every image advances the story forward and creates new meaning. This isn't a narrative film. It's a film to experience and to be amazed by. This is a rare movie where being style-over-substance is brilliant because the style is the substance. The artistic mastery on display here takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. This movie will have you feeling joyous one moment and terrified the next. The soundtrack is absolutely flawless as well. Elle Fanning is great and all the actors do a good job with their limited dialogue. Even Keanu Reeves is decent in this movie. A flawed masterpiece, The Neon Demon is a mesmerizing, hypnotic and mind-blowing cinematic nightmare that stands high above most of 2016's other films, even though quite a lot of people disliked it. 9/10",The Neon Demon
64,rubenm,"Visually stunning, but without substance",6,18 June 2016,"In a way, this film is a perfect example of form following function. What better way to show how empty and perverse the model scene in Los Angeles is, than to make an empty and perverse movie about it? If Nicolas Winding Refn wanted to make this point, he has made it loud and clear.But the question is: did he really want to make this point? Or did he just want to take his cinematographic capabilities one step further, by taking the visual aesthetics to the limit, without bothering about the rest? 'The Neon Demon' is visually stunning, but lacks substance. The story about a 16 year old model being literally devoured by the fashion industry, is nothing more than a vehicle for the visual exuberance of the film. It is like a 'Vogue' magazine: there are many pages, but they are all filled with glamorous pictures, and very little text. You can browse through it, but it doesn't have a message, other than an endless display of beauty.To accentuate the perversion of it all, Winding Refn had added some horror elements, which almost seem ridiculous, especially at the end of the film. There's also an irritating and very prominent soundtrack. The acting is mostly unnatural and pretentious. But if you like browsing the latest edition of Vogue magazine, perhaps this is the film for you.",The Neon Demon

As with the subject matter, it is a poor facsimile of a truly worthy art film – or perhaps that is what it is meant to be.The story could have been told more in-depth, after all several unnecessarily long scenes took up far more time than was palatable – which would have left plenty in the time budget to develop the characters and their motivations.The characters were shallow and uninteresting. For most of the movie we were subjected to Elle Fanning's interpretation of her character Jesse. It must have been an easy role because her portrayal of her sickly sweet character was exactly the same all the way through whatever situation she found herself in. During the longer scenes involving only her it became annoying and tiresome.But this is typical of many American films that have attempted to present themselves as 'art for the masses'.

After the first 20/30 minutes, we understood the message and the film would have benefited from being a short film. Que nenni!

As a synthesis: visually amazing but desperately boring.",The Neon Demon
68,PyroSikTh,"Weird, Disturbing, and Visually Extravagant",8,12 July 2016,"This is listed as a horror film, and while it has it's moments, they are all crammed in at the very end. When it does shift more into horror territory, it becomes some of the most disturbing and crazy stuff Refn has put to film (which says a lot). Up to that point though, it's just the story of a girl finding success at the chagrin of those around her, and her evolution from an innocent and shy teenager to a proud and narcissistic fashion model.Visually, and unsurprisingly, Neon Demon is a masterpiece. There's a lot going on, and the sheer amount of longshots just pause the movie to make sure you devour every detail there is to offer. Colour is used to wonderful effect to illicit moods and moments of significance. Blue and Red have a big part to play in particular, signifying the shift of both character and movie from innocent to chaotic. Green, as well, plays a big part, and is only used once at the end. Space and composition play a big part as well. There are a number of shots with the subject placed centrally, and the space around either filled with blackness or interesting architecture. The opening shot uses space really well, expanding it around the subject and revealing the almost amateur quality of the studio. This is juxtaposed fantastically later on when Jesse enters a professional studio. Everything is white and clinical, and the amount of space is vast. There often isn't anything to see of the room itself; no windows, no bricks, just white (and later solid black when the lights are turned out).Character-wise, I found a lot more to digest in Neon Demon than I anticipated. Elle Fanning does brilliantly as Jesse, encapsulating that innocent country girl vibe early on, and slowly evolving it as she gets more successful, and her looks start to go to her head. By the end her smile is more menacing than sweet, and her whole stature a lot more ""dangerous"" (as she describes herself). Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee are also great as the two envious models Gigi and Sarah respectively. Gigi is a lot more forthcoming and two-faced, possibly embodying the more stereotypical idea of models with her obsession of plastic surgery and trying to look perfect. Abbey Lee is a much more menacing presence, with cold blue eyes that puncture those around her and hide something psychopathic behind them. Jena Malone probably steals the show as Ruby though. Ruby befriends Jesse early on, and guides her into and through the big league. Ruby gets a lot of development as a character, with many inconsequential scenes signposting more disturbing twists that occur later on. For example, the way she looks at Jesse is less like the daggers Sarah offers, and more like the stares she receives from male characters. This gives her a slight edge of lesbianism that plays a bigger part later on, but is never outwardly stated until that moment. Similarly she moonlights as make-up artist at a morgue, dressing corpses up ready for their funerals, signifying she has no qualms with gore and dead bodies. The degree to which she feels comfortable with the dead made me fear what she might be capable of.The various male characters are treated very differently to the female characters. They all appear slimy with long voyeuristic stares. Not only does this paint the male characters as somewhat unlikeable and give the female characters more focus, but it also helps the movie drive home it's message about society's obsession with beauty; an obsession that is driven primarily by male eyes and the objectification of women. Karl Glusman is the first male to appear, and it's with a creepy stare as he watches Jesse, the subject of his photography. Dean turns out to actually be a nice guy, but this shows that even he is susceptible to the lure of female beauty. Desmond Harrington is brilliantly unnerving as the professional photographer Jack. Again he has an unflinching stare as if he's undressing his subjects with his eyes, and his gaunt appearance gives him just enough of a creepy look about him that you dread what he might do when he orders everyone to leave his studio. Keanu Reeves plays against typecast as the douchebag manger of Jesse's motel. Again he can't keep his eyes off Jesse or her assests, constantly looking her up and down and checking her out, but his antagonism extends beyond that. Reeves oozes that darker side so effortlessly that you forget he ever played good guys.Neon Demon is a bit of a tough movie to judge objectively. To some people, it'll play as a boring and pretentious piece of cinema that serves no purpose other than to show off some pretty pictures, while others will hail it a masterpiece filled with ingenious storytelling techniques that bubble in the subtext. Of course being a Refn fan, I went in expecting the latter, and I can't say I was overly disappointed. There's a lot to take in, and while the plot itself is fairly linear, it becomes a little confusing by the end. There's a lot that isn't explained (like how did the wildcat get in Jesse's motel room? Who put it there, and why?), and the third act just takes such a sudden nose-dive in tone that it can feel a little jarring and played for shock value, no matter how well it was signposted throughout. I give it a deep and insightful, if a little messy 8/10. I certainly wouldn't just recommend it to anyone though.",The Neon Demon
69,MattBrady099,The Neon Demon - Movie Review,9,4 September 2016,"Sarah: ""What does it feel like, to walk into a room, and it's like in the middle of winter. You're the sun.""Jesse: ""It's everything"".The Neon Demon is a movie experience that I will never forget. From the minute it starts, I was glued to the screen and not once could I look away, even with the long silent moments, I was still hooked. The LA lights are something to drift away too.Nicolas Winding Refn can be a love or hate thing with me. I loved ""Drive"" and ""Bronson"". I didn't like ""Valhalla Rising"" and ""Only God Forgives"" that much. He's got talent, I can see that and I know that he wants to make movies that only he wants to see, and not just for others. I think we all can agree that all of he's movies are shot so beautifully and if one of he's movies as the word ""Neon"" in the title, then you better you expect something glorious. Refn shines in The Neon Demon by adding this dream like fairy tale theme to the mix. There was so many times I had a ""Suspiria"" and a Michael Mann vibe to this (with the use of colors). This was such a step up from ""Only God Forgives"". And here's why.What ""Only God Forgives"" was trying to get across in it's symbolism was too simple that I pretty much got all of it. I thought it got repetitive in terms of the visual imagery that the film constantly presents, but I feel that those scenes didn't have any glue to hold those previous scenes together. It was pretty much all icing but no cake. And while I got what Refn was doing with ""Neon Demon"" in terms of the fashion industry, but I still feel that there's more to it then that. Even through I don't 100% understand all of it, I still felt that I got more out of it than ""OGF"". Is it obvious of what it's getting across? With the fashion industry, yes, but with everything else, no. I think plenty of re-watches might help, as I do want to watch this again. Elle Fanning was pretty fantastic as the beautiful but dangerous Jesse. But I thought Jena Malone steals the show, as she brilliant. Her character dose the most unnerving things that you can't even imagine, but still manages to be attractive. Oh and I can't look at Keanu Reeves the same way again after this. He's good in this but...damn. Refen characters are not from this earth. The opening sequence to this movie is just magnificent. It's everything that a movie should do to get you engaged. The staging was on point, the framing was flawless and Cliff Martinez amazing soundtrack blasting in your ears was just icing. It left a massive smile on my face. Where do I even begin with the soundtrack in this movie. It's sexy, stylish with a bit of glitter and just pure magic. It's probably one of my favorite soundtracks of this year. Cliff Martinez is just a fantastic composer that always delivers that excellent 80's vibe in he's music. Even topping his previous work which I didn't expect him to do. There's some things in this that I did pick up on that I'm not sure if others have. The cannibalism in the movie is basically another way of looking at the industry of modeling, with models who actually do starve themselves to death just to get the perfect shape. Basically letting your body eat itself, which is cannibalism. I might be over thinking things, but I thought to throw it in there as a cool little thing to bring to the table. Everyone in this film sounds so fake and shallow, and that's not even a complaint. Beauty from the outside but shallow and dead from the inside. It's all intentional. It's not a perfect film. The story is flat and the dialogue is really bad in a few scenes. It can be quite stupid at times, but I'm glad it doesn't take itself too seriously. This isn't for everyone, as I already have seen two sides to this. You either love it or hate it, and I can understand both reasons. Different strokes for different folks. Overall rating: The Neon Demon is a disturbing and yet beautiful film that's very hard to recommend. While not my favorite of Refn, but it's pretty damn close, like third place. I honestly can see this having a cult following in the future. I really do.",The Neon Demon
70,Dragonborn64,Fashion is Evil and You'll Sell Your Soul,9,15 February 2019,The metaphors are heavy. Jena Malone says to newbie Elle Fanning - Lipstick sells best when named for food or sex. What are you? Food or sex? Some visually amazing scenes - namely Elle's cross to the dark side quite literally falling in love with herself. It's a slippery slope. The moon plays heavily. This is not for everyone and the director is obviously obsessed with the occult. I loved it.,The Neon Demon
71,CineMuseFilms,"the price of beauty is hyper-vanity, deadly jealousy and a smattering of bright red cannibalism",7,16 November 2016,"There is something innately intriguing about the film title The Neon Demon (2016). Perhaps it's the tension between neon brightness and evil darkness that draws us like moths to a flame or maybe it's the imagined devil coming into the light. In any case, the imagery is perfect for what is a parody thriller-horror about the shining promises of the fashion industry and the dark dangers that lurk within for the innocent young. This is a grim tale about the worship of unattainable perfection and the belief that ""true beauty is the highest currency we have"". The price of beauty in this film is hyper-vanity, deadly jealousy and a smattering of bright red cannibalism, all of which makes The Neon Demon an original addition to its genre.The opening scenes compel the voyeurism that is lifeblood to the fashion industry: a reclining young model dripping with blood while flashbulbs immortalise her beauty into captivity. Sixteen year-old Jesse (Elle Fanning) has just arrived in Los Angeles and lied about her age to get into modelling. She stands out for her wide-eyed 'deer in the headlight' naivette and ephemeral other- worldly beauty and is immediately noticed by fashion industry exploiters and lesser mortals. With feigned innocence that disguises her inner narcissism, she is quickly preyed upon by human and other predators.It's pointless to describe specific incidences or plot twists as this mashup montage of horror, thriller, and melodrama is all about atmospheric metaphors. Several scenes are composed with pure artistry and Jesse is the artwork. Her friends turn out to be enemies and nobody in this industry cares for anyone except themselves. It is a world of pixels not principles, and everything is false image and silicon-pumped body parts to shame other women into buying empty promises. Again we are reminded ""beauty isn't the only thing: it's everything"".What makes this film so engaging is how Jesse seems to float angelic-like across such a brightly lit but ugly canvas. Different makeup styles depict her variously as a Grecian goddess or a metallic super-woman while those around her remain trapped in the ordinariness of their bodies and their lives. The mascara-thin values that drive the models are glorified with high-glamour photography, only to be revealed as a facade hiding a primitive blood-lust and taste for human body parts. Elle Fanning plays her part with softly-spoken understatement but overwhelming aesthetic presence. This is a clever film with several surprise turns that leave you guessing what will happen. Perfect viewing for someone aspiring to be a model.",The Neon Demon
72,MovieCriticOnline,I have no clue what I just watched.,2,25 February 2019,"First, mad kudos to Natasha Braier for the amazing cinematography. Love the look of it, even though it felt maybe a little staged (too much of set designs), but it fitted this dreamy film. However, I cannot say the same thing about the story. It was just bizarre. Too artsy for my taste.The acting seemed fine, which is usually an issue in most films. A little too derivative from David Mamet perhaps (Mamet's style is very wooden/deadpan). Either way, it didn't bother me too much. I'm still trying to figure out, however, what the movie was about. They could have gone in a different and better direction with maybe pushing the lead, Elle, to doing different crazy stuff, sexual, etc, but although the trailer sorta implied that was happening we really never saw it come to fruition.Other movies have explored the theme of someone entering a new business and getting pushed into things they would have never done otherwise. Again, this movie just didn't even go there. It teased, but never went there. Too bad.It wasn't a horror movie. It wasn't a sexual/love story. It was a very confused movie.",The Neon Demon
73,peefyn,Naive?,8,28 March 2017,"Is beauty good or bad, or something beyond the both of them? The movie does seem to argue that beauty is something that exist, but also that it does not have to be something positive. If ""beauty is everything"", and there is nothing else - which is stated in the film - then everything we see in it must be seen as some sort of comment on beauty. My main gripe with this movie is just that: whatever the movie says about beauty, it does not feel all that profound or fresh. The symbolism used is at times very on the nose and obvious. Almost naive, as if someone who has never had anything to do with the LA beauty scene decides to make a critical story set in it. (That last sentence was not really meant as negative assumption towards Refn, because I do like the movie he has made.) It is a compelling movie to watch, because it is both beautiful and disgusting. Mostly clean, but at times utterly vulgar. I also enjoyed the movie's several turns into the ""odd"". It all made me really enjoy the movie, but it was also despite itself, as the story itself and the thematic exploration seemed to me to be almost banal. But somehow it works.",The Neon Demon
74,James_De_Bello,7.5/10,8,12 June 2016,"A cocktail of sensual experience and craziness, ""The Neon Demon"" is a cinematic endeavor that deserves to be lived in the widest screen possible and whilst you will probably not walk out of it emotionally clear or satisfied, you will have had a mind trip in the weirdest possible directions and a physical reaction to it that is something I rarely ever get with films.Right from the opening to the very end this film is all about aesthetic and visual beauty, both explicitly and thematically. The latter part might be the less successful element of the film, but as long as this movie was playing I didn't really care. The viewer sinks into a world and no matter how dark and fuc*ed up it appears to be, I wanted more of it. Natasha Braier gives us some of the best cinematography there is: both visually breath taking and inventive in its storytelling. Come to think of it, this film is very close to Anotnioni's ""Blow Up"" stylistically, dialogue is barely given any importance and serves more as a connective tissue throughout the crazy journey we are taken through.To talk about the visuals in this film proves to be very difficult, both because they are so clearly and complexly assembled and thought out, both for their immense beauty and abstraction, there are a number dolly shots scattered around the film that work magnificently, with superb staging and lighting, they were definitely highlights of this visual masterpiece. Yet, the images of this film are only one part of the many that combine seamlessly in making a piece of art that overcomes its flaws with the sheer value of the overwhelming sensual and moving feelings you get to live.Cliff Martinez is just as deserving as Braier and Refn, his score is spot on with the tone of the film and ranges from unsettling and scary atmospheres to full on techno and it all molds perfectly, the way in which some parts of the film over power the sound with music pumped loud and clear to serve the story were really original and didn't bluntly imitate for example Sorrention's way of doing it, which could have been very easy, there was a unique voice behind the camera and that is always something that is good to see. Moreover, the performances are all particular and special in their own way. Elle Fanning goes to places that are uncomfortable and fascinating to see explored, Jena Malone goes even further and manages to make you buy into it. Yet the standout for me is Abbey Lee, when I first saw her last year in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", I wrote in my review that she really had something special and this is the proof of it, her prescience on screen is stunning and she manages to build a character visually first.Thematically, as I said before, the film struggles to emerge, there is not a deep emotional connection established, no particular pay off nor a profound or interesting moral, yet the film clearly isn't as interested in being a traditional, three act story and that comes with both pros and cons.I wasn't turned off by anything in ""The Neon Demon"", I had a blast and actually could care to watch it again on the big screen and whilst I didn't get too much of an emotionally satisfying experience I definitely had a lot for my mind to process.",The Neon Demon
75,markgorman,I loved it. That's not to say you will though.,8,19 July 2016,"This is a marmite number I would say. In Drive, Nicola Wynding Refn made a stonewall classic that was so cool, so violent it just oozed class. No real reference points although I think some people found it reminiscent of Heat.In this latest outing however Refn is wearing his influences on his sleeve and most obvious of them all is David Lynch (in his Twin Peaks/Mullholland Drive era).Again it oozes class thanks to the superb cinematography by Natasha Braier and this astonishing electronic soundtrack (following up his Drive opus) by Cliff Martinez.It's achingly slow partly so that Braier can seduce the film's lead ( a very young looking Elle Fanning) with her camera, and boy can she look stunningly beautiful (albeit verging on Lolitaesque).The violence is slow in coming but eventually it does with an ending that smacks a little of Heathers.The story is slight. The theme is around natural beauty that only Fanning possesses. Her rivals on the catwalk world, that she breezes into in LA, have been nipped and cut to blazes in a vain attempt to preserve their once natural beauty.Needless to say, they hate her; the new Queen Bitch.Overall it feels a little voyeuristic. The treatment of Fanning verges on the uncomfortable and the plot is pretty weak. But it's a thing of beauty. An artifice. But so what?Sometimes art survives on artifice alone.This does.",The Neon Demon
76,eagandersongil,Perfection through the death of naturalness,8,26 September 2017,"Luxuria, Glamor, Envy, Perfection, Ego, Narcissism and more ... ""Demon of Neon"" finds the point and explores the world of perfect human beings, where naturalness shocks, and robotic is accepted, where perfection can be reflected in the mirror and where ""everything that the human being has, is its beauty"", this is the world of the film of director Nicolas Refn, a film under-appreciated by criticism and by the public, which tells a sarcastically sensational and a beautiful technical and visual. The plot of the film has a simple premise, and focuses on a linearity and the character of Jesse, but with the course, the secondary characters are gaining strength until finally steal the film. A kind of ""Black Swan"" on the contrary, because here our protagonist is already perfect, and the others around her who seek this perfection in her, with an air David Lynch and using subjectivity, ""Demon Neon"" is a spectacle, entering as far as possible into the human ego it shows that perfection goes beyond the very concept of humanity, and the search delimits the character and submits decency to nothing, the long produces and shows a world where what really counts is appearances , and he does not have to do it with dialogues, he says it in small details, like the make-up that Jesse is wearing in his moment of ""change,"" or in his parade where she kisses her appearance in a metaphor of marriage to herself, the film uses a variety of script resources, from this dialogue to subjectivity to show its idea, and after a while this becomes so natural, that Nicolas begins to introduce elements of pure savagery, such as rape, cannibalism, murder and even necrophilia, shocking? no, not at all, the shocking thing is the human indifference to savagery when your goal is to be perfect and your lust wipes out your humanity. The film technically is a very detailed, with a camera always searching the center, and a photograph that plays with games of lights, reflecting the climate of the scene, although at times, it seems that Nicolas plays with the photography of random way but nevertheless , is a very beautiful work, we also have a good track, good set that gives a very good rhythm to the film, even the same being sometimes very contemplative, a great makeup and costumes, technically, ""Devil De Neon"" is pure whim, and it's one of the most technically beautiful thriller movies I've ever seen. Elle Fannng is great in her role, and can pass the tone of innocent girl and bad girl when it is necessary, Jena Malone tabem is giant, beautiful and passing a hidden air, her character is the synthesis of the doubt, she wants the carnal perfection and sentimental, at the same time that the two are in conflict, the other actresses are robotic, even in their postures at the table, and this is not bad, is great, which proves that has no weakness in the cast. ""De Neon"" is not perfect, his moral that preaches a vision that nothing can be perfect and natural for a long time proves itself in the evaluation of the film, he can be perfect in some aspects, but his naturalness dies, and sometimes it is even a little forced, but it is still a great movie and a psychological suspense of quality, with questions, good technique, and great outcome, because this is the most dangerous thing in a movie, its end, it can ruin the work, and it seems that it will happen with ""Devil De Neon"", because it has a ready and great ending, there the film lengthens 2 more scenes, showing a final more than great, perfect, where perfection is reached, dead humanity and digested naturalness.",The Neon Demon
77,kgprophet,Experiment in Deliberate Style over Substance,5,30 June 2016,"I doubt Refn himself tries that hard to legitimise the imagery, along with the story arc, of this film. Perhaps like some visual artists, they will deliberately obscure any real meaning and allow the observer to find their own meaning. Refn takes a visual approach to the storytelling, with only sparse dialogue to spell out what we can decipher in the setup. Such as an MTV video of the early 90's period, when music video became high art, the synthesiser score mates the theme of this film ""Ultimate Beauty"". With such striking imagery, Refn lingers on each shot to turn it into a fashion photo. There is certainly is no doubt that Refn is a directorial force to be reckoned with. He gets strong performances from his actors. He can be genuinely disturbing to the point that you almost are flinching waiting for something violent to happen. The best news about this experiment, is that it was impossible to pigeonhole the production as ""Lynchian"" or ""Kubrick-esque"". When you feel the drift into the hallucinatory world, it is a different experience compared to what Lynch might do. I paid to see this film in the theatre because I believe Refn is one of the more important filmmakers around right now. His half-successful experiments are far more interesting for me than the umpteenth remake of Tarzan. One thing for sure is that Refn will continue to make films worth paying attention to. And some of those future films will be considered masterpieces. However, on this outing, I can applaud the fact that Refn has found his voice in recent films, but needs to allow some depth into the drama. You can certainly wait until the DVD comes out to give this one a try. However, the cinematography is the best I've seen so far this year, and I was satisfied to see such mesmerising visuals on the big screen.",The Neon Demon
78,Ramascreen,"It's a cruel, cruel world, and Nicolas Winding Refn disturbingly captures it in his own cruel, cruel way",9,22 June 2016,"I think THE NEON DEMON is a fabulous horror that many would mistakenly file under a WTF film. Writer/director Nicolas Winding Refn is one of the few original voices out there, I've been a fan of his work for quite some time and this latest, THE NEON DEMON is nothing short of fascinating. Mysteriously sexy, hypnotic, shocking and scary yet very irresistible. It allures you, it seduces you and ultimately it devours you.Elle Fanning plays an aspiring model named Jesse, your typical small town U.S.A girl who moves to Los Angeles in pursuit of her dream. Things start to go well for her, so well that other girls in the business start to see her as a threat. Turns out, there's something about her youth and vitality that leaves some in awe and others in hatred.Let me say that Elle Fanning is a remarkable young talent, she's so captivating on screen, to the point where at times I don't even remember anymore that she actually has a sister, Dakota, who used to be in a string of big budget movies. As the aspiring model Jesse, you can see Fanning's wide range of skills on display as she goes through Jesse's arc from innocent to dangerous. It's quite amusing to see Jena Malone, Abbey Lee, and Bella Heathcote play these supporting characters who are basically jealous of Elle Fanning's beauty, I say amusing because my goodness, Jena, Abbey, Bella and Elle are all beautiful in my book, any guy would be damn lucky to be in the company of those four gorgeous ladies.But watching THE NEON DEMON is a total mind-trip, so many colors and so many artistic or creative choices that may seem brazen but they fit the story well. Refn is never one to shy away from experimenting with new possibilities and illustrations just to get his point across, even with the accompaniment of graphic violence. Like a fly that can't keep its eyes off of a UV light, that's how the audiences will be fixated on this film. That said, at the very heart of it, THE NEON DEMON speaks about society's view on youth and beauty, especially when it comes to women. It's no secret that when one hits a certain age, even when she still looks fine by regular standard, all of a sudden, certain industries no longer see her as beautiful. I'm reminded of that classic fairy tale when the mirror tells the witch she's not the fairest of them all, THE NEON DEMON also depicts the ruthlessness of the competition that comes out of such deep envy. It's a cruel, cruel world, and Refn disturbingly captures it in his own cruel, cruel way.-- Rama's Screen --",The Neon Demon
79,jayjaycee,Visually disturbing descent into an abyss of beauty and envy,7,13 November 2020,"""The Neon Demon"" is a 2016 horror thriller directed by Nicolas Winding Refn starring Elle Fanning and Jena Malone.
⚪
All in all, this dazzling Nicolas Winding Refn feature captivatingly parades on a gloomy catwalk of beau ideals, obsession with slenderness and unadulterated envy, and even if there are some weaknesses concerning pace and plot, the bizarrely hypnotic imagery, taciturn but distinct performances and an indescribably unnerving score make for a subliminally ruthless and subtly disturbing, fluorescent fever dream that impressively and radically exposes the mercilessness and perfidy of being a glamorous model.
⚪
After many of my fellow cinephiles have told me that this NWR is slightly underrated and didn't deserve any of the hate it has received from critics, I thought that it was a must watch for me. Honestly, I didn't know what I was in for. All I knew was that the director of the brilliantly cruising drama ""Drive"" directed Elle Fanning in a bizarre thriller about models and fashion. Basically, that's the gist of the film, but how it was executed was what had an impact on me. Once again, I can comprehend why one might dislike it, because the Danish director's style is anything but ordinary, and only when you can appreciate it, you will find a gem with this film. Yes, it is absolutely unconventional, and this concept shows itself in all facets of this odd feature. First of all, I would like to point out Elle Fanning who scintillates in one of her first leading roles. At the age of only sixteen (yes, when shooting started she was underaged!), she managed to capture the vulnerability, insecurity and innocence of her character extremely convincingly, and it is her who, in fact, carries most of the film with her performance. She plays the juvenile Jesse who tries to become a fashion model, and, thanks to her often-referred natural beauty, eventually manages to get into the business, what, of course, inadvertently makes her make enemies. Well, what admittedly sounds like a generic reality TV show ends up being a distressing nightmare. What else did you expect from the dude who made ""Drive""? Light fare? As the tag line on many advertisements state, beauty is the only thing, and the film follows this premise in one of the most disturbing and ominous ways possible. Gradually, Jesse succeeds in the business and is more and more consumed by vanity, egoism and arrogance, and the shy little girl from the beginning is gone completely in the end. And I mean, literally. It wouldn't be a work of NWR if it wasn't grotesque, but before I'll talk about the outrageous final act, I want to point out the equally dark undertones preceding it as well. As you might have noticed, I have purposely remarked on several occasions that Jesse is merely sixteen years old. You may ask why, and I am going to tell you: In many scenes the young girl is exposed to misconduct of all kinds. From her best friend who tries to hit on her, over a photographer who forces her to undress in order to lubricate her with golden paint, to a make-up artist trying to rape her, there is all, including Keanu Reeves as a shady motel owner who contributes a little perversity as well. I for one was shocked to see that Refn in fact depicted all those scenes despite the actor and the character being a minor, but then I came to the conclusion that it is not even as unworldly as I thought. I might not have been a model myself (wait, I have been once, but I was a kid), but I know how hideous and unpredictable humans can be. The real world is merciless and hard-hearted, especially to young women. That's why I thought that the scandalous things depicted in here are as shocking as they are realistic, and that wasn't even all. Right under the surface of this apparently shallow film seethes a callous conflict, and how Refn does criticise the business deserves major respect. Almost casually, by short and rushed lines of dialogue, he subliminally expresses his extreme criticism on the entire industry. When a perverse photographer touches a minor, a company chef fires a candidate without looking at her or when an opponent model proudly brags about her plastic surgery, there is this intense feeling of disgust, and its always palpable. By the example of Jesse, he wants to show the severe conflict of ""natural beauty vs. artificial beauty"" and how the two extremes act accordingly. As she is becoming more and more successful, the protagonist falls for egotism, and the once humble girl turns into an condescending little princess. The curious thing about this film is how this development takes place, and that is how I also come to my first point of criticism. There is zero to little dialogue in this film, and the intensity is primarily carried by its disturbing and bizarre imagery, and even if it is possible that a film can in fact succeed doing this (see ""Portrait Of A Lady On Fire"") it is a risky thing to do. This one here is not always on point, and the inconsistency amazes me. Many sequences are exciting yet bland, impressive yet unimposing, vacuous yet meaningful. You know what I mean? At the same time, I grasp what he wants to state and have no clue about what he wants to tell me. It showcases raw emotions, feelings and simultaneously it keeps its distance which in turn keeps me from finding a deep connection to both the characters or the story. There is a certain intensity this film causes, but I wonder how it would have haunted me even more if it had been, in fact, closer. You know what I mean? Well, therefore the final act compensated this feeling, because it is downright shocking! True to the motto ""pride comes before a fall"" Jesse pays the price for her arrogance by, well, falling. As if the necrophilia depicted before wasn't dreadful enough, cannibalism comes into the play as well. After she has neglected or outdone them, her former friend and two peers decide to kill her ... and then eat her and bath in her blood as well. I was like ""What in the actual hell?"" only to be reminded that it just perfectly rounds up the alleged exaggeratedness Refn accuses the industry of. And in the final scene, when one of the cannibalistic models throws up Jesse's undigested eye and kills herself, and her friend picks up and eats it without batting an eye, the preposterousness has reached its climax. Before you are able to ask questions, the credits roll and leave you completely disgusted and shattered. In the end, it is one of those odd, crazy and unusual films that were never meant to be mainstream films. It is pure independent cinema and definitely not everyone's pair of shoes, but what did you expect from Nicolas Winding Refn? I for one was able to find a liking to this unconventional work, and even if it has its obvious flaws, it left a severe impact on me.",The Neon Demon
80,jawneyfloros,weird but enjoyable,9,20 November 2018,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it is a case study of how shallow and the shelf life of models in the spotlight. The direction and screenplay are both really good. The casting and acting are both really good also. All in all I would give this four out of a possible five stars.,The Neon Demon
81,jackmeat,Visually stunning but so painfully slow,5,22 October 2016,"My quick rating - 5,1/10. Highly rated movie on IMDb that deserves kudos for all the technical stuff that goes into making a film. Excellent camera work, lighting, etc. All the good stuff you take out of film school, and then usually lose when you make it to Hollywood. As of yet, the is something that has not happened to Nicolas Winding Refn quite yet. Although I would like to see a quality story to go with it. In what is not a horror movie in the slightest we have a girl caught up in the grown ups world of being a starlet. This overcomes her and leads her down a bizarre trip where she loses her sanity and becomes enthralled with the pageant world. There are all kinds of other underlying themes written in and anyone who enjoyed this movie is free to write about it. I basically plodded through a very slow movie that all the flash on screen, even the strange imagery, couldn't sustain. The characters were all so stiff (which I assume they were supposed to be) that I couldn't care less about them including the lead. I personally don't recommend it just for the boredom factor but anyone aspiring to get into film, this is a nice treat of how to use those cameras and edit the film well. Beyond educational purposes, you are left with very little.",The Neon Demon
82,Rendanlovell,Waste of technical craft,7,25 June 2016,"'The Neon Demon' is the latest film from director Nicolas Winding Refn. Much like his previous movie 'Only God Forgives', this one is quite polarizing. It seems that early screenings had people either cheering or straight up booing. For me I'm kind of right down the middle. The film is about a young girl that is trying to break into the world of modeling. After she signs with an agent she starts getting work at an alarming rate. Needless to say this makes the other models, who have been working for far longer, pretty upset. And that's the basic run down of this films story.Of course if that was the only thing that the story had to offer I probably would be one of the people that did not like this. Even though many people hate on Refn's latest two films, I can't say they are bad movies. Did I really enjoy either of them? Not really. But when watching this movie it's impossible for me to ignore the technical craft behind it.Because this film is absolutely beautiful to look at. The production design, color grading, and lighting is all incredibly well done. Each scene is set up in the most perfect way. This is what I appreciate most about Refns work. His natural knack for style is something that you don't get to see very often.Top that off with excellent cinematography and a superb soundtrack and you have a movie that is a sensory masterpiece. Where I want to focus most is on this films story though. Because it has me at a cross road. There are a lot of things that work well inside that story and a lot of things that just don't. For one, the message that it is trying to convey is actually really great. It talks about how far some people will go for fame and fortune. Whilst also harping on how beauty is perceived in our culture today. One of the best scenes in the movie is when a fashion designer is arguing with someone about how beauty is the only thing that matters. It did a great job of putting into perspective how little people care about personal identity. This created an interesting contrast with the films characters. Not one single person had any kind of personality to be found. While I wish that this was an intentional choice, it never really goes any deeper into the beauty is everything argument. Which makes me think that this was not something done on purpose.Without anyone remotely interesting this film is very hard to sit through. I found myself constantly checking my watch or playing with my on fingers in order to pass the time better. It tries so hard to be something different that it forgets to do the most basic thing, make even pacing. Until the last act of the movie, the pacing is all over the place. The first half of the movie pretends to be a generic underdog type story and last half a completely unique visual metaphor. ​ Without anything holding your attention the last act of the film feels way out of left field. It introduces new character motives that don't go anywhere, new plot points that feel forced, and not so subtle visual symbolism. I was never confused about the symbolism the movie introduced but, by the end, none of it paid off. Everything ended up feeling crammed into place without much thought of why it should be there. As I left the theater, I was left with a dry taste in my mouth. Not only because the last thirty minutes are pure shock value but because I felt like nothing really went anywhere. It's a movie that has a lot to say, and while some of it works, the majority feels forced and poorly evened out. It wasted the visual style and overall technical achievements with bland, uneven storytelling. 'The Neon Demon' begs to be talked about and I will talk about it, but probably not in the way Refn intended.",The Neon Demon
83,mike-c-b,Nobody can relate to art this low.,1,30 April 2019,"There is absolutely no humanity or common sense.One scene to skip to that underlines the movie is where Elle Fannings character is told to take everything off in a photoshoot. - She acts like a deer in the headlights (unrealistic), no one says relax (unrealistic), the photographer acts like a serial killer (unrealistic), he walks out of the dark and slaps gold paint on her using slow-motion attacking movements (unrealistic), shot from the shoulders up (cowardly) so you don't see how rediculous the whole scene is.In other scenes, people bath in blood as if the artistic message is they're suffering for their art. In reality, in the model world, if you don't like what you're doing you get out of the kitchen because no one wants to see a depressed person. Nobody buys that product.It's an example of a confused director who thinks being upbeat is the devil and so has sought to be as downbeat, slow, confused, and psychotic as possible... Then stick it all in a film as if it's art.",The Neon Demon
84,MogwaiMovieReviews,"Silent, haunting moments, drawn out and dwelt upon",8,20 September 2016,"Just been transfixed by Nicolas Winding Refn's new film 'The Neon Demon'.At its shallowest it looks like little more than a Daft Punk video, but at its richest it feels like Mulholland Drive meeting Suspiria - or Black Swan if Black Swan had actually been a good film - a glamour magazine cover come to appalling life, with each scene a delicious, opulent moving painting.Not an enormous amount going on in way of story, but full of silent, haunting moments drawn out and dwelt upon, and some interesting meditations on the nature and power of women's beauty. I came away thinking the meaning is more in those individual moments, what they say about the characters, the story, and the world we live in, than in the logistics of the longer tale.It struck me too how it's a film that would easily pass the 'Bechdel test', given that 90% of the time there are only women on the screen, and they never talk about relationships, only their careers and looks and plastic surgeons. But then there is also an attempted lesbian rape of the protagonist, and the other three principal female characters turn out to be utter, inexcusable, necrophiliac and cannibalistic monsters, with no attempt to explain away their monstrousness because of 'The Patterwacky' or 'The Male Gaze' or 'a man made her do it' or whatever else, so the feminists will probably not have a clue what to make of it, which for me of course only added to the attraction.If you don't like your films slow and quiet, you probably won't like this, but if you do like dazzling cinematography and brooding moods, set to warm, pulsing electronic beats, you might well find something in here to think on and carry away with you.",The Neon Demon
85,ritera1,Could have been extraordinary but,8,25 December 2016,"stumbled in several instances. Very atmospheric and gritty. Excellent mood and pacing. Original and horrific.But several portions where greatness was missed. And two scenes that were just terrible.I just didn't understand the casting of Fanning. After awhile I realized that it didn't matter what she looked like. The role was a metaphor. There was a film called Suture that had two characters that were suppose to be identical. They were played by a white and black actor.Right off the bat something that tells us that what she looked like didn't matter as they were telling a story about an idea of beauty. Making her fat would have thrown it into the ridiculous, but something like a scar. Maybe a scar that becomes more pronounced but is not evident to the characters, only the audience.The next mistake was in the bathroom when the model breaks the mirror. Fanning confesses that she knows that the world stops when she walks into the room. But it was delivered so flat. This is suppose to show us that she has a potential to use her power for evil. But it farts out. But the mood in the scene was very thick with tension despite that.The scene where Fanning closes the show is interesting but vague. I see the evil in the mirror but don't really feel it.The ""beauty is everything"" scene in the red restaurant was terrible. Choppy and scatterbrained. Same with the following scene at the motel on the stairs. The subsequent two scenes in Fanning's motel room were clearly horrific, including her curiosity.I was confused by Keanu Reeves casting. He did a good job at being a s't, but was still a very good looking s't. He needed to look the part and didn't. Maybe it was going against type, but didn't work.Not much beyond that but a lot of very moody scenes that were very long. But they generally worked, by and large.",The Neon Demon

The music score is phenomenal and Refn definitely has an eye for something, but like Only God Forgives, I have no clue what this film was about. Yet I liked it, kind of sort of. Perhaps Refn doesn't know what the film is about either. Maybe he just put it out there like a work of art for the viewing public to subjectively give their opinion on. Who knows.

89,TheRedDeath30,An Art Film Short Drawn Out into Two Hours,3,6 February 2017,"I love all kinds of horror, from the major studio to crude independent productions, from the gore filled to the psychological, from the blatant to the metaphorical. As I fall deeper down the rabbit hole of the horror genre and discover more styles and more nationalities, I am drawn increasingly to the artistic horror film because I'm looking for something different. These movies, though, can be very hard to judge and are usually very divisive. Those who love them will insult the haters' intelligence, while those that hate them love to throw out words like ""pretentious"".Let's get things out of the way, then. There are ways to make artistic horror, with gorgeous imagery and do it well. There are ways to present stylistic moving paintings in your camera shot and still bring the audience a story and a plot that are entertaining. Then, there are movies like this. We can sit here and argue cinematography and camera angles, shot selection and color. The fact is that those things really only matter to an intellectual few who either write reviews for certain zines and blogs, or went to film school and have long since forgotten what made them love movies in the first place.Yes, this movie is gorgeous to behold. I will not argue that with anyone for a moment. There are stunning shots, including the book end shots of the opening and closing segments, very similar scenes that weave images into a tapestry of visual stimulation. I was so intrigued by that opening shot and really thought that I was in for something spectacular, but this movie is full of empty calories. It looks good, it tastes good, it makes you want to come back and sample a little more, but in the end you find that you're still hungry for something with substance.Most of the movie watching public wants a plot. We want some action. I have a degree in Literature and a love of horror. I'm fine with metaphor. I'm fine with hidden meaning. I'm fine with symbolism, but much better film makers have been able to do those things and still bring a fantastic movie, from Argento to Bava to Kubrick, there are ways to bring a visual feast and still fill my hunger with something sustaining. Even the little bit of meaning and metaphor that is here is so boring and mundane. The glamorous world of modeling ultimately devours people. The innocent usually fall when pride takes over. Jealousy is a cruel beast that will inflict deadly harm. These story arcs have been done so many times that they're cliché. Yet, I find so many reviews here praising this guy like he's some sort of genius for putting these thoughts on film.I was really hoping for something like BLACK SWAN mixed with a better version of STARRY EYES. Something that could take that artistic horror spin and use it to really say something or give me something meaningful. This is nothing more than a Calvin Klein television ad, drawn out for two interminable hours, with a brief moment of actual horror tacked on to the end to say that they've given us a denouement. I rarely give ratings below a 5 on this site because most movies don't deserve them. I really thought to myself that I've seen plenty of ""artsy horror"" films get bad reviews on this site and I usually like a lot of them myself, but in this case it deserves every nasty review you've seen and more.",The Neon Demon

91,darkreignn,Jaw-droppingly beautiful,9,25 June 2016,"""The Neon Demon"" is the newest film by polarizing director Nicolas Winding Refn, who made the critically acclaimed ""Drive,"" and the critically panned ""Only God Forgives."" With ""The Neon Demon,"" Refn returns to make a bold film that some people love because of its dreamlike aesthetics and messages about the fashion industry, and others absolutely hate for its supposed lack of substance and perverse content. On one hand, it makes sense why people wouldn't like this movie. It's disturbing, it's slow (but never boring), the characters are unlikeable, and the film has a very minimalistic story. But on the other hand, this movie is magnetic. From start to finish your eyes will be glued to the screen, with your jaw agape in absolute awe of how incredibly stunning this movie is to look at. Elle Fanning plays Jesse, a 16 year old model who breaks into the fashion world with a bang because of her natural, unadulterated beauty. Jesse almost immediately gains the attention of professional photographers, modeling agencies, and basically everyone she comes across because of the fact that she radiates innocence, goodness, and, of course, beauty. This quickly makes Gigi and Sarah, the more experienced, more hardened models, jealous, as Jesse makes it big almost immediately with no effort, while they actually have to work at staying pretty.That is basically the plot of the film, and while it's not incredibly deep or complex, it is consistently interesting and never boring because of just how unpredictable this movie is. From the cast of characters (Keanu Reeves is fantastic in this, playing a dark and hilarious role, and Jena Malone completely steals the entire film as Ruby), to the surreal fashion runway sequences, to the clinically insane third act, you'll never be able to guess what is hiding around the corner.""The Neon Demon"" is easily one of the most gorgeous films of this year. The colors, the clothing, the sets, the music, the actresses, the violence; everything about this film just screams pretty. This movie is basically a two hour long feast for the eyes and for the ears, and because of this one could say that this movie is the epitome of style over substance. But is that really a bad thing? In a film that depicts the superficiality, vanity, and on-the-surface beauty of the fashion industry by being superficial, vain, and beautiful on the surface, the answer is no.",The Neon Demon
92,songod-95003,Not as Advertised,2,1 September 2016,"Labeling this a horror movie was extremely misleading. Thriller, okay, yes there was a sense of unease and tension in the film that carried through all of the scenes; but nothing supernatural. I concede that horror and supernatural do not necessarily equate each other, but the trailers all indicated some dark secret about Jessie when there was nothing but beauty and a modicum of innocence. When the lines ""You know what my mother called me? Dangerous."" come I expected Jessie to take flight!But no. The horror of this was all in a real world setting with real people committing a horrible act on a real person. There are people who eat human flesh (as a delicacy). There are people who have sex with corpses. It is when the people who are eaten or abused in death come for you that you have horror.An indie film from last year, ""Starry Eyes"", while not shot as stylistically as ""The Neon Demon"", is a better film. It makes no bones about what it is. ""The Neon Demon"" doesn't appear to know what it is and when it decides chickens out and does not show the true graphic horror! If it were not for the way the film was shot I'd say it was a complete POS.Another disappointment was that Elle Fanning proves she is no Dakota Fanning; as she could not fully carry this film.Everyone else fared better acting wise though the models playing models were so feral from the moment we saw them it was really no surprise they resorted to extremes.Keanu? Could have been any actor. Nothing special added and not an embarrassment.Have to low ball this and give it a 2; and that only for the cinematography and lighting design.",The Neon Demon
93,FallenEye,Feast Your Eyes.,5,17 May 2018,"Somebody is presumably being killed, and Jesse didn't know who to call, so, she calls someone who can provide absolutely zero help or protection for the person in danger. Too bad Wyclef Jeans ""Someone please call 911"" wasn't playing somewhere within all these dreams and visions we were subjected to. But, that's the thing with ""art"" films I guess; logic or reasoning isn't really the primary goal or defining characteristic.This films' payoff is actually pretty amazing, however sadly, it being attached to a body of work about as powerful as an atrophied arm swinging in zero gravity, meant its punch was almost unrecognizable and could've easily been mistaken for a baby fist bump.Also, Elle Fanning isn't nearly as pretty as one would need to be to play the character she's supposed to be portraying. Perhaps this may not mean anything in the grand scheme of things, but given the subject matter, I feel that maybe, it may just mean everything.The Photography is quite stunning, the performances were on and off like flickering neon lights, and the character development and handling was depicted well enough for almost all except the lead while the script had some moments of merit.

The Neon Demon is visually stunning and has a hypnotizing quality thanks to the combination of images and the excellent soundscapes delivered by Refn's house composer Cliff Martinez. The film's story seems superficial and shallow and all focused on looks very much mirroring the world of modeling which is what this movie is about. It's hard to describe this movie, you have to like the 'feel' and style of it. For me this movie proves that movies don't always have to be story driven but rather can be works of visual art.

Finale served a purpose artistically and justified the slow build.

For all its incredible imagery, the plot is a little too pedestrian even if not entirely predictable.This movie is a feast for the eyes but offers somewhat less in the way of mental and emotional nourishment.Still, a worthy, sumptuously guilty visual pleasure so long as you're not expecting Cronenberg level horror-craft.",The Neon Demon

99,isantistao,"Well Done Cinematography and Directing, But Lacking In Other Areas",5,28 October 2019,"This film is well done when it comes to cinematography and directing, but when it comes to other areas it is lacking. First of all it is marketed as a horror movie, but it isn't a horror movie, it is a thriller. So it was disappointing when I sat down in the mood for a horror movie. It also moves too slow for the way they marketed it. If it was a psychological drama it would have been fine. But I thought it was going to have more action, so it didn't meet my expectations. When the horror does come, there's no real action and killing. They do however gross you out by showing you some of the most disgusting things you'll ever see in film.Third of all, the story is flawed in my opinion. Elle Flannings character is envied by all of these super models who are so much hotter than her. And yet in this film they act like she is super model hot and all of these other models pale in comparison. Anyone with eyes can see how flawed that is. She is more of a cute but plain girl next door type and these super models make her look even plainer in comparison. So the whole premise of the story just doesn't work for me.Its a shame that I feel the need to give it a 5 because it has such good cinematography and directing and is so artfully well done, but the set up is very flawed and lacking and I have to be honest.

101,Morten_5,Amazingly beautiful and sharp satire -- a masterpiece,10,4 November 2017,"With ""The Neon Demon"" (2016), Danish provocateur Nicolas Winding Refn has created a masterpiece. It's a dark satire and not for everyone.Having been harshly criticised for its portrayal of females and the female body, and accused of sexism, the strength of Winding Refn's work, co-written with Mary Laws and Polly Stenham, is the subtle but ingenious way it exposes and ridicules the unsound and destructive view and treatment of women in today's society, in particular in the world of modelling, acting and singing. Benefitting largely from the breathtaking, powerful, creative, beautiful and ferociously skilled cinematography by Natasha Braier (one of very few female cinematographers), the film also has an aesthetic quality that reaches far beyond mainstream filmmaking. Adding to this the fine score by composer Cliff Martinez, the audiovisual experience grows even more. ""The Neon Demon"" is an example of truly great cinema and the work of a great artist with a visionary originality rarely seen. Nicolas Winding Refn, thank you! Please, never stop doing your thing.",The Neon Demon

Starting with something that I'm sure everyone will agree, the photography is very interesting and beautiful.
It surprised me how consistent, clear and straight forward it started, I liked how it was easy to follow but at the same time it was creating an atmosphere of tension that kept me curious on what was going to happen, even though it was quite obvious, it still kept my attention through the two first thirds of the movie.
But then it kind of lost the grip and deranged into a psychedelic trip, which can be interesting sometimes, but it felt a bit out of place here, like there was a massive change of idea and style towards the end.

105,WubsTheFadger,The Neon Demon,7,3 January 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerWord of Warning: The Neon Demon has a very complex story that contains a lot of symbolism. At first this film might be hard to follow and understand. I would recommend watching it and then look up an explanation guide on YouTube. The film gets extremely dark, gory, sexual, and plain out weird towards the end. With all that said, the story is extremely dark. The film holds a very eerie and surreal tone. Like I said before, the story is very complex, confusing, and difficult to understand. After a second viewing, I understood mostly everything but still looked up an explanation guide to further clarify. The acting at times can seem inconsistent. Especially in the case Elle Fanning's character Jesse. But the inconsistency is there for a reason. Without spoiling anything, her personality changes when she comes to terms with her true beauty. Keanu Reeves delivers the weakest performance. His character is very dry and has no depth. The amount of symbolism throughout the film is astounding. The two main symbols to look out for are beauty and the triangle.The film is slightly overlong. The film itself is about two hours, but could have been about an hour and a half.The film has a perfect blend of nudity and violence. All of the scenes that involved nudity or violence were there for a reason in order to further the symbolism and depth of the characters. Pros: Complex and dark story, consistent tone, good acting, perfect blend of nudity and violence, and a great use of symbolismCons: Keanu Reeves' dry performance, can be a difficult story to follow, and an overly long runtime Overall Rating: 7.4/10P.S. Nicolas Winding Refn's most notable films are Drive (2011) and Bronson (2008) which I would highly recommend. Also, if you really enjoyed The Neon Demon you might also enjoy Only God Forgives (2013) which was also created by Refn.",The Neon Demon

I've enjoyed his previous four films, with Drive being a personal favourite. Only God Forgive was better the second time round, I appreciated it more rewatching it and Valhalla Rising/Bronson being my introduction. Loaded with amazing, dramatic, artist shots and long pauses that teases the audience and creates an incredible tension, allowing everything to flow in epic fashion so when it hits, it hits hard. This film is intense and done so beautifully well. It's about a fresh, young Jessie coming to terms with the pretentious modelling world that appears to have chosen her. Those already there become envious of her natural beauty and undivided attention she receives, cravings leading to conniving, it becomes vicious and disturbing, cat walking more than one controversial taboo. Elle Fanning, Dakota's (The Patriot, World of The Worlds) little sister plays the lead who has an uncanny look of Carey Mulligan who was originally set to cast. We watch the metamorphosis of complete innocence, childlike empress to an almost sinister, enchanting bitch that evidently ends up as just a piece of meat. You see how misplaced and uncomfortable she is and then there's that sudden realisation, the switch and how her face changes in that elongated brief moment. Hungry Games' Jena Malone plays her seductive 'friend' and is strangely chaperoned by fellow, egotistic models Bella Heathcote (Aussie soap Neighbours, Pride & Prejudice & Zombies) and Abbey Lee (Mad Max: Fury Road, Gods of Egypt) who both resemble androids, like something from a Philip K. Dick novel. Not quite human, artificial and trying to be something else. The soundtrack is mind-blowingly good and makes fifty percent of the film. NWR's regular, Cliff Martinez does an amazing score that if you could colour music, it would be neon. Haunting, atmospheric and at times ambient. It's something like what Vangelis did for Blade Runner, dotting conversations and awkward silences with gentle sounds and then pounding the cinema with heavy beats reminiscent of a night club. There's more to this movie than even the trailer suggests and the cast and roles are intriguing and at the same time vulgar, full of self importance. This is what I expect from NWR and arty films. The cinematography being vibrant and elegant yet quite brutal and disgusting. It's not going to be for everyone's taste, maybe a selected few but for me, it's impressive filmmaking, a visionary, a clockwork neon.

112,quinimdb,The Neon Demon,8,5 December 2016,"""The Neon Demon"" starts with a shot of a woman lying on a chair with blood leaking from her neck, appearing to be dead, but lit with neon red and blue. As the camera pulls back, it is revealed that this is a model in a photo-shoot, but the audience learns through out the film that part of the joke in that shot is that models are essentially just as lifeless as a corpse, and even death is superficial and trivial to them.This level of visual brilliance is what keeps the film afloat. Almost every shot of the film is constructed to convey the greater points about these characters and this lifestyle. It is some of the dialogue of the film that ruins it to some extent. The dialogue occasionally feels forced and unsubtle, unnecessarily conveying in words what has already been communicated visually.The film is almost constantly saturated with neon reds and blues, and most of the light in the film is very artificial, just as the people. The film is filled with visual metaphors, and this is what Nicolas Winding Refn does best. As far as the performances go, they all fit their role in the movie well. I saw one user comment that the performances and dialogue made the characters seem ""lifeless"", but this was Refn's intent. He wanted to show the distance from humanity in these people who are obsessed with their own superficial image. The characters are often shown in mirrors. In fact, the first dialogue scene is done with two women facing themselves in mirrors. This shows the fundamental loneliness of these characters. They feed on others' admiration of their own beauty. It's how they feel important in a world where they are ultimately insignificant, and it's how they feel successful, because all of them have no true talent, so when a new girl comes in and reveals that they also have no true beauty, envy takes a hold of them. They become animals and consume each other, signified by the appearance of a jaguar twice and a wolf in one shot. Jesse first arrives scared, a little unsure of herself, and innocent, but due to the hostile nature of the people around her and the admiration and envy she garners, she becomes self- obsessed and distant. She places herself on a pedestal above the others.The end of the film goes way over the top, with even aspects of an exploitation film, but most of it is metaphorical rather than literal. However, some details of these scenes were unintentionally funny. For instance, the sound effect when Jesse was first punched was a cartoony and out of place sound, and the eye that the woman throws up at the end was clearly CGI, and the extreme nature of that scene came out of nowhere.Despite the occasional cheesiness of several moments, there is subtlety in this film and it is visually incredible and unique, and that is what I adore about this movie. Its themes and points and characters are all communicated through the fantastic visuals, it is only when Refn tries to communicate them through dialogue that the film falls flat.",The Neon Demon

114,Condemned-Soul,Gradually digs its way under the skin...,8,18 August 2021,"On a first watch, 'The Neon Demon' never clicked with me on a deeper level; but this time I could see below the surface - where it's dark and perverse - and understood (and liked) what I saw.This is a depraved look at beauty and the fashion industry. It's a toxic desire, a poisonous attribute, envied and lamented. Elle Fanning is like an innocent soul pestered by demons in the underworld, attracting every gaze because of her natural look and pureness, uncorrupted yet corruptible. The themes are daring, challenging, provocative.Plus it's no surprise that a film revolving around perfection is made by someone who strives to get just that in every frame of his films. Visually this is stunning; the colours are hypnotic, garish, perfect. And the score is alluring, almost retro with its use of synthesisers, further transfixing us in its unpleasant world.Overall, Nicolas Winding Refn serves up an engrossing and stylish experience that typifies him as a filmmaker. Simply put, this is a horror film, and the last half hour is proof of that. (Bring a strong stomach).8/10.",The Neon Demon
115,lois-lane33,Very Iffy.,4,2 August 2016,"I went to see this movie because it was the 'best of a bad bunch' playing at a cinema just down the street from where I was staying on vacation. I have an open mind when it comes to movies but this one stretched things a bit too far for me. I think that the writing for it was not so great. I don't think there was a believable plot development in that a) its unlikely that the lead female character would suddenly become a raving narcissist overnight, and b) its unlikely a bunch of female models who would get freaked out over a mouse would suddenly turn into Sociopathic Killers overnight. In short I thought the premise was fairly dumb and Keanu Reeves was wasted in this film because he only had a bit part in it. I think one of the reasons I went to see it was because Keanu Reeves was listed on the marque as being in it. It was technically a 'film noir' effort but it didn't really capture much of that genre which is all about intrigue and suspense-and there really isn't much of either in the movie. Since it had a lot of Scandinavian participants it might go over well in cinema circles in Europe but probably not here. The grossness at the end probably didn't help it much. No messages here-even though some people might see it as a 'scathing critique of the modeling world' and or a 'scathing critique of the state of our society in general.' Maybe. Maybe its just a crappy movie.",The Neon Demon

117,vasco_cid,The Neon Demon on Acid,7,25 August 2016,"Set in the high stakes, debatably vain and fabricated world of fashion, ""The Neon Demon"" is Nicolas Winding Refn's take on external beauty and the ultimate effects it brings to those who make or try to make a living exclusively out of it. Relying on formulaic plot schematics to move the story along Refn again presents a film that makes the viewer question whether he is in fact valuing style over substance or if there is something else on his mind. To fully appreciate ""The Neon Demon"" one must acknowledge that this is no ordinary film as this is no ordinary director: love him or hate him, Refn is an auteur in his own right and a true visionary. His predominant surrealistic approach pulls away most people but others are inexplicably drawn in. I can't honestly say that I loved or hated the film. I was drawn in by its surrealistic approach, the haunting cinematography and soundtrack, despite some extremely embarrassing dialogue exchanges and cringe worthy performances at times.Some films are not meant to be watched as straightforward closed product; they are meant to be digested subjectively as you would a different piece of art. ""Demon"" could have been the ultimate film about the fashion beauty industry and its carnivorous (!) repercussions if only it had been filtered down and conveniently edited, but that isn't what Refn is about as an artist or what he intended for the audience. He did not (and never has before) tried to appeal the masses, he is merely projecting what he is and what he would want to see in a film and that is not wrong at all. Again, love it or hate it, Refn couldn't care less.",The Neon Demon

119,Sci-FiHorrorFan,This Film is so Bad I wanted to shoot myself when it Ended!.,2,2 October 2016,"This Movie is pretentious and Boring as hell!.I hated this movie because there was No story and there were No likable characters. The writing and directing are Awful the characters are Awful as well as Demented. There were people in this movie that acted like Robots because they showed zero emotion. There were other characters that were just quiet and weird but in all honesty I thought they were all Demented. I don't understand how anyone can like this film.what is there to like about it?.its Boring its slow moving its Not scary, its Not Funny, its Not thrilling its just a pretentious Artistic Film.The film tries to be clever and it fails miserably.the film tries to be scary and it fails miserably.This is Not a horror film either so I don't know why it was advertised as one. The movie is full of pretentious dialogue and pointless symbols.they show a new symbol every ten minutes and after awhile it got on my nerves.this Film was just style over Substance and Nothing more.I also don't care if that's what the POINT Was,I Didn't Like it.all the weird style does is make the writers look Lazy.they couldn't think of anything good to write so instead we are Treated to a bunch of weird scenes of girls staring into thin Air.The story what little of it there was I thought was Lame and extremely uninteresting.the story is just bout a group of women who want to be the best model and when the new girl comes along played by Ellie Fanning the other girls get jealous of her.they get jealous to the point were they become crazy.Everyone in the movie is obsessed with Ellie's character and I have no idea what they found so special about her. She may have been cute but everyone acted like she was the Best Looking Girl in the World!?. Which I Highly disagree with. Don't get me wrong I Like Ellie Fanning as an actress but I did Not think her character was the Best Girl Ever!. I can think of about 100 other women that I like more.(No offence to Ellie).I also don't blame her for this movie being Crap, I blame the writers and the director.The screenplay was bad by all three writers.I think the main problem with this film is that its Boring.Nothing happens for a Long time.unless you want to count people talking as stuff happening.which I don't. I should also mention that a women is attacked in this film off camera and the Police are Never called for some reason. In fact I didn't see a single police officer in this Movie!.which is weird because there were two attacks in the film and Nothing is done about it and I have no idea why.I guess the writers were too lazy to explain themselves so they decided to be ""Artistic"" instead.This film has so many problems I could go on all Day but I will try not to.Another problem was Keanu Reeves his role was totally pointless and he didn't even need to be in the movie.he just plays a small time thug and he's only in the film for ten minutes tops.I like Keanu Reeves and he can do better than this Boring film.he was Better in the Matrix which is a much Better film than This!.Every women in this film except Ellie's character are Freaks and I did not Like any of them.Ellie was okay but the Script let her down.Keanu does pretty much Nothing and the other ladies just act bitchy and Weird throughout the entire film. The Ruby woman was seriously disturbed and Perverted which I can probably say about everyone in this film except Ellie. Ellie's character is only 16 years old in this movie and she is way to young to be a model and I thought the characters were idiots for not realising she was 16.don't they realise girls sometimes lie about their ages?.I guess they were too Stupid to figure it out.I will admit i thought the Dean character was Okay, he was probably the only Normal guy in the movie and he was the only one that treated her with respect because none of the others did.Dean was at least nice to her and treated her like a human being unlike everyone Else.Everything about this film Sucks except Ellie.I thought her acting was Okay and she's the only thing that made me keep watching the movie,although now I wish I hadn't because the Ending is Terrible and unsatisfying in every Way. This is one of the Worst Films I've seen this Year and I advice people Not to watch it because its Pretentious and Ridiculous.",The Neon Demon
120,stonedraim,An astonishing visual experience... strangely beautiful,5,17 September 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Getting the immediate feeling and emotion of Michael Mann and his way of making movies, and one of his movies that is drawing attention for me here is Michael Manns ""Manhunter"". The neon flashing font, the music and the artistic way of conveying the text in the beginning... the opening scene is purely artistic and could have been taken out from one of David Lynchs films. Now... let's see what this motion picture is all about and what it brings forward.A pure original movie. An artistic kind of slow paced and innovative in expression of sound and visuals, yet it sometimes conveys a very beautiful and dark emotion that again get my mind to Michael Mann. Do you like original movies that stands out, and then stands out a lot in almost every way, then dig into Neon Demon.A highly interesting movie that is far too long and slow and maybe too ""far out there"" for its own good. It takes an interesting twist on the fashion world and tweaks that almost into infinity. The change and the evolving of the main character into so to speak The Neon Demon with the narcissistic fashion worker (that is being explored and showed around as she's walking the catwalk) is highly philosophical and maybe wonderful in its own sense. If you take Tree Of Life, Antichrist and Louder Than Bombs, mash them together, you will get the Neon Demon. If you are out for an ordinary horror or thriller flick, please just move along. Because, The Neon Demon takes the toll of you and you have to dig deep to both watch it and understand.The Neon Demon has moments that is soothing, almost ""spa-like"" and relaxing, and also moments that are extremely confusing and terrifying.The whole motion picture is quite interesting to watch and at the same time I ask myself, is it good, is it bad... well, you can create your opinion about that.If you decide to watch this movie, prepare yourself for a ride. Up, down, left and right. It shakes up all people that see it, in one way or another. Nicholas Winding Refn has done an remarkable work in making this story and movie a kind of weird piece of art. It takes the fashion side and the social aspects such as homosexuality, necrophilia, the conscious of the human being, the dreams of human being and shake them all up in a bowl, and then adds (in some perspective) madness. Interesting twist of the story that the main character dies 15 minutes before the movie ends.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Very well made, very well balanced in the artwork of philosophical moments and the script itself. It is a solid production and has an extremely well made soundtrack and perfectly fitted music. Camera angels, slow camera movements, colours and editing is direct in place, spot on. - The actors : The both directing and the acting is fitting each other and the great competence of the actors makes the story, the movie and the artwork trustworthy. - Entertainment : Fun to see a piece of art, a piece of an artistic point of view speaking about the fashion side. Too philosophical and too original for its own good. Cut one hour of the movie and push the pace up, that could have been a recipe for a greater rate. - Age : 15, due to mental angles, blood, cruelty and darkness5,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie. 5 Approved.)",The Neon Demon

It gets a little too perfume commercial for me to give it anything higher. I liked that it was artistic. The visual style was strong and often beautiful. There was also a little bit of poetry to it. The heavy handed satire is like a negative 3, though. We get it, Hollywood can swallow you whole. This writer/director should have collaborated with another writer. The shallowness, pretension and just bad writing might have been been jettisoned and allowed the film to be lifted to something higher. The big shocker in it is just wrong. Instead of making you gasp, it makes you shake your head and roll your eyes. It breaks the film into another movie, almost. A (little) movie that is not as good as the first movie might have been had the story been stronger and the writing better. So, that's negative 2 for the writing. This is bordering on David Lynch territory and just like with Lynch, it's better when he has a strong narrative on which to hang his style of storytelling. As it is, it swings for the fences and gets caught on the warning track. Too damn bad. It could have been something special.",The Neon Demon

123,rjsf96,If Looks Could Kill,9,26 December 2016,"Nicolas Winding Refn has never been a filmmaker looking for the easy way out. If that was the case I doubt he would ever have committed his body of work to film in the first place. Refn is a Director whom pushes the boundaries at every available opportunity he gets, no matter if he alienates his target audience in the process. This is a person so determined to achieving a singular goal that it's almost frightening. With Drive, Only God Forgives and now The Neon Demon he has pushed the envelope of cinema. Jesse is a reserved yet stunning 16 year old with big aspirations to make it in the LA fashion industry. Although we never know much about her life other than this facet it is more than enough, because that's the point. We are not told vivid or entirely intimate character details, at least not till the end. Like the characters and industry it represents The Neon Demon may at first glance appear superficial, but lurking underneath the surface is its dark blood red humour coursing through its veins and the twisted two faced personalities behind it. Being a newcomer to this entire way of life Jesse is guided by Ruby (Jena Malone) and models Sarah (Abbey Lee) and Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and as Jesse becomes a darker shade of her original self they use her to their advantage.There's no point now denying that Nicolas Winding Refn is perhaps my favourite Director working today, because in essence he understands what makes cinema such an attractive medium and art form to utilise. Not just in his usage of colours to create an atmospheric mood and stunning visual palette, but in the way he presents his themes however brash they may be, you have to admire his skill and craft behind the camera and the undeniable talent in front of it.Elle Fanning who showed promise in her limited screen time in Trumbo earlier this year, provides an even greater on screen presence as Jesse. The smallest subtleties of character progression are felt and are only accentuated when the shocking climax is revealed. There's posing to be sure and a hell of a load of it at that (this is about glamour after all), yet this is the bold uncompromising statement of Refn and a scathing reflection of the fashion industry as a whole. If this sounds like your standard art film about the dangers of the glitz and glamour of the fashion industry take note. The Neon Demon is assuredly not for the faint of heart. With helpings aplenty of cannibalism, forced sexual encounters oh and necrophilia, in case you were wondering. The Neon Demon for all its superficial dressing is very much the work of an auteur and a take it or leave it film maker at that. If any criticism is directed towards the film none should shine on Refn. Uncompromising? Yes. Dramatic? Check. Flamboyant? For sure. I wouldn't have it any other way.A",The Neon Demon
124,just_in_case,"Bored for an hour and a half, traumatized in the last 30",6,25 February 2017,"I'd been kind of ignoring this thing for ever. I was told it was a horror film about models and I'll be honest I could not get in the mood for it. I managed to sit down for a quiet unobstructed evening to try and get through whatever this was.I can be open to slowburn films as long as something about it pulls me. That I can feel the progress of the film like pages turning. This felt like it went no where for an hour and a half. Vapid teen goes to CA to be a model. It's just random scenes of her interacting with people and dream sequences. I think my problem is she, the main character, never says anything. I'm not asking for profound epiphanies or inner monologues. 90% of her dialog is her saying ""Not really..no?"" and it's impossible to care. I found the surrounding characters far more compelling, that was still little to none.I think the writer was going for Bret Easton Ellis in the theme and Kubrick in the cinematography. The Kubrick you get. I'll admit the highlights of the film are the dream sequences. BEE is respected for writing captivating stories about empty people and the dialog is witty. There's none of that here. Everyone in the film speaks each line in 5 syllables or less and it drove me crazy.Then the last 30 minutes, it turns into a horror show that would make Edgar Allen Poe quit drinking. I haven't seen anything that disturbing since Martyrs which I absolutely despise.So yeah if you really want a film slower and less interesting than ""Solaris"" with a big disgusting last act payoff more power to you.

126,Hawkensian,"The weak, lazy third act undoes around 70 minutes of unnerving slow burn ambiance",6,26 June 2016,"The Neon Demon is the new film from Nicolas Winding Refn, the Danish auteur best known for his blood-spattered fetishisation of Ryan Gosling. The film's not released until 8 July, but I was fortunate enough to attend a preview screening and Q&A with Refn, or NWF as he's now calling himself, at Manchester's HOME cinema.Let's begin by saying that it is a marked improvement on his last work Only God Forgives, the Bangkok-set misfire which strew terrible characters, terrible dialogue and dull Oedipal metaphors over 90 tedious minutes.For The Neon Demon, Refn has left Thailand and taken us back to Los Angeles, the sprawling city that Newton Thomas Sigel photographed so beautifully in Drive. Sigel hasn't returned but Natasha Braier, his Argentine replacement known for her work on The Road, provides similarly dazzling visuals, from sweeping shots of the dusky Los Angeles basin to surreal and sparkling strobe-lit sequences.Composer Cliff Martinez supports Braier's sterling work in his third collaboration with Refn. He has produced a goosefleshingly brilliant medley of industrial electronica that sends its heavy, menacing baselines thudding through your body. Indeed, Martinez has probably outperformed his director for the second time in a row.At the centre of this audio-visual spectacle is Jesse (Elle Fanning), a wholesome young girl whose angelic, virginal beauty sends her hurtling to the top of the modelling industry, much to the catty chagrin of Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee).Gigi has been cut, sliced and hammered into shape by LA's most esteemed surgeons, and she'll proudly tell anyone who listens. Heathcote's outrageously defined jawline delivers much of her performance, but she also effectively creates an artificial wide- eyed façade that barely masks a desperate insecurity and venomous jealousy.Rather than being artificial, Australian supermodel Abbey Lee is often just plain wooden as Sarah, the more overtly bitchy of the pair. Lee's dollish face has an emotional vacuity that's appropriate for the character, but her line delivery is regularly stilted. However, she does shine in a scene where she breaks down in front of Jesse, asking what it's like to have that 'thing' that gets you noticed. Lee's steady improvement is a reflection of Refn's preference to shoot chronologically.Gigi and Sarah are the primary antagonists of a toxic industry that wants to sink its teeth into young Jesse and suck all the life out of her. It is only Ruby (Jena Malone), a make-up artist, who appears to have Jesse's best interest at heart. But even Ruby's intentions are dubious, as there are disconcerting sexual overtones to her friendliness.Perhaps the greatest danger of all is Hank (Keanu Reeves), the thuggish sexual predator who runs the dodgy motel Jesse's staying in. Sleaze sweats from every pore of Reeves's gruff face as he leers and intimidates Jesse and Dean (Karl Glusman), an amateur and affable young photographer who Jesse has firmly friend-zoned.All of these thoroughly malevolent individuals cast a menacing shadow over young Jesse. If she isn't sabotaged Showgirls-style at work, she might be shanked to the sound of Bernard Herrmann's strings in the motel shower. Despite this, it does not feel like a horror film, it's really a warped social commentary, a bit like Cronenberg's Maps to the Stars, only without the humour and scathing satire.The Neon Demon becomes more of a horror film in the final 20 minutes or so, which is when everything falls apart. After about 90 minutes of preamble, Refn undoes the slow-burn tension with a lazy denouement that indulges his crude metaphors of the beauty industry's 'cannibalism'.Fanning has said that the ending was created and improvised on set, and it really does show. Instead of remaining ground in reality, which the film generally does up until this point, Refn takes the easy route by falling back on viscera of the comically supernatural variety. Some Refn fans will sneer at such criticism and hark on about the grand symbolic value, but not only is the fashion industry an easy target for derision, but the metaphors are flat, too.This is the problem with Refn – he's prone to pseudo-intellectualism. For example, during the Q&A session he said that the main reason for making the film was to live out his fantasy of being a young girl, concluding with total certainty that 'there is a 16- year-old girl in all of us'. Speak for yourself, Nick. He continued to delve into his strange brand of pop-psychology, dubbing himself as a 'sadist' in his profession but a 'masochist' in his home, because his wife and two daughters outnumber him. This is a pretentious and somewhat incestuous way of saying his wife wears the trousers.He also spoke about directing Jena Malone in the film's most sexually explicit scene, asking her to spit there and rub that. Some would say he was blurring the lines between film director and porn director, between Ron Howard and Ron Jeremy, but Refn said that 'it was all okay, because we found her character together.' This is such guff, Nick – you were getting off on it! After all, Refn has confessed in the past that he's a 'pornographer' who makes films based on what excites him.Perhaps the most interesting thing Refn said during the Q&A was that he considers Richard E. Grant to be a 'c*nt', which after seeing Withnail and I, is something I think I can agree with.Thematically and metaphorically speaking, The Neon Demon is about as shallow as the industry it critiques. But Fanning's endearing lead performance, Natasha Braier's stunning camera-work and the ambiance of Cliff Martinez's score make it a film worth watching on the big screen, especially in Cinema One at the brilliant Manchester HOME.3/5www.vulturehound.co.ukwww.hawkensian.com",The Neon Demon

128,ccamp89,The Cinematic Equivalent of Vanity,9,26 February 2018,"It does my heart good to know that a movie like The Neon Demon can still get a wide release in the United States. I'll be the first to admit my tendency towards pessimism regarding the current state of our film industry, especially when it comes to true creative freedom. But the fact that I can hop in my car, take a 10 minute drive to my local Regal Cinemas, and watch a movie as uncompromising and unique as this - with ""Amazon Studios"" plastered on it, no less - gives me hope. The fact that I was one of exactly five people in the theater on opening Saturday night? Let's not talk about that part.The film follows Jesse (Elle Fanning) - a beautiful, virginal (figuratively and literally), and possibly orphaned (the backstory is vague) 15-year-old girl who has recently moved to LA in pursuit of a career in modeling. Essentially, we watch as Jesse is slowly sucked in by the superficial glitz and glam of the industry, chewed up, and eventually swallowed whole as the film becomes increasingly bizarre and abstract.At its core, The Neon Demon is a film about vanity; it's a film about the vacuous existence that results from a single-minded obsession with appearance. It's certainly not a unique idea, but the success of the film is that it isn't just about vanity, it embodies vanity.Many have praised the visual prowess of this film and I'll wholeheartedly echo that - it is unbelievably beautiful and easily one of the most visually striking movies I have ever seen. There is an obsessive attention to detail in every single frame: the lighting, shot composition, set design, color palate - you name it - are all finely tuned to create an incredibly sumptuous, nearly sublime visual experience.But at the same time, the film feels incredibly empty. Much of it takes place in big, wide-open spaces sparsely populated by women who take up just about as little horizontal space as humanly possible. Many scenes - interestingly, often those with dialogue - feel extremely quiet as monotonic characters lethargically converse with intermittent moments of near-silence between each statement and response. And, of course, many of the film's scenes find its characters simply gazing wordlessly at themselves and others, completely lost in the allure of their perceived beauty.The polarized response to the film is definitely unsurprising. By its own design it feels empty, emotionless, and artificial. The characters in the film and the world they inhabit don't feel real; they are personifications of vanity - vampires who feed on beauty rather than blood. To enjoy the film isn't really to identify with its characters or connect emotionally, but to marvel at how wholly and successfully it captures the essence of superficiality and vanity. The brilliant crux of the film is that the pleasure derived from it by those like me who enjoyed it comes directly from the same deep-seated, mesmeric attraction to beauty that the characters in the film embody. Not unlike what Haneke accomplished with Funny Games (another polarizing film) and his commentary on the ""torture porn"" genre, Refn slyly exposes the audience for their moth-to-flame affinity for beauty, regardless of how superficial it may be.However, while the main appeal of the film is certainly (and fully intentionally) the visual style, there definitely is subtlety and depth to the proceedings which bolster it as well. Jesse's character arc is quite frank - at the outset she's a naïve, relatively unassuming and hesitant girl who is slowly ""consumed"" by the glitz of the industry and ultimately becomes as self-absorbed and delusional as the veteran models who surround her. It's the manner in which this transformation occurs, however, that is quite well-executed and subtle: flattery. She's surrounded by people in LA who universally faun over her, call her special, tell her she will be the next big thing, etc. Through a series of ever-so-subtle positive reactions to this repeated flattery (portrayed very well by Fanning), we watch as all of the praise and attention infiltrates and corrupts Jesse's mind, culminating in a hallucinatory, abstract turning point during a runway show where she becomes fully taken by lust for her own beauty, kissing her reflection on either side of a triangular mirror. She becomes her own worst enemy. Though obviously taken to an extreme in the film, this is a trajectory we see all the time with child stars whose fame inflates their ego to a breaking point from which they spiral downward. And Fanning's performance combined with Refn's direction deftly captures the subtlety of such a transition and how it can be provoked by something as innocent as a compliment.Also, while many of the characters - particularly the rival models - are thinly drawn (and intentionally so), I found the other main character of the film, Ruby (Jena Malone) to be quite interesting as well. She's a makeup artist - most likely a failed model - who rubs elbows with the elite models of the industry but is clearly an outsider and fully aware of that fact. She's pretty, and clearly just as preoccupied with beauty as the rest, but also painfully aware that she just doesn't quite have the looks to make it in the industry. So instead she does the makeup, surrounding herself with her more beautiful counterparts motivated both by envy and physical attraction. She gets as close to the life as she possibly can without being able to live it herself. This theme is very effectively driven home by her role as a ""house sitter"" later on in the movie - caretaking in the home of a wealthier, more successful individual, watering the plants, living the life but at the same time not living it at all. It's all a fantasy fueled by her desire to be something that she just isn't. Her character feels like a vehicle for commentary on the detrimental effects of a society so hyper-focused on appearance - those who don't meet the standard almost inevitably feel discluded and inadequate.As far as criticism goes, the themes of the film can definitely be a bit heavy-handed at times. Also, on an initial viewing I will say that the third act of the film left me wanting a bit more. Looking back on the full arc I do appreciate the ending, but there was definitely a bit of a tonal shift where the film began to feel a little cartoony, particularly in the very final scenes. It's a minor criticism, as the film certainly is already quite detached from reality and the cartoony elements really just augment this quality and bring it out in full view at the close. Still, I couldn't help but want a little more as the credits started to roll (although, to be fair, it's also partially because I didn't want to the film to end).Bravo to Amazon for helping to produce this film. This was the very first film I have seen with ""Amazon Studios"" labeled on the front, and I applaud them for putting their name on a project so uncompromisingly artistic and with very little universal appeal. Regardless of whether you enjoyed the film, I think we can agree that such a huge company supporting and advertising an auteur film like this is a huge win for film lovers.Decent 4.5/5",The Neon Demon
129,pinokiyo,SO BAD. Style over substance... yet again from Nicolas Winding Refn,1,17 February 2017,"PLEASE, Nicolas Winding Refn needs to take Screen writing CLASSES. It seems he only took cinematography courses before he became a director. We get it he understands pretty visuals. Story is absolutely HORRIBLE. The ending is something out of a cheap horror film, I don't know if we're supposed to be shocked or... laughing. He is probably trying to please the weird ""art house"" crowd, but he is no David Lynch - this is nowhere near the brilliance or level of Mulholland Dr. And I thought his other movie ""Only God Forgives"" was bad... Nicolas Winding Refn seems to be consistent in all his films with the same formula: he runs out of ideas and the ending always deals with some cop-out, sadistic, grotesque bloodbath. His movie ""Drive"" probably had the most potential, but he just doesn't know where he's going with this films. Why even have Keanu Reeves?!? Even in an interview, Keanu asked the director what was the deal with all the random triangle and everything in the film and the director couldn't even answer it! It's just random - there is no meaning. I'm pretty sure deep down inside, Keanu is also thinking what the hell the point of the movie was.",The Neon Demon

It was a massive waste of my time and will no-doubt be a massive waste of the time for the vast majority of people.I am sorry Elle, you are very pretty but please pick better movies next time - a few more like this one and you will find getting decent jobs very difficult in future.

Visuals could be deceptive, indeed. With the exception of sparkling performances by the young Elle Fanning portraying the narcissistic rise of a naive, under-aged model in LA fashion industry along with Jenna Malone as a surreptitiously obsessed make-up artist, the film is absurdly convoluted with the lack of any pace and some well-intended allusions to biblical-style-horror. Even the electro-fusion score by Cliff Martinez couldn't help the case much. Sadly, Nicolas Winding Refn disappointed with this one.An unsatisfied 5.5/10.",The Neon Demon
133,Bofsensai,"Glamour bitchiness horror, with brilliant Lynchian, Kubrick, Haneke and Shakespeare touches.",9,26 May 2017,"WOW! Rarely do I anymore get the experience like as one famous UK TV reviewer*, who once confessed that most of what he saw was trash / disappointing, so why do it, go on? Because, he explained, just occasionally, an offering comes along, out of the blue (left field) to stun and impress so much that makes it all worthwhile. Well, this is one of them! BRILLIANT! As is the spectacular cinematography (superb Natasha Braier) and colour scheme throughout, and in which so enjoying you can spot the Lynch, Kubrick (even Haneke) touches (even, are they deliberate homages, perhaps, Mr. Refn?) That's it, for this is one that should not be plot spoilt in the least (which is how I fortunately came to it and the second half stunned.) And taking you along for the uncertain ride is also then an utterly superb soundtrack courtesy of now several times partnership to director Refn, Cliff Martinez.Of course, it's already somewhat 'spoilt' by being labelled a sort of horror sci-fi: yet, just like the best horror films of old, all the better that the monster is not shown, so with this you can further 'enjoy' spotting all the shock horror tropes, most all the better for all being mostly only inferred throughout, so to be that much more disturbing as the realisation of what is (probably) happening, unfolding, takes hold of you.Refn states that the end product is not really that important to him, rather than the process of getting the project up onto the screen: in that case, it makes this even more, er, unsettling as presumably it is a paean to the 'wholesomeness' of the (bitchy to a deadly degree) fashion glamour world: in which case an excellent beware to all those (small town girls, as Fanning is) who would be inveigled into its 'horrors'.

134,jasontheterrible,Not even any good sex or nudity,1,1 July 2016,"There is no sex or nudity worth mentioning in this macabre and boorish mess, unless you like cadaver sex or think the brief UN-erotic shower scene (both near the end) are redemptive. If we all knew the game of these psychopathic models before the final 10 minutes of the film and we had some of that narrative for the first 75 minutes, this could have been fun and engrossing but it was neither. And no, you don't get to see any Fanning skin in case that was your motivation. She is the neon demon though having just turned 16 and about as waspy a Kansas bred doe as a girl could be. The logic behind that label is only revealed at the end and is so thin it is laughable. I was chuckling audibly the last 15 minutes realizing how badly I was had.

135,MdlndeHond,Series of scenes strung together without substance,4,1 September 2016,"Mulholland Drive, yes that is what it reminded me of but that was not a good thing. The movie consisted of no story and was mainly a series of scenes that seemed unrelated. The same here, Elle Fanning is sweet but not convincing as a stunning mesmerizing model threatening her surrounding with her beauty. The soundtrack consisting of throbbing bass, twinkly sounds and industrial metal clanging would make this series of impressions suitable as a music video. If any review needs 4 paragraphs of 20 lines each to explain why this is a new exploratory piece of art it probably isn't that good. Unless you were born in 1996 and missed the entire Lynch area and Scandinavian dark cinema this can be thought provoking. I still keep it open that this could be a spoof with all the caricatures and cliché depictions of the fashion industry. Not impressed.",The Neon Demon
136,hamidullahgenc,"Behold, Your Inner Demon Wants Fashion and Admiration!..",8,18 December 2016,"Elle Fanning paragraph starts now... She absolutely has a talent for drama for sure. The gestures and facial expressions of hers as well as her speedy journey (and this speediness is a flaw) from the innocent / foolish girl to the arrogant / narcissist ""star"" is just so well that her awful end is kind of a relief for us in a way that no innocent beauty should get corrupted to the full... We have better purposes in life. Sure. Keanu Reeves, our mentor, I won't be the one to evaluate your ranking talent. Hi's are unto you!.. Derived from Italian ""modo"" which means ""right now"" (in Turkish, it is ""moda""), fashion necessitates footwear, clothes, accessory, make-up, piercing...etc. So, fashion clearly aims women at first who loves to be up-to-date and flourishing not to the eyes of men, but to themselves and the women around them.This can be seen by the rapists' horrible statements like ""I thought she wanted it from the start."" No, these evil rapists are dead wrong in their acts. But still, women have an inner mechanism that reveals the need for beauty and flattery... For this, in society we see preteens that dress up like adults and follow a dream to be ""The"" Queen some day mostly by their exterior equipment... If we get to the point; they say Refn seems to have not a linear plot and to had been possessed by a force for the sex / lesbianism and violence in the movie. But I think he clearly states true ""demonic"" sides of the fashion business in his own way. The long scenes that are only related to the characters who play some role in the course of events are seem experimental, and my favorite. So I don't agree that he is a bad copy of David Lynch. (Sorry Mr.David... I did't... wasn't gonna... puff.) However, I don't say Refn is a complete genius either. Time will judge. The overall soundtracks are really well-picked and well-placed. Our thanks to Julian Winding (The Demon Dance), Sweet Tempest (Me), and of course Sia (Waving Goodbye).Let me say that the sound effects and the ""light games"" are well-meshed together. Otherwise the ""Neon Demon"" in would not party our brains out from the movie to the reality. For the fact that he takes a glance at our realistic problems, and our animalistic / primitive sides and desires in our selves; I give this movie a ""8.1"" points. May it be an example toward our refinement. Yep. (P.S.: Refn, keep hard man! Let our troubles be your efforts!..) The Gracious Koran clarifies all these in the 3. Chapter, 14. Verse: ""Decked out fair to men is the love of lusts -- women, children, heaped-up heaps of gold and silver, horses of mark, cattle and tillage.

The lighting and use of colour is very NWR.The opening scenes are good but It never really gets going. Its a very slow burn. With a lead character who barely raises a smile, has zero personality, zero charisma but apparently she has it all. She displays no emotion at all. She basically walks around pouting and asking stupid dumb questions like is this your house? Erh, you dim wit, I'm in my 20's, this is mansion worth millions!I was at the London Q&A tonight.

139,StregaAsuka,Neon and nothing else,6,4 June 2017,"This is a strange movie; something that shouldn't surprise us as here we are talking about director Nicolas Winding Refn, whose previous works ""Drive"" and ""Only God Forgives"" did not leave anyone indifferent; either because it was brilliant (like in the first example) or because it was not (like in the second example).As always in his films, what gets the audience attention is how the movie's aesthetically appeal. Best things of the movie is how it looks like and its music, always good, that we cannot complain about. And in this movie, that is it. Nothing more, nothing less. Except for Elle Fanning's performance, which we know she always is good at.The story is something we have watched more than once and more than twice: the dream of a young female to go to the city where dreams come true: LA/Hollywood, depending on what dreams does she want to have. That is nothing new but what is new is the way the story is told, with some creepy scenes and a creeper outcome (won't say anything more). But still it will be probably a movie you will forget about.

A group of models feel threatened by that beauty and they will do anything necessary to obtain that thing she possesses. The writing is superb throughout the film as it will take at least one more viewing for me at least to fully appreciate all of the clever uses of foreshadowing, symbolism, etc. I was glued to my seat wondering what will happen to Jesse as she aspires for greatness. But I was also interested in all the characters as well. Everyone played a part that added to the story that made you wonder ""what are they going to do next"". Even Keanu Reeves was great as the dark comic relieve.The scene stealer in this movie for me was Jena Malone as Ruby. I believe she desires at least consideration for a Best Supporting Actress nomination. That character will definitely be in the back of my mind for awhile, put it simply she gave me chills.I wouldn't recommend this movie to the faint of heart as the blood and gore is definitely used a good amount. If I would compare this to another movie just so you can get an idea of what you are getting into, I would say Black Swan. But even the Black Swan is a light movie compared to this.

142,jmerlino,Medicore thriller,4,29 September 2020,"There's nothing really novel or interesting about this movie. It's your basic vampire movie.But because it's got a lot of hot women telling other hot women that they're not that hot, and generally obsessing over their bodies (with some help from the men, too), it's got a pseudo-feminist ""message"" that will instantly add two stars to the reviews of anyone who purports to be ""progressive.""To be fair, the movie is beautifully shot with some amazing use of color and light. Many of the shots do look like fashion photos, which, I'm sure, is intentional.Elle Fanning, though absolutely stunning here, largely sleepwalks through her role, maintaining the deer-in-the-headlights look that's commented upon early in the film.Jenna Malone is interesting and appealing as Ruby, but telegraphs the fact that she's a baddie pretty much from the get-go.Keanu Reeves has a very small role as a sleazy motel manager that had me scratching my head. Did he love the script so much that he was willing to take that crumb of a role? Or maybe he just wanted to pick up some pocket money while he was filming ""Bill and Ted Face the Music."" What up, Keanu?Anyway, after watching some genuinely creative films recently just as ""Visitor Q"" and ""I Am Not a Serial Killer"" this just left me bored. I'm sure some people will call it a ""scathing indictment of the fashion industry"" or Hollywood, but at this point, after so many films like this, it just falls flat.

144,TonyDood,Shallow and Beautiful,8,8 February 2017,"""Neon Demon"" isn't for everyone, but it's wonderful all the same.Set in the high-fashion world of LA (??) ""Neon Demon"" takes its first cue from ""Mulholland Drive,"" starting as the story of a young, blonde innocent played delightfully by a chameleon-like Elle Fanning who is sometimes innocent beyond belief and other times seductive, wise and deranged beyond her years. She meets a ""friend"" in Jenna Malone, who gives the film's most interesting performance as a possibly-predatory, possibly insane Lynchian lipstick lesbian and the movie then moves into Brian DePalma-land, filled as it is with ultra-clean, neon lit sets and the ever-pulsing electronic score. The plot follows Fanning's ""Jesse"" as she moves her way up the ladder of ""success"" in the cutthroat fashion industry and the malevolent forces that seem to be gathering, either to taint her quality or to, literally, feed on it.While the plot isn't all that original (people in high-profile creative jobs can be literal cut-throat monsters, Hollywood is a tough town, the price of naivete is destruction) and the film contains some tiresome, unsavory moments of young women being threatened and dominated by men (and one gratuitous scene with a cadaver that would have stopped the show completely if what followed hadn't been equally outrageous) what makes the ride worthwhile are the 80's-inspired set pieces. Project creator ""NWR,"" whose other films I have not yet seen, tips a hat to Kubrick, DePalma, ""The Hunger"" and ""Cat People"" (to answer the question many have asked as to why a certain scene of an uninvited animal guest appears in the movie). I imagine that's part of the problem...I don't think a lot people who reviewed this film negatively got the ""joke."" I chuckled through the entire movie, and I suspect the director wouldn't have minded. My first clue was the use of a Kubrick homage key word...I can't believe any director would put such a bit of business into a film and expect it to be treated seriously...likewise the Lynchian cameo of Keanu Reeves and Allessandro Nivola. The pace, the characters, the over-the-top fashions, the color scheme (I have a color-blind friend who can vouch that people with color blindness prefer a world that looks the way the film is colored) the retro music score and the nods to other psychological thrillers...I was absolutely delighted to find someone had seen and loved the same trashy films I enjoyed in the 80s and 90s and made a film that not only commemorates those tarnished gems but takes them a step further (I had no idea where the film was going to end up and found the ending satisfying as well as repulsive).This film is not for anyone who has pre-conceptions going in, it's not for those who insist on viewing cinema as an art form of ""literalism"" (""Cinema Sins,"" which I actually enjoy), it's not for someone in a hurry, it's not for someone who wants to see a ""Syd Field 101""-scripted action story with commonplace character tropes. It's female-centric, the politics are left-of-center and the movie absolutely requires you to surrender yourself to the moment and not be in control. It's probably not terribly deep in intent. It has the lack of narrative discipline of a European art film, it's too long and slow, it succumbs to the visually and mentally repulsive on occasion and doesn't provide easy answers...I'm not even sure the movie is asking any questions. It seems like the sole purpose of the movie, like ""Enter The Void,"" is to generate a sensory response, and there's certainly nothing wrong with that. Would that many mainstream Hollywood films today were better at doing that much.When this movie came out I read a lot of reviews saying this movie was ""bad,"" that it was a disappointment, that it didn't live up to the potential created by the director's other films. As usual I took the advice of these reviews and missed seeing the thing in a theater before remembering that often as not the movies that people shout are ""good"" bore me to tears.

149,parleon-thedon,The Neon Demon - Review: Substance within Style,8,26 June 2016,"Directer Nicolas Winding Refn didn't just create a movie with an artistic visual style, he crafted something with a cool color palette, awesome soundtrack, exceptional performances, moderate storytelling, and nuance.Quite frankly, I absolutely love this movie, I've seen it three times, and it just gets better.First and foremost, this movie isn't for everyone, people who love Nicolas Winding Refn might enjoy it, but this could possibly even tear Refn fans apart.After my first viewing of The Neon Demon, I was confused, after my second showing, I was frustrated, and by the third time I had picked up on something I didn't notice before, I nourished in it, and then I felt refreshed, by the way, this movie is not a masterpiece, it still has its flaws.The Neon Demon is a movie that should be examined closely, preferably with a microscopic lens.Everything in this movie should be examined closely, the color palette during the opening and throughout, the facial expressions and body language of the characters, the otherworldly and abnormal scenes, and the atmospheric music play a crucial part in ones ability to fully comprehending the narrative no matter how outlandish it may seem. From the start everything seems simple, but with closer examination you'll notice that there's something brewing just beneath the surface.The Neon Demon is a slow burner, it takes awhile for things to get started, but the movie elevates with each new scene.The first act is stellar, the second act is magnificent, and the third act is acceptable; Everything falls apart during that third act, however, using the tools required, the viewer should be able to fathom its bizarre execution.The third act wasn't perfect, it could've taken the traditional approach and ended on a sad note, the earlier scenes did provide some insight lending in, but trying to fully grasp it is a nightmare, I was left scratching my head, and I thought that certain scenes weren't really necessary, however, I do believe that some of the final scenes made sense.Overall, I really enjoyed The Neon Demon, I pretty much liked everything about it, except the third act, but that still didn't ruin my overwhelming enjoyment, and so you either roll with it or you don't. For a viewer to fully grasp an understanding of the movie, one needs to know what colors represent, look out for these colors because they're scattered throughout, also look out for mirrors, and pay attention to the music within context while also enjoying it; every little detail was clearly planned and thought out right down to the color choices.

151,Carriexoc,Not a horror movie,4,3 November 2021,"Watched for 45 minutes, no thrill, no horror. Boring as F$&@. Don't bother if you love Thriller/Horror movies. It's just an ""artsy"" drama. Lifetime movie.",The Neon Demon
152,ShaeSpencer,Don't watch this movie.,1,9 July 2016,"I have enjoyed most of the Nicolas Winding Refn films I've seen. I love both Bronson and Drive. I tried to like Only God Forgives, but couldn't. I came into The Neon Demon with neutral expectations. I walked out of the end credits disgusted with myself for not having left sooner.The Neon Demon is vapid, soulless trash. It is despicable drivel. It is irresponsible. It is made without a sense of accountability to taste or reason. It is a bafflingly inept attempt at surrealism, where caricatures are passed off as characters, and bright, pretty lights and colors as compelling imagery. The potentially interesting (if trite) theme of the moral and emotional emptiness of the modeling industry is presented in a laughably inane way, as if it were a fresh, vital artistic insight.If Only God Forgives was nudging audience members in the ribs a bit too hard, The Neon Demon kicks us in the groin. Repeatedly.This is true both in the film's style and content. I'm a firm believer that any subject can be dealt with in a film. There is a line of decency and human concern that is usually difficult to discern, and is obviously highly subjective. Shocking scenes will often polarize viewers, and, usually, there are legitimate points to be made on either side. Neon demon goes miles over that line. There is no defense for a scene where over the course of what I would estimate to be a couple minutes of screen time, a woman molests a female corpse. The audience sees and hears almost everything. I won't go into further detail. Unfortunately, Refn did. If this weren't bad enough, this footage is intercut with an abstract representation of the woman's fantasy about an underage girl who earlier rejected the woman's advances. The girl is 16 in the film, and Elle Fanning was either 16 or 17 at the time of filming. I don't consider myself a prude when it comes to dark topics in film. As I said, I firmly believe there are tasteful (or at least acceptable) ways to handle any issue through the medium of film. An example of a film which is uncompromising in depicting evil and yet doesn't cross the line is The Silence of the Lambs. However awful the acts of Hannibal or Buffalo Bill are in that movie, the film is made from a place of heart, of empathy for the victims, a place of humaneness. It doesn't revel in the crimes of its villains. We are meant to be sickened by them. When Hannibal clobbers a policeman (nearly?) to death, the director is very selective in what we see, focusing in on Lecter's demonic glee. It's a thrilling, gut wrenching scene. In Neon Demon's necrophilia scene, everything is fair game. A large part of the reason this scene is so reprehensible to me is that it seems almost as if it's meant to be titillating.I wonder: How would this film have been received if the necrophile were a man molesting a female corpse?It's disheartening to me that a small minority of people seeing this film actually like it. I can't help but think (and hope?) that they're simply fooling themselves, that their affection for Refn's previous, far superior films is being unduly extended over this one. As with Only God Forgives, perhaps the cinematography is distracting enough for them to forgive its fundamental storytelling flaws.But even though I found The Neon Demon intermittently nice to look at, and in spite of my adoration for the genius of Drive and Bronson, I hate this film. Even if I was to pretend there was no sickeningly indulgent necrophilia scene, or other lingering, exploitative shots which directly contradict the premise that the film is an indictment of the male gaze, I would still hate this film, simply because it is so bad.",The Neon Demon
153,philip-davies31,'A diamond in a sea of broken glass',7,2 August 2017,"The one cinematic influence on 'The Neon Demon' that is never mentioned - perhaps never generally observed before - is the uncanny way that Elle Fanning, as Jesse, is often shot as an evanescent but hypnotic creation conjured out of elaborate coloured lighting, make-up, setting and other lensed optical artefacts, in the manner of Clouzot's wildly kinetic portraiture of Romy Schneider in his abortive 'Inferno.' Clouzot gave himself a nervous breakdown and a heart attack trying to perfect this experimental cinematic device, and neither he nor his career recovered. There is a very good and detailed documentary about this unfinished film. I am sure 'Inferno''s evocation of predatory lust and its dangerous perversions is a major influence on the ferally prowling gaze and motion of this film by Refn, and that the intensely caressing yet lubricious, even droolingly all-consuming, radically transforming, obsessively superficial and disturbingly shifting gaze is channeling the extraordinary surviving snippets of Schneider turned into a puppet or an abstracted icon of totally objectified, possessed and possessive, stalking, sinisterly beautiful light. Refn has bolstered Clouzot's unstable and imperfectly-realised visions with Argento's robustly exploitative distortions of reality, and Kubrick's chilly and cynical humour, to produce a stylish Grand Guignol vision of the inhumanity and feral lusts literally prowling the catwalk, with ruthless ambition as the driving hunger. Everything possesses a dangerous sharpness that lacerates itself - the final partly-off-screen murderously lustful orgy having the power of Greek and of Senecan tragedy, as rival huntresses stalk the Goddess-like perfection of the new girl with knives, and their own nails and teeth, to appropriate her power in a kind of cannibalistic magic, doing plastic surgery by using one dismembered body to donate the Goddess's flesh in a primitive communion, savagely expropriating Jessy's Beauty. The horror and beauty go hand-in-hand, just as the make-up artist who befriends the perfect new model consoles herself, after her lesbian advances are rebuffed, with one of the female corpses in the morgue where she also works making the dead presentable for their last journey. Just as big cats, both savagely prowling a seedy motel, as well as stuffed and mounted as decor, can be dangerous life and pathetic, parodic trophy.Refn is very conscious how the coldly observing lens of a camera dissects the image, consumes it, spits it out again. The abstract image of a newly-rejected model in the crazed washroom glass of her violent symbolic self-harm is a cruelly angular Picasso rearrangement of the features - and a stray shard painfully penetrates the young innocent who has come to sympathise. It eventually settles in her heart, making her worship herself and look down on other mortal beauties. The shattered older model pounces upon the bloodied hand and, vampire-like, imbibes from the living icon of perfection and success. This is the first intimation that this 'Diamond in a sea of broken glass,' as the Svengali-like fashion-house impresario calls her, will fall, and break.As she finally poises aloft, at the extreme end of the slender diving board, high above the empty deep end of this impresario's private pool, it is like the deus ex machina of Greek tragedy, as she seems to defy mortal constraints. A perverse, Euripidean conclusion is inevitable.Though I have not researched his family background, it appears that the former husband of Refn's mother (or another close relative of his?) may well be the same Andréas Winding who was responsible for many of the innovative and practical lighting techniques created for Clouzot's ill-fated 'L'Enfer.' Thus Refn may have had privileged, private access to the surviving test-footage of these techniques. In some shots of 'The Neon Demon,' Elle Fanning is even made to look uncannily reminiscent of Romy Schneider!",The Neon Demon
154,d_carlotaj,Let's Do Lunch? Horror!,10,20 February 2021,"""Neon Demon,"" (2016). Elle Fanning, Christina Hendricks. Directed by Nicholas Winding Refn.
This film uses the Last Supper allusion to depict the Sacrificial Lamb/ Transubstantiation metamorphosis of the Christ Figure. As with most aberrant psychological disorders, this film about the effects of all consuming, malignant jealousy fits nicely into the horror genre. The setting is the Los Angeles model scene. Of all the horror symbolism which pervades the scenes, the unusual reliance neon lighting is used evoke eerie feelings and rarified state or unnaturalness. Extreme beauty in juxtaposition to the less beautiful seems to cause malignant narcissistic cannibalism. The cannibalism manifests itself in a most peculiar way. Normally less beautiful girls will attach themselves to a beautiful girl as if proximity will ensure that some benefit will rub off on them, as in surplus males and spill over. But in malignant jealousy, the envious one becomes homicidal. It works this way. The psycho will insinuate herself into every aspect of the life of the object of her desire. She will almost insert herself into the private regions as if if she remains long enough, she can work her way up from the inside and look out of her host's eyes, thus becoming the host and no longer feeling jealousy because she will own what the besutiful woman has. In the film this phenomenon is shown in eating, ingesting, digesting, and consuming imagery. Males do the same thing. Keenau's slipping into Jesse's room while she is sleeping and slipping a knife between her lips suggests that his purpose is to destroy the beauty that he feels he cannot have, his jealousy reflecting eating or consuming imagery. These are the types of men who maim women or kill them. They are often cruel or denigrating to a beautiful woman for no conceivable reason. No pun intended. The lion lying in wait in Jesse's bedroom symbolizes danger lurking in predators whose purpose is to rid themselves of competition. It is strange that Jesse's instincts kick in and she manages to sidestep death at that time. But because she is young, she naively allows herself to be backed into an irretrievable position at the pool. What, one wonders, is the reason that a sixteen-year-old girl is alone in the world, suseptible to the dangers of a cut-throat industry in LA? Usually, runaways were chased away. By something. From something. They become statistics. LA is full of them. This is a well done film. Superb script direction, action, lighting, art production. I give it 5 of 5 stars. Enjoy!",The Neon Demon

156,pkneer,Could Not Take Any Of It Seriously,2,8 October 2021,"I love movies, especially those that can offer escape or make me think for days after watching. But Neon Demon did neither.The premise was weak, the script nonexistent, and the acting stiff as a board. I did not find a single character in the film I cared about, even for an instant. The only positive aspect of the film was that it was well made and attractive - the sets were well done and some of the sequences were appealing to the eyes. But that's it. The film's scenes were disjointed and just fell flat. The dialogue was never interesting and pauses that seemed to last for minutes.Cannot recommend this film, unless you're interested in self-absorbed young women talk to each other like they're made of wood. They are pretty, but void of anything anyone would find interesting or thought provoking.I give the film a rating of 2/10 for being a film that is pretty to look at. If you want a film that has interesting dialogue or some resemblance of action, look elsewhere.",The Neon Demon

I guess most of the budget was spent on Christina Hendricks and Keanu Reeves, who somehow agreed to participate in this piece of poo - why they did is completely beyond me.The director's ego is obviously enormously more expansive than than his talents, which, if this movie is anything to go by, are practically non-existent.For one thing, the supposed models in this movie don't even look like models, but are at least 30lbs and 4 vertical inches away from being allowed to attend a cattle call.

158,patomartinezfgo,"Visually Perfect, Interesting Story",9,28 May 2017,"The movie ""Drive"" is my favourite movie of all time. So I was very excited to see this movie. I believe Nicholas is a very good director, although sometimes he can get too full of himself.This movie is perfect production wise. The cinematography was beautiful, and the score from Cliff Martinez is beyond amazing. The colours of this movie are beautiful and you cannot take your eyes off the screen for that very reason.This movie uses a lot of visual storytelling. I love the way in which you can understand things by just looking at what's happening instead of having someone telling it to you. It is perfect in that way.This story was written by Nicholas, and it does have some very interesting things to say about our perceptions of beauty. It is full of visual metaphors as you might expect, and it leaves you puzzled. I really urge you not to have a defined opinion about this movie as soon as you finish it, give it time to sink in and analyze it.Some people might find this movie extremely disturbing. There are some things in this movie that might shock some people. I have and don't have a problem with the shock factor in the film. On one hand, I really liked when Nicholas uses some strong imagery to get an idea into your head, on the other hand, there are some things that in my opinion just happen to shock the audience.Another nitpick I have with the film is that the main character is supposed to be the prettiest woman in the movie, but there were some other characters that I though looked way prettier, anyway, that's my opinion and I won't take the movie points away for that.In conclusion, see it. But give it your full attention and try not to get ""offended"" by the imagery, it is part of the film.",The Neon Demon

But the plot itself did not hold my interest. The image of the main character was not particularly original. But I liked the classic juxtaposition of good and evil, innocence and provocation, the natural beauty and the falsehood behind the created. However, the film did not impress me as much as I expected and I lost interest in it before the end. And the end was absolute insanity for 20 minutes.

160,zzyzx000-124-271558,Making something out of nothing,9,16 September 2016,"If you were given a script detailing the plot of this flick, you would yawn and flip it in the circular file. A story about the modeling industry and how tough it is to get on top and stay on top. Greedy models who would do anything to stay in the game. What do you do with that script?Liven it up, that's what. Get some interesting looking young eye candy for a start. Hire a really good make-up artist to make them look very special. Have them act really weird..... and sometimes lezzy... how about a lezzy rape scene? Shoot some extraordinary videography... it doesn't even have to have anything to do with the film so long as it is great. Have a terrific sound track: both the vocals and the electronic music kick butt. I think the director must have gone to the David Lynch School of Film for the way he handled the plot and also worth mentioning is the photographer. Anybody can take great pictures now-a-days but wait until you see his equipment and attitude.",The Neon Demon
161,chimera3,A Colorful Mind Burn That is Worth the Watch,8,8 September 2017,"When I first read up on ""The Neon Demon"" on the Upcoming Horror Movies website, I honestly didn't know what to think. Seeing a title like that made me think that it was a supernatural-based movie. After seeing a few trailers, I realized that it was anything but. So I put it on hold at my local library and sat down at night to watch it. If you happen to be under the influence of anything, do not watch this. The colors involved may make you ill. Without giving too much away, it is one movie that you may not want to watch over and over again. Once is enough to soak it all in and process the many nuances that Nicolas Winding Refn creates. After watching it just once, I will gladly admit that it made my head spin and almost sick to my stomach, which does not happen very often with me when it comes to watching horror movies.In truth, I must say that it is good without a shadow of a doubt. If you are not afraid of some subtle shock value, pursue this movie. It is unique unlike any other horror movie of its type and I guarantee that you will never see anything like it again.",The Neon Demon
162,a-kastenas,"Great Soundtrack, Visuals and Sensual Story Telling",8,3 November 2016,"This is a very pretty movie. The colors, the soundtrack, the somewhat slow-paced turn of events. This is a great movie, artistic and worth watching.The negative side of the movie is somewhat static acting of all of the actors. Meaning that everything looks and feels a bit superficial and fake. On the other hand this is hardly a drawback, since the main idea of the film is the effect of beauty, as a prize and vice to the people craving for it. I do understand that for some people this movie might seem a bit boring.The narrative is also nonexistent here. However again, this can be explained by audio visual story telling here. The strong side of the movies lies in the fact that it is a piece of art rather than mainstream drama/horror movie. And art here is mostly aesthetic, however also tainted and grotesque at some point.I give it a solid 8/10. It was on a verge of 9, but I was dissatisfied with the ending, as I was expecting a bit more.",The Neon Demon
163,Bryan_Roderick,Oh the cinematography.,7,13 November 2016,"The Neon DemonA young and naive model tries her hand breaking into Los Angeles. She's a natural beauty surrounded by models who have modulated their bodies one way or another. Not only that but everyone else has their agenda including her make-up artist and the owner of the motel she's staying at.Story-wise there are a lot of missing elements and unnecessary scenes. Visually there are some superb shots. The cinematography is almost second to none. Also the film is a perversion and a personal fetish for the director. It was never about telling the story but instead letting us into the mind of the director. There is so many scenes that have color being added and subtracted and symbolism. For instance there were many scenes where animals were used to represent different personalities, and the use of mirrors to show vulnerability.I've enjoyed a film by Nicolas Winding Refn, ""Drive"". Top 20 at least. He's also directed one of my least favorite films: Only God Forgives. I can forgive Nicolas Winding Refn for that film especially when he puts out such a beautiful film since then.Jesse played by Elle Fanning, you might remember from Maleficent, does a wonderful job doing physical acting. She doesn't need to talk much when her face expresses how she's feeling or her wants. A comparison that has to be made is the transformation she makes is almost identical to Black Swan. Ruby (Jena Malone), Gigi, and Sarah are a group of girls who've been in the town for a while and feel threatened by Jesse. Abbey Lee's character Sarah is especially good at portraying this and I can't really go into more detail without spoiling the film.All of the men in the film feel like sideline characters. It was intentional to keep the film focused on the females. Keanu Reeves is the most noteworthy actor in the film but his role is minor. There's really only one scene that feels completely out of place and it's Keanu Reeves and Karl Glusman's scene where they talk about Jesse. It was a play on sexism I feel.Verdict: most people would have hated to watch this film. It's methodical, slow, and has very little exposition to help you understand what's going on. I'll recommend this if you're into dissecting a film and not prone to falling asleep through movies.",The Neon Demon
164,the_bluesman,Visually impressive but without much substance and ultimately grotesque,5,31 August 2016,"Featuring a capable cast with the superb Elle Fanning in the lead and a fascinating score by Cliff Martinez, Nicolas Winding Refn's 'The Neon Demon' is a visually striking art film that is very good in the beginning, but in the end, relies too much on shock moments to be taken seriously, which in turn diminishes much of its expressiveness.The movie starts out great with Elle Fanning's character making her way in the glamorous but shallow modeling world of L.A. where she meets some shifty characters. As the movie progresses, we get to see more and more surreal scenes accompanied by Cliff Martinez' excellent electro-score. The first half of the movie is all good filmmaking if you ask me, at times reminiscent of David Lynch, Dario Argento and Roman Polanski, but somewhere in the middle, the movie begins to drag because the plot lacks narrative structure and there are too many scenes that introduce potentially interesting plot lines that are never elaborated later on.After about 90 minutes, the movie takes a kind of U-turn, changing from a slow-burning psychological drama into a nasty gore-fest that could be straight out of the mind of a lunatic. The movie's decent into full- on madness begins with Jena Malone having an experience of lesbian necrophilia in a morgue and ends with Abbey Lee eating Elle Fanning's eyeball that Bella Heathcote just puked up. Yes, that's just as crazy as it sounds. Even though Refn obviously tries to make a certain statement with the way he ended 'The Neon Demon,' one can't deny that this final succession of weird and weirder scenes is primarily there to shock the audience, and it absolutely doesn't fit in with the rest of the movie. Don't get me wrong, I like my share of insane horror movies, but it's almost never a good idea to start a movie a certain way, keep up its style for a long period of time, and only at the very end completely break with that style. It's almost like the screen is screaming ""F*** you!"" at the audience.All in the all, 'The Neon Demon' is a visually striking if narratively underwhelming social commentary on the dog eat dog modeling world of today that keeps up a great style for most of its running time but ultimately discards it in favor of shock schlock.",The Neon Demon
165,temrok9,An Experience,9,7 October 2016,"I understand the objections raised against Refn, and The Neon Demon in particular. One could really find the film boring, shallow, even repulsive or ridiculous at moments , and this is a legitimate way to react.On the other hand, it's all a matter of the kind of cinema one wants.Personally, I felt mesmerized by the unfolding of the movie that kept me captivated and made me wish for more. I don't feel cleverer for that. It's just that I care less for a plot and even less for the reconstruction of reality , and more for an experience, which definitely this movie is.Refn is a cinematic relative of David Lynch, Dario Argento, Stanley Kubrick (the master of over-stylizing), Mario Bava, Brian De Palma, Jean Jacques Beineix, and he succeeds in creating his own style, devouring all these influences. It is true that at the end I was a little bit disappointed, as I was waiting for a climax, and the final turn of the story left me somehow cold, but in general the Neon Demon is a fine representative of the kind of cinema I want to watch, so rare these days, and from that point of view it is precious to me. I watched the movie yesterday and its images keep coming to me and kind of haunt me.This is what I need a movie to be!",The Neon Demon
166,Ben_Cap,A 2 hour struggle.,4,2 July 2016,"One of the most important things that I look out for in a movie, especially in movies that are more on the indie side is originality. I first noticed director Nicholas Winding Refns' showed off his unique brand of visual movie making in Bronson, and then further so in Drive. I am sad to report that The Neon Demon is as far as I have ever seen Refn from his glory days.I entered the theater excited to see something that was not a superhero or an alien movie as most of my summer movie experiences revolve around one or both of those themes. I expected a dark LA fashion thriller akin to something like Black Swan or Chuck Palahniuk's Invisible monsters but instead I got a 2 hour overly pretentious attempt by ""NWR"" to make the most ""NWR"" movie he possibly could.I don't expect a Nicholas Winding Refn movie to have the most stimulating dialogue, i mean he has had Ryan Gosling basically be a silent lead twice in his last three movies. While I did not expect much, the writing was insulting if anything. Every bit of dialogue was used to further an incredibly slow and ultimately uninteresting plot. There was no real development of character, only the most basic skeleton of barely passable as actual human beings interacting about the plot that is made useless anyway by the terrible unlikable characters.What ""NWR"" is probably best known for is his sharp, 80's esque imagery that really put him on the map with Drive. There are plenty of neon colors and some interesting imagery, with just enough lens flare to make you hate your eyes for perceiving light that way. With that being said a vastly small amount of this is actually useful to the movie and even less is actually stimulating. There are also some really bad looking shots in this movie, which makes it either feel unfinished or unrealized.This has not been a great year for movies, while I have seen some fantastic ones such as Midnight Special and to a lesser extent The Lobster, The Neon Demon has been closer to the quality of films this year. All that being said I can't remember a worse movie that I have seen in 2016 than The Neon Demon. Even the music, which has been a staple of ""NWR"" films seems to get forgotten pretty early in the movie. If you thought it could not get any worse than Only God Forgives, I am here to tell you it can, it can be much worse. I think Mr. Winding Refn needs to spend a little more time either choosing his scripts or more time making them more interesting movies rather than all the time he spends trying to get various forms of his name in the opening credits.",The Neon Demon
167,modernmonstersdotnet,Beauty Stab,6,23 September 2016,"Nicolas Winding Refn doesn't know fashion, he doesn't care about fashion, but most importantly, he doesn't feel fashion. That's why he's copycatting Guy Bourdin in the rare occasions it is given screen time. But of course fashion is the least of The Neon Demon's concern. The closer but most elusive domain to cinema, fashion is a mighty beast to tame, and the list is long of directors trying to use it, either as satire or backdrop. Count this movie as another ill-advised foray into the carnivorous industry of youth, beauty, and the predatory behaviours it entails. Oh it's beautiful to look at, and too clever by half. But it's a ridiculous movie all the same.There are a lot of questions to be asked about where Refn's love for genre will take him at the expense of a coherent cinema. ""Do you mind if I use you for that?"" is a key phrase, said by a photographer to a model towards the end of the movie. This is definitely a question Refn should have asked Dario Argento before committing his feverish dream about the loss of innocence to film. To be honest, no one has ripped off Argento more shamelessly and unsuccessfully than Argento himself, and before the Suspiria remake hits the theaters next year, The Neon Demon might be the next best thing to the original. But as it the case with fashion, one will argue that Refn doesn't get Argento either. He knows the notes but does not sing the tune; once again, it is not what interests him here. So, what does? Christianism, apparently, as was the case with Only God Forgives. It makes sense: after the Old Testament comes the New.For some reason everything seems to be happening in bathrooms/toilets, at least the three best scenes. They play like a Christian allegory. The first one, in a dark club, has the Three Mothers (cleverly?) presented in reverse order, and the Mother of Tears, the most dangerous of all, has Jesse (Elle Fanning perfect as a preraphaelite nymph with porcelain skin), lured her out of her comfort zone and orally dissected by her two sisters, the Mother of Darkness, a top model who proudly lists her cosmetic procedures, and the Mother of Sighs, never the It girl to begin with and therefore on passive-aggressive auto-pilot. This is as much temptation as it is a Holy Spirit visitation.The second scene has Jesse meeting an unfortunate candidate for a runway show after she smashed the ladies room mirror. Jesse attempts to comfort her but is scorned for it. She cuts her hand on the broken glass. What follows is as sudden as it is ghoulish, a communion of sorts which emphasizes what is barbaric, vampiric, in the idea of drinking someone's blood as a religious rite. In the audition scene itself, starting as the Malcolm McLaren video for Madam Butterfly, the way Refn uses sound is very clever: the models walk, and you can hear their shoes creaking on the white floor of the studio. The designer never looks up. When Jesse walks, there is no such noise pollution, so he has to look up, and she's cast.The third bathroom scene is the shocking one, with an apocalyptic blue pattern on the walls and the body horror you might have heard about. It is another hint at communion, in a potent mix of glossy styling and gore. It might also be the most ridiculous way a director as gifted as Refn can take this idea across to his viewers. The scene has to be seen, and can't be unseen; it is both gross and weirdly disincarnate. The Neon Demon is not sadistic, not even voyeuristic. It makes an earnest attempt at figuring out what it is to be the most beautiful girl in the world, and guesses rightfully that she has to be punished for all the love and lust she inspires. It's too bad the movie wasn't shot in Japan as initially intended. Los Angeles is the wrong Petri dish to grow these alien life forms, reduced to one designer, one photographer and one make up artist (Jena Malone, poised even in the movie's most incongruous foray into exploitation).There is a thin line between using a genre form for such an aloof purpose and having the rubber, once stretched too far, snapping back in your face. The Neon Demon describes our iconisation of beauty as a pagan cannibalistic cult based on the debasement and consumption of virgins all too willing to sacrifice themselves to the titular demon, a vaginal pentacle devouring them whole at the end of a runway. The virgin thinks she gets a chance at becoming a Holy Trinity of herself, but instead of making her whole the demon slices her up, pixellating flesh and soul alike. There is definitely something Christian in that but, like barocco churches, there is so much imagery at work that it's all to easy to get lost in looking and missing the point.",The Neon Demon

It's hard to watch movies where I don't like any character. At one point early on, the lead literally admits to being in Hollywood because she has no skills other than her being pretty. It's just the worst kind of person living the worst kind of life; you're stuck for two hours watching a movie about people you'd ditch at a bar within five minutes.Reviews are saying ""all style, no substance,"" but I have to disagree on their being any style. The cinematography makes the film nearly unwatchable, and the actual fashion is super dated, like how you might imagine Vogue if you hadn't bothered to pick up an issue in 30 years. The final photo shoot was around a Los Angeles pool; you'd think that a film based around ""fashion"" would at least have a more fashionable, original idea. A pool in LA? Florals for Spring? Groundbreaking. That gold face makeup was cheap stickers on her face. That ""hot"" photographer not demanding she get redone was more shocking than that ending.Now, all this critique is for what you can see; the film is so dark and so ... neon - take an aspirin, you'll need it for the inevitable migraine.The ending of the movie would have been better as the opening premise, assuming the filmmaker had any interest in plot.

Not to mention that some tracks of the soundtrack are pretty good.While the basic story had potential, the actual storytelling is terrible.One may philosophize about the movie's deeper meaning.
Shallow personalities without inner qualities being obsessed with beauty, especially in the modern world of today, even more in a city that's infamous for the lack of substance of any kind, LA.Maybe The Neon Demon is nothing but an ironic allegory, using the world of the model business to show the obsession with style over substance in movies nowadays. ;)But that's not good enough, unfortunately.
I want from a movie to get either an interesting, complex story or action/horror (whatever the genre normally suggests), preferably both.Also, it didn't help that the film is too long with no pace at all, and characters I didn't care about. It can be watched, but there is no need to.

176,christian-larson,Impressive visuals with good story,8,8 September 2016,"The Neon Demon stars Elle Fanning, Jena Malone, Bella Heathcote, and Abbey Lee. Its the story of Jesse, a model that has recently moved to LA to look for a job. And this causes some problems since a lot models are also looking for the job. First thing, the cinematography is excellent. The use of neon lights, metaphors and head-trippy sequences made the cinematography authentic and brilliant. The score was also great with having a lot to do with neon lights. The whole cast was excellent, and had a lot of character depth. Abbey Lee was the one who made the best performance in my opinion, she made a very devastated look and was the one with the best lines in the film and she nailed it. The story went 50/50 for me. I loved the 1st act and was excited for the 2nd act, but then it went in this weird direction that was unnecessary for the plot. I wanted to see how the beauty of Jesse was slowly eating away her youth and quite literary her life. But then it went in this strange direction with Keanu Reeves character. It would be fine if it was brought on later, but it does not. Also the ending, while amazing to look at, is exaggerated a lot. I got the message, but it was too graphic and too weird for its own good. Aside from that, the sequences stick with you as it is a masterfully, brilliant made film with a lot of rich character depth. The script was also 50/50 for me, some of the lines are amazing and made a lot of references of how beauty is represented today. But the actions of some of the characters are a little weird and left without explanation. I will see this film again for its metaphors and hidden themed messages, overall i did really enjoy this film. 7.5/10",The Neon Demon

178,helenmcguin,Surreal Horror,9,12 April 2020,I've read other reviews saying neon demon had no substance. This film is for those who know how to look deep for substance. This film is not straight horror. It is artistic horror. I enjoy both straight horror & weird thrills. Neon Demon is surreal art in its vibrant colors and dazzling images & the acting is not straight up either. It is strange & great. I loved this movie & imagine enjoying it for years to come.,The Neon Demon
179,ryandannar,A seductively dark fairy-tale about the currency of beauty.,8,3 July 2016,"Nicholas Winding Refn -- whose previous films include ""Drive"" and ""Only God Forgives"" -- is a Danish filmmaker whose colorful, visually- arresting films tend to plumb the dark areas of the human psyche, often in a way that contrasts light, gauzy, dreamlike sequences with sudden bursts of shocking graphic violence. His latest, ""The Neon Demon,"" follows in that, ahem, vein.Superficially, ""Neon Demon"" tells the story of Jesse, a naturally- beautiful girl who arrives in L.A. with the intent of making her name in the high-fashion modeling industry. Played by Elle Fanning in a surprisingly fun and measured performance, Jesse spends much of the film unsure of herself, surrounded by people who either want to take advantage of her or BE her. She begins the film as a kind of victim, but soon enough realizes her own latent power, and begins to be more assertive. Her peers don't like this. Shocking violence ensues.If the plot sounds skin-deep, it really is -- and, arguably, the film is all the better for it. Because what's really going on here -- what Refn is really striving for -- is a dark and dreamlike fairy-tale, dense with symbolism and Jungian undercurrents, about the nature of beauty and its perceived value within our society.Jesse is, effortlessly and naturally, what all of her peers want to be. What they would kill to be, actually. Refn uses graphic violence here as a metaphor for the ways in which people harm themselves to be beautiful. One character speaks about about women being sliced, injected, stuffed, shaved, and plucked in pursuit of beauty, and the words hurt because they're true. The violence is in our culture, the film argues. We do these things to ourselves, in pursuit of the ideal represented by Jesse. When the film inevitably turns to bloodshed, it does so as a natural extension of this idea.So, the plot proceeds simply and slowly, the dialogue is campy and overwrought (but fun) -- and the symbols, sound, and cinematography loom large, carrying the bulk of the film's meaning.Let me talk about a few of the scenes and symbolic motifs which fascinated me, because that's really the only way to get to the heart of what makes this film appealing for people like me. I suppose you're either the kind of person who enjoys ""reading"" a movie on a visual level like this, or you're not. (You either ""get"" the ending of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" or you don't and probably never will.) Personally, I just love films which rely more on the visuals and the sound to tell the story than on the plot or the dialogue. Refn's films really appeal to me, because they function in sophisticated ways on this level. SPOILERS AHEAD!1) Jesse's hotel room. Jesse stays at a seedy hotel, where her small room is decorated with gaudy wallpaper, curtains, and a bedspread which all evoke a jungle theme. This might be easy to dismiss were it not so visually striking. The patterns, the textures, the colors -- the camera lingers over the walls of her room during a couple of long tracking shots, well-establishing that this place where she lives -- the only place we know as her home -- looks like a jungle.2) The spirit-animal. Returning home to her jungle-like hotel-room late one night, Jesse is startled by a noise and a shape moving in the darkness within. She gets help from the hotel manager (played by Keanu Reeves), and when they return to investigate, they discover that the intruder is a freaking LION. A lion. Pacing the jungle of her room, her room which is her home. How did the animal get inside? Where did it come from? Nothing is explained.3) Due to the aforementioned incident, the hotel manager dubs Jesse ""Wildcat.""4) The transformation. Jesse is selected to participate in a prestigious fashion-show. One of her rivals -- a woman whose candor about her many plastic-surgeries is startling -- is sick to find how easily Jesse found a place there. And then -- insult to injury -- Jesse is selected to CLOSE the show! Gasp. But watch what Refn does with Jesse's fashion- walk. Rather than show us the actual event, he gives us Jesse's internal impression of the event. What we see does include a runway, but on the other end of that runway, FACING Jesse, is another Jesse. Surrounding the runway are inverted triangles. Triangles, the symbol of power. Jesse approaches herself in a mirror, kisses her reflection. This is the transformation scene, folks. This is the scene where she embraces her inner lion, and becomes the super-predator she was born to be. Notice how, when this scene ends, we next see her leaving the backstage area, and she is completely transformed. Makeup, hair, her whole look -- it's all different. She no longer has Doe Eyes. Her eyes are now more predatorial, threatening.I suppose I could go on, but I don't really feel like spoiling the rest of the film, and you get my gist: The film lays-out symbols which build on each other and become meaningful motifs, motifs which occasionally take the foreground, driving the plot and the action. All of which plays into a multi-sided metaphor about the currency of beauty, and the violence people are willing to do to themselves (and others) in its pursuit.So, yes, I really enjoyed ""The Neon Demon."" Many people will not. It is violent, and metaphorical, and the portion of its narrative which is made explicit is just the tip of the Jungian iceberg. But those with a taste for visually evocative films -- especially the works of Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch -- will find here much to enjoy and discuss.",The Neon Demon
180,tokanac,A visually appealing fashion catalogue on screen lacking substance.,3,16 September 2019,"This is a film by Nicolas Winding Refn, which is a visual feast, featuring top celebrities. It features Elle Fanning as Jesse, an aspiring model who meets make-up artist Ruby (Jena Malone from 'the Hunger Games' fame, among others) and two fellow models Gigi (Bella Heathcote, 'Neighbours,' 'Fifty Shades Darker') and Sarah (Abbey Lee, 'Mad Max: Fury Road,' 'Office Christmas Party'). As other models, such as Gigi and Sarah, work hard for where they are and are nearing their 'expiration dates,' Jesse experiences success rather quickly. She befriends Ruby, Gigi and Sarah, but soon learns that the trio soon becomes resentful of her good-looks and success.I saw this movie pop up on Netflix and decided to give it a go because of the actors and it looked visually appealing. Unfortunately, this is just what it is, visually appealing. I was disappointed because I know the calibre that these actresses can go, but that performance I know them for just wasn't delivered in this film. Perhaps that had something to do with the writing and story, which left little to be desired. The story had potential, but because of the writing, it didn't get very far. Instead, there's no true substance to this movie at all. It's like looking at the latest edition of Vogue Magazine - the wardrobe, lighting and make-up are there, and look stunning, but not only is there no text to accompany those photos, there's also nothing about the models wearing those clothes. Sure, there's dialogue, but it's all superficial s***; the dialogue doesn't add any depth to the characters. Therefore, the audience doesn't feel any connection with the said characters and we don't really care what happens to them. This movie is just reiterating what we've long suspected (which has been proven untrue) that models are just airheads who lack any real depth and are more concerned with their looks than anything else.The soundtrack is bizarre and shouldn't be in such a film. But, considering that the film, itself, is bizarre, I guess it suits.I don't know if I'd see this movie again. Apart from the visual feast, this movie is lacking in anything real and, therefore, I give it 3.5/5 stars.",The Neon Demon
181,antant-13838,Pointless,1,27 April 2020,Whatever was going on in Winding Refn's mind definitely did not hit the screen coherently. Ok it looked good at time's but really it's a pretentious mess. Save your eyeballs.,The Neon Demon
182,austinfromdahood,A very polarizing movie that I thoroughly enjoy,9,4 December 2018,"Just to start right off the bat, I'm a big Nicolas Winding Refn fan. I've only watched 4 of his movies, and I worship all of them. Even the not so great Only God Forgives, I still highly appreciate for its uniqueness. Drive is one of my favorites, Bronson was a really solid movie for it's superbly low budget, Only God Forgives is a very tough movie to watch, but there is many things to appreciate while watching it. The Neon Demon falls along the style of Only God Forgives. Drive and Bronson were very accessible films, ones that most audiences wouldn't hate. Only God Forgives and The Neon Demon are not so mainstream like Refn's other films. Definitely my favorite thing about The Neon Demon is its complexity and style. This movie isn't so straightforward, and many audiences might not like that. There are scenes that on the surface, might not make sense, but in the context of the story and its deeper meanings will make sense in terms of why that scene is in the movie. I can describe the movie's style as eye candy, and also, not holding back it's violence and gore. There are time where I feel disgusted watching this movie, and at other times, feeling hypnotized on what is going on. I like to watch movies where I get a strong reaction from what is going on, and this movie succeeds in that. The movie also doesn't have much dialogue either. This movie is mostly visual storytelling, and it is used beautifully. The overarching message in this movie is also horrifying, if you really think about it, and it is also very realistic. Some unsettling things that happened in this movie certainly happened in real life, and I'm just saying that this movie portrays objectification, jealousy, and how beauty is represented in the real world. The only complaint I have with this movie is that sometimes there is too much violence, and I feel like Refn is just putting stuff on screen that he enjoys. But, this movie is definitely my second favorite Refn film, and I really can't get enough of it. This movie gives me chills just thinking about it. I'd give The Neon Demon a 9/10",The Neon Demon
183,gtylerpayne,Incredible directing and cinematography in this abstract art film,8,21 September 2016,"It seems that, after the massive success of Drive, Refn is being given the opportunity to make the films he wants to make and take a lot of creative license.I think this is a good thing, and it's a smart way to go about a career in any creative industry. Achieve mainstream success doing things that are commercially viable, and when you have people's attention and trust, you can do something more abstract and creative and people will actually go see it with an open mind, and quite possibly love it. Another example of this is a band like Radiohead, they put out ""Creep"" which is a perfect radio single, and when that got them famous, they went and made albums that would never have been produced or listened to if they had done them straight away. This is a cool movie. It's not for everyone. The editing, camera work, framing, pace, screenplay, lighting, production design, wardrobe... all the creative elements of this film have a modern, stylistic feel that seems ahead of it's time. It's the type of movie you may want to tell all your friends is your ""favorite"" even if it's not, just to make yourself look cool (haha.. sad but true)The plot is very abstract, and contains a lot of elements of surrealism. Refn reminds me of film-makers like David Lynch or Terry Gilliam or even Salvador Dali. I like that he took a risk and really went with his vision to make a film that could never have mainstream appeal. It is a piece of art, and left open to interpretation. The whole thing may be a dream, or an alternate reality, or some combination of these with real life. The production design and framing and editing made me feel things and think things and imagine things. It seemed to be trying to take me on a journey through space and time while telling an intoxicating story that was an allusion to the real world. It helps to be in the right state both mentally and physically for a movie like this. It's the type of movie you want to watch in a very dark room, on a very comfortable couch, with a big screen and a great surround sound system. Then you can prepare to get lost in the film and experience it as a whole, instead of just watching it.I definitely can't watch movies like this everyday, and while it is a great exercise in expanding your mind, being creative, and thinking abstract thoughts, it may seem boring on the wrong day. A cool thing about movies like this, is the re-watch-ability of them. Most movies are best the first time you see them, and don't offer much for a repeated viewing. This is the type of movie that can be watched many times. The experience will be different each time and you may notice or realize things you didn't see the first time. It reminds me of David Lynch and his movie ""Mulholland Drive."" I really love that movie and it is similar in the way that people love it or hate it. With ""Mulholland Drive,"" I watched it many times, and grew to understand it on my own terms, which was a fun journey.I do hope that Reft doesn't decide to continue making movies that are always this abstract. Often times, I watch movies with a great plot, that are very entertaining films, but wish the director and cinematographer had been more creative with the lighting and camera work. Seeing his style and eye applied to mainstream blockbusters and thrillers would be really cool in my opinion, but I doubt he will ever go too far into directing movies with a typical ""Hollywood"" script. After the success of ""Mulholland Drive,"" Lynch continued to make exclusively dreamy, abstract movies, and while I respected that, it just didn't seem necessary.Go check this movie out with an open mind on a night when you are relaxed and feeling good. Maybe watch it with some friends and have a good conversation afterward sharing thoughts and interpretations; I'm sure they will vary radically. You might love it, and you might hate it, but I think most people will respect the artistry of the film and have trouble forgetting it anytime soon.",The Neon Demon
184,klheintz,Too much symbolism and cool scenes with not enough coherent story,5,10 November 2016,"Neon Demon is a strange movie. It's one of the trippy films with a whole lot of weird imagery that makes you pay attention because you feel like it may be a super smart movie and you don't want to miss anything important. But what you're left with is something that isn't really that smart, it just tries to be.The acting in the film is strange as well with a lot of characters purposefully being stiff and almost mysterious. It's trying to be a super smart, strange, trippy kind of movie a little bit too hard. Also some of the characters never feel wrapped up and you just never see them again.What did I like about the movie was some of the imagery. While it does offer some of the symbolism I mentioned earlier, it doesn't feel as out of place as you'd think. There are some really pretty scenes that are definitely memorable and recognizable.Overall it's not a bad movie, it's just OK.

185,FrostyChud,Hypocrite,3,14 June 2016,"My ex-model ex-girlfriend, who is as heartless and superficial as the evil models in this movie, would find THE NEON DEMON to be a perspicacious criticism of the fashion world. This alone should discredit the movie.That's the thing about these people. They love to emit pseudo-criticisms of themselves and their corrupt world...pseudo because although the content is critical, the form is not. This is even a handy heuristic for outing hypocrites of all stripes: does he or she adopt a cynical critical distance towards his or her persona while continuing to engage in bad behavior? If so...run away.This director is such a pompous sell-out that he has actually transformed his initials into a brand that appears during the credits. Buddy...in this life, you can't have it both ways. Every shot in this movie is an homage to surfaces. The script is vacuous. There is nothing resembling subjectivity here. The very form of beautiful, static images is oppressive. By cloaking itself in a self- righteous message, THE NEON DEMON can attain its true objective all the more efficiently: making the spectator feel as envious, as worthless, and as empty inside as the ""bad"" models, who are the true heroines of this movie. Try to imagine how they were cast. I should also mention that THE NEON DEMON is a rip-off of a much better movie: David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE.I will never see another film by this evil man.",The Neon Demon

Natasha Braier's pictures under Refn's prodding, with the performances on show here will leave you so unaware of what you're feeling ... but feeling it so very hard that the world will be muted for an hour after you leave the theatre.For me this is what cinema is for: Taking me away and *making* me feel. Feel it hard. This is guttural, and intensity born of coldness. I don't remember feels this hard from anything Refn has displayed before, but I do rather sleep around a lot ... so perhaps his films have just melded in to all the other films I've gotten in to bed with.One note: I might be dumb, but I saw no metaphor here, as others have suggested to me that this has on show, but that could be the aforementioned ignorance.

188,FilmLiquet,Film Liquet on The Neon Demon,4,7 November 2018,"Jesse (Elle Fanning) is a 16-year-old teen that just moved to Los Angeles; looking to become a model, the agency convinces her that she needs to pose as a 19-year-old in order to get into the business without any troubles. Furthermore, the other models get envious of her beauty and she puts up with a creepy photographer and a nasty motel manager.The film is covered with bizarre visual elements and editing techniques. However unsettling it may be, it is mesmerising to watch the work of Natasha Braier, who uses many contrasts of light, darkness and an abundance of colours to match the moods of the film. The make up in the film has a great amount of detail put into it and is stylised to match the film's peculiar design elements. The film looks alien almost, being so perfect and yet having so many creative choices behind it, it certainly has a unique look.Disregarding the aesthetics of the film, the story although very clear is riddled with elements of psychological horror, making it almost seem like the film crosses into the art-house genre. The twisted, nightmarish horror is a flawed masterpiece, as even though the mind-blowing cinematic elements do raise the film to a high standard, the story and the characters are underdeveloped. The movie relies on the aesthetics mostly, and although it does deliver in the genre, taking you on a roller coaster of emotions, in our opinion it does not do the story its due. It is fairly obvious why the film wasn't received too well and was not too popular, not even making up the half of its budget in worldwide sales.",The Neon Demon
189,Victreebong,"Poetic, stunning, violent, cult.",9,25 February 2017,"First off, this is not a feel good movie. This is a WTF kind of film. If you loved Drive but cringed when Cranston got his arm cut, prepare for another visceral endeavor. Neon Demon starts off cautionary, transcends surreal (several times), and then goes full on horror/thriller. The conclusion is absolutely WTF.From the minute the shutters flash in the beginning with Jesse (Fanning) posing for an amateur shoot, we're aware that she's in way over her head. Naïve, underage, beautiful, vulnerable, she's a girl chasing a dream about to be swallowed by a world all too used to eating through potential starlets; Hollywood, CA. She befriends Ruby (Malone), a Sapphic make-up prof who moonlights as a morgue assistant at night. Ruby is intermingled to a posse of veteran models who already know the ropes of the Hollywood machine and take no time sticking Fanning in her place to avoid a potential talent uprising. Drama ensues.Being the attractive magnet that she is, Jesse must play smart in a world full of cutthroat talent scouts, agency reps, love interests, rapist motel clerks, and jealous peers. But will she use intuition to avoid the malaise of the glamorous, or be sucked into it's vapid vortex? You'll need watch Neon Demon to find out for yourself, but the conclusion (while fairly obvious) is startling.Pacing is on track, scary, then scarier, then startling, and then ultimately ""how the hell did they film this?"" moments. Acting is also on point, in particular Malone and Hendricks are my absolute favorites. Hendricks unfortunately doesn't have a lot of screen time in this, pretty much limited to one scene, but this is about the most believable role I've seen her in. Malone, dear God. This is THE girl we need to watch out for. If you thought she stole the show in Catching Fire, see her in this. Keanu plays a character that is simply dripping with slime. And while the models are absolutely plastic, the gravitas in their performance is nothing short of a forewarning about what modeling in the fashion world is really like. Harrington and Glusman are equally as empty, portraying a world in which superficiality is the ONLY thing (incredible casting for Harrington, you're almost afraid of him the first time you watch the movie). Lastly, Fanning is a delight. Clean, sweet, pretty, fragile, and then at one point develops into The Demon, she changes at the same pace the movie unfolds. This is a surreal flick (it is a Refn film), so expect flash montages, saturated vibrant colors, glitter, body landscapes, pools of blood, moonlight, pure white, the most perfect blacks, liquids, slow-mo, nipples, vulvae, absolute violence, beautiful decay, the gorgeous. The movie's soundtrack could have its own introduction, bass thumping, soft undertones, electronica, and just about anything you can think of on the catwalk present. This IS a cult title in the same vein as Scanner Darkly, Spring Breakers, Traffic, Blow, Boogie Nights, and any other film that tells you what the real price is for living in the fast lane.You've been warned.",The Neon Demon

I saw an interview with Refn where he basically sums up this film as being about ""what it would be like to be born beautiful.""

193,Fiurilli,A beautiful film but not quite a masterpiece,7,15 July 2016,"Before going into 'The Neon Demon' I really did not know what to expect. The trailers made it look like I was about to see a beautiful movie, but as Nicolas Winding Refn's previous movie 'Only God Forgives' showed beauty is not everything. The movie states the opposite however and claims that beauty is the only thing. Well if this is true than 'The Neon Demon' should be considered as a movie that is almost close to perfection. The 'Neon' part from the title really shines throughout the movie as every scene is gorgeously lit. Furthermore almost every set is carefully constructed, when combined with the amazing soundtrack by Cliff Martinez and the neon what is left is a movie that without an accompanying story would be worth the price of admission on it's own.The movie does have a story however as it tells the tale of a fairly unknown model who goes by the name of Jesse. Jesse is one of the most beautiful women you'll ever meet. Her rise to fame is fairly quick as all of the designers and photographers want to work with her while on the other hand most of the models go to great lengths just to be more like her. The story really shines in the first half of the movie and, despite the surreal way some scenes are, seems very realistic. As the second act begins the events start to become quite abnormal and really contest the viewers suspension of disbelief as certain characters undergo an enormous shift in character. Although this was foreshadowed in earlier parts of the film it would have been a lot better if this change happened a little more gradually throughout the movie. Also even though their resolution would have no real effect on the story there were still some loose ends by the time the credits appeared on the screen.Speaking of foreshadowing the movie does this a lot. Scattered throughout the movie are a lot of breadcrumbs in terms of visual clues and a few lines of dialogue causing certain events to be foretold. The movie hardly does any hand holding however as these breadcrumbs are just large enough for the observant viewer to notice. Although I have only seen the movie once I am certain I missed a lot that were hidden in plain sight.The actress Elle Fanning who portrays Jesse does so in an amazing and unique way, with another actress in Jesse's shoes the movie probably would have turned out quite a bit differently. I hope to see more of here as she certainly established herself in a leading role. Supporting Ella Fanning is Jena Malone as well as Bella Heathcote and Keanu Reeves. Although Malone's performance really sticks out amongst the four they all acted out their role extremely well.Overall I can say that 'The Neon Demon' is a real treat for those who enjoyed Nicalas Winding Refn's previous movies or are fond of artsy movies in general. The movie is well acted, well directed with an amazing soundtrack on top of it all. Beauty is certainly not it's only thing!My rating: 7/10",The Neon Demon

195,zadok-332-444684,The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.,7,7 January 2017,"It is a mistake to consider this a film about the ""evil fashion industry"" ruining some innocent country girl. That is not it. That is not the demon. We get to see quite some Neon alright - a half-colour that appears to carry from fashion and art all the way to dystopian dreams of artificial sheep. It goes well with mirrors. What is the demon though?It's her. She herself pledges guilty. She is dangerous and destructive, sowing sorrow and despair. Although she appears to not do much of anything, everything revolves around her still. The appeal of innocence, mouldability and availability is more decisive than her beauty. Her charms lie in awakened desires that are not to be fulfilled. Like Helena, like the written ""Calista"", she doesn't do anything but rather inspires evil in others. She is victorious. Her essence is contained, spreads its evil seed further and further in consumption.Now this is all pretty neat but is it really the message here? Impressive images are sparsely provided with content, showing that this film was genuinely meant to offer a certain depth while not really closing a container to hold anything. An Abyss? In any case a rather vague series of expressions. The stronger these expressions become the more it feels like a bucking bull ride rather than an arrow in true flight.If his vision is so great I'd consider it sin to not commit further, to not make it digestible to a reasonable degree. Perhaps Nicolas Winding Refn can see far. However: he's not very good at showing his findings to others I am afraid. Hardly any film had so many shallow and obviously wrong interpretations in its reviews, just like hardly any film fails as hard to make a point and get it transmitted. Even if I managed to shed some light here - this is the bare bones, no more. Is there any purpose, any love in these ideas? Is this film good? Yes: there is art in this. The Neon Demon appeals to our hidden desires, to some kind of half-natural animal inside ourselves, in its neon images. It does not leave me satisfied at all. Who knows? Perhaps I am not even supposed to be. Perhaps this film is just as demonic as is its subject.""You must have a cigarette. A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied."" - Oscar Wilde",The Neon Demon
196,pelhamc,All That Glitters is Not Gold,4,8 September 2016,"Style over substance is what you will get with Neon Demon. It's Black Swan meets Bladerunner. Nicolas Winding Refn, now ""NWR,"" cultivates (savors?) his art deco sense of cinematography in his latest. Neon Demon follows the story of an anorexic ingenue with the ""it"" factor, set in the glitzy world of glamor. It's a classic innocence lost tale. The dialogue is mysteriously terse a la David Lynch. The plot bares a suspicious resemblance to a certain ballerina picture. It stars nobody.I will say this for Neon Demon. It's visually stunning. You may find this interesting if you're a model, but if you find it relatable or realistic, seek help.",The Neon Demon
197,croweykid,Not for everyone...obviously,8,10 November 2019,"For instance, don't watch it with your kids...or your grandmother with a heart condition...or with your pastor, or at a work party, or on date night with your Ken doll or Larry the Cable Guy figurine or a confused confused Door Dash delivery boy you dragged in to pretend to be your date. Okay, maybe the last guy - if he's riding the flow state.But all in all, it's generally best viewed at new moon art shows, illuminati discos and JP Morgan' annual masquerade ball. If you can deal with abstraction, open ended fantasy and don't need a YouTube commentator to hold your hand and explain what you're watching in lieu of dialogue. If you like Borges stories, Argento films and exploring the primal darkness in the human ego then git in thar & have a looksee.The panning is invariably the result of Transformers fans getting lured into an arthouse flick by the promise of gorey T&A. Quite likely many of them are the joke here - some people are laughing and they don't get it and it makes them feel anxious, so they lash out with 1 star reviews.Keanu Reeves slays as a total creepshow. Elle Fanning nails it. There is only one somewhat sympathetic character and we feel that perhaps it was only a matter of time before he succumbed to the viral madness around him. While I don't typically enjoy movies without a character relate to, the underlying conundrum of existence in this world is what's there to empathize with (in place of an audience surrogate character, we have an audience surrogate emotion hanging over the whole narrative, if you were one who could follow it). Realizing that everyone and everything is hostile becomes the most gripping part of a movie that is suddenly holding you captive as the prey. There are jackals circling a small rabbit on screen but soon there are only jackals and they are all looking at you, and you are alone in the dark. Don't blink, don't avert your eyes. Stare it down.I agree with another reviewer that said it could, perhaps should, have been shorter. The actual ending feels like a bonus scene, an epilogue that could have rolled after the credits. The pacing didn't need to be so slow and the extended closure broke the smooth flow of the film, somewhat, which was essentially resolved at 90 min. However, the 2 hour mark is interesting nonetheless.",The Neon Demon
198,DeadeGuard98,"The Beautiful, The Innocent and The Narcissistic",7,25 May 2020,"😱 First Impressions:
The name itself already lured me in and it actually bears more meaning than initially thought. Firstly, a literal one involving the style and design of the film. The other has to do with a metaphor; centred on narcissistic tendencies.Pros:
😋 Beautiful even surreal use of colors and symbolism in cinematography😋 Elle Fanning is a perfect fit for the inexperienced, timid and ultimately easily impressionable aspiring model.😋 Soundtrack bodes well with the overall trippy experienceCons:
😪 The same imagery could be jarring and too slow-burn for some.😪 Under-developed characters.😪 Story could have headed in a better direction; instead of a grim albeit possibly true depiction of a cutthroat industry.😇Verdict😈
The Neon Demon presents an equally stylistic and ambitious exploration of the modelling scene- though one that does not pay off or lead anywhere groundbreaking. That said, it is still a worthy 2-hour long psychological horror that's unlike any other, not for a long while.",The Neon Demon

However, if you're a fan of slow horror then yea give it a shot.My issues with the movie is there isn't really much to it besides the typical everyone wants to be or be with the pretty girl. Thinking back on it now after seeing it, it felt kind of boring. Even more so considering the big twist isn't until the very end. While the movie was over all very beautiful and the main actress is down right gorgeous, there aren't too many moments in this movie that creeped me out. And a lot that did was just real life horrific things that are real and do happy every day. Uncomfortable? Yea. Scary?

But I thought, whatever, the premise seems cool so I went and watched it anyway. Visually, the movie is stunning. If I were judging based on aesthetics and cinematography alone this would have been a 10/10. The music also fits the mood of the film like a glove. It's in terms of story-telling that it falls flat. For a thriller (as it is listed on IMDb) The Neon Demon fails to get the viewer on the edge of his/her seat. Other than a chase scene at the end, the movie is rather slow and tame in terms of pacing. It also felt drawn-out. With the amount of story, I'd say that The Neon Demon would work much better as a short, as the shorter time frame would deliver all the story in a much more lively way. So that's what The Neon Demon is; a pretty movie with mediocre writing. If you love good cinematography, I absolutely recommend this. However, if you want a gripping story, better watch something else.",The Neon Demon
202,dmhughes-448-695102,"Another Polarizing Film By Nicolas Winding Refn, And I Loved Every Minute Of It",9,27 June 2016,"In September 2011, I saw a film by Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, who up until that point was known for his gritty crime thrillers like the Pusher Trilogy (1996-2005) and Bronson (2008). That particular film was called Drive (2011), and the critics adored it so much at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival that it earned Refn the award for Best Director. Drive was only a modest box office success at the time, as many audience members had been expecting an action-packed heist film in the vein of The Fast & The Furious. I understood that Refn was creating a small character-driven story, but it seemed like a lot of people just didn't get it, and the film ultimately left my local theater after just two weeks, and was completely ignored at the Academy Awards that year. Thankfully, Drive has spent the past five years growing into one of the most adored films of the decade. It helped make actors like Ryan Gosling, Oscar Isaac, and Carey Mulligan become household names, whilst it gave others like Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, and Ron Perlman some of the best performances of their careers. With it's simple, but investing story, gorgeous visuals, editing, and of course Cliff Martinez's classic 80s-inspired soundtrack, Drive has become one of my all-time favorite movies, and I, like many, couldn't wait for what Refn would come up with next.in 2013, I got my wish, as Refn released a new film, Only God Forgives (2013), a film that also starred Ryan Gosling. It had everything that made Drive great; fantastic visuals, editing and cinematography, and another inspired soundtrack by Martinez. Everyone waited for the word from critics at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival to sing praises of Refn's latest magnum opus...and ultimately, the critics were not so kind to it.In fact, from what I heard and read, some critics outright despised it. I heard stories of the film being simultaneously booed and praised at Cannes. Many complained that Refn had made a film that had no point, and that it was just an exercise in his own artistic pretentiousness and the desire to show gratuitous violence. The film regrettably came nowhere close to my local theater, so I had to wait for it to come out on video before I could watch it, and I'll admit that I loved it. Refn did what he promised, take the style of Drive and amplify it. He didn't care if he drove critics or fans away, because he wanted to make movies that appealed to him and not a studio system, and I came to admire him for it.Now, it's 2016, and Refn has returned with his latest film The Neon Demon (2016), and like his previous effort, it has received polarizing reviews. Once again, Refn has made a film that was either booed or applauded by critics at Cannes, and it seems to have divided audiences down the middle; it's either seen as a scathing criticism of the modeling industry in Los Angeles, or a pretentious wanna-be horror film that focuses on scenes of graphic violence and...other activities involving violence that I will not dare spoil, despite the insistence of many top critics to do so.The Neon Demon is the story about a young model named Jesse (Elle Fanning), who arrives in Los Angeles and is quickly viewed as ""the next big thing"". She has it all; the looks, the style, the walk, etc. Everyone praises her for her natural beauty and skill, and how she does not need to rely on body modification, or usage of drugs and sex to get the best gigs at fashion shows or photo shoots. Naturally, this draws the attention of older, and less-than-perfect models/make-up artists Ruby (Jena Malone), Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee), and eventually reveals their obvious jealousy and rage that could potentially put Jesse, who becomes enamored with the prestige and high-life, in mortal danger.I will not say any more because that would be spoiling, and I believe this is a film that needs to be seen to be believed. The Neon Demon has all the hallmarks of a Refn film I could want. It looks incredible (I could literally put frames from this film on my wall), it sounds incredible, once again thanks to another phenomenal soundtrack by Cliff Martinez, the performances from everyone are spot-on, including a surprise turn to the sinister by Keanu Reeves (who I swear is having a Renaissance in the vein of Matthew McConaughey), and of course, Refn's method of using visuals to show his point of view, which I will admit is pretty twisted, but fascinating.Refn makes it clear from the very first frame, that this is a world where you're successful one day, and then out the next, and that many industries, in this case modeling, will literally and figuratively devour you. Watching this film made me feel both exhilarated and uncomfortable, and some of the imagery that Refn uses here did make quite a few people in the audience, myself included, gasp in shock and awe.In conclusion, Nicolas Winding Refn has done it again. He has crafted a film that at times is a very tough viewing, but it constantly kept pulling me in with its rich visuals, fantastic music, and some truly terrifying performances. I just feel sad for those Refn aficionados who may not get to see this on a big screen. It appears that Refn will once again have to watch another one of his films see true life on television and home video, as indie-fare is constantly pushed aside for mediocre sequels and big-budget extravaganzas. Who cares, though. It's a future cult classic, and I highly recommend it, ONLY if you really like Refn or films that really focus on visuals. Otherwise you might despise it like a lot of critics did.VERDICT: 9/10",The Neon Demon

It shows how models can go above and beyond to be successful or keep on being successful and looks isn't a mirror to what's inside. Although people may understand many things or nothing from this movie but that is how I perceived it.
.
You will find many bad reviews about this simply because people chose to watch a movie that they expected differently in my opinion. This movie doesn't sell itself to be a story driven thriller whatsoever, or action movie. This movie is a movie that is made purely to achieve outstanding, gorgeous visuals that will make your eyes bleed from beauty. It's one mesmerising shot after one.

There is bit of gore, disturbing scenes that includes cannibalism, necrophilia and fetishism. I definitely would define this movie as an erotica alongside with thriller. Erothriler? I personally love these movies, I'd put it in the same category with Raw and Dogtooth, which I loved. Weirdly and disturbing with a touch of ero.

~This type of movie kind of reminds me of old Giallo movies like Profondo Rosso (1975) and Suspiria (1977), which is getting a remake!!!!, so if you're into those movies that has lots of colour and eroticism and gore, I definitely recommend this movie.",The Neon Demon

The director of this movie should just direct music videos because this movie is a nearly 2 hour music video! This film is made as an excuse to include lesbian sex scenes. I'm not homophobic.

209,moritzmeyerautor,AWFUL! Avoid this horrible and repulsive style-exercise,3,4 February 2017,"So, I wanted to watch The Neon Demon, like many other people, because I absolutely love Drive, director Nicolas Winding Refn's acclaimed predecessor. It's one of my favourite movies of the recent years and I have watched it many, many times now. I am not going to watch The Neon Demon again. Ever. In fact, I'm trying to wash some of its images out of my mind. At the beginning, it seems to bear a lot of similarities with Drive. Like the Driver, our heroine is pretty tight-lipped, we don't know much about her past and she has a unique talent, in which she surpasses anyone else. At least, she is given a name: Jesse. We met her shortly after her arrival in LA, where she desires to start a model career. At first, everything looks very promising. She gets a couple of gigs and looks to be the rising star of LA's catwalks. But her success evokes the envy of her competition. And these model- bitches certainly don't hold back, when it comes to fighting their territory. These could have been an interesting plot, if Nicolas Winding Refn had any interest in executing such a thing. But none of the actions of the characters seem to mean anything. I get it, that this is supposed to be very stylized and surreal. But that doesn't mean, that it has to be boring. So many scenes go on and on and on without having any impact for the rest of the movie. Well, a movie can be boring. I mean, this is a problem, but it happens. The problems with The Neon Demon begin, when it starts to counter its own dullness with crudity. In the second half, the movie becomes not only repulsive. It insults the intelligence of the audience.What is it, that NWR wants to accomplish with this style-exercise? Is it a commentary about our own superficial society? Does he criticize, how the fashion industry and we as consumers objectify women? Does it show, how close the beauty and the ugly are? These could be interesting questions, if the movie would make any attempt to answer them. But it doesn't. Instead, it falls victim to its own subject. There is no depth in scenes of rape, necrophilia, pedophilia and what other distasteful obscenities occur in this movie. You have to give them at least some context. The only thing, that is absolutely clear to me: The way, NWR treats his female characters, is plain awful and disrespectful. They are just dehumanized, exchangeable parts in a misguided art installation.In short, after a promising opening, The Neon Demon falls apart very quickly and ends up being a cheap exercise in meaningless provocation and obscenity. It's one of the worst films I have ever seen. Avoid!",The Neon Demon
210,feelinesound,Worth seeing if only for the incredible score and visual extravaganza,8,24 August 2016,"There have been others here who have done great full reviews of the film so I'll avoid that and just try to add my own two cents.This certainly isn't Refn's best film (for me that honour still belongs to Drive) nor his second or third best. It seems like with this one he fell in love with himself, and with his persona as a director, a bit too much and started overemphasising the audiovisual aspect at the expense of story, emotional depth and character development. As good a job as some of the actors did, I simply didn't feel anything for any of the characters, not even the poor naive boyfriend, and didn't at all care what happened to them.That said the audiovisual aspect is phenomenal, even more awe-inspiring than any of Refn's other works, and it's worth seeing this film just for that. Cliff Hernandez's score particularly is just another level of analogue synthesiser heaven and by far his best work to date. It gives the film almost every bit of emotional depth it has and lifts it from an ""interesting but ultimately superficial"" to ""exceptional and utterly unique"" piece of work -- and this from someone who still bears begrudges Refn for dismissing the Johnny Jewel soundtrack for Drive in favour of Hernandez.In summary, go see it and enjoy it for what it has to offer, even if it's noticeably flawed in other ways.",The Neon Demon

The movie is simply without any substance and the story lacks a reasonable meaning - it comes out empty as a shell in my humble view.Once before Refn tried to copy masters like David Lynch half psychotic/half sane universe (Twin Peaks, Lost Highway) and Stanley Kubrick (A clockwork orange, 2001:A space odyssey, Eyes wide shut) when he made Fear X and Only God Forgives, but in my opinion Refn simply does not have the talent for this type of genre which The Neon Demon so obviously demonstrates.It is not that Refn cant make movies.

217,LongLiveTheNewFlesh27,"Flawed, but unique and entertaining",7,18 May 2017,"The Neon Demon is definitely a gorgeous film. Each shot is painterly, giving a sense of personality and energy to every frame. I can't quite name one shot that couldn't be framed and hung up at an art gallery. The soundtrack too is completely gorgeous, nailing a distinct mixture of haunting electro beats and fairytale synths. The Neon demon is definitely a welcome and fresh surprise in this barren apocalyptic landscape that is current movies, but it's not completely free of sin. The main problem with the movie is the screenplay. While it skirts along from one epic artsy- setpiece to the next(The nightclub scene, the gold paint shoot scene, the runway scene, the eyeball scene), the connecting tissue to those scenes isn't as strong. The characters are mostly vapid and since this is a movie about Los Angeles and the modeling industry I completely understand that, but it can become a bit tiresome after a while. It's obvious that Nicholas Winding Refn is trying to give the main character (Elle Fanning) a certain sense of innocence and naivety as to make her transformation (during the pivotal runway scene) all the more jarring, but once she makes that transformation, she doesn't really follow through on it. There's one scene where she gives her sort-of boyfriend the cold shoulder, but other than that she (spoiler alert!) dies before she can even do anything. I would have liked to see become as cold as the models preying on her, and perhaps kill the character of Ruby, who isn't a part of the shocking set-piece at the end of the movie. Besides those problems, there's only a couple other minor grievances I have with the film. The models were all very good, and Jena Malone was fantastic, and also extremely daring and ballsy (a particular scene in a morgue is quite disgusting and shocking). The only character I particularly disliked was the male fashion designer, who was just completely absurdly unrealistic. The fact is that most male fashion designers are gay, and even if they aren't, their not as alpha and brooding as he was. The worst scene in the film is a conversation between Elle Fanning's sort-of boyfriend and the fashion designer, where the fashion designer says ""Beauty isn't everything, it's the only thing"". The boyfriend replies with: ""I think it's what's inside that counts"". WHAT? This is a line that betrays the character first of all (in the opening shot he is shooting Elle Fanning draped over the couch, dripping fake blood from her neck), and also just comes off as completely disingenuous. The film's entire aesthetic is beauty. It's beauty for beauty's sake. The film, up to that point, is not about feminism or ideology. It's merely bathing in aesthetics. You can make a film about how ""Whats on the inside counts"" but this is certainly not that film. If I were Nicholas Winding Refn I would not have let that line fly. At least next time you'll know, hopefully.All that aside, I implore Hollywood to look at unique, interesting and well-made films like this and say ""Let's do more of those"". I don't know how many more ugly, stale Marvel films I can watch before my head explodes from boredom. I haven't seen all of Nicholas Winding Refn's films, and I'll admit that some of his earlier work isn't for me. I didn't really dig Valhalla Rising or Bronson, or the first Pusher for that matter (I know the sequels are better and I'm looking forward to seeing them), but what he's been doing recently, with Drive, Only God Forgives and now this, I'm pretty sure I'll be the first in line to see whatever he does next.",The Neon Demon

Supposedly.Only God Forgives was Refn's take on Korean gore horror/torture porn. Neon Demon is inspired by runway aesthetics with a hint of satire.

I just wasted two hours sitting through it so I'm not spending much time here. There are plenty of reviews that go into detail about the reasons this is such a terrible film. I will say that Kendrick and Reeves only seem to be in this film to attract viewers as name-brand actors. Keanu's character is undeveloped and serves no real purpose here, at least not to an extent requiring anyone with the price tag he surely comes with. It's clear that the score here on IMDb and the reviews are padded. Your time would better be spent here reading a few of the 1, 2 and 3 star reviews and then watching anything but this film. When I see a film this terrible, with not a single redeeming quality or moment, I can't help but wonder how a group of writers, directors, producers and actors can all get behind something like this and think it's worth wasting their collective time and money on and then also have a studio promote and market it. So many films with great potential fall through the cracks and never get made or completed for whatever reasons, yet somehow films like this get made and promoted.

222,marcar912,Does anyone remember Helmut Newton?,1,8 November 2016,"The Neon Demon seems to be an unsuccessful attempt to animate the daring, scary and high-fashion photography of Helmut Newton from the 1980s. It seems to me that director Nicholas Winding Refn (who has the nerve to leave his monogram NWR throughout the opening and closing credits as though this film was his tribute to himself and his imaginary smoking jacket), fails miserably to enter the over-the-top, sexually tinged world of slick editorial and advertising fashion mags without a clue to its real inner workings or long-standing history and innovation. Just take a look at a Vogue from 40 years ago and you'll see more provocative images--women in bondage, strapped with saddles, sporting sleek prosthetic legs and arms--all the while in stiletto heels and designer clothes. That era, in a gorgeous, and highly controversial manner, broke all the rules in the fashion world. There's been no one like Newton before or since. Certainly not Winding-Refn. My guess is that NWR needed to do some research not just of the fashion world he tried so badly to recreate but of the movies that have dealt so longingly and beautifully with themes such as cannibalism, envy and eternal youth. Try the Hunger with David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve or even Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" that introduced us to paparazzi. Those films brought slick, disturbing yet hauntingly beautiful images on screen to create classics that still stand.

It is abstract and has a pretty simple message about the issues with vanity and the modeling industry specifically. But personally, I found it entertaining and the acting was on point from all the actors / actresses. Keanu Reeves did a great job; his character was horrible yet hilarious at the same time.POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEADThere's pretty much one sane character (the amateur photographer) and everyone else is psycho or becomes corrupted in some way. But the characters were pretty interesting. There were a lot of strange things that were a bit ""what...?"", but it worked for a more abstract film. I also think it was clever how the woman who warned Jesse at the beginning to watch out for the male photographer and that ""it's good to have good girls around"" was ultimately the one who was the worst psycho of all.",The Neon Demon

A lot of people are gonna be like ""omg how is this movie disturbing"" BUT HAVE YOU SEEN IT!!! That witch girl Ruby literally tries to RAPE Jessie like OMG!!!!! A 30 LADY TRYING TO RAPE A YOUNG 16 YEAR OLD GIRL!!!! That's just disgusting! Then she makes out and tries to have you know what with A DEAD BODY OF A YOUNG GIRL!!! Ruby just imagines that it's Jessie but it's not and because Jessie doesn't like her like that, SHE PRETENDS THE DEAD GIRL IS JESSIE AND TRIES TO HAVE YOU KNOW WHAT WITH IT!! I gagged at it like seriously, who would even do that. Who comes up with this stuff and why would they do it? What person would ever think of having this in a movie? When Ruby pushes Jessie into the pool with no water, she doesn't die, UNTIL THOSE WITCH GIRLS EAT HER LIKE OMG THEY ARE CANNIBALS. Sarah, Gigi and Ruby eat Jessie so they can have natural beauty and get more modelling gigs. Well that does happen.This girl named Amber gets fired and Sarah replaces her. Gigi is also doing to modelling gig with Sarah and their standing in front of a pool. Gigi starts feeling sick and goes to the bathroom and vomits up Jessie's eyeball. Gigi kills herself so she doesn't need to feel sick anymore because she need to get Jessie's body out of her. Sarah then pick up the eyeball and EATS IT LIKE OMG OMG OMG!!!

227,Corlissa0994,David Lynch Meets David Bowie Meets Andy Warhol,6,28 September 2016,"Wow. So I wasn't sure how I was going to approach this movie as far as factual and professional, or casual and raw. Causal and Raw it is. ""Are you food, Or are you Sex?""- Ruby. The line that seems to incorporate the whole movie. This movie had some massive power. My rule of thumb is that if you can hook me right away and keep me interested in the first 10-15 minutes, half the battle is won. This movie comes out guns a blazing. Music, lighting, artistic visuals, and of course, the mood. Tension is built so subtly, and yet so effectively immediately. The interactions between all characters is awkward, tense, haunting and almost alien. From the uncomfortable silence, the awkward stares, and the bizarre conversations it just keeps you staring trying to decide if you are loving it or completely puzzled. Slowly you follow a awkward but hauntingly beautiful aspiring model Jesse through her introduction to LA. From there it is a slow tense ride of photo shoots, ego transformation, lust, paranoia to finally plunging into a black hole of necrophilia, cannibalism, witchcraft and suicide to which you find you are no longer safe because there are no limits to where you are going.Don't expect a clear clean ending, as this will leave you coming down from an acid trip through the eyes of Andy Warhol. This movie delivers a Black Swan experience, along with touches of David Lynch, So hold on and loose control over the need for story resolution, because it will NOT Happen.",The Neon Demon
228,christianrmaxwell,"Not a Movie, Rather an Experience",8,8 July 2018,"The movie Dogtooth directed by Yorgos Lanthimos and this movie both have some things in common. Not only are they both movies that are very abstract in their production, but they are also both movies that I would describe as experiences rather than films. My reasoning for this is somewhat hard to explain, but it mainly boils down to the fact that both films present a string of events, presented in a very ""realistic"" (I use this term referring to the shots and dialogue, not at all with the content being presented) manner. This movie was outstanding in terms of visuals, and my god, the soundtrack was phenomenal and added much needed suspense to some moments in the movie that might have suffered without it. The acting in this movie was great as far as the main characters and Keanu Reeve's character go, however, there were a few side characters that I believed did not deliver their lines so convincingly. However, they are side characters and as a result did not draw me out of the movie too often. The story of this movie honestly did not have a lot going on, but again, as with Dogtooth, I believe that is kind of the point. Nicolas Winding Refn is too good of a director and writer to just accidentally present a film with little story. I believe this was done on purpose for this movie, to make it play out, like I said before as an experience. The movie also makes some surprisingly great social commentary on beauty and human nature itself. I have no idea why this movie has ""horror"" as its first genre, as the movie was not horrifying at all in my opinion. However, I do agree that this movie is a thriller, Refn takes the audience on a ride, winding up the coils of suspense until he just releases the coils and lets everything fly, referring to that crazy ending of course. The strangest and perhaps most intriguing thing about this movie to me was the fact that even though the ending was absolutely insane, it did not seem out of place at all in terms of the movie's universe. Even though the universe at first was presented as very realistic, as the movie went on you could feel the reality start to slip as if Refn had been slowly pulling a rug out from under you. This movie was fantastic, although there were a few flaws, and I do not believe I have the desire to watch it again, it is definitely a thrilling, visually compelling, smart ride that will have you holding on for your life as the credits roll.",The Neon Demon

233,Matt-Canalcon,"Gorgeous, weird and scary",8,24 June 2016,"I went to a screening of 'The Neon Demon' in my town this afternoon. I should start by saying that it was a particularly fun screening since I was alone in the room and it kind of helped with the atmosphere of the movie.'The Neon Demon' is the new feature film by NWR (as it was stylized in the opening title). I was a big fan of 'Drive' and I also enjoyed 'Only God Forgives' even though most people didn't like. I knew going in that the movie didn't receive the praise of 'Drive' so I was expecting something like 'Only God Forgives' and it's pretty much what I got.Elle Fanning plays a young (underage) model trying to make it big in the city of angels. The opening scene will dive you right into this world with great cinematography and a very cool song. I actually thought that the visuals, the acting and the soundtrack were by far the best aspects of this movie.This is a pretty dark movie, but I actually found myself laughing a couple of times. Keanu Reeves' supporting character has a couple of good lines and the movie itself also has an interesting commentary about the world of fashion... even though it's delivered in a radically surreal way.Saying that the visuals are great is an understatement: the art design is impressive, the lighting is perfect in multiples scenes and the colour palette is really ""in your face"". There are two 'mind- trip' scenes in the movie that are worth the price of admission alone.I had a couple of issues with the character development of our main character (Fanning) in the script. I hate when art films immediately gets stamped 'style over substance', and I don't think it was the case here neither. However, I don't think NWR did a good job at portraying her evolution through the movie. Without getting into spoilers, Jesse (Fanning) is initially portrayed as being timid and insecure. At some point in the film her character experiences a sudden shift in personality that I didn't exactly bought. Even though you might think the movie is a bit long at times, stick to it until the end, the final act is pretty crazy and rewarding. Jena Malone's performance was amazing to say the least, she went totally wild in this film. All things together I liked 'The Neon Demon' even though I had a couple of issues here and there. It's a cool ""horror"" movie with a very twisted and subtle sense of humour. Maybe not the perfect date movie, but it's definitely worth a watch!7.5/10",The Neon Demon

I went in knowing Refn sometimes puts style of substance and was okay with it, until I wasn't. The visuals were gorgeous, the soundtrack was terrific, and the cinematography gave me a metaphorical hard on, but behind that was no real story. Take away the beautiful visuals and you have a very slow plot that feels like it goes nowhere. If Refn put a little more time into the plot, it could have been much better. Also the ending was very upsetting and left the story feeling very unfinished and unexplained. It got more horrory at the end, but they didn't show much of the violent bloody horror the movie became. Also Keanu Reeves felt like a waste. I think the film could have had a lot more going for it, yet I'm still giving it a 7 because of the stunning visuals and great soundtrack.",The Neon Demon

It's too long, boring, pretentious, has scenes thrown in simply for 'shock value', and has the worst ending possible. If you can even call it an ending.

That at any point all this nonsense will elope into something interesting. But instead this film manages to remain a vapid empty shell of nothingness with some shock value thrown in.Keanu Reeves in this film ..why? After seeing him in John Wick, I kept asking why Keaunu.

237,sallyannandrew,Suspiria this ain't,5,29 June 2019,"So this has been compared with Suspiria which is one of my all time favourite films so I had to see this, although I doubted the comparison was apt. No one can do Argento. And sure enough, this is no Suspiria. Yes, it is stylish. I liked the colours, I even kind of liked the music. It has a eerie, haunting quality that I also liked - but the huge, enormous problem with this, and the reason I don't think it can be compared with Suspiria is that it takes itself pretty seriously! There is clearly meant to be some kind of subtext here, and boy, has it been done - the modelling world, Hollywood, LA is soulless and shallow, women are, well quite literally here, chewed up and spat out. Well ho hum, we know right?!And this isn't a redeeming film, in fact it is exploitative. The males in this film have all the power - the sleazy, rapey hotel owner, the sleazy, rapey photographer, the sleazy, rapey designer. Ugh, and the women in this film just grovel before these men, completely submissive, and then they turn on one another! So, no empowerment here. Honestly, Abbey Lee, who for some reason signed on for this even though it is kind of an insult to her and her kind, is 29 and still modelling, still successful, still looks amazing, and yet, in this film it's the same old same old 'You are past it once you hit 21' line.Not sure why everyone is so offended by the necrophilia scene - I thought that was about the only self-aware scene in the whole film, the only scene that acknowledged this is a pretty silly movie.So, this is definitely not going to knock Suspiria off it's perch any time soon. Argento knew he was making trash, he embraced it and Suspiria is a classic for just that reason. It didn't try to be something it isn't.

239,thethomasboy,An Unsettling Metaphor for LA and the Fashion Industry,7,9 April 2020,"This film is not for everyone (nor should any film be), but it is widely misunderstood. It resides in the singular vein of auteur art house films such as Suspiria (1977) and Under the Skin (2013). The Neon Demon is rife with hidden symbolism, and the title itself is left open for interpretation... A seductive and alluring entity that ultimately devours and destroys. It could represent the fashion industry, self-obsession, our cultural infatuation with youth and beauty, the LA scene, or even fame in general.The audience follows 16 year-old Jesse (Elle Fanning), who arrives in LA with aspirations of modeling and is befriended by make-up artist Ruby (Jena Malone). The film walks our naive protagonist through the typical baptism of the LA culture and lifestyle: meeting people with hidden motives, the predatory nature of powerful men, how we manipulate to use others, and facades of friendless which mask fear and jealousy. Even the opening club scene - with its flashing lights and quick editing that draws Jesse slowly forward - represents the hypnotic and seductive nature of the high-life in Tinseltown.The theme of beauty heavily pervades this film, and writer/director Nicolas Winding Refn leaves every frame dripping with style. It is an unquestioningly gorgeous film, and even the final credit sequence's typography and visuals are beautiful works of art. It's hammered home that beauty isn't everything... it's the only thing. It's nature and value is routinely debated, focused on the perfect and natural. Jesse's peers/rivals include the surgically plasticized Gigi (Bella Heathcote), who represents the idea of 'manufactured' beauty, and beautiful but established Sarah (former Victoria Secret model Abbey Lee), who represents the unreasonable expiration date of high-fashion modeling.If thematic concepts of narcissism, backstabbing, crushing loneliness, and the dog-eat-dog nature of highly-competitive yet shallow industries aren't horrific enough... there's plenty of Pagan imagery, implied witchcraft, and reference to Elizabeth Báthory (the most prolific female murderer in history). The first two acts play on psychological fears and societal mind-games, while the third act calcifies the film's horrific tone, with some genuinely disturbing scenes including necrophilia and cannibalism.Ultimately - like its characters - the film helps determine who is able to stomach what is necessary to 'make it' and who can't. If you're dreaming of being an actor or model, consider this film a beautiful prism that examines the price of success.",The Neon Demon
240,carollaw51-41-56256,Disappointing,3,24 April 2017,"I just watched this film on Netflix ,which i had been browsing through hoping to find a good thriller this one had been given 4 stars so i thought ahh it must be good.???? No i was wrong The film starts off promising enough and is about a young 16 year old girl who has run away from home and turns up in Los Angeles hoping to become a model,here she encounters and makes friends with a lesbian make up artist who hangs out with two other women,one an over the hill model and the other a model wannabe.The lesbian wants to bed her where the other two women are envious of her and want to be her. She also has a nice caring boyfriend who makes photo shoots of her and helps her put a portfolio together. After a very short time in the industry she becomes the special one and the new promising IT girl.She then becomes very self obsessed and vain and acts like shes immortal,she dumps the nice boyfriend as his no longer of any use to her,and the other two models who have been cast aside by the industry become even more envious which lead to disastrous consequences. This is basically the thin plot of the film. Through out the film her dwellings are in a run down motel run by a rapist possibly peadophile (Forgive me for not writing down the characters names but they were all pretty much pointless empty unrealistic characters with no real substance} As I've said the film started off okay and held your interest as to where it was all leading,but further into the film it just became stranger and stranger and towards the end had some very distasteful scenes one involving the make up artist performing a necrophilliac act(disgusting). Apart from this i couldn't understand why if she was the new top model why she was still living in a run down terrible motel,wouldn't the modeling industry have moved her into a nice penthouse suite? Also why didn't she call the police when she heard the woman in the next apartment being raped or killed as she thought. The directing was annoying as well where in many scenes there was too many long pauses every time they spoke,you felt like certain scenes should be speeded up ,but all through the film it was slow and plodding.

Yes - The cinematography is stunning but it is not enough to save this mess. I know so many fans are all about ""some people don't get it, some people can't understand its real beauty and meaning..."" - sorry, but this is NOT a good film. It could have been great, the idea of it is actually good, but very bad executed. There are so many unanswered questions, there are scenes that makes us think they are supposed to mean something and they are going to have a sort of explanation, but ended not meaning anything. Also, the beginning of the film and the trailer makes you think that the main character, Jesse, has a dark side or a secret, something evil, but she only has the ""special beauty and glow"" that makes other models envy her in a very weird way. Jesse does not have her parents and she has some kind of weird dreams or visions, which makes us think she is more than just a pretty face, but those aspects were not developed or made any difference in the story.The feeling I had after watching The Neon Demon was that they started to write a plot that was supposed to go one way, but then got too lazy to keep up and develop the idea, so just decided to add some ""chocking""aspects like necrophilia and cannibalism to try to save it. If you want a good horror movie about how far someone can go for fame and beauty, watch Starry Eyes (2014), is not as glamorous and so visually beautiful, but delivers the message and has a better plot, besides, it's real horror.",The Neon Demon
243,simonize850,Too much Nicholas Winding Refn,4,30 July 2017,"You will see NWF on your screen, more than once; writer and director, and commentator at least on the DVD/Bluray release. Too much for me in this fairy tale of a 16 year old girl Jesse (Elle Fanning) whose beauty incurs the wrath of her rivals, who would literally kill to be her. Unfortunately I did find any of the girls particularly attractive, and thought the revelations these same girls made to achieve success, trite. But no doubt there are those who feel beauty is all. For every one person like that hopefully there is at least one Dean (the young man who sees Jesse's inner beauty).I felt the character HANK, the motel manager (KEANU REEVES) was a throw away piece, and thought Christina HENDRICKS of MAD MEN wasted in a cameo.The bluray has a commentary with director and star; I don't think my take on this film will change for hearing it, and I don't want to spend another two hours trying to swallow this.

All I knew was that the promotional images really captured my attention, due to the pretty colors, with up-and-coming actress, Elle Fanning in the center. A ""nymphet"" Tumblr blog I follow also re-blogged images from this. It's some kind of horror (I read the sex/nudity descriptions in the parental guidance section here prior to viewing) that has very mixed reviews.Much of the the first two acts is relatively slow and realistic. It's got great visuals, despite two scenes with annoying flashing lights. The trip-hop soundtrack by Cliff Martinez is also ear-catching. But, boy, was I not expecting such a final act! Thinking back on it, there's a decent amount of foreshadowing leading up to it. As the track titled, ""Are We Having a Party"" played over, my eyes were widened as I realized what had happened to Jesse (Fanning). In spite of its disturbing aspects (notably, a scene involving necrophilia), I ended up really liking The Neon Demon. I appreciate how it chose to make audiences uncomfortable rather than the usual ""lesbianism is hot~"" excuse (ie Birdman). There are critics who hate and/or have called this misogynistic, and I can completely understand why; but that doesn't wane my enjoyment of it. On the official movie discussion on Reddit, users have called this ""David Lynch meets Black Swan,"" which I also happen to agree with.It was great to see Abbey Kershaw on-screen again after her debut in Mad Max: Fury Road - also kind of funny her playing an aspiring model, considering she already works as one in real-life; can't wait to see what else she and Fanning have to offer in future projects!Learning that the director, Nicholas Refn, was born colorblind is very surprising, since his movies are so awashed with vivid colors.

The cast is well chosen too, of course.I think it was smart to send the message via a movie like this, fairy like and horror like though this is more of a mental horror than anything else.

It is just one of those movies that are aesthetically very pleasing. One could even go so far as to say that the main drive behind this movie is the visual art and not so much plot. The latter can be frustrating for the non 'arty' movie audience. That being said there is one problematic scene (which I will not mention) which makes the movie seem ridiculous. It is one of those 'stupid' irrational horror genre scenes in which the protagonist should call the police instead of doing X or Y. However, when one is wiling to overlook this plot error/inconsistency one can still enjoy most of the movie. Moreover, the movie has some highly disturbing scenes which in my opinion are in line with the Art of film making and symbolism. However, I can imagine that people who are not attuned to this only will perceive it as pure horror instead of 'artistic' thriller, horror as far as there is such a thing.",The Neon Demon

That's all. He's no story-teller, and this movie exposes the fact more than any other. There's no substance here. The story and dialogue are on par with Showgirls, but with less going on and long stretches of nothing happening but we're supposed to just look at meaningless compositions the whole time.

The use of colors and soundtrack and cinematography and everything was really nice to look at, so if you're really into that sort of art then this movie is worth watching. I've seen so many reviews calling the movie shallow, but I disagree. I think the theme of narcissism in the film is rather complex, especially considering the social context of beauty and selfie- culture and social media and how that promotes vanity and whether or not that is a bad thing. Basically, the film will likely leave you wondering about what you just witnessed, and what was real and what was symbolic and what was insanity.One theme of the film that left me disappointed was the homosexual plot line and how it seemed to demonize homosexuality. In a way I get it and see how it fits into the film, but another part of me is over the stale ""gay people are perverse and/or evil"" trope that exists in the horror genre. It feels overdone and not particularly socially conscious and that part of the movie left me rolling my eyes a bit. Otherwise, the acting was great and there was definitely a couple moment of truly disturbing imagery that made the film worth watching. I would like to see Elle Fanning in more films after seeing this performance.Overall, I think this film is a successful art piece that questions our current social environment in America. I think it's an especially good film for teens and young adults, but the ideas may not relate as well to older adults.",The Neon Demon
250,please_stand_by,An Airy Yet Vicious Satire of All-Consuming Vanity,9,29 October 2017,"""The Neon Demon"" is a film of mesmerizing aesthetic brilliance, but one which also contains visceral depravity. This makes it highly similar to much of Nicolas Winding Refn's other work. What sets this film apart is its unsettling hollowness. Its lack of emotional attachment. Its lack of a traditionally satisfying narrative. Many critics have invoked the dubious criticism of ""style over substance"" in order to attack these elements of the film. But is style itself not the ultimate substance in a film which is altogether about the obsessive depths of vanity? As I see it, that hollowness is very much by design. With that said, ""The Neon Demon"" is most definitely not something that everyone will enjoy, so tread with caution.The film is frequently quite extreme in its imagery and visual metaphors, particularly with its infamously disgusting ending. For this reason, it can perhaps be classified as an exceptionally slick and beautiful exploitation film, albeit one with many subtleties to it and which moves at a slow, confident pace. At no point do the exploitative elements feel cheap, even when they feel excessive. Jena Malone's incredible performance as Ruby is perhaps the best example of this subtle/extreme dichotomy. She remains disconcertingly calm, soft-spoken, and amiable, yet she is also a terrifying enigma, full of menace and dread, capable of bizarre, disturbing acts. The characters of Gigi and Sarah are similarly threatening in relation to Elle Fanning's Jesse, who anchors the insanity in a simple tale of innocence encountering for the first time that which preys upon it. Will she overcome it, embrace it, be consumed by it, or paradoxically all of the above?One criticism I had was that a few of the extraneous characters such as Hank, the character played by Keanu Reeves, seem underutilized. Hank, aside from being yet another menace for Jesse to avoid, doesn't do much. My best guess is that he serves as a way to juxtapose the masculine and the feminine, the two different types of threats that Jesse encounters both seeking to use her in their own selfish way. Ideally this would be a bit clearer.Ultimately, though it is an unusual film, I don't think it is one which needs to be heavily analyzed in order to be understood or enjoyed. However, if you do decide to check it out, make sure you are prepared for just how bizarre and shocking it can be. In a twisted way, you just might find it to your liking.",The Neon Demon

I am sorry to say that but the innocence which should be the main essence of Jesse's character slipped more to stupidity due to facial expressions of Elle Fanning. Nothing against her, she is pretty and interesting-looking. But really it was more off-putting than relatable for me to watch her face when e.g. she posed for the photographer. And because of that I can't rate it higher than 6. I could think of far better actresses for Jesse's role e.g. Chloe Moretz, Sophie Turner.

255,Spoffdarko,A stunning work of art,10,27 June 2017,"The Neon Demon is an excellent, thought provoking journey into the state of the human condition. NWR takes the beauty industry and creates one of the most disturbing and unsettling films I have seen in a very long time.Some films are not intended to be ""watched"" in the traditional sense. They are intended to be ""experienced"". The Neon Demon is one of these films, actually, less a film, more a work of art. The world created here is so absorbing I was mesmerised for the entire film.Even though there is terrible and bloody violence in TND, that is not what unsettles here. It is the atmosphere, the constant feeling of dread and being preyed upon by ruthless predators, who seem to be around every corner, at the end of every dark alley...TND is essentially a tale of innocence and vulnerability, and how that innocence can very quickly be lost (or consumed) in the world we live in today. TND explores almost every human emotion and feeling in a very intense way, fear, love, lust, anger, frustration, rejection, obsession, they are all here, and all laid bare in the starkest of ways with no apologies to the viewer.We see the very soul of these tormented individuals, it provokes thought, introspection and if you are lucky, it changes your outlook on things. It can give an insight into some of the emotions we feel ourselves, in our every day lives, but would never act on them the way the characters in this film do.It is interesting to see the very extremes of these emotions played out on screen, some in a rather abstract way, others more directly, some with shocking results, others with a more subtle undertone.This film really is that powerful, and I am so glad that films like this continue to get the green-light.Beautifully shot (the cinematography, use of colour, and shot-framing are masterful) wonderfully scored, and perfectly cast. TND is by no means an easy film to watch, but if you bring a strong stomach, and a non-judgemental attitude, you may be enriched by it.Challenging, raw, and with something to say, a perfect example of the ""art"" of film.",The Neon Demon

258,noorutin,Art film with a point to make.,9,11 September 2016,"It was probably clear to everyone, from the early trailers onward, that this movie is going to be a cinematographic masterpiece. And it is. The lighting, movements and post-processing is striking, incredibly stylized and simply amazing.As for the content itself, it certainly seems a very divisive topic. There is no great story to tell. The only noticeable character development seems to be that of the main character, and even then it is a very minimal arc of development. But that surely is the exact point of this movie. If I had to describe it in a few words, those would be ""off-putting"", ""cold"" and ""reflective"". And reflection is the key here. There's absolutely no doubt that every frame of The Neon Demon is a part of current social commentary. It is a reflection on the ultra-commercialized culture of incredibly excessive vainness that is so very, very prevalent in today's society. I cannot say whether it's a commentary on the fashion industry specifically, but that isn't even really relevant. I'd say that the fashion industry is a rather small side effect of a much, much greater problem.It is an art film with a point to make. It isn't pretty, and it sure as heck isn't subtle, but the point being made is an important one and I applaud the movie for exactly what it is.Maybe the point hits close to home and makes you reflect on your values as well as those of society around you. Or maybe you couldn't care less about the issues presented and are going to vote it 1/10 and call it ""boring"". The wild differences between the votes and reviews here are understandable.Finally though, I'd like to say something to those who accuse the movie of gratuitous female nudity for some kind of (heterosexual) extra male votes. Should you actually watch the movie again, you will notice that not once is the nudity without purpose - and finally, it is the women in the movie that are much, much more concerned about each others bodies than the few men seen in the movie.",The Neon Demon

There is a long tradition with us since we lived in Austin involving medicating to European Horror movies from back in the day, as the visuals and music combine into an extra-sensory experience when communing with the plant. Neon Demon takes the themes of Jean Rollin's films, particularly Fascination, and presents it through a visual palette like that of Dario Argento's Inferno. It is a trip that keeps on tripping all throughout the movie. Jena Malone deserves a Best Supporting Actress award for this film.

275,adrin-65078,goodbye 'Nevernever Land' hello 'Whatever Land',8,1 August 2016,"Nicolas Refn's the Neon Demon is a conceit of a very contemporary nature: form without content. Completely dedicated to the stylised image it could almost be an advert for some sort of Apple product. In one sequence model Jesse is positioned in front of a huge dazzling saturated white backdrop which almost seems to envelop her with its cold sensuality. As she poses in this setting, she is painted gold by the fashion photographer, I expected a gold Apple iPhone to somehow appear and transfix itself into the scene. The setting was perfect opportunity for product placement.Neon Demon is very much the product of the Apple generation, a parallel cinematic form of the mediated reality that permeates and defines the iPhone life style in which life is not experienced directly but only indirectly through a screen which accesses image and information. Screen takes the place of life. Gazing becomes living.The cool.Refn wants to make a cool film. He only requires of his audience that they watch the screen with detached interest as he invents and shows a succession of locational architectural backdrops accessed by tracking shots down narrow runs walkways and corridors. He then fills the spaces with content. It doesn't matter what the content is. The only point of the content is as a product to attract the gaze. Colour, eye catching interiors, blond women from the parallel universe, violence, sex, blood, cannibalism etc. The more transgressive the image the less it affects. In fact there is an inverse relationship between the extremity of Refn's provocations and the intensity of audience reaction. Penetrative necrophilia, eyeball eating become ""plaisirs des yeaux"", bagatelles. The important thing about the content is that it should be and is vacuous, empty. The scenario develops situations, events, actions in which the audience cannot invest with meaning. 'Never never' land becomes 'Whateverland'.Into this refined space, characterised often simply by colour and architectural form, Refn promotes Jesse, who is in many ways rather like an Apple product. Jesse is blond shimmering white and perfectly designed by nature. She does not attract empathy as she is a contextualised product. She tells that her parents are 'gone' but otherwise she is carefully screened to remove the personal. She is an object to be gazed at. Like the objects in the Apple universe, admired as image. Like a product, Jesse has little to say about or for herself. She lets other people do the talking. It is for others to fill her out with their projections.For the most part Jesse is the subject of other people's observations and desires. Jesse has such beautiful skin hair nose. She is just so perfect. And desired. They want to suck her. (except her boyfriend) As heterosexual sex, except abusive rape (suggested but not realised in a dream sequence), wouldn't fit with the extreme product design, Refn and his writers, have gone for a baroque rendering of that old movie stand-by: Lesbian Cannibals from Outer Space. And the final sequence of the film plays out with a series of grotesque tableaux, like some kind of 18th century masque, of the hunting killing and eating of Jesse by a group of deranged other worldly blond coat hangers.The Neon Demon, is not a horror film or anything like that. Refn has made film that is produced for the state of mind that is characteristic of certain patterns of contemporary consumption. A state of mind that finds significance in objects and products, and by engaging in life through the isolating filter of a screen that is detached but desirous of visual excitement through image. As Marshall McLuhan observed: the Medium is the Message. And how 'cool' is that?",The Neon Demon
276,vert2712,Dangerous beauty,8,24 June 2016,"I wouldn't really recommend The Neon Demon unconditionally to my friends; not because it's a bad film (quite the opposite) but because it's the kind of movie that would inevitably lead some of them to think ""he told me to watch it and said it was great. What kind of freak could possibly like that kind of stuff?""To call it ""not for all tastes"" is the understatement of the year, since the majority of audiences probably won't really appreciate its very droll mix of violence, cannibalism, dark comedy, necrophilia and fetishism. In fact, I will be very surprised if there isn't any condemnation or manifestation of outrage from groups or individuals arguing that it's yet another shallow male-directed film that objectifies, stereotypes and vilifies women. I'd also be willing to bet that Nicolas Winding Refn, who, like his fellow countryman Lars Von Trier, has a reputation for being a provocateur par excellence, had exactly this type of reaction in mind when he made it. There is a semi-gratuitous maybe-it's-a-dream sequence where a female character is forced to fellate a knife blade that seems designed precisely to elicit that sort of response.Deliberate excesses aside, The Neon Demon is possibly Nicolas Winding Refn's most straightforward narrative in a while (certainly more linear than Only God Forgives or Bronson). The film follows Jesse (Elle Fanning), a 16-year-old ingenue who moves to L.A. (or, to be exact, to a seedy motel in Pasadena, run by a sleazy and sinister manager played by a cast-against-type Keanu Reeves) hoping to become a model. Her naïveté and awkwardness notwithstanding, she first catches the eye of a powerful model agency head (Christina Hendrickson), then an influential photographer (Desmond Harrington) and finally a big fashion designer (Alessandro Nivola) who casts her as the centerpiece of his new show, much to the chagrin of established models Sarah (Abby Lee) and Gigi (Bella Heathcote), who don't take kindly to being laid by the wayside to make room for a fresh new face. She is also befriended by Ruby (Jena Malone), a seemingly well- meaning fashion make-up artist who moonlights at the local mortuary by applying her skills to make cadavers more presentable, and by an impossibly nice young man named Dean (Karl Glusman) who would like to be Jesse's boyfriend and protector. This being a horror film, at least on the surface, things starts to get weird for Jesse when her new friend and rivals decide to do something about her rapid ascent to the rank of top model. To say more would stray into spoiler territory, so I'll stop here.Like Quentin Tarantino, Nicolas Winding Refn is a master regurgitator of old genre films. ""Drive"" was the bastard son of Michael Mann's ""Thief"" and Walter Hill's ""Driver"", with a few other ingredients tossed in for good measure (the film also owed a huge debt to Jean-Pierre Melville's ""Le Samourai""). ""The Neon Demon"" is his love song to Dario Argento (in particular ""Suspiria"", which is visually and thematically referenced multiple times) and to countless Euro-thrillers from the seventies, starting with the fantastic but little-seen (in the USA) Belgian lesbian vampire/Countess Bathory retelling ""Daughters of Darkness"".Punctuated by a great electronic score by Cliff Martinez (which sounds like the best soundtrack that Goblin never wrote in the last 20 years), The Neon Demon is a visual feast that makes the neon- drenched ""Drive"" and ""Only God Forgives"" look almost drab by comparison. This is a gorgeous-looking film, set in beautiful locations, with a cast to match.The women are all impossibly beautiful and incredibly shallow and repellent at the same time: they look and move like poisonous snakes whose skin you would really like to reach out and caress, knowing full well that you are likely to receive a painful bite. Male characters on the other hand are almost uniformly visually unpleasant and slimy or feral-looking (Desmond Harrington's photographer in particular looks gaunt and menacing like a wolf circling a wounded animal). Only Dean, the prospective boyfriend, seems like a good, decent human being, but this is a movie that seems hell-bent on confirming the old adage that ""nice guys finish last"".Elle Fanning is good, especially at the beginning of the film where she is required to look shy and insecure -- in fact there are no weaklings in the whole cast. But the film belongs to Jena Malone, whose character undergoes the most startling transformation as the story progresses. Her performance is truly daring and committed and easily the most memorable in a film filled with weird and eye- catching characters. When you see the film, you'll know what I'm talking about.Although The Neon Demon is ostensibly a horror film, underneath all the scary movie trappings lies a very black (and bleak) comedy about a superficial world where appearances are everything and the only way to survive is to embrace (quite literally) a dog-eat-dog attitude. It's most definitely not a movie for everyone (and the only film in recent memory where a scene involving an act of lesbian necrophilia doesn't feel gratuitous and out of place), but it's the product of a talented director who has completed a metamorphosis, which began with Bronson (2009), from ""simple"" genre filmmaker into full- blown auteur, with a personal and distinctive visual and narrative style. If you are at all interested in cinema beyond regular multiplex fare, it's definitely worth investing 2 hours of your time.",The Neon Demon

278,trada122,His most experimental film among his entire filmography.,10,24 June 2016,"After watching his previous film ""Only God Forgives"" and also his Norse themed film ""Valhalla Rising"", I never thought he could make a more experimental film but I was wrong. His latest film ""The Neon Film"" by far is his most experimental film. You could almost say he made ""his Eraserhead"" just now. Also, he homages to Dario Argento's Suspiria(or even some of Mario Bava's films) when it comes to the cinematography of the film. Throughout the film, like Suspiria, you see the usage of the bright red light, in a surreal nightmarish way. People also seem to compare this film to a mash-up between David Lynch's Mulholland Drive & Dario Argento's Suspiria. While I do completely agree with the Suspiria comparison, I'd say it's more Inland Empire than Mulholland Drive, due to its extreme surrealistic dreamlike presentation(considering Inland Empire is even MORE surreal than Mulholland Drive). I've even also heard people compare the film to Black Swan, though I think the way The Neon Demon depicts its brutality and the violence, it reminds me more of Satoshi Kon's Perfect Blue than Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan. However, The Neon Demon, like both Perfect Blue and Black Swan, do focus intensely on the theme of physical beauty, superficiality, and the facade among the ""entertainment industries"".One thing I personally thought was interesting, even aside from the gorgeous cinematography that's very Argento & Bava like and Cliff Martinez's usual brilliant contribution with the film's soundtrack, is the main theme of physical beauty. But unlike most of the films about physical beauty and supermodels, this film actually ""admits"" that beauty actually gets you to places. Even has a scene where the characters are discussing inner beauty vs. outer beauty, where one of them states the most uttered "" fact"", about how inner beauty is more important, while another character, a fashion designer, actually states something most would never say or even admit, which is that it's actually the outer beauty that makes most people give the ""attractive person"" a second glance. Which I honestly thought was interesting, the way the film focused on the narcissism of physical beauty and the brutal reality of receiving many opportunities if you are pulchritude and beautiful while among the ""non-attractive people"", only a few selective and anomalies will be given many opportunities. I honestly have had discussions with a friend of mine about this topic, about how most people say it's the inner beauty that is the most important, when the brutal and harsh reality is that outer beauty is actually what gives the person many opportunities in life. And I think there is some real truth to the outer beauty aspect that most people don't seem to delve into in real life(or at least don't admit it out loud). I genuinely enjoyed the simple, yet somewhat of a subversive take, on physical beauty and narcissism. Remember: ""Beauty isn't everything. It's the only thing."" I could see why some, if not most people, would not enjoy this film. I've even heard people call this film Refn's worst film. Personally, I think it's his most experimental, inventive, and surrealistic film(even above ""Valhalla Rising"" and his previous film ""Only God Forgives""). The cinematography, just like his last two film(Drive & Only God Forgives) is gorgeously shot, and the fact that the film reminded me of Suspiria(wouldn't be surprised if he admitted Suspiria to be one of the main influences for The Neon Demon) made me smile, especially as a cinephile. The soundtrack of the film definitely is reminiscent of both Drive & Only God Forgives(as Cliff Martinez took the similar routes and tackled the same genre of synth music). Only, for me, The Neon Demon is slowly becoming my personal favorite, even among Drive & Only God Forgives. And the introduction of Julian Winding(Refn's nephew) as part of the soundtrack team, was the perfect decision. As for the acting, they definitely are decent. By no means are they Daniel Day-Lewis or Marlon Brando, but they do a decent job at it. And honestly, the acting in the film is a minor factor and one of the least things that carry the film(it's really the artistic genius outlet by Nicolas Winding Refn). Though I will give Elle Fanning for accepting such a dark(or even dangerous if you will) role at such a young age. And I'd say this is Jena Malone's best role since Donnie Darko. As for Bella Heathcote & Abbey Lee, while their actings aren't necessarily their most impressive aspect of them, they are undoubtedly eye candies. There's also a somewhat of a minor role for Keanu Reeves, but surprisingly I ended up liking his character and found his character to be darkly humorous.Overall, The Neon Demon is THE most experimental film made by Refn. It definitely will not be for everyone, but for appreciators of art-house/experimental films, looking for some stunning cinematography, or even if you want to look at the ""facts"" of physical beauty from a different and subversive perspective, I say check it out.

279,paradamed,Overrated and pretentious,2,6 August 2017,"This movie has beautiful scenes and thats it. It has no plot, no substance. I wonder why it is labeled as horror. It has blood and gore that seem to be there just to gross people out. I think the writer wanted to play with the contrast of beauty. I would not recommend it. THe movie is not well paced, is very boring and everything that happens makes no sense. People who enjoyed this movie are probably the ones who find the clothes of the king beautiful, when there are no clothes at all. Pretentious movie, zero content. The message the author wants to send could be done maybe in a short 15 minute youtube movie, it would make more sense.",The Neon Demon

The sad thing is you can relate the characters to modern day society with ease. That alone is enough to frighten me.Watch in full HD with a nice surround sound setup and enjoy the show.

281,fannyelisabethdahlin,Wonderful scenery but weirdly executed plot,5,14 November 2019,"The first hour was a four star film, the last hour a one star. So I'm not even sure what to rate it now. Nothing saddens me more than when the first half is no less than amazing and the second is bleurgh.The light in this film is stunning, and so is the scenery and cinematography. Actually I have rarely seen such beautiful work. The music is haunting and ethereal, and the whole set is like a mix between Twin Peaks and the glossiest fashion show ever seen. The quiet scenes are the most effectful, while the dialogues are often stiff and unnatural. I read that director Nicolas Winding Refn asked Elle Fanning to revise the female spoken dialogues - can't really say it helped. It did really sound like a writer not knowing how woman speak to each other.So, the first half. I was so amazed. Elle is really great in her role as Jesse, I could really feel her loneliness and strong wish to achieve her dream of being a model. The framing in every scene is so well thought out, like when Jesse first meet the famous photographer and the scenery is almost covering the entire frame with first it's light and then it's darkness. When Sarah is rejected by the fashion designer, who is completely ignorant to her, and smashes the mirror in the bathroom her pain blazes through the camera. And when Jesse hurts her hand and Sarah drinks her blood - that's horrifying and shows so well her desperation to get what Jesse has.And that leads me to the second half. Sarah drinking Jesse's blood was horrifying enough and perfectly captures what the film wants to say. But then it went downhill. From the second Jesse stepped into the mansion the scenes were strange in a really creepy way. Unsettling can be great, and in the first half of the movie, it really is.But in the second half those scenes are downright disturbing. The last forty minutes felt sensational and voyeristic with it's lesbian predatory trope. And the necrophilia scene was too much, crossing it with the scenes of Jesse touching herself put extremely disturbing equal signs between being lesbian and necroromantic, no matter what the actual point with it was. This film would have been a lot better without the ritual thing.There are ways to tell the same story about our society with it's obsession with beauty and doing everything it takes to achieve it - without sexualizing the hunt.(Oh, and frankly the movie would also have been better without Dean, he's such a typical ""good"" photography guy who just want to take pictures of pretty girls. It was disturbing how he was somehow depicted as being righteous in the ""beauty is the only thing"" scene. It felt like that was his only purpose.)I hope someone will take this idea and make a new film from it, but without over-the-top elements shown in this film. The obsession with beauty is always current and interesting.",The Neon Demon
282,guccipix,A Mulholland Drive/Suspiria inspired film for this decade,7,21 June 2016,"The Neon Demon is yet another original effort and polarizing film from Nicolas Winding Refn. It was already both booed and applauded at Cannes, and this reaction is one I expect to play out when it gets its wide release.The film draws the viewer in with it's dazzling lighting and visuals, which remain throughout, but also with the mysteries it creates. The mystery of the film results in a compelling narrative, but the last half fails to capitalize on some of the themes and ideas it introduces. However, the main 1-2 ideas are well-developed and relevant. I won't spoil those ideas here, though.Another positive about the film is the soundtrack composed by Cliff Martinez, which is no surprise given the work he and NWR have done together in the past.While the soundtrack and visuals are certainly memorable, and the major themes are ones which I commend NWR for developing, my main gripe with the film is its over-indulgent nature. NWR has a fixation on violence and gratuity, and in the past I've had few problems with it, but in this film I felt it was taken too far. Things that other filmmakers would have implied with cues, Winding Refn shows us in great detail. Some will praise him for his willingness to show us what we don't want to see, others will condemn him. I just found most of these scenes to be unnecessarily over the top.Despite my comparing it to films such as Mulholland Drive and Suspiria, it doesn't feel derivative, but instead like a mostly original experience.On the whole I'd call The Neon Demon a very good film. It's much different from most of the releases so far this year, which alone makes it worth seeing. However, I would not recommend it to the faint of heart, or those with a general disdain for gore in film.Like most other divisive films, I expect that this one will be a subject of conversation for years to come.7/10",The Neon Demon
283,sleeperservice-19872,Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder,9,12 October 2016,"The people cry style over substance and are, therefore, victims of their own platitudes.The Neon Demon is a work that examines the surreal world that is the beauty business. Stunning cinematography tells us the story of Jesse who wants to make it in the world using the only asset she has, her natural beauty, her boyish good looks which are the source of the cat like jealousy for those striving for the same jobs and that one shot that will propel them into modeling stardom.The film examines the seedy side of the business. From the motel manager who is just out to make a quick buck to the bored casting people watching endless trains of the same, manufactured ""beauty"" parading past. All filmed in dark surroundings with splashes of colour to highlight the focus and culminating in the final horrific scenes that made me immediately have a title for this review.Along with Only God Forgives, Refn's style may be hard for people to come to terms with, but for me, is ideally suited to the subject of the films he is currently making.

286,shivamchowdhary336,The best and scariest movie of 2016 by far!,10,25 June 2016,"Wow. I just saw this movie and my god, this movie has total staying power! The plot follows a young 16 year old girl who moves to LA to pursue her love of modeling, but soon strange things start to happen with her fellow models - and in it's third act the film takes the most unusual, scary and horrifically violent path ever taken in a film. But it was amazing. It was truly, truly amazing.The cinematography in this film was beautiful! Every shot in this movie was absolutely gorgeous to look at. NWR definitely used colors to his advantage. The soundtrack to this movie was eerie, surreal and very very scary. This film was more of a very intense psychological thriller with adult undertones in its first and second half, but is definitely a gruesome horror film in it's third. The transition was quite abrupt, but worked very well.Referring back to the soundtrack, Cliff Martinez made a wonderful electronic soundtrack for this movie that is scary and happy at the same time. It resembles the soundtrack from the 'Portal' game franchise. However, I understand this movie will not be for everyone. And critics most likely wont like it, (on Rotten Tomatoes for critics it's rotten, but for audience it's fresh.) The result will end up being like the reviews for The Butterfly Effect, which has a staggering rating of 31% for critics, and 81% for audience. And personally, I loved The Butterfly Effect. The only con that I can really think of is that the script at times can be weak and the first half of the film drags on a bit - but don't be put off by that. The film is a beautiful, scary, intense, gruesome, and stylish metaphorical horror film. Definitely worthy of a 10 out of 10 for me - don't let the critics put you off. If you like stylish, scary and violent films - the Neon Demon is for you.",The Neon Demon
287,MeBeiM,A beautiful actress alone doesn't make a good movie,4,3 September 2016,"What can I say? I've been waiting to see The Neon Demon for months, being utterly spellbound by the trailer, and I've always felt like this movie could have either been an indisputable masterpiece or yet another meaningless representation of the modeling industry. Turns out the latter one was the nearest definition I could think of for it. Let me get this straight: Elle Fanning? Completely stunning, I couldn't look away from her for a second; her acting was terrific, and she looks like an angel. However, a beautiful actress doesn't make a good movie alone.The direction? I don't get Refn's style of filming interminable sequences in which nothing happens (like the catwalk one), or the fact that the dialogues have to feel so heavy and full of pauses, but after all the direction wasn't that bad.The plot? Let's talk about it: by the eleventh minute I could've already imagine how the whole thing would have turn out; by the twenty- first, I was more than convinced; by the forty-fifth, I just knew it without any doubt. First of all, Jesse is a sixteen-year-old girl living alone in a motel, and the only person she can barely rely on is her ""friend"" Dean (which is a good guy indeed). There's no reason for her to toss it away like wastepaper in a second, nor any other lonely young lady like her would have done that, so that just makes no sense and makes me feel annoyed because the overwhelming atmosphere of the story gets worse and worse as time goes by. The other models: I got sick of them since I first saw their faces on the screen, but that's all right - I thought - that's just how it's supposed to be, they are meant to be the antagonists. Right. Apparently Jesse couldn't figure that out on her own, so after only one single shoot she is already totally immersed in the newly discovered world of envy and greed which is the modeling industry. She then begins to understand how powerful she is, and how dangerous is her position. Women would kill for her beauty. She doesn't want to become like them, but they want to become like her. The movie keeps slowly going on with boring - yet wonderful - scenes that are only meant to make you stare at her until you get hypnotized by her gaze. Moreover, not a single scene of daily life is shot, not a single normal dialogue, normal human interaction or such thing, making the whole movie feel like made out of thin air. The utterly predictable death of the poor girl just makes the whole point of the movie disappear, and I could have gone with that if only it would have happened in a less silly way. Now she's gone, apparently eaten by the envious older models, and suddenly nobody even notices about it, like she was nothing.I'm still questioning myself about the seemingly nonsense scenes, like Ruby menstruating all over the floor for no reason, not to talk about her totally random lesbian necrophilia. When I reached the final scene... yeah, well, I just stared at the screen helplessly (let's just ignore the fact that the thrown up eye is stupidly fake and it would have been digested in a matter of hours). Every single thing, from the beginning to the end, has no consequence whatsoever in the real world, making the movie so open to interpretation (if one can say so) that it just doesn't feel worth being interpreted, there's no real ""solution"" or ""meaning"" for it. And, yes, I understood that the four girls are meant to symbolize four different forms of beauty (external, internal, artificial and natural), I mean, honestly that was pretty obvious, but for which purpose?In conclusion: I loved Elle Fanning and, to be fair, the soundtrack was pretty good, but that's it about this movie for me.",The Neon Demon
288,frucklish,"Wow, just...wow",9,30 December 2016,"Let me say right off the bat that I did enjoy this movie. A lot. Although it was undeniably pretentious and camp, the visuals were incredible and some of the best I've seen in a while (even if they did look like they were ripped straight from every perfume commercial ever), Cliff Martinez's composition is impeccable and works incredibly well with the theme of the movie, the color scheme definitely worked to portray themes of jealousy, anger, innocence, etc., the characters, despite what many critics might say, were intriguing, and Refn's vision seems to have been fully realized through this film. Elle Fanning's airy, monotonous voice as Jesse made her all the more creepy and compelling, in my opinion. Abbey Lee absolutely SLAYED as the creepily cannibalistic and dethroned supermodel, and although Jena Malone's performance was sometimes lacking, she was almost always convincing, whether she was the innocent makeup artist who showed undying support for Jesse or as the crazed necrophiliac which she eventually reveals herself to be.It did an excellent job portraying Hollywood for what it can often be: a factory which takes in innocent, naive girls and turns them into vapid, catty monsters who will do anything to stay on top. Although some might argue that the movie is lacking in subtlety in this regard, making it less enjoyable to watch, I think that the over-the-top nature that the movie often has while tackling certain serious subjects is very fitting and does the subjects more justice than if it had taken the nuanced route. The symbolism in this film is everything. The core message that this film is trying to send to its viewers can be debated, but overall it seems to be saying that you are what you eat. (just kidding) The bottom line seems to be that Hollywood and the modeling industry will chew you up and spit you out (literally) if you're not cautious or you're overly optimistic. Elle feels like a very lonely, inexperienced girl, and watching her transform into the uncaring person who she eventually becomes is all the more sad because of the fact that she is so ignorant to the evils around her prior, only to become these at the end.Now let's go into what I did NOT enjoy about this film.For starters, no offense, but Elle Fanning is not a particularly visually striking girl, especially when placed next to Abbey f***ing Lee, who is not only a former Victoria's Secret model, but also generally breathtaking. As the movie progresses, you are forced to see her enough that you start to realize that she does have a very interesting doe-eyed look to her, but the idea that she is in any way capable of dethroning either of the women who she does is difficult to imagine. At first glance, she is plain, and although an undeniably pretty girl, she does not have the model-like appearance that the evil stepsisters of the film do. I'm sure that this casting choice was made intentionally, as she is very youthful looking (since, well, she's pretty damn youthful) and has a much more innocent air about her than any of the other characters in the film, which is a very common theme that cause but it doesn't excuse the fact that her features aren't sharp enough to convince the viewer that she would be able to take someone like Abbey Lee out of power in the modeling industry. This problem really only bothered me because it caused the movie to feel a lot less real to me (even though mountain lions breaking into a motel room in LA isn't exactly ""real"" either, but whatever.)Secondly, the pacing of the film is so incredibly slow, making finishing some of the scenes feel mundane and chore-like. Of course, a good half of the scenes require you to watch them in their entirety to truly enjoy and absorb them, but the other half seem to be that slow solely to follow a pattern. Although admirable, this pattern gets VERY tiring at a certain point, which becomes especially apparent when the writers decide that they get tired of it too and suddenly make Ruby a necrophiliac rapist and Gigi and Sarah psycho cannibals.Lastly, this movie included a myriad of scenes which, even if they did have any true meaning, were clearly done in large part for the added shock value. These scenes are most likely what caused those at Cannes to boo this film. Watching Gigi and Sarah have sexy shower time with Jesse's blood followed by watching blood pour out of Jena Malone's hoohah are too gross/confusing for the general public to actually pay attention to whatever importance these images could have and probably held in the context of the film, and doesn't serve to actually progress the film further.7.5/10",The Neon Demon
289,nejclozarslo,"""Beauty isn't everything, it's the only thing.""",8,20 October 2016,"Ever since I have seen Drive recently, not a day goes by that I wouldn't be haunted by the beauty and style of that masterpiece. It's how I discovered Nicolas Winding Refn which immediately became one of my favorite filmmakers of the generation. One of the main reasons I respect Refn so much is the fact that he isn't afraid to be different and tap into taboo themes. And The Neon Demon is no exception. Make no mistake, there will be people who will hate this movie, but this isn't a bad thing. It's something that this film can wear as a badge of honor.I will say this right of the bat, The Neon Demon is crafted with some of the most jaw-dropping style my eyes have ever seen. There is not a cinephile in the world that can watch The Neon Demon without being blown away by the unsettlingly masterful cinematography, lighting, editing and production design. The only other filmmakers that I can think of that paid so much attention to detail would be Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott.Where we ran into the polarization that this art-house feature will undoubtedly cause is when we get to the themes and concepts of a film. After seeing The Neon Demon you will think that Drive is completely main-stream.This is a gritty, dark and disturbing depiction of modern with beauty obsessed society and modeling. When I say disturbing, I'm saying there are concepts in this film that no person in the right mind wants to see, but the effect that these dream-like sequences leave on the viewer is mind-boggling. You will never view modeling the same way as you did before. Performances are hauntingly effective. A film that truly cannot be unseen.While this movie isn't by any means as good as Drive was, it's still an undeniable visual mastery and a riveting and disturbing commentary on modern perception of beauty and the extremes some people are willing to go to in order to achieve this illusive prestige.",The Neon Demon
290,dexterbmet,I DO NOT LIKE THIS FILM,4,14 March 2019,"Some people might hate me for saying this but I think this film is awful. Even though it is directed in a beautiful way that all it has going for it. The script is an unpolished mess with a awful Climax. I feel like the writer write most of the script then realised that it wasn't an 18 so put a ton of stuff at the end which has a lot of blood and sexual scenes in the final 15 minutes. The reasoning behind the ending makes no sense to me. (spoiler part) at the end the girls kill and eat our main character so they can become pretty. But how does eating someone makes you our pretty on the outside wouldn't it make more sense if they wanted to be an overall nicer person instead of just looking pretty. And what was with all of the triforces in this film. You might think I'm joking but I'm dead serious they are triforces all over this film. I half expected ganon to come out and try to steal it. The first 100 or so minutes of the film is the most generic screenwriting I have ever seen. I felt like I was watching a parady film because most of the film is just cliché after cliché in a boring mess with underdeveloped characters. The Climax just comes out of nowhere with very little to no build up to it one moment our main character is walking through the house the next moment she is being chased by crazy girls with knifes and your just like ""where the heck did this come from"" making you feel like it's missing a lot of scenes. And I mean a lot of scenes. Overall it has great directing in it but everything else is pretty terrible. You might say I don't get it and maybe I don't.

My tastes tend to lean toward dark, psychological thrillers, sardonic humor, and ending left open to interpretation. The Neon Demon definitely has the latter, which is what draws me to it. As for any other elements, those need to be assigned by the viewer, and will vary based on individual preferences. I have developed a range of theories from Jessie being a demon, to the other girls being demons to the industry itself being demonic, then circled back around to, there is no meaning to be assigned. Here are some absolute takeaways: it's lonely at the top, jealousy can destroy a person, vanity is indeed the devil's favorite sin (a reference from another movie,) you never know what someone is hiding, and you can trust no one in an industry based solely upon everything that is superficial.

297,ogazaha777,Mother used to call me dangerous,10,15 August 2016,"Beauty and Violence go well together in the movies, as many horror flicks and thrillers prove. Nicolas Winding Refn knows why, or he feels it, and finds the deep connection between the two - on the Surface.To feel sorry for Jesse (Elle Fanning) because the L.A. fashion world makes an ice-cold model out of this awkward girl with a big dream would be pointless: She is a shell, and remains a shell. She isn't just beautiful, maybe she is Beauty. What she says, thinks, where she comes from is irrelevant, not just within the narrative. The film itself treats plot and dialogue as secondary things, and it communicates with images. ""Beauty is not everything, Beauty is the only thing!"" is its most interesting verbal statement, delivered by a fashion designer (Alessandro Nivola). One could say about the film: ""The Surface is not everything, the Surface is the only thing!"" Shortly before Jesse comes to her end, she walks through an empty baroque villa, as if showcasing. At this point, the film is on the edge of becoming boring, but it is a deliberate boredom akin to the one in Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"". Baroque ornaments indicated overwhelming wealth and decadence, as our ornaments do now, even if we prefer smooth surfaces over opulent embellishments (just think of prevailing Apple aesthetics or that phone healing its own scratches). But Art as idle and clean as this becomes dull, and needs its creator to provide another quality. As Refn put it: ""Art is an act of Violence. It is about Penetration."" That Beauty is hard to digest is something Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee), two aging models rivaling Jesse, have to learn in the end. Literally. After Jesse has grown overconfident and over-successful, they throw her into an empty swimming pool and... we don't see what happens next, but in a later scene, Gigi regurgitates an eye, of all organs! And it is too fitting how the audience reacts to this film, or how the audience sitting with me reacted anyway. Attentively silent during the sporadic conversations; chatting during scenes were ""nothing happens"", at least nothing of mere plot interest; half- stifled laughter when sex or violence occur.That a film like ""The Neon Demon"" should disturb, even appall a mass audience is taken for granted. But it was also booed at Cannes (the second Refn film after ""Only God Forgives"" to earn this honor) and it would be a pity if it were widely ignored and doesn't find the audience to make it profitable at least. Film, says ""The Neon Demon"", is a visual art. Many good movies, especially from Hollywood, offer exciting stories and complex characters. But even among those, only the ones that are able to express themselves with moving pictures are remembered, and it is those moving pictures with which you can approach more abstract themes. Film is also a violent medium, not just when it shows murder and blood, but when it does not explain itself but communicates with pictures, and when you can't simply rate it with a check list in mind. And although movies are inevitably commercial commodities, they shouldn't be as predictable and as easily digestible as a lollipop.Cliff Martinez won an award at Cannes for his wonderful music. His soundtrack will likely get away in scathing reviews as the movie's only good thing. But it is just like the film - repetitive, bold, unsettling, radical.

Also the dialogue of this movie is very cringe-y, and not like in Only God Forgives, where I could give it a pass, but here the dialogue is so freaking weird and at times nonsensical, that it kind of takes you out of the film.Pros: The film is so freaking gorgeous! The score balances retro, classic and futuristic all at the same time, and it fits perfectly to the scenes.

Now, I did like the fact that the movie showed that some of these women in modeling can be pretty cut throat (yes PUN INTENDED!) and will do anything to be the next ""it"" girl.

It paints a disturbing but realistic picture of the fashion/modelling world in the first 80 mins.

There are 1 or 2 scenes that are maybe a little gratuitous, hence my score of 9 (instead of 10), but this is a great movie and makes an important statement, something that too few movies do these days.

They seemed there for shock value but added little. Like gratuitous nudity. It's not needed but it's there anyway. The story was not a bad one but the writing and execution killed it. It could have been good based on premise. I really don't understand why it had to be so tortured. I would not recommend this to anyone. Simply not worth the 2 hours.,The Neon Demon
305,grahame12,ATTEMPT TO COPY DARIO ARGENTO'S SUSPIRA,7,22 March 2018,"Suspira is a visually sumptuous experience with incredible audio, a film to immerse yourself in. Neon Demon has tried to replicate the style, music and even theme of Suspira. It is a passible attempt but falls way short.
The colour saturation; dominant haunting music; long corridor & door shots; long slow non-action; vampires replacing witches; lesbian theme - these all reflect Suspira.
Enjoy this film but for a special experience watch the original.",The Neon Demon
306,caloniect,Glamorously Distasteful,4,11 August 2020,"This film will have you questioning WHY you continue to watch it.
It is an art film; full of luxurious scenes and lovely people whom have minimal words and minimal personalities.
The acting is steady and you get a dash of Keanu Reeves, so that's a plus. Elle Fanning has substantial presence in this film, but it might bother you that she was only 16 years old in this film which (when you think about some of the scenes with and without her in them) is pretty creepy. She wasn't couldn't even watch this film when it came out due to her age at the time.
I love the highly artistic visuals, but then it starts to slip more and more into the horror that it says it contains. It becomes a glamorous disturbance in excess. Some scenes I had to turn away from. The movie takes on perversion, increased coldness and is also like watching Elizabeth Báthory (an actual, historical psycho) and Jeffrey Dahmer, but with models.
Watch this at your own risk. Yikes.",The Neon Demon

That spitting into the corpse's mouth and sucking it back up was truly disgusting. When the model started retching, I started retching, thanks for that-then I continued to sympathy retch while she puked up the eyeball and then the other girl picks it up out of the puke and swallows it. Why was Keanu Reeves is this horrible movie playing a disgusting character. The neon lights were migraine inducing and also made little sense in the scheme of things.

308,briankane1984,I feel like I've been hypnotized,10,26 June 2016,"I am a huge fan of the director's past movies Bronson, Valhalla Rising and Drive. If you haven't seen those movies then you may not be expecting the style of this movie. It is very subtle yet in your face. Visually hypnotizing with a soundtrack to match and some disturbing scenes to top it off. Not everything is explained, not everything makes sense and yet I want more. I have been thinking about the movie for the past two days now and I can't wait to see it again. If you need a lot of exposition in movies, then this isn't for you but if you are in for something unique, visually stunning and all around entertaining then I suggest you support this movie",The Neon Demon
309,redhotchilipieper,Refn is possessed by a demon that feasts on all that is trite and shiny,2,24 June 2016,"As a viewer who has enjoyed a handful of Nicolas Winding Refn's works like Drive, Bronson, Valhalla Rising, and even Only God Forgives - which I defended wholeheartedly in a 2013 Amazon review - it pains me a little to kick off my review with the following statement: It is difficult to decide what I dislike most about Nicolas Winding Refn's The Neon Demon. Critics giving Demon positive reviews and arguing that its monomaniacal focus on style is intentionally on par with the film's message are missing the reality that NWR's creative juices are simply dried up at the moment.So what is the least admirable trait of Refn's latest? Is it the paucity original thought? The onslaught of the routinely neon- drenched Kubrickian imagery? The fact that a good sixth of the movie feels like the director got away with making fetish porn with an Amazon Studios (and about a half dozen other production companies) budget? I'm not even going to start in on the film's literal blood baths, but I think that the lack of originality is probably the worst part.Audiences have already seen everything that The Neon Demon has to offer. Cinematically speaking, there is nothing more than the usual slew of rehashed Kubrick frames (including a groan-worthy Shining shout out within the first few minutes). Aside from a memorable strobe- light inspired scene of a performance at a model- populated L. A. party, Refn adds nothing new to his aesthetic arsenal that he has not already splashed on the screen with his previous four films.From a narrative standpoint, one should not expect a fully-formed, fleshed out story or characters. These are not Refn's preoccupations when making a movie, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that. That is, if the film's style and themes can compensate. Stylistically (see paragraph above), it does not hold any substantial weight. Unfortunately, there is even more of a thematic drought.At one point in the film, the increasingly narcissistic protagonist Jesse (Elle Fanning) says that other girls will cut, carve, inject, and do anything else to their own bodies just so that they can look like a second- rate version of her. The girl from the small town who seemed so nice starts becoming a bit conceited by her time in the fashion industry. Can you believe it? Imagine that! Wow, what is the director trying to say about fashion? Hollywood? The male gaze? SOCIETY?If there is one thing that 2106 films like The Neon Demon and Zoolander 2 should be teaching would-be blockbuster directors and art-house auteurs alike, it is that the fashion industry has become one of the stalest targets for satire in any artistic medium or genre. It's not that superficiality doesn't deserve it, but at this point if a writer or a director has nothing original to say about it, then they should not be saying anything all.To be fair, the trite and shiny cloud of unoriginality that is The Neon Demon does have its silver linings. I have never felt so badly for a film score than I do for Cliff Martinez's excellent work on this soundtrack. While the message of the movie will blend in with the mental smoothie of other Hollywood/superficiality parable flicks, I will not easily be able to excise Martinez's thumping synths from my ears. I will also never forget the intensity of Abbey Lee's stares.There are also less silvery scenes involving Jena Malone taking the tired psycho lesbian trope to whole new level and an absurdly Nicolas Cage-esque Keanu Reeves as an acrimonious motel manager that I will not forget for other reasons (primarily the random shock-less ""shock value"" senselessness of them). I wish I could recommend The Neon Demon as a startlingly original work from a gifted auteur, but it feels like Refn simply isn't challenging himself or the audience in any meaningful way. Here's hoping that this kind of trite and shiny would-be shock fest will not be the only thing that Refn has to offer cinema in the future.",The Neon Demon

This is the second WORST movie I have ever seen (Antichrist being the worst) and the fact that some people think it is entertaining makes me think 'Am I missing siomething?' The girl is not that attractive, the other two models you see are far more attractive, and even the make up artist is sexier!

311,shanefoutz,All Art No Film,1,14 November 2016,"I pondered giving this movie a 2 but then I realized that there was no reason. A 2 in my my seemed to believe that this movie had a redeeming quality, it doesn't. While the title to my review sounds like it could be interesting, don't be fooled, even the art isn't worth seeing. The transitions are poor and create a choppy film, each scene lasts 5 minutes too long because it's all about the artistic flair and the art is abstract at best. The soundtrack is even as pretentious as the artistic flair of the movie. No redeeming qualities. The acting is absolutely terrible. The main characters boyfriend literally just stares and delivers a couple line, then stares more. He looks like an absolute creep at the best of times, but that's something that really plagues this whole movie. Someone speaks and then it's like they want to capture every angle of it'll leaving us with a 30 second shot of 2 words. You sit and stare and wonder if it will ever change because dear god this isn't how dialogue works and then it cuts to another scene that has nothing to do with it. While I'm sure that there is some deeper meaning behind the movie, I'm not willing to suffer through it again in hopes that I can rip it from the movie. Any meaning, is so far hidden underneath a gilded scene that it exhausts you hoping that what you're watching is actually about something. I was rather excited that the movie would be tastefully non-nude as it seemed like this could be the type of movie that quickly turns into a porno. While half the movie persisted with it's pleasant non-nude view, it quickly changed with the necrophilia scene and just goes down hill. I don't need to watch two girls showering in blood over and over for 5 minutes. Once again, another ""Artistic"" design, taking double, triple, quadruple the time trying to create a uselessly artistic shot. This film, in all honesty, is just garbage. It has no vision outside of someone screaming ""ART!"" at everyone involved. The dialogue is unnatural and delivered by uninspired actors. Nothing moves along at any sort of pace and whenever it changes scenes it uses terrible cuts and you may not even see the wrap up of the last scene. Save your time, it looks like it may be cool, but it's not. It's a movie that leaves you sitting there wondering what the hell you're watching. If you manage to make it to the end, all you feel is regret.",The Neon Demon

Reference to orange clockwork can be felt. The down side is that it gets the point of boredom right at the second half, building up a story with vivid and hallucinogenic experiences trips onto the second half. Feels like a fall off a very tall skyscraper, causing a slow climax that unravels into a ridiculous semi-psychotic ending.Visual language in the movie is strong but the dialogue is loose, too long of a weak story to watch. Bottom line, it's an awful movie and story with a beautiful style.If you're epileptic I'd recommend not watching: repetitive light effects.

I have only seen 2 Refn's films, and the other one was a big disappointment for me (Valhalla Rising). But I'm sure that Refn didn't direct his magnum opus yet... He's quite young and talented...

The best part of this movie is the visuals like every movie done by refn, and you can feel that sometimes the story loses because of the effort for the look. The acting is good throughout. So it is a good movie with a unique feel, and Great visuals. 8/10 would recommend.",The Neon Demon

The acting was good, the plot was, though not captivating, interesting, and the casting was incredible. It was well directed, and the characters and lines seemed quite natural and well written. I very much enjoyed it and kept wondering why it got a 6.2/10 on IMDb throughout the movie. I was more than ready to give it an 8 at least. (It's worth repeating that there are spoilers from this point on) Then, Jesse (Elle Fanning) died. It was striking, and would have made for a great finale. At that point, I was awe-struck, impressed that they dared to kill off the protagonist. But the movie didn't end at that point. It kept going, and going, and going. From that point onward, everything was just... how to put it... weird. The movie got very alien, and while that is not grounds to dislike a movie, this particular one was a very ""normal"" movie for an hour and a half, and only the last twenty minutes were like that. To me, it was out of place. That last part was as if it was stitched to the movie. It may sound cruel or unjust to lower my rating from at least an 8 to a solid 5 only because of the last twenty minutes, but that last twenty minutes utterly ruined what could have been an incredible movie.

It's a horrifying satirical depiction of the modern world and the social implications of true physical beauty; something few will ever experience.We live in a very aesthetic obsessed world. Movies, TV, Tabloids, Instagram. It's all the same business; looking pretty on camera. The average citizen sees attractive people on tv, people who live higher and larger just because they're easy on the eyes.The current time is a very body positive era but deep down, we all hate the fact that we aren't perfect. Nobody is. The pictures you see on the cover pages of magazines and all over social media are just ""photoshopped"" images of people who are really just as insecure as the rest of us. But if that's true, what would happen if a such perfect being were to exist?

Perhaps that's the entire point of the movie? I felt the actors, who were phenomenal in and of themselves, were entirely wasted for the talents they represent which could have been employed to much greater effect and facility than ... whatever this film is.

320,jdrake-70044,Why Elle Fanning?,4,28 September 2016,"I couldn't stand watching any more of this movie. I got half of it and just had to leave my comments about it right here. The first exercise not to despair were the 3 minutes of opening credits, without anything to show. The movie starts right in action. We don't know anything about that girl, she doesn't know anyone .... we're right there in any moment of her life.What happens? Good question! Nothing happens! Scenes as long as Andy Warhol's most boring boredoms, mixed with nice colors and electronic music. All around Elle Fanning. Due to the fact that she is in reality a model, the following question answers itself: Is she good enough to be a model? But wait! She may be a model, but could she be that most beautiful creature as shown in the film? Is she tall enough? Is the pretty enough? I'm sure that someone else, someone really pretty, could have played her role much better. Someone more authentic and credible. That way, it wouldn't have been necessary to show all the other models dumb, to maintain balance to Elle's insecure smile and rather stupid laughter.She's pretty, the models are pretty, but it could have been prettier. Way prettier. The story is boring, dialogs are quite dumb, scenes are too long. All that deserves my few given stars are the used colors, the music, scenery and the try to make a model related black swan story.",The Neon Demon
321,wcb-75582,i do not understand the love for this film at all,1,10 January 2017,"I am truly baffled that this film has a high rating, The positives; Casting is a triumph, not only very good actors, but very attractive and believable in their roles.Cinematography is outstanding,The Negatives;Slow, very slow, in fact, slower than that. Almost pedestrian.Pretentious and meaningless, although the actors are very good, the fact i didn't care what happened to ANY of them speaks volumes about the Direction and Writing.At several points the film seems to try and become a message, a moral, a thriller, then it swings back to lame attempts at horror and eventually dips a very little toe into the waters of soft core suggestive erotica, i've no doubt that the film was intended to be much more than it is, possibly should have been, unfortunately the director seems to get constantly confused as to what the narrative of the film is, therefore losing any cinematic experience. What we end up with is trite, dull, pretentious and annoying, no doubt it will win a lot of ""critics"" awards and admirers, but certainly not from inside the industry itself or their peers. But this is not a film, its a piece of art, at which it truly is accomplished, 10/10, however, this is a movie and a movie website and as such, as a movie, its awful, 1/10.It will be confined to the DVD bargain bin, despite the outrageous reviews on here proclaiming its brilliance.

Superb use of color, creative composition, unpredictable sequences , and excellent variety of wide, medium and close up shots.The film is a sharp criticism of the fashion industry. It is not very erudite. In fact ir seems to be from the point of view of a naughty school boy. How can a sophisticated visual presentation of beautiful women turn into an amateur production ? The fault begins with the fact this film is a one man show with all technical jobs being done by one person like a film school project. When a film is executed by many people , viewers get the best talent in each category and a film goes through a natural push and pull of the creative process. Instead in The Neon Demon we get the voice of one childish man who produces a film that perpetuates stereotypes. The women do little acting and instead pose like Madonna from one scene to the next. His voyeurism rests on the bones of a poorly written and poorly conceived script. To keep it from being totally rubbish on the cutting room floor , the film crosses over into the horror genre. These attempts of creativity result in trite laughable moments that make me wonder is The Neon Demon supposed to be serious drama or corny comedy ?",The Neon Demon
324,verydarkmagic,"This film explores topics of beauty, jealousy and vampires",10,16 December 2019,"I watched this film like a week ago. I was impressed, but after thinking more and more about it, I am ready to say that this was one of the best films I've seen in life. Don't want to talk too much about visual and soundtrack - they are STUNNING and could make this movie alone. You can find that in other reviews. I want to talk about what else this film has to offer.The pacing is slow, not as slow as 2001 but still. Story is pretty simple, a 16 year girl from countryside comes to LA to pursue a model career. She has natural beauty while her competitors have implants and plastic surgeries. In a blink of an eye, all the 'important people' like photographers and designers are thrilled with her.
This film explores topics of beauty, jealousy and vampires in a cruel field of beauty business. Beauty is a slippery thing - if you are born pretty, you are lucky. If you're not - you can try and undergo a bunch of plastic surgeries like Sara and Gigi did just to be ""OKAY"". Then Jessie comes around and you are instantly out of the game, no matter how hard you try. Jessie possesses natural beauty and is genetically superior to any other model in the film.
This beauty of Jessie is a gift and a curse at the same time. She falls in love with her self image and then we are presented with Neon Demon herself - a self-confident and arrogant woman who is ready to exercise her unmatchable superiority.
Which ultimately gets her killed. But what made the ending so shocking is how understandable and even relatable it felt. The film presents murder, cannibalism and occultism from a perspective of hopeless attempt of 'simple' people trying to fight the nature.To sum up, The Neon Demon is one-of-a-kind masterpiece. I loved watching every minute of it. I loved remembering it and trying to understand it.

But it needs doing.",The Neon Demon
326,JanksReviews,"The Neon Demon is a beautiful looking, psychological horror film from the warped mind of director Nicolas Winding Refn - and is some of his best work to date.",9,1 August 2016,"Jessie (Elle Fanning), a young and innocent aspiring model moves to LA to make it in the fashion industry, where she encounters the harsh brutalities that come with it, both figuratively and literally.It's not the most original of plots for Refn's first foray into horror, but add his signature style to the mix and it's a unique viewing experience overall. The director has a rare ability to take an average story and turn it into a very personal art-house piece of cinema, one that often divides audiences. He relies mostly on audio-visual elements to drive the story of the film, of which he is a master of. Though as often is the case, the story and characters suffer for it.In this instance, the characters are a bit weak in the sense that the film doesn't delve too deep into their backgrounds, but does just enough to give us a glimpse of their personalities on the surface. Elle Fanning is great as the doe-eyed, small-town beauty and Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee are both on point in their roles as Gigi and Sarah respectively - two ruthless, established models trying to survive in an industry that chews up and spits out its stars without mercy. Jena Malone plays Ruby, the makeup artist/friend to Jessie and is great in her role, coming off as the most-grounded character, but one that may or may not be hiding something.It makes you wonder whether the characters were purposefully made all surface and no substance, considering the film is based in the fashion industry where it's usually only what's on the surface that counts. It doesn't just only relate to the characters though, as the whole film is essentially about what you see in front of you. Visually, the film is gorgeous and by far the best looking Refn film to date. The use of colors, framing and sound of every scene compliment each other perfectly, with almost every shot providing an image you could potentially hang up on a wall. When keeping that in mind, it doesn't sound fair to call the characters weak any more, as looking at the film as a whole, it all makes sense.One can not talk about a Refn film without mentioning the score. Cliff Martinez returns to provide the score for this film after previously providing his talents to score the director's other films Drive and Only God Forgives. The creepy electro music fits the style of the film perfectly, building the tension where necessary and adding a further sense of terror to the imagery.The Neon Demon might not be Refn's best work (Drive is hard to beat), however it's right up there as his most enjoyable. From the opening title, the audience is drawn in on what feels like a hypnotic journey into the seedy side of the LA fashion scene. The whole film feels like a two hour photo-shoot for Vogue, but is not without some tongue- in-cheek humour and of course, the signature brutality and obscenities of a Refn film are ever-present.The Neon Demon won't appeal to a lot of people, which is fine. One of the best attributes of the director is that he's yet to 'sell-out' to Hollywood. Fans of his should love it. Horror fans should love it. Anyone with an open mind looking for a bit of an experience will love it. It's a film that warrants multiple viewings, which could, and should probably be the only measure of success a film and its director needs.",The Neon Demon

Watch the movie. When ignoring the storyline, it's a beautiful shot that's for sure. Digression: In Dostoevsky's ""The Idiot"", the protagonist Mishkin observes that a certain type of beauty can save the world. That observation rang false then, and it rang falser yet after watching The Neon Demon.

Beauty is depicted through the characters, lightning, with every camera angle, through the whole atmosphere which will leave you feeling empty. Even the conversations they have are regarding beauty. The movie is about the inner ugliness of the people surrounding our protagonist - Jesse, how she copes with it and how she is devoured by the beauty world by giving into it. I do agree that this movie has nothing new to say, but by that analogy all the movies have nothing new to say. Every movie is about things we come across in every day life, of course not to the extent the movies show it.

It's about a young woman called Jesse (Elle Fanning) who wants to be a model. In order to launch her career as a model, she moves to LA from a small town in Georgia. On her 16th birthday, she was signed to one of the most important modelling agency in Los Angeles. where she was asked to lie about her age. Everything moves really fast for her which makes the other models started to get jealous of her beauty. And then we have a movie.Let's talk about the positives first.First, visually, this movie is amazing. As expected from Nicolas Winding Refn, he is is a great visual director. Compared to his earlier films, The Neon Demon are his most colorful movie. by far the best visually. The usage of colors and lighting in this movie is so good, this movie is stunning. go see it yourself if you don't believe it. Not just the lighting, but also the people. everyone looks beautiful in this movie.Elle Fanning, Jena Malone, Abbey Lee, Bella Heathcote. all of them, are so beautiful. Especially Elle Fanning, never in my life ever I notice an actress physical appearance before. In a movie you'd expect the actor or the actress to be good looking. but in this movie, it's so apparent. Before you think I was a pervert because instead of talking about the movie I talk about their beauty. let me explain. The Neon Demon is a movie about people's obsession of Beauty. about how some people will do basically everything to be beautiful. So this movie is all about physical beauty.makes sense if Nicolas Winding Refn, as a visual director, wants to emphasize this by making everyone in this movie looks more beautiful then they normally are. if you watch the movie, you can tell that there's a difference between each actresses face. their face have their own character. let's talk about the sound of this movie, amazing. Cliff Martinez once again proves himself to be one of the best composer in film industry. this movie's score is amazing, never in my life I watch a movie where the visual and the music works so well together. The performances in this movie are great too. Almost every actors in this movie is good. except for Karl Glusman. Who in my opinion is a bit bland. Elle Fanning is also really good in this movie, she's so good as this aspiring young model who was born as an amazingly beautiful woman. Keanu Reeves is also in this movie too. and I like his performance as the owner of a Motel that Elle Fanning stays in. As much as I like Elle Fanning's performance, but the one who deserves more praise is Jena Malone as a beauty obsessed make up artist. Jena Malone gives one of the best performance in her entire career. the things that she did in this movie is insane. I've never seen an actress who gives a performance like that. she was so out of this world. I don't want to spoil anything so i'm not going to tell you what she did in this movie. but she does STUFF that's it. not gonna give you more. Go see the movie yourself, you'll be amazed by Jena Malone's performance. My issues with the movie is, First Keanu Reeves is in this movie, but his character is so weird. His motivation is strange. His character is pretty interesting at first, his funny but kinda rude. but then he gets taken to some strange direction and his character is just gone, and wasted. the other problem that I have with this movie is still the same problem that I have with Only God Forgives. Nicolas Winding Refn himself said that he only film something that he want to see. and that he have some kind of fetish to violence. In Only God Forgives there's an extremely violent torture scene that's completely unnecessary, and in The Neon Demon, there's also some sequence in the movie that was so disturbing I can't watch it, but I don't mind it, even though it's difficult to watch. the problem that I have with it is, it's not that necessary to the story. it's just Nicolas Winding Refn visualizing his fetishes again. and that is some insane fetishes. Nicolas Winding Refn is not holding back his urge to visualize his fetishes. and sometimes it works, but sometimes it's seem so out of place. I think compared to some of his earlier films, this is by far his weakest one. this movie is good for the eye, but nothing more. but that doesn't mean The Neon Demon is a bad movie. it's a good movie, but pretty hard to digest. This not an accessible movie, there's so many way to interpret this movie. there's also a lot of hints throughout the movie that i'm not going to explain because this review is already as long as it is. And it will disturb, bother, and offend a lot of people. but if you're not that kind of person, if you love an experimental films.. then I would recommend you guys to watch this movie. for that, i'm going to rate The Neon Demon this film is insane and weird as hell. but there's a lot of visual metaphors in it, which is why I was so riveted throughout the entire movie, and also why in my opinion it's worth your time if your into it.",The Neon Demon
336,tasteoferik,refn lacks incredible insight into womanhood and is childishly self-righteous,3,19 April 2021,"Refn clearly has no idea what goes in the modeling industry, does a terrible job in general at setting an unsettling tone. Everything comes off as straight up inaccurate, unrealistic. The worst part is that it has this self-seriousness about it which makes it even more painful to watch. I hate to say it but the film feels as though it was made with the intellect of a middle schooler: grand critiques with no substance, everything is black and white, fabricated characters to fit a certain narrative.Oh and the casting was terrible in my opinion. I understand the protagonist had to look plain and innocent etc. But god, it was almost funny how every woman that she's supposedly superior to was infinitely more interesting and attractive.",The Neon Demon
337,jtimmons0,Only for the most pretentious,1,28 July 2017,I like a good art film but this is barely either. A collection of loose scenes and and random sounds with a paper thin plot make for a long two hours. It tries so hard to copy classic abstract films but fails miserably. I can't imagine recommending this to anyone I know whose friendship I value. I don't mind gore or shocking imagery but its used so cheaply here with little meaning behind it that its almost insulting.,The Neon Demon

339,michaelrthomasfofc,"Visually striking, nothing more.",1,29 September 2020,"This ""art house"" film is difficult to describe without giving away the whole thing. The vivid colors and contrasts are appealing, but for me it ends there. The plot is thinly veiled and the story could have been told within a 30 minute TV episode. It drags for over an hour before it gets to the little bit of story.This movie just doesn't have ANY elements of humanity or value. It is pretentious and almost condescending to watch, as if trying to be coy and sneaky. There's nothing remotely erotic in the film. It's uncomfortable to watch such a story develop around a sixteen year-old girl, and it's just not entertaining. There are some good actors on screen, but this movie is far below their abilities. IMHO this movie shouldn't have ever been made.",The Neon Demon

I didn't like a single character and the movie seemed to drag on. By the end I was begging for it to be over. I mean I get the point, natural beauty = good and fake beauty = Bad. The natural beauty is a shown as a martyr and is literally killed because the other (also beautiful) women are jealous. It just comes off as misogynistic. I wonder how many little girls got eating disorders after watching this.I give it a 2/10 because although it's vain and hardly watchable it's visually stunning.",The Neon Demon

There's basically no dialogue, no rhyme or reason to any of the characters or plot, terrible acting, no emotions, no action, no anything.The main character is the least attractive character in the movie, which makes the story even less believable.There are several scenes in the movie which were there strictly for awe value, and did not contribute anything to the actual plot.The whole thing is just boring and awkward, and I want these 2 hours of my life back.",The Neon Demon
343,scandium-65-287575,Did I just watch an art house film?,9,4 March 2021,"Did I just watch an art house film? I guess so but, wow this was an unreal experience!The Neon Demon doesn't function through a thick story line, sad characters or through heavy gore scenes. It's the eery atmosphere it creates and especially the outstanding visual presentation what makes it unique. I highly recommend watching this in a complete dark room to be fully able to perceive its dark and sinister beauty.The Neon Demon tells the story of Jesse who is a - I guess 19? - years old cute, shy girl who left her hometown to start a photo model career. Her fragility and innocence make her to be perceived like an angel in a potentially hostile world. This is one way of how the movie creates a contrast to set up several suspenseful moments:Just by rooting for the girl and hoping that nothing evil happens to her put me under high tension. Additional contrast is created by the interaction between Jesse and her environment: I even doubted something good can actually be good, like when she says something positive about a person, although there was no open reason given at all to think so. My feelings were really ambiguous. I guess that's called (a form of) suspense and at least it worked for me.Jesse's story is told in a rather slow way throughout the movie. Although it offers a great character development don't think about The Neon Demon as a slow-burning drama or even a feel-good movie. I mentioned that it doesn't do its trick by graphic gore scenes, but this flick is not recommended for the faint-hearted and a few very gross scenes exist.It touches several different taboo topics!By touches I mean that it makes you aware of the moral boundaries every sane person has about various topics. With these borders called to mind it creates pictures in advance where the border crossing only takes place in your own mind. It often creates terror solely by playing with the uncertainty if something injected into your mind will actually happen or not. No spoiler, but some things (beyond the border) will actually happen! This creates a real horror feeling and it worked better for me than the usual gore fest type of movie.Expect an artistic, dark, twisted and even sick horror movie which culminates in its last third and finale. Personally, it left me speechless about what I have seen in the last hour when the credits rolled.The Neon Demon is a masterpiece and not just a movie but an audio-visual experience. ""Enjoy!""Thanks for reading.",The Neon Demon

The visuals gave me a headache and made an already boring movie way too drawn out. Keanu Reeves made it bearable, as well as Christina Hendricks, but neither of them were in the film a whole lot. The only reason I'm giving it three stars is because of Keanu Reeves.",The Neon Demon
345,KellyCastlesbridge,Dumb people won't get it,8,30 June 2016,"This was an interesting art film, that is not your typical mainstream, mass-produced ""feel good movie"". Instead, it is dark, complex, and cynical. Solid acting from Elle Fanning and Christina Hendricks. They are both beautiful and talented. The film has a great soundtrack and integrates the music into the story line.It uses various metaphors throughout the film to communicate ideas and philosophies, but most of these will not be understood by dim-witted members of the audience (feminist types) who will simply bash the movie and complain about the female nudity and call it ""sexually depraved"" or ""exploitative"" or other such nonsense. Obviously, people who say such things are not well educated or intelligent, and are the kind of insecure women who stamp their feet and have a little tantrum anytime a movie shows a bit of female skin. The nudity in the film is mostly near the end, primarily during a scene where a woman engages in implied sex with a corpse. The ""corpse"" was obviously a live human actress pretending to be dead, and no actual sex was shown, so its nothing really that bad. We did get to see some female genitalia (a bit of vulva/labia was briefly seen for a couple of seconds) which was refreshing, since most movies nowadays only show male genitalia. The scene certainly made sense in relation to the context of the film, and I'm surprised that anybody would get their knickers in a knot over it. There was also a scene that showed women bathing in blood and implied cannibalism. This was related to several concepts, including references to bathing in the blood of a young virgin to maintain youth and beauty (which references the countess Elizabeth Bathory), and the tribal idea that if you kill and eat your enemy, you consume their power and it becomes part of you. There are also references to the maxim ""Truth is beauty, and beauty is truth"", narcissism, shallowness, transformation, etc. The movie will NOT make you feel good; that's not its intention. Its designed to make you think. People who gave it a 1/10 rating obviously were unable to see beyond their own prudish prejudices and sexist/feminist intellectual limitations to understand the deeper metaphors and ideas the film was trying to communicate. So dumb, close-minded people should avoid this film. For the rest of us, I give it an 8/10. The film would have done a lot better if it had more television advertising and better marketing.",The Neon Demon

347,marinkasalo,Missing a tiny little thing- plot,3,29 October 2021,"Reason why I am giving it three stars is because it has some nice music and pretty colors. But thats about it, there is no actual plot to follow. Now i dont mind some art scenes in a movie, they can have a reason and serve a purpose in some films, but 90 percent of this film is bunch of some kind of art scenes that all seem like a filler to pump up minutes. You are just watching some nice shots with some pretty colors, movie tries to present is as some sort of a metaphor for the world of modeling, but since characters are so shallow and you dont get any sort of character development (cant really blame the actors here), you couldnt care less about what is going to happen. Their motivation is as cliche as it gets ( pretty girls are upset because a prettier girl shows up, oh please) and all characters seem like caricatures of what someone completely shallow would think these people would behave like and are not at all believable as actual people.Arguably, the most interesting part is the last twenty minutes where the movie takes turn from some pointless, meaningless art film to some sort of a ridiculous horror film, but it is too little too late and apparently that ending was improvised on set so it seems director had no idea where to go with the film, somebody just suggested ""why dont we do this"" and director said ""sure lets do it"". And that was the most interesting part. That tells you all you need to know about the story.Despite all that, movie still manages to rack up lot of disgusting stuff like pedophilia,necrophilia and cannibalism but apparently it is not that bad if it is done by female characters. Movie that does not work on any level, neither as an art film nor as a horror film. Just a bad film. No real story.",The Neon Demon

Refn) has created a visual masterpiece for the modern film aesthete. vibrant color and dynamic light pull you in by your optical nerves meanwhile dramatic pause and caesura keep you biting your nails (i read somewhere the start-stop-go scene arrangement was inspired by high-fashion runway catwalks). the glittering images are highlighted by fluorescent and neon lights, and every scene has at least one magnificent still. not to be called a one-trick-pony, NWR's cinematographic prowess comes full circle here. i can't define his aesthetic per- say, but his visual devices are uniquely stylized and engage viewers to come- hither and witness something both beautiful and repulsive. the decadent elements, the juxtaposition of the grossly violent with the delicately pretty, the adornment and romanticized pictures of death haunt and bewitch us. the truest art disturbs the comfortable. total ensorcellment is guaranteed by musical wizard Cliff Martinez (soundtrack and original score for the film; he is also the one responsible for The Knick's (dir. steven soderberg) electro-synth perfection). with Cliff, you barely need dialogue.which is just as well since that is the main area in which the film disappoints. what some call 'bad acting' is actually lack of skillful writing; steeped in modern existentialism, NWR intended to make a social commentary of capitalist consumer culture and whether or not he intended on making something beautiful but vacant is irrelevant. like couture culture, lack of substance is part and parcel to the fashion industry. models are meant to look perfect, not be perfect. you can have brains or beauty: not both ad supremum. either way, the Hollywood cult of beauty is on display (literally and figuratively) in all its tragic glory. are RWN's shortcomings the same as those at play IRL? this hypnotic mise-en-scene ironically submits to and subscribes to the same controversial polemics. cut to scene: fashion show fitting ""take her to measurements"". even if you find this entire movie a waste of time, money and or life, there are 3 things that you must admit to appreciating. 1. the panther in the hotel room. 2. keanu, for the first time in a long time. 3.

Each shot is poised for elegance and beauty, each interaction with the main character is tense and feels ominous, with a very steady build up ultimately leading to nothing unfortunately. The ending is dissatisfying, given the build up, although it is expected through out the movie as it doesn't really feel like its trying to go anywhere in particular.

Interestingly this dream is frighteningly close to reality in its portrayal of our modern world. We want easy access acquisition of everything these days. No long-term investment of time or money appeals to us. We want a quick fix. We move hastily and find it tiring to dig past the surface. This film is a shot of adrenaline. The most horrifying thing about The Neon Demon is how well it plays with society's obsession with all things external. It hammers on the head of our fixations of youth, sex, and violence with blunt force. It proves us shallow as we are utterly mystified by the visuals but repulsed by the horror on display. This review is being written after my second viewing and with it comes a better understanding of the film. There is an overwhelming deluge of sensory information in this film, it is practically numbing to witness. See it twice in the theater if you can. It is my belief that the story is never meant to focus on one particular character. Jesse is a Trojan Horse into this mad world - this all too real world. All of the performances are frighteningly simple and easy to understand. The characters are laughable and precise. This is the ultimate experiment in voyeurism. As a viewer you are a voyeur into a depraved world structured carefully by Refn. His film deals with modern surface-level existence. It showcases a group of models and their problems in their dangerous world. It is a crazy place that cannot be defined with words, therefore Refn chooses to make his music tell most of its story.

But then, very weird things happen I really don't get. Maybe I miss the whole point of the movie, but it starts when some kind of a big cat that's not a pet is in her hotel room. How can you suddenly have a tiger (its not a tiger, I don't know what the animal is called) in your room?! Then things happen like having sex with a dead body, vomiting eyeballs and re-eating it, cannibalism, murder and peeing blood. What?! The movie takes two hours of your time and I recommend spending it on another movie. Besides the plot, the visuals were cool; not awesome, just cool.

357,Subjekt_16,Beautiful - Stunning - Gut-wrenching,10,16 January 2017,"With ""The Neon Demon"", Nicolas Winding Refn delivered nothing less than the best movie of 2016. Even when I watched it for the second time, it still kept me on the edge of my seat. Elle Fanning plays a young model, who wants to make her fortune in Los Angeles. Acting like a shy and naive girl, she soon reveals her true nature. The young actress delivers a great performance, making all the other actors seem like amateurs. And we're talking about Jena Malone and Keanu Reeves here.But the true stars of the film are its stunning visuals. Whether it's the beautiful skyline of L.A. or the neon lights and geometric forms of a fashion show, where everything is artificial and just Elle Fanning represents the natural world. Everything about the optic is just outstanding. The music is also great and remarkable. Another strength of this film are the many quiet, intense and sometimes disgusting moments, for example when Keanu Reeves orally penetrates Elle Fanning with a knife or when Jena Malone has sex with a dead woman. Nicolas Winding Refn shows what he needs to show in order, to deliver the overall message of the film, criticizing the sick world of fashion and beauty. This movie is for people, who want to have a unique experience and have no problems with disturbing imagery. For everyone, who is not afraid to see.",The Neon Demon

I'm actually quite baffled by the low ratings, but then all it means it's not a movie for everyone and some people should just rent Spiderman 6 and enjoy it with their popcorn. This is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen, and on many levels. First of all, it looks really good, photography is absolutely breathtaking. The story line is twisted, sexy and surreal, not patronising and moralising like many people would like it to be. I would call it a modern take on what David Lynch was doing many years ago, a refreshed Jim Jarmush, with a touch of minimalist Korean photography. Enough said, just watch it.

361,jbbeebe,"Great atmosphere, Confusing (if there even is one) plot",6,5 January 2017,"Neon Demon is yet another provocative, violent, sometimes disgusting film from director Nicholas Winding Refn. The film stars Elle Fanning as a fresh model named Jesse on the scene in Los Angeles trying to make a career for herself, but also features the creepy guy from Gaspar Noe's Love Karl Glusman as Dean, Jena Malone of Donnie Darko fame as Ruby, and two beautiful envious blondes Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee, and for some reason Keanu Reeves as a hotel manager. Similar to other Refn films, Neon Demon has beautiful camera work. There are some truly awesome shots in this film. A true standout shot is Elle Fanning's silhouette against her hotel room's wall listening to a possible murder occurring next door. The lighting on this shot is sparse, merely a circle of light on Fanning's figure, but it conveys a great sense of loneliness and fear. Another cool shot involved Jesse (Fanning) in a pure white room, having gold paint rubbed on her body by a photographer. Also similar to other Refn films, the soundtrack is both in your face but enjoyable. Neon Demon's soundtrack is EDM based, with thumping bass blaring throughout many scenes. This makes sense in some scenes, but makes less sense in others. The first half of this movie is fairly slow-moving. Most of the scenes involve Fanning's character making a name for herself in LA, finding modeling gigs, meeting people, hanging out with her boyfriend. Fanning's character is quite innocent and naive early on, until she starts getting gigs and is reinforced in her belief that she is beautiful. Beauty is a major theme in the film. There are multiple conversations on the subject. Early on the in the film two other models make it obvious to Jesse that they envy her natural beauty, telling her that it is unfair. Christina Hendricks also makes a brief appearance as a scout at a modeling agency, letting Jesse know that she could be great. Another scene involves Jesse telling her boyfriend(?) that all she has is her beauty, she's not talented. There are quite a few more conversations on beauty in the film, but you get the idea. These are not particularly deep views on beauty, and are mostly surface level discussions as mentioned above. Where the film does get more interesting, and downright bizarre is its take on envy of beauty. Three characters (Ruby, and two blonde models played by Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee) in the film have an unhealthy relationship with beauty, and unfortunately take it out on Jesse. From the get go the two blondes are not fond of Jesse (they're jealous), but Ruby makes it obvious that she is quite fond, forming a friendship with her. Things start getting interesting when Jesse gets a great modeling gig and one of the blonde models (Abbey Lee I think) does not. Abbey Lee is in the bathroom and smashes a mirror. Jesse walks in and confronts her. Jesse accidentally cuts herself on her hand on some of the glass and Abbey Lee starts drinking the blood from her hand. This is the first sign that the level of envy is not normal. Things continue to get even weirder when Jesse is staying with Ruby and Ruby makes a move on her and fails. Ruby works in a morgue and applies make-up. She is also apparently into necrophilia, as she commits unspeakable acts with a cadaver while fantasizing about Jesse. The weirdness culminates in Ruby and the two blonde models murdering Jesse and then eating her. There were signs that they were into this sort of thing, such as the scene mentioned earlier with the cut on the hand. Ruby then randomly (but very artistically, this is Refn after all) breaks her water (not sure how) all over the floor while lying down. The movie ends with the two blonde models getting a pretty good gig with a top-notch photographer. Bella Heathcote gets very sick during the gig and has to use the little ladies room. She then barfs up Jesse's eyeball and then stabs herself in her stomach with a pair of scissors, killing herself. Abbey Lee witnesses the whole scene and then decides to eat the barfed up eyeball. That's where the movie ends. These scenes suggest that envy of beauty is so strong in our culture that people will go to great lengths to acquire it, even if that means murdering someone and eating their body. We all see beautiful people in movies, television, magazines, and the Internet. This film focused on the feminine side, and odd departure for Refn. This film is not all too clear on what point it's trying to make plot wise, but it's hard not to watch it to its gore filled conclusion with so much interesting atmosphere, music and camera-work, even if they seem to be all the film really offers.",The Neon Demon

Visually, The Neon Demon is a quite beautiful film... But unfortunately, that's all that really I enjoyed about it. The film seemed to pride itself on its symbolism, but never gave much substance plot-wise to make the symbolism mean anything at all. The Neon Demon really did have the potential to make a profound statement about beauty in our society, but it fell far too short to make any sort of lasting impression. As someone who was extremely excited to finally get to watch this movie, my expectations fell flat.",The Neon Demon
363,LJplays,Kubric + Pizzagate = Neon Demon,10,27 December 2016,"Holy god damn hell.Please don't tell me im the only one connecting this movies obvious metaphorical references to satanism and the pizzagate child eating conspiracy!!??! First let me say - This film shocked me deeply because i have worked for Alexander Macqueen and actually photographed all the vogue models preparing for their final outfits in London and in Paris. So i know the physical strain the models go through whilst competing for the catwalk. I have literally had to help models from buckling under their own feet with the stress of the boots they are walking in. This movie for me portrayed this magnificently well - and how girls and boys are both manipulated into this materialistic way of life.The movie is directed and paced as if Kubric had risen from the grave and guided Nicolas Winding Refn's hand whilst he was crafting this explicitly dark and twisted yet beautifully metaphoric masterpiece. There really are no rules to crafting a film - and Nicolas Winding Refn is not afraid to break all boundaries here.The strangest thing about this movie, is that it has stuck with me for weeks afterwards, and when i learn more about political scandals and pedophile rings all connected to these VIP people in our current governments - i have flash backs to this film and the references it was trying to make - but i completely missed! So lets go: Underage girl enters a neon world - Links to pedophilia already. Parents are both dead, so the agency signs for her as parents claiming she is older than she actually is. Already she has been seduced and illegally adopted. You are told through imagery and expressions only - that for some reason the producers of these shows want this girl in particular because she is underage and has that kind of ""innocence""; whereas all the other accomplished models have had so much plastic surgery that you don't really know what they really look like - they are just fake emotionless demons.Throughout the movie we are subject to what I've read on these forums as ""too much art"" lol? I mean come on.. seriously? If you do some research you will see all the hidden symbology in connection to pedophilia and secret underground rings - ie: the codes these *beep* up weirdoes use to communicate with other freaks like themselves. Hes throwing it all in your face - but if you're not actually looking - you will just see straight through the whole movie like a thin piece of empty glass.The symbology behind the scene where our main protagonist gets eaten by the other models and they all bath in her blood in an EMPTY SWIMMING POOL..!?!? Are you kidding me!? Just do one search on pizzagate and go look at podesta's paintings on his walls with children lying down in empty swimming pools and tell me there is no connection!? Nicolas Winding Refn is saying that there is something really *beep* up going on with hidden underground pedophile rings, and this *beep* goes real high up and even deep than just pedophilia. If you really look into it - they are saying that newborn fetus when eaten - these satanists actually believe that it will extend their lives and replenish their looks in some twisted satanic ritual of witchcraft1?!?!?! Go do the research and then go watch this movie - and then be prepared to miss a few nights sleep. Enjoy.A+",The Neon Demon

368,MirarchiJ,Interesting ... but does take itself too seriously.,6,16 June 2017,"""The Neon Demon"" is a trancey-paced story of a young up-and-coming model who encounters a metaphorical (and literal) hell in Los Angeles. The film is an inscrutable fusion of catty melodrama and abstract occult symbolism that includes: fluorescent triangles, levitating contortionists, transformative menstruation, and icky pagan bathing rituals (all for the sake of BEAUTY). ""The Neon Demon"" is all glossy, pleasureful surfaces but HOLLOW. Sorta like smooth background music that doesn't emotionally engage. Ironically, the film's director has said that he made his opus for teens.

A little too many mirror shots, but I guess it was appropriate. Nothing really happens, nothing profound anyway. But that's kind of the point, in my opinion. The fashion world is all fake and flashy and beautiful but it has absolutely no substance. I don't think this should be under horror. More maybe under surrealism? Elle Fanning did a great job. Her character was supposed to be this innocent scared girl but there was something floating just under the surface. I feel like it could've been played on more. Honestly it was the second part I was unsatisfied with. The necrophilia scene was just so? Unnecessary? And disturbing? But I guess it was set up for the scene where they eat Elle's character. They just eat her. And it was so anti-climatic? Like, that was it? They just ate her? Just like that? And I don't know, I feel like the movie had a strong foundation to go into a different direction and it would've been a lot better. It had potential. But the whole cannibalism thing just made it comical. It wasn't scary or shocking. I just wanted to laugh at how ridiculous it was. Also there was a scene somewhere in the beginning of the middle, where Elle's character closes her first show and she has that weird abstract scene with the triangles. What the heck was that, honestly? Was it supposed to be artsy? Some kind of metaphor or symbolism? Initiation into the fashion world? I don't know. But it made no sense. It was pretty, though. The film could definitely do without it. Overall, it was interesting, but it could've been a lot better.",The Neon Demon

Characters disappear and they don't even explain it, that is a major issue story wise. The mad construction of the body, in terms of what society considers beautiful or worthy of being called beautiful is in there, as the movie glorifies white beauty it critic's it at the same time.

It's a twisted movie, with intentionally empty scenes and characters. The lead, Elle Fanning is great. Her character undergoes a transition in the middle of the movie that makes it almost like there are two characters. She is the ideal of beauty; an ideal that the movie proves does not exist. The only real characters in the movie are Gigi and Sarah. This movie is an art project. It is almost entirely metaphorical. The cinematography is great, but the standout is the way the movie is colored. It's awesome just to look at, with stark contrasts, Red vs. Blue. Visuals alone make it worth watching: they are the center of this movie, not the plot. This movie and La La Land are my two favorites for this year. Interestingly, they are both about LA, and breaking into the industry, and achieving unachievable greatness. But if La La Land shows the good in LA, then Neon Demon shows they bad. It's like the two sides of a coin- the movies are polar opposites, yet center around several of the same things. Rated R for a reason, 17+",The Neon Demon
386,jrobertfleming,Self-Serious Mess Filled With Bad Laughs,1,28 June 2016,"So I guess female vanity is some kind of dark magic and you see the innocent virgin attracted to its glowing allure. As she is drawn into it she meets a coven of witches: a passover, a wannabe and a sorceress supreme, who all covet what she has. The passover wants to kill her, the wannabe is jealous of her and the sorceress supreme who occasionally turns into a wildcat attempts to seduce her, but, awake to the power within her, the innocent virgin instead opens herself to her destiny as the vessel of 'The Neon Demon'. The coven then kills her and eats her flesh to gain for themselves the powers of 'The Neon Demon'. Which is female vanity or the male gaze or some nebulous cloud of similar tropes referenced in terms of fashion modelling. The bad laughs and eye-rolling material comes on early where our innocent virgin hits all those on-the-nose beats about falling from innocence in the big city. Speaking of 'beats', long expanses of the film seem like the cinematography was only there to provide a light show behind Carpenter-esque synth jamming. An example of this was a heavily abstracted scene where our innocent virgin is finally possessed by 'The Neon Demon'. I guess 'abstract' is the word for it. 'Stoner planetarium laser show' would also suffice. Within the narrative continuity, this possession is meant to have occurred when the innocent virgin is given the star slot in a famous designer's runway show. One is left with the suspicion that the filmmakers couldn't actually show this happen in the context of an actual runway show because they didn't have a clear idea of the reality of a runway show. The scenes bookending the sequence feature some of the most self-serious and unintentionally silly dialogue in the film. After her possession, the film takes a steep dive into very silly territory. Our innocent virgin is presumably transformed now that she has accepted 'Teh Power', but Elle Fanning has none of the startling aesthetic presence attributed to her character either before or after. We're just meant to recognize her unique and startling attractiveness because it's written into the dialogue. By the foot of the second act, audience credulity on this point is strained. There's a scene of the sorceress making out with a corpse, a ten minute sequence of the witches washing the innocent virgin's blood off their bodies in slo-mo under blue light while the sorceress, also covered in blood and glitter, gazes on and one of the witches heaves for ten minutes, in another ten-minute sequence of a character doing one thing, before throwing up an eyeball. There's more goofy stuff after that. There are a lot of party-bulb and blacklight shots which go on for way to long. A lot of bad dialogue. It's not a good movie.",The Neon Demon

There are many big names starring in this movie, but there are truly only two main stars and their names are Cliff Martinez, and the madman himself, Nicolas Winding Refn. (Also need to mention Jena Malone, because she had the best acting performance by far in my opinion.) If you've seen a Refn movie before, you might know what you're getting yourself into, but even at that, you still might leave the theater with your jaw on the floor. I know I did. It's not a perfect movie, but if anything, my biggest fault of it was that I simply wanted more. You could use the phrase ""style over substance"" but I thought there was a lot of substance there, just not enough. Christina Hendricks and Keanu Reeves were also horribly underused which was frustrating. I do think the final act will completely divide people, if the first two acts didn't divide them already, and it's most likely a ""love it or hate it"" film. I'm leaning towards loving it, but I need to watch it a few more times, and eye absolutely will.",The Neon Demon
390,c-pi57,"Defies all conventions. Flawed, yet stunning",7,3 July 2016,"I can't lie, I initially rated The Neon Demon a 5/10. However, after seeing it opening day and being transfixed yet somewhat put-off the entire runtime, I couldn't get the film out of my head, and have now decided I absolutely love it. Yes, the dialogue is a disaster, the performances are interesting at best (I was actually the most impressed by Abbey Lee and hope to see her play an out and out psycho soon), and all semblances of a conventional plot line are nonexistent, but the world and experience the movie gives the viewer is like nothing else. Films that would come close are 70s cult classics including Argento's infamous giallo Suspiria and the underrated Japanese horror/acid-fest Hausu, and I would be shocked if Winding Refn didn't at least take some inspiration from the former. I had thought films like that were all but lost in time, but The Neon Demon takes the technicolor-ed, fever dream slasher to a new level, even down to the haunting score. No one can deny it looks absolutely fantastic-- from the day-glo pinks and blues juxtaposed against black, the artful shots that looked like a cross between a Kubrick film and an underground rave, and the way LA was captured as almost a character in itself- a menacing, hollow one at that. However, all this would be nothing more than an experimental, music video-esque piece of performance art if it wasn't for the thematic elements in which the movie draws from. And though it's hardly groundbreaking in touching on its deeper elements, the movie really does have a lot to say about conventional beauty standards and the levels with which we will go to achieve them. I found myself wishing I looked like the three female leads more than once during the movie, and while I'm sure this irony, if it can be called that, wasn't exactly intentional, it does make me think a lot about the way the modeling and film industries view beauty, and how rather than try to change society, we try and change ourselves. Both are easier said than done. All in all, The Neon Demon was a visual feast with a deeper meaning. Many things are unexplained, but this just adds to the mystery. If you're up for in immersive, original experience that may leave you feeling a bit uncomfortable due to its content and the harsh reality of its themes, I would recommend it in a heartbeat.",The Neon Demon
391,jzonda415,"Utterly Fantastic, but Not for Everyone",9,21 June 2016,"I will preface this by saying that if you haven't seen any other Refn movies, like ""Drive"" or ""Only God Forgives,"" then you should see those first to see what you're getting into. I thoroughly loved this film, and will stand by in saying that it's an incredible movie. However, if you can't get through Refn's other works, or didn't really ""get"" them, then it won't deliver the same payoff that I received. To clarify, I'm not saying that if you hate this movie then you ""just don't get it."" But, seek out other Refn works first to see if you'll like something like this. This is an incredibly cerebral experience. It's is a lot of silent and dialogue free moments where you take in the world the movie cultivates. The cinematography, like in all of Refn's movies, is simply stunning. The colors craft the tone of the movie so effectively it tells a whole story with just itself; it almost is another character. Every shot feels expertly crafted, well put together, like a painting. No time in this 2 hour movie ever feels that wasted. Every shot feels necessary, every frame is splendid.The acting is also on point. Elle Fanning is perfectly cast as the main girl in this film. Her innocence, her shyness, her entire persona is conveyed very effectively. Many of the side characters also fit their character well. Keanu Reeves fit his character well, along with Abbey Lee. But Jena Malone stood out especially to me. The mannerisms of her character, the subtleties, the way she talked was fantastic. Without spoiling anything, a certain scene in this movie with Malone contains so much passion and emotion that I was completely blown away. She, along with Fanning, were my favorite parts of this. I would recommend this movie wholeheartedly, even knowing that it's really not for everyone. It's beyond strange and weird, and is a lot more visual storytelling than a solid narrative. It still has a story, nonetheless. If you're into that, then this may be for you, and you be able to get into it. If you're not, or are skeptical, then you will be disappointed. Nonetheless, I standby in saying this is a great film, and that there ought to be something in it you can enjoy.

At most a weak version of a biographical film.Basically the film is an biography of the pressures that exist within the modeling industry and the extremes that people are willing to go to. This is nothing new. The film tries to trick you into the idea that there is some sort of plot followed by a climax and and and ultimate ending. The acting is sub par by most standards in the industry and the fact that it is rated higher than films that I have enjoyed much more is an absolute joke.Let me start off by saying that this review is strictly an opinion, as are most reviews. The difference here is that I actually felt, after viewing this particular film, that I should review it based on what the IMDb rating was. You can consider this unfair, or biased, if you must, but I feel as if this film tried to be two different things - an artsy film and a thriller/horror film. While I believe it was neither, I did enjoy the cinematography in the film and felt that there were some really solid shots that were unique in an artistic sense. The shots that really intrigued me occurred in the white photography studio as well as the scenes taking place at the party and the run-way show. Those shots were awesome in my opinion! The problem that exist is with the story and lack of an actual plot. I felt empty after watching this film. As if I had wasted 2 hrs of my life watching something I could have got more out of by watching an actual documentary about modeling and the pressures in that field. This is a prime example of some beautiful cinematography work mixed with an absolutely rubbish story. I get how cinema, or film, is not all intended to be about story telling; however, I feel as a film this film tried to push the boundaries of art and story telling with an absolute fail in the storytelling department. I would have much rather seen the ghost of the young model haunting the lives of the experienced, veteran models after what happened to her. Now that would be an actual horror story.",The Neon Demon
398,threedten,"The spiritual sequel to 1977's Suspiria, but only marginally better",7,15 December 2016,"Very much like Suspiria from 1977. The times have changed obviously and the generic details of the film are half a world away—but its basically the spiritual sequel to Suspiria. Suspiria has the disadvantage of being horrendously dated, especially with regards to its being an Italian production dubbed clumsily over into the Hollywood idiom. The Neon Demon unfortunately fares only marginally better than its predecessor.Yes the film is beautiful. No the plot isn't very deep, and no its very well constructed either as far as simple plots go. The plot being simple isn't a bad thing, and simple plots are not categorically bad (rather the opposite is true IMO,) but the film experience is also pretty shallow and unsatisfying; like Suspiria. The way The Neon Demon aestheticizes death and violence are compelling, but only in ways that will likely seem unrealistic and quaint in another time. In fact its already showing its age a little bit by some rather obtuse occult references that seem possibly even more stupid than Suspiria's pretensions to the then red-hot taboo area of Satanism and witchcraft, though the amount of screen time given to these inexplicable and unneeded references in The Neon Demon is kept to a ignorable minimum. The story however only seems to progress through nonsequiters, which while thematically relevant, don't quite follow from the preceding logic. What this film has, which Suspiria lacked, is a pretty laughable degree of self advertising. The opening credits were shockingly narcissistic, something which the end credits mirrored and indeed crescendoed to a undeniably intoxicated degree. Now it may not be fair to judge the film at least partially by its credits, but these credits were positively intruding into the film. The director is clearly ""high on his own supply,"" and is so in such a topical and obnoxious way that will seem laughable to many now and almost everyone in the near future. Its almost like making a film where the credits are something like 'hashtag best movie ever.'To use the current parlance, it has no issues with pacing or tone, just a rather half baked story filled with competently acted, but woefully underwritten characters. If you can enjoy films like Suspiria for being beautifully polished exploitation films with a touch of class, then you stand a good chance of enjoying The Neon Demon, but then again it might be too classy for what you're expecting (even with a Keanu Reeves performance trashy enough to bring in that sort of interest.) For most people the film is a probably little too extreme, or a little too unsatisfying depending on taste. Unlikely to really wow anyone, but not a bad film. I don't think you have to be pretentious to say you liked it, but I think its pretentious to say that its a great film.",The Neon Demon
399,fyc-49144,Brilliants Observations of Introspection and the Value of Beauty,9,1 January 2017,"Refn is not for the faint of heart, but for those who understand him, he's a genius. If you aren't familiar with his other work, start with Drive and work your way backwards to get a feel for how he communicates messages to the audience. For this film in particular, you need to watch with an intelligent eye. Each scene has a voice that delivers a message. You must interpret each scene to follow Refn's eccentric view of the subject at hand. That's his directing style. The message to be heard from each individual scene in this film is simple, but its implications are profound. Refn examines the envy that fuels same sex attraction in straight people--wanting to become the other person because you subconsciously view them as more valuable than yourself. The average viewer may or may not be able to relate to this without a frame of reference. Story-wise, The Neon Demon starts off a bit slow but eventually picks up with some very entertaining scenes. Keep in mind, this movie is a piece of art to be interpreted. The story doesn't have the same pacing as your average Hollywood film, but it is faster paced than Only God Forgives, Refn's previous film.In short, The Neon Demon is an intelligent film for intelligent people. Anyone expecting an easy watch with family or friends is in for a total disappointment, because what they'll get instead is a convoluted cinematic masterpiece.",The Neon Demon

403,jess-gonzalez,A must watch whether you like it or not...,8,5 August 2016,""" You know how my mother used to call me?  Dangerous"" This is the sentence that will echo in your head after watching ""The Neon Demon"", the latest Nicolas Winding Refn film. Some people hated it and felt that this film was a waste of their time, superficial, vain, not adding anything new, not very well drawn characters, some others loved it and named Winding ""The King of Ultraviolence"", whatever it is, this is not a ""nothing"" film, it will make you feel something, can't predict if good or bad, but will definitely make you feel.Jesse, a wannabe model, moves to the ""City of Angels"" to become the next ""big thing"", but in order to achieve this, she will have to pay the price. (I don't want to go too much into the plot, as otherwise the spoiler alert will be read on each sentence I type).The film is hypnotic, mesmerizing and thought- provoking. The visuals are stunning, every frame, every shot it's obsessively measure, will make you feel as if you were watching a music video. The colour palette goes from blue and violet to white and red contribute to the mood, also helped by Cliff Martinez's soundtrack, Martinez excels here, ""The Demon Dance"" is a fantastic and addictive piece, perfectly suited for the film, we can feel the ""Kubrick's influence"" present in here.While watching the film you get transported into the universe of so many other well-known films, such as ""Mulholland Drive"" , ""Black Swan"" or ""Suspiria"".Is Jesse the pray or the predator? Is beauty subjective to the viewers eyes? What would you do in order to become the next Queen Bee? How long will it take until your crown is taken from you?. This and so many other questions float in the air throughout the film.The best performances are coming from the supporting cast, Elle Fanning's performance lacks strength, charisma and falls flat compare to her contenders (maybe this is done on purpose). Abbey Lee and Bella Heathcote , playing Jesse's rivals are witty, funny and poisonous , Lee has that sort of magnetism and feline demeanour that takes her character to the next level, while Heathcote tenderness and fragility creates that sort of sympathy required. We care more for the ""baddies"" than for the ""good girl"".""Neon Demon"" is not perfect, it is visually as I said, but the ending doesn't make justice to the entire film, leaving a bittersweet taste in your mouth, maybe this is also intended, as this is a vehicle to tell us the story of ""Cinderella at the cannibals ball"".",The Neon Demon
404,isaacridgwell,Beautiful but Vague,8,31 May 2018,"The Neon Demon is simply about a beautiful young country girl moving to a big city, because she thinks she can make it in the modelling industry. Not only is the cinematography on of the greatest I've ever seen, in any movie, but the acting is also amazing. Elle Fanning is great as the lead but the show was stolen by Jena Malone as Ruby. Desmond Harrington and Charles Baker also have amazing scenes. The Neon Demon unravels the inner happenings of the modelling industry and what females in the industry deal with. The main theme throughout the movie is beauty. What natural beauty can get you and actions other people will undertake to achieve that beauty, changing the way they look or ""becoming plastic people"". This is explored well and is an interesting case study into the modelling industry.This deep look into themes puts the character arcs out of focus and it creates a very straightforward reason for all the characters, showing not much emotion or depth. The dialogue is also forgettable. The main negative with this film is all the unnecessary gore and horror. Even though thats the directors signature the movie can be just as powerful without the gore. Refn's love for horror and fetish should not trump the overall quality of the movie.This movie is a visual masterpiece, giving the audience mostly visual storytelling techniques. Some people may not grasp this movie and just find it boring. The Neon Demon is only for people who enjoy arty films or are intelligent enough to grasp the concepts presented.",The Neon Demon

407,paddybass,A neon lit parable of big city poison.,9,25 May 2016,"Nicolas Winding-Refn is a director who defies all analysis. Most considered him a surefire ""Commercial Success"" following on from his exceptional adaptation, Drive back in 2011. However, against all odds Winding-Refn went darker, more subversive and all together more polarising with his 2013 release Only God Forgives.The Neon Demon is sure to be equally divisive. I was lucky enough to attend the red carpet premiere of the film in Cannes and was personally blown away by it's unique style & vision. It's long slider shots demand attention and draw attention to every minute detail on offer. It's use of mirrors encourages the viewer to look beyond the ""real"" world and examine what lies on the other side.Obviously, it goes without saying that this film looks amazing. If nothing else, most of Winding-Refn's supporters or critiques will admit that his films aesthetics are always incredible. However, despite the muted dialogues and slow pacing, the film gripped me for its full 110 minute run time. This was because, although the movie is a ""horror"", it's so much more. It's an examination of the human obsession with beauty.Elle Fanning does a remarkable turn as Jesse - a young runaway, trying to make it big in Los Angeles. Her beauty is so powerful that things begin to work to her favour almost immediately on her arrival. More over than that, her beauty seems to encapsulate and draw in those around her, while repelling her peers who scathe her. Her natural beauty is something that all the plastic surgery in LA can't generate.Jena Malone steals the film as Ruby - a make up artist who befriends Jesse as soon as she arrives in the town. She also introduces Jesse to the vacuous and vindictive pair of models played by Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee. If you haven't guessed already this is a film with a real focus on females. Although there are a handful of male characters (Dexters Desmon Harrington does an incredible turn as a high power fashion photographer), the focus here is all feminine. Even down to the decision to bring in a female DOP to shoot the film.There are too many twists and turns to get into here, but all I can say is that this could be Winding-Refn's most powerful movie to date. It's an analysis on the human condition and our obsession with natural beauty. It claws and scratches at our preconceptions and breaks us down, revealing the gooey centre; what makes us tick. Stellar performances, amazing visuals, a banging score and a unique storyline will cement this as a cult classic - of this I am sure.I cannot wait for the theatrical release if only to have more time to soak in the films dreamy visuals, take in more of the films subtexts and once again be blown away by the force of nature that is NWR.",The Neon Demon

It has always made me sad that many young ladies endure so much pain to obtain the look of a supermodel.. As a man that used to train both male & female athletes, and studied anatomy i can tell you this look is not only unhealthy, but it is also not realistic. Yes we love a nice chin, neckline, supple breast, and the way the curve of the back descends into the buttocks. The look of these Women come from constant starvation & very important nutritional deprivation. The ironic thing is that it is always some average looking person that somehow posesses God like powers to set the standards for beauty. The movies uses great colors for references and really sheds some light on the superficial aspects of modeling and all the hatred and jealousy that it involves. Young ladies need to understand that true beauty is not on the front of the superficial magazine covers, it is being the best you that you can be. Have a healthy food plan, workout with, weights, cardio, yoga, etc. Never deprive yourself of proper nutrition & you will be the best you possible & beautiful.

Boring, slow, and eminently forgettable. Chekov's gun lying all over the floor, unshot. We sympathize with Elle Fanning until we don't. Keanu Reeves seems to have been in a more interesting movie, but these were the outtakes for that movie and they just crammed them in here to add a big name. He's irrelevant to the story. Jena Malone is given little to do but be weird and a little offputting. We learn more late in the movie, but in a very ""what's the wackiest thing I can get Jena Malone to do on camera?"" sort of way, not by means of anything grounded in the character.
Bella Heathcote and the one who isn't Bella Heathcote are fine, if interchangeable, which I suppose is part of the point.
The fashion industry in the movie is run exactly the way that you would expect the fashion industry of Tupelo, MS to be run. 1 agent, 3 models, 1 photographer, 1 makeup artist (who doubles as the makeup artist at the local mortuary in her free time).

It leaves you thinking what the heck did I just watch. Most scenes were very awkward and hard to watch. I didn't understand most of it, like the party at the beginning. What was the lure of that? Was it just for the flashing lights? Idk, but it was weird. Moving on, the fashion show when she changes personality... what was that? More flashing lights, her kissing her reflection, and triangles. Still lost at this point.

She wakes up on the floor for whatever reason, and he try's to break in. There is a pretty heartbreaking scene of him going to rape the 13 year old in the next room, where all you can hear is her fighting him and crying, and all you see is Jessie putting her ear to the wall and listening. But hey, no need to call the cops, just call ruby. Next we go to Ruby's, ruby try's to have sex with her and she says no and pushes her off the bed. Ruby snaps, draws a weird face on a mirror, then goes and has sex with a corpse while the scene flashes back to Jessie rubbing her hands all over her body. Didn't get the correlation there. Then ruby, thing one and thing 2 kill and eat Jessie, bathe in her blood, and that's the end of the main character. Ruby then lies on the ground naked in the house, in-front of a window( and moon), and she either pees everywhere, or a ton of blood comes out of her. No explanation, nothing more to it, that's it from her. Then thing one and thing 2 go to a photo shoot, one pukes an eye and blood, then stabs herself in the stomach to get Jessie out.

Danish writer and director Nicolas Winding Refn presents us a first layer of clichés that underneath - as we get tangled in the story - opposes itself with anticlichés. However, the transition from mundane to absurd seems a bit rough as if Refn never found out how to achieve a fitting end that at the same time is relevant and makes us reflect on the passing two hours.I would prefer something simpler and less daring with the great film visuals and sound being the cherry on top of itself with the narrative just comfortably melted on these kinky dessert.Drive (2011) continues to be Refn at his best and this is more a Only God Forgives type of movie.Just a final thumbs up to the danish for, again, being able to work with a great cast with the best performance coming from Christina Hendricks.",The Neon Demon

426,ace-spadez,A polarizing film,7,11 December 2016,"The Neon Demon like most other films by Nicolas Winding Refn is bound to divide audiences acutely. Apart from ""Drive"", most every film he's done has his hallmark style, tone and pacing etched deeply within it. Which is why ""Drive"" appealed to so many more people. That's not to say his other films are any less enjoyable if you're one of the people who fall into the camp that enjoy his films. The Neon Demon is no different, if you're a Refn fan, you're probably going to enjoy this too.The story is as simple as a young girl, Jesse (Fanning), arrives in a big city trying to make it in the fashion industry. She befriends a make up artist (Malone) who introduces her to other models (Heathcote, Lee). Much of the story centers around how Jesse navigates the very slippery slopes of the fashion industry and the affect it has on her personality as she gains more traction. The story is paced quite slow, but rest assured it's actually faster paced than other Refn films. Line delivery is slow, sometimes painfully slow. Moments linger, sometimes for no reason and feels dragged. Whilst not much happens in terms of plot points, the movie allows time for the audience to feel a real unease and creates tension in ways that are unconventional.Fanning is absolutely spot on with her character. She played the role with such subtly but with much poise when required. How she looked and her presence on screen really reflected why certain characters felt and acted certain ways towards her. The perfect storm of innocence, beauty and poison. There were a few characters that I thought had fairly insignificant roles and really didn't have much place in the film other than as plot devices. Keanu Reeves character for example. He played the motel landlord and apart from one really obvious setup he was totally dismiss-able. Jena Malone was probably one of the most interesting characters. In the 2nd and third act you really get a sense of who she is.The whole look of the film is just superb. It's honestly Refn's strongest point in all his films. Natasha Braier, a name I'm not familiar with in the cinematography world, did an amazing job bringing the look together. It feels like a Refn's last film, Only God Forgives, with the deep shadows, the vibrant colors, the clinical framing, and the clean camera moves.Did I enjoy the movie? I certainly did. It's by no means a perfect movie, and by no stretch Refn's best or worst. But for me it's so refreshing to watch a movie so unbounded by convention and rules. Is it borderline art house? Yes. Painfully slow in sometimes, but other times rewards audiences for their patience. Clinical and cold, but so appropriate for the subject it deals with and the tone it's delivering. Will you enjoy this movie? Well that depends on your tastes. If you've seen Refn's past works and hated it, then don't be surprised if you hate this. If you've enjoyed his past works (excluding Drive), then you will likely enjoy this.",The Neon Demon
427,andreah49,Repulsive,1,11 August 2017,"How anyone can review this film with any other judgment than repulsion is beyond my understanding. I came here expecting to see the creators of this monstrosity dragged through the mud, but no, only a bunch of kool aid chugging zombies evidently disappointed that this demented, gruesome heap of trash has nothing intellectual to draw from. Well, who could have guessed? Hopefully somewhere beyond the first few pages of these reviews there will be a comment lamenting my thoughts which I will state here. First, In my opinion, tolerating this type of filth is an indication that the west has fallen to piteous lows. Something is seriously wrong with the minds of our society! A normal, healthy person should not feel remotely comfortable in watching a film fashionably portraying necrophilia, pedophilia, murder, and cannibalism. But then again, this imagery often attacks us in television, film, magazines, and music videos anyhow. I have zero plans on watching this movie, and came here solely to leave the comment I didn't see on any reviews so far. Even worse than the fact that this film was produced, is that there are automaton drones out there who watch something like this but think, ""It had no depth, it was only pretty lights and costumes, it had no critiques or commentary on the fashion industry and no grand revelation"". Is there any artistic merit to the brutalization of humanity? Of teenage girls? What kind of a demented person expects to find enlightenment or even entertainment in this material? Here. I will explain to you, in short terms, one of the many meanings behind neon demon, many of which are too detailed to describe here: to subvert the morals of society and brainwash the youth into adopting unbridled hedonistic, hellish behavior. They want humans to have no regard for each other, no understanding of empathy, no compassion, no intolerance for the worst types of degenerate behavior, which the devils in Hollywood/the most influential pockets of humanity readily participate in themselves. And they want you, the adult, to welcome it in open arms under the guise of ""art"". If you can't see that, it's no wonder you're grasping at straws trying to find any semblance of ""meaning"" in a film showing a woman molesting a dead body. SEEK HELP if you expect to find art in any such display.One day (and dozens of cultures like this have existed throughout human history, make NO mistake) we will wake up in a country whose youth thinks nothing of murder, beastiality, pedophilia, cannibalism, rape, intense physical abuse, etc, and you'll wonder how we got there.",The Neon Demon

The beauty representing itself in the perfectly crafted frames stitched by the perfect soundtrack (Refn's Signature). Already shown his cinematic brilliance in Only God Forgives may fail to give audience what they were expecting but did not fail someone expecting an experience but with Neon Demon he surpassed himself from his last film, the way the movie unfolds as a simple representation of the fashion world and end up being a one grotesque adventure that does not fail to surprise as it is the fashion world we are talking about.

It captured some of the horror that makes us uneasy, but we fail to acknowledge on a daily basis.The setting for this movie is the modeling industry, where participants schmooze with the powerful hoping to find their break. Without spoiling too much, I'll just summarize by saying the industry is shown to be competitive, cutthroat, and superficial. One fashion designer tells a model that ""true beauty is the highest currency in this world."" He even points out the hypocrisy of an amateur photographer who disagrees. Though all the girls are beautiful, the main character quickly rises to the top. Though she initially stated she had no talent, she later admits that she knows other girls wish they could one day be a second-rate version of her.The ending is by far the best part. After the models eat their ""friend,"" Gigi starts to feel queezy, ultimately throwing up an eyeball and stabbing herself to death.

At the start I thought the scenes are meant to allow the viewer to think a bit rather than being bombarded with the ideas. That would have worked if there was at least a bit more material in the first place. You struggle with the movie at the start and you're eager to see what this all about but you're gonna only be disappointed. Partially because the movie allowed you to think a bit with those boring scenes.

During one, lengthy, unnecessary scene, a lead character appears to vomit up an eyeball. My biggest regret was that it wasn't my own eyeball. The film has around 3 locations in which it is set, all of which are filmed in silence, or with dull, bass heavy music as it tries to match the edgi-ness of 'Drive' (it does NOT succeed.)I genuinely think that the screenplay could have been written within an hour.. by a child. Unfortunately, the lowest rating I could give was a 1. Which I must say, is generous. Don't be fooled by the appearance of Keanu Reeves, it seems he was hired to simply boost the advertising for the project. He appears around twice and only manages to mutter a few lines before jamming his knife in Elle Fanning's mouth. Which, (obviously) made no sense and had no relevance to the shambles of a storyline.If you're wanting to see all of the action, watch the last 10 minutes. I can assure you that you won't need to watch the first hour and fifty minutes. It probably won't make sense anyway. Anyhow, the cinematography was good. Or should I say photography? The film is slow. So, extraordinarily slow. If it was filmed at a normal pace, and all the lines were spoken together, you'd barely have enough footage to compile a movie trailer.

As it is, I'm not sure if I missed something, but the whole scene of Elle with the mirrors and the neon triangles felt *way* too long, and somewhat meaningless.The fact that everyone was just... dazzled as soon as she walked into a room ended up being unbelievable fifteen minutes into the movie, so the longer they went on with that idea, the funnier it seemed to me, which I think was not the way they meant for me to feel about it.All in all, I think the only things I liked about this movie were: - Keanu behaving like an a**hole, but that might be just because he reminded me of his role in John Wick for some reason (I'm fond of the guy, so sue me), - And Sarah at the end of the movie, that was a nice twist right there.",The Neon Demon

439,marshallhiatt,"Lights, Music and the Shitshow",6,3 July 2016,"My rating: Visual: 9/10 Audio: 10/10 Story: 5/10God, there is so much to say about this movie. Firstly, it is not a perfect film. It is far from perfect. But damn was it a good experience. I assume watching this high would be great. Very similar to 2001 A Space Odyssey.The first half of this film deals with the stressful and exciting life of a small-town girl who has moved to Los Angeles at the age of 16 to pursue a life in modeling. No family, she fills her social void with a few acquaintances from her primary photo-shoot. She applies to a modeling agency and they think she's perfect. Everybody thinks she's perfect.That's what this whole story is about. The new girl from town who is perfect in appearance and grace, and how vulnerable she is to the world and influences as she weighs her friendships and competes in the modeling industry.This first half I mentioned has every making of a perfect film. It's got a strong, developing protagonist. It's got antagonists and great rising action. It's got lights and music and it's gorgeous and sexy and brilliant honestly.AND THEN IT IS RUINED. The story and the director go off the deep end, every bit of development so far is ruined. The story flips angles, great characters are ignored or abandoned, and the movie loses the visual stimulation/music and modeling theme which carried such a huge weight and built all tension.By the end of the movie I was laughing ironically at the terrible lines, the disgusting and unexpected visuals and sexual content and gore. I found myself in pain at how my beautiful characters I had grown to love weren't behaving like themselves. Not that they had grown to that point, but that they simply didn't fit in this story. Ruined. Absolutely ruined the latter half of the film.Go see the movie if you like weird movies and can handle graphic (and I really mean graphic) scenes. And please, by all means watch this film intoxicated because it really ins't worth your sober time.This movie will become a cult classic for me but I'll stock up on rum before I watch it next.",The Neon Demon

441,zooeyalakia,A neon dystopian nightmare you must NOT see,4,10 May 2017,"""Remember, girls, no matter what happenskeep your eyes closed. And you men take a good look"" is one of the lines that haunts Danish writer/director Nicolas Winding Refn's dream like midnight movie ""Only God Forgives"". That line could just as easily be the main interpretation for Refn's latest abysmally sinister perturbation ""The Neon Demon"". Like ""Only God Forgives"", ""The Neon Demon"" follows in the footsteps of the lead protagonist Jesse (Elle Fanning) who is torturously being consumed by her dreams. This innocent, neophyte fashion model unfolds the story of a 16-year-old girl who visits Los Angeles intending to become a promiscuous super model in a world mainly ruled by a poker-faced agent Roberta Hoffman (Christina Hendricks), an emotionally unstable make-up artist Ruby (Jena Malone), stereotypical anorexic models like Gigi (Bella Heathcote), known for her ""vampiric"" relations with Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's film ""Dark Shadows"" and a seedy motel owner Hank (Keanu Reeves). The question hidden under this neon reverie of such sheer satanic rapture is not about how ""The Neon Demon"" shows its ballet of envy, necrophilia, erotic obsession and cannibalism whereas how does this worthless meretricious world represents only just a cinematic superficiality. Refn's captivation through a vortex of tedious one-shot scenes is constantly attempting to reveal a futuristic and astonishing society which in fact has nothing to state. Welcome to a fake world where scenes are a cheap imitation of ""Melancholia"", the melodic masterpiece Lars von Trier launched to cinema and ""Death Becomes Her"", an ingenious delirium Robert Zemeckis has invented. Not to mention that the scenes in which Jesse appears in a visionary night club looks vaguely like a combination of ""Tron"" and ""Under the skin"". How does pure imitation even make this film a must watch movie of the year? The answer is simple. The ""Neon Demon"" is a neon dystopian nightmare unable to trigger audience's attention as the more you get into the notion of the film the less interesting it becomes. Anyone could claim that critical offence can all too easily be taken at a piece of preening auteur cinema that sets out shock especially when on its first screening at Cannes, people were leaving screaming. On the other hand, anyone could agree to the fact that when a film features more thought provoking ideas, the audience can handle the shocking notion the film represents. Having said that, ""The Neon Demon"" struggles to present a productive script, co- written with the playwrights Mary Laws and Polly Stenham, which in fact is stuffed with gaps that ultimately transmutes its satisfying character into a preposterous one. Gaps which unfortunately reflect the issue of quality in several moments of memorable scenes. If all this sounds like an attack on culture that is obsessed with the way people look, it isn't. Refn never intended to satirize the fashion world or more specifically the modeling world so much. Instead he tried to deal with a more disfigured view of it in a way this stomach-churning world seems boring. Beyond the valleys of offensive criticism, the Danish director through his filmography (Drive, Only God Forgives, Bronson) has shown a dynamic character in terms of his own style. He puts his signature into films which looked like predators that reflect two mindsets: Either you constantly plumb your id or you just exist as a passive narrative. Both ways seem to end up debatable but at the same time productively brash. And therein lies the key. Refn may have succumbed to his most unabashed urges but in fact he overgeneralized the issue through a narcissist's eyes. Yet soon, this film can be compared to as a surface modernity both for its inner construction and its outside corruptible beauty. Before I run out of words, ""The Neon Demon"" is not just a bad movie led by a remarkable writer/director/creator of the neon world but is just a movie at the right place in the wrong time. Refn has invented a surficial movie for surficial characters who are not able to ""digest"" reality. In this case, ""The Neon Demon"" is a nightmare you must NOT watch if you think yourself as a doubter.",The Neon Demon
442,juliannedv,The cinematography just can't make up for the rest of the film...,2,6 July 2016,"I watched this primarily because the cinematography did look visually stunning and creative, giving that the trailer didn't show much about the film. Unfortunately, right from the start there was no visible plot. Granted, I actually do enjoy plot less films, but the dialogue and acting have to really make up for it, and in this case neither did. The script is unbearable. I'm not sure what Refn was aiming at, message wise, or if he was making a statement about the fashion industry overall. It was somewhat unsettling to have a male directly with nearly an all female cast trying to say something about women in this industry and society overall. I understand excessive gore but the blood and antics in here really had no significance. As usual, it was disappointing to see a film like this use lesbian sex scenes purely for ""artistic"" purposes. There was unnecessary fetishization and misrepresentation as a whole. It was a shame that Elle Fanning was in this because I can see she has talent. 2/10 with an extra point for the cinematography.",The Neon Demon
443,Hanae0814,more of like a sensual and visual experience,7,19 January 2017,"I finally watched ""Neon Demon"", which I couldn't get a ticket to watch at Tokyo International Film Festival. I recommend you watch this film on a big screen and with audio equipment at a movie theater. It's more of like a sensuous and visual experience than following an elaborated story with many lines. I don't intend to deny adaptations of novels or manga, but I really like this kind of film which must take a form of a film because there have been too many films which derive from the original works recently and I want filmmakers to create their own original works. ""Neon Demon"" is about women in the fashion industry who are obsessed with beauty. If I'm asked what kind of film it is, adjectives such as scary, dark, grotesque would come to mind, but at the same time it's a film about a sad state of those who can no longer live in other ways than being crazy. I almost cried at the end of the film which is quite intense while being overwhelmed by a visual shock. Sia's ""Waving Goodbye"" played for the end credits is good. It matches the film and I got a feeling which slowly spread pains in my heart.",The Neon Demon
444,leonardbenjamin,"If you think there's no substance, look closer",8,26 June 2016,"Typically, I prefer to go into watching films knowing as little as possible. I managed to achieve that as I shuffled in to see The Neon Demon early this morning. All I really knew were the names that made up the cast and crew.I've been conflicted over Nicholas Winding Refn for a while. He makes visually stunning films, but I often find the stories lacking in substance. Additionally, in interviews he comes off (possibly intentionally) as a misogynistic and pompous ass that I'd like to punch in the face.So, as we entered the hell-hole that is one of the smallest and shittiest screens at the UA Riverview Plaza Stadium 17 to see Refn's take on women, LA and the modeling industry, I wasn't expecting much.Boy was I wrong. The film WAS visually stunning as I've come to expect, but there was so much more. This was a tale of the occult/supernatural (witches?) and Dario Argento's Suspiria was clearly an influence.Instead of the misogyny portrayed in the media interviews and I thought I would see on the screen, the film actually showed that, yes while women can be terrible to each other, society as a whole is to blame for our obsession with and sexualizing of young women. There are innumerable metaphors that I would love to discuss, but I hate giving out spoilers.I now feel the need to go back and give Only God Forgives a second chance.

A lot of the hate seems a little childish and snobbery. I love Nicolas Winding Refn movies, this one is now my favourite.For a start the visuals and sound are sublime. I think most of the dialogue and acting is deliberately basic as it's taking a dig at the shallow world of modelling in LA.If you like dark, stylish and twisted films check this out. Cliff Martinez is also a master of electronic scores.The plot is straightforward but if you wish, there are plenty of hidden meanings to mull over. An innocent young girl is potentially destined to be a star model but to make it can she see the dangers and obstacles in her way ... ?It's a slow burner, building tension to an unforgettable climax and the constant background music is so good it never feels like it drags.Rarely do I watch a film more than once, I've seen this 3 times in a week already!Refn explained in a conference the main point is beauty, power and reaction.

447,Ibrahim-Mehrzai,A visual feast but took too long for dessert.,6,19 April 2017,"Nicolas Wining Refn manages to bring all the qualities he's known for into this film, but that's not necessarily a good thing. To cut to the chase, The Neon Demon is about the struggles of both high fashion modeling and teenage runaways. Although, I doubt that's what the film is entirely about as it has a lot of deep symbolical meaning. The opening is unique and Refn makes another great opening. Now to get more analytical. A) Acting: Elle Fanning looks and sounds perfect for the part but I couldn't help but sigh every time she talked. She was so monotone and bland but pretty much all the characters are like that. Maybe its just Refn films as Drive and Only God Forgives also had some very monotone dialogue. Jenna Malone did better than most, witch a somewhat creepy aura yet a kindhearted soul at the same time. Reeves was a real show stealer as he make you forget that he is Reeves for most of the film. You start to despise him and his gruffy look really matched the film. As for the rest, well mediocre at best but a lot were models to be fair. B) Writing: At first the movie moves on pretty well with an intriguing opening and some pretty shots but ultimately it starts to spiral out of control. It maintains it's order until the scene where someone, Keanu Reeve's somewhat implied, is raping someone next to Fanning's room. Refn threw in a romance between Malone and Fanning which seem irrelevant and then all of a sudden Fanning's character goes from humble to an egotistical prick. Now I've heard that Refn shot this in chronological order and improvised the ending. Very few directors can pull off improvising, like Terrance Malick or Robert Altman, and it is quite obvious that it was indeed improvised. The film was indeed psychological but instead it spirals to a sudden gory and chaotic thriller(?). The ending was just the cherry on top. I couldn't think what was more weird, her throwing up an eye or her friend just scoffing and walking away. The Neon Demon isn't terrible it just starts to deteriorate at the end. If you're a fan of Refn or love visually stunning films, this is definitely worth a watch.",The Neon Demon

I love Drive. I love those silent moments and slow motions. Because they meant something. They were elegant, meaningful and beautiful. They brought artistic sensations that not every movie can do. And when I watched this work of Nicolas Winding Refn, I felt very very angry. It's very amateur. The dialogues were bad. The actors were bad. Elle Fanning in this movie is a disaster. Frankly, she's not for this kind of movie. She's for PG-13 - family friendly. When I saw her and the cast, I paused the movie to look at the director's name again. I couldn't believe that Refn didn't do more to have a better cast, at least as good as the Drive's cast. The script has problems - big problems. However, good filming angles and nice colors contrast saved the day. They gave me more patience to pull through this, with hopes that the movie could get better. But nope, all I still remember now is nothing but nice neon colors. To my opinion, this movie it's not worth watching at all.",The Neon Demon
449,azorianjoey-66773,The thin line between experimental and masterclass,7,24 June 2016,"The Neon Demon (2016) - When Nicholas Winding Refn's Drive (2011) came out I was instantly a fan. There is just something about the way he can direct his characters and almost immediately set the tone. He grabs the audience and makes them realize the brilliance of his work. Walking into this movie I thought there is no way that this movie could be better than Drive, I was wrong. And yes, I'm aware that they are two completely different movies, Drive is brilliant and beautiful in its own way. But The Neon Demon brought Refn from an up-and-coming director to one of the greats. I would compare this to Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (1971) and Cronenberg's Videodrome (1983). Now, What is so good about The Neon Demon? We can start with the cinematography. The entire film is eye candy whether its the beautiful use of darkness and light or the constant vibrant colors the help tell the story believe it or not, It's all very inventive. Refn's directing is top notch. Most of the character development and plot lines are told through visuals and physical movement, Refn is one of the best directors working today when it comes to this.There wasn't one error with any actor/actress. Talk about a flawless cast, I can't see anybody else in these roles. But, the spotlight goes to three... Ellie Fanning, Jena Malone, and the one and only keanu Reeves. This movie isn't for everybody, especially the squeamish. But, for those of you who can get past some disturbing imagery and are able to follow a visual storyline, you'll find an important theme that is relevant in our time period. I give it a 10/10.

452,anhtruongta,A great film but... TOO many scenes have been cut,10,4 August 2016,"Only after i have seen Drive,I decided to watch 'The Neon Demon'. The director have shown subtly conveyed the image being put glowing triangles of Jesse bottom stage, symbolizing the desire for power, but she gradually towards. Or as Jesse met modeling scene in discos, play intense music to sound like heart beat, together with red flashing lights to signal the danger awaits available at the people she is facing. Throughout the film, each scene has a contrasting tones and the unique light, sending fully express artistic intentions of the director of the upcoming events that the characters face.Images and sounds are also a significant plus point for The Neon Demon, making the movie became a sumptuous feast of lights, costumes and sound. Beautiful costumes and picky, accompanying scenes meticulously arranged, all supported by strong soundtrack and emotional Cliff Martinez is one of the most distinctive impression that the film brings.But.. as i said too many scenes have been cut in my theater so:It's hard for me too understood all the story Nicholas Winding Refn want to say . The atmosphere of tension and the height that the movie tried to built in the first half has not been meet and solve a knot. The story in the second half seemed to not eat so much input with content is built very well in the first half of the film.However, it should be seen as The Neon Demon was quite successful in telling a horror story that doesn't need ""jump scare"" or ghost.

453,wastethedayinc,"The worst movie I have ever seen, by far - SPOILER ALERT (for a film that is already spoiled)",1,26 June 2016,"I loved the movie Drive. This is not Drive. Here's why:1. This movie is visually very weak. Don't get me wrong, I understand this aesthetic. But that is because it is totally played out. I heard NWR say that he got the idea for Only God Forgives from the mental image of a clenched fist. I would say for this one he got the idea from old Maybelline commercials, the 2006 Daft Punk alive tour and some old Mert & Marcus editorials. It looks cheap, dated and badly executed. The soundtrack is the same. It worked for Drive because that electro revival of Moroder in 2001 is the perfect driving music, but now it just feels tacky. Save your money and just walk into any Sephora store.2. This movie is not ""crazy"" or ""dark"". Every ""surreal"" moment is predictable and cliché. Watch Un Chien Andalou and then got to Burning Man festival and you'll have all the inspiration you will need for a sequel. Claire Denis' Trouble Every Day makes use of the same clichés but the difference is that NWR thinks he is the first one to think of them. 3. This movie is not a ""critique"". This doesn't reveal the truth of anything except a made- up idea of the fashion world. Who told NWR that modeling make-up always involves putting a bunch of junk on the girls faces? Who told him that the center of the modeling world is LA and not New York? That Elle Fanning, who is short and pudgy, is somehow meant to be believable as a more desirable model than Abbey Lee Kershaw? If she is so good why does the camera cut away every time she is meant to strike a pose or walk a catwalk? Abbey Lee says at one point that by the time you are 20 your past your expiry date. She is 29 and had a major Calvin Klein campaign earlier this year. 4. The story sucks (because NWR ""wrote"" it, unlike Drive). The story is basically Black Swan. Think pseudo-lesbian jealousy corrupting a young hopeful in a competitive industry. But then add a few dozen plot holes. This girl is the modeling worlds' new It Girl and yet she can't afford a motel that isn't rape-infested? Or ever go to a hospital? You can successfully bury a girl in a six inch grave in a perfectly manicured garden in a house that isn't yours? And why are there only about 6 people in the whole movie? Parties, nightclub toilets, restaurants photo shoots and the backstage of runway shows usually have dozens of people around, not three. Especially not the same three every time.The acting is pretty lousy but who cares at this point. I'm sure most fans will think that dislike for this film comes from its dark, confronting, disturbing portrayal of our superficial society. It doesn't. It comes from wanting to watch something other than an old loser irk himself off for 2 hours to a 2001 copy of Vogue magazine.",The Neon Demon

There weren't more than 6 people with me.Despite having amazing visuals and great music, the movie seemed like a lack luster to me. In the first half the movie seemed to build tension, just to result in an anticlimax.These anticlimaxes happened roughly three times for me, including the ending. Refn is known for having shocking scenes in his movies, but this one lacked in this department.The movie seemed to lean on just the shock element, which made it rather disappointing for me.I will however watch it again to make sure. I do recommend a true Refn fan to watch it though.",The Neon Demon
456,mittendane,"Uncanny, and Thought Provoking",10,3 September 2016,"When watching this film, remember that film is art, and art does not need to be formulaic, and it does not have to fit into a pre-defined category. The Neon Demon takes the viewer on a ride through the edgy emotions of human experience, in a world we are all too familiar with. The vivid imagery leaves the audience wondering if something supernatural is at play, but also draws out the worst emotions in us all. Those that make you question who you are, and why. A deep seated fear is awakened, a fear of inadequacy, a fear of self loathing, that grips the body as much as the mind. Some will be turned off by the clear deviation from typical plot formation and character development, but they are missing the true art that this film is. Watch it with an open mind, and try to feel it.",The Neon Demon
457,steenhannah,what the heck did I watch?,7,8 October 2016,"I was interested in the movie cause I really liked the main girl in this movie and I picked up this movie at a family video and the worker there said it was weird. I like weird movies but this was really weird. The whole time as I was watching this I was so confused and the music was very weird. I thought it was entertaining but very weird. It wasn't all that scary but there were some parts that could be. When it was over i wanted more. it felt really slow and all the messed up parts are kind of towards the end. But if you are thinking about watching this movie try to pay attention I still don't really get it. I gave it a 7 because I love the main character she's a great actress and pretty. It also is very artsy. And I am sure the modeling industry is similar to this just not so messed up. But I do recommend this just don't get your hopes up to much, I was a little disappointed.",The Neon Demon
458,tinman-71042,The unintended couple of laughs are not worth it,1,26 May 2018,"It's an accidental comedy in one or two scenes. 
Nothing artful about it at all. Not even really visually stunning like some claim.
It's about as visually stunning as a cotton candy bloated dizzy carnival nightmare.
Yea, I'm pretty sure this is the worst movie I've seen in a good long time.",The Neon Demon
459,wynfyd,"Self indulgent, shallow 1 dimensional film.",1,22 November 2016,"This film started out promising but after 20 minutes showed sign of regressing and it never recovers. There is no story, no worthwhile characters and no point. It's too late for me but you can still save yourself! I was really hoping it would be more because some of the scenes are beautifully shot, the actors are beautiful and the soundtrack is good. But call me old fashioned but I like film with a plot, a point, a story and characters who we come to know, and this film as none of those. Avoid like the plague! I think the writer/director was on a mission to shock and forgot to make a film in the process.",The Neon Demon
460,sweetcin-20929,Seriously???,1,7 October 2016,"I cannot believe this movie had some really great actors but was so terrible. To be honest terrible doesn't even begin to describe how BAD this movie was. The acting was terrible. There was NO plot. Nothing made any sense. This is two hours of my life I will never get back. I am only writing more because in order to post how horrible this movie is we need to have 10 lines here. This movie was deplorable. The music seemed like it was from the 80's and the entire film seemed to be ""old School"" rather than modern or up to date. Don't be fooled by the 6.5 star rating. This movie was beyond horrific and not in a good horror film type of way.",The Neon Demon
461,markveruca,Mince,1,20 November 2019,"This movie is a lot of mince, thank god for fast forward buttons. I take it Keanu Reeves has retired from acting, well he didn't do any in this lot of rubbish.",The Neon Demon
462,aaronrusso-59726,"A damn masterpiece, thats really not for everyone",10,7 November 2016,"I went into the neon demon with no real expectations, I liked drive and only god forgives which has grown on me a lot, so i thought why not it looks interesting enough. What I wasn't expecting the best use and beautiful execution of visual storytelling i have ever seen in a movie, a soundtrack that is, put simply, gobsmackingly perfect, tied all together with masterful directing. Im convinced this movie could have been made with no dialouge and you'd still understand it all, i believe Refn once said ""if you can show it don't say it"" and oh boy is that executed well here. Every pause before a line perfectly builds suspense, every reaction and gaze perfectly communicated and my gosh when was the last time you said ""the use of lighting and colours here is incredible""? Can i say this movie is for everyone? Absolutely not. It gets dark, really dark, to the extent that im sure some people would leave the cinema in awe of whats happening. It gets weird, really weird. Don't see it if your even a little bit epileptic because pulsating electronic music cut beautifully to strobing neon visuals is done beautifully but may be uncomfortable for some. Its not an easy watch, its not for the faint of heart but il be damned if this movie doesn't raise the bar for me as to what a movie can do and how it can be told. An utter psychedelic masterpiece, thats not for everyone.",The Neon Demon
463,redmanever,This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Period.,1,24 November 2016,"I paid nothing to watch this movie yet still feel like I want my money back after seeing it. It has to be the most pointless, boring movie I have ever had the displeasure of viewing. I kept waiting for something,but that something never came. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time.This Movie Is Really BadI made this account specifically to write this review. That's how bad it is. I felt the need to warn other people, so that they would not suffer the same fate as me.You have been warned!",The Neon Demon
464,anticlimatic_neutral,Visually stunning but poor plot,6,18 January 2017,"This movie looks and sounds great but other than that it doesn't really have much. I've watched Refn's other work (like Drive and Bronson) and was really disappointed with this one.I think that this movie just wanted to feel edgy. It was a psychological thriller, yes, but I've watched other thrillers and they never left me with these many questions. So many metaphors and hints of symbolism were spread all over the film but it was never revealed what they meant. I understand that most of the film can be left up to interpretation by the viewers but how are we suppose to fill in so many plot holes?As you would expect from a movie called 'The Neon Demon' the visuals are stunning. The bright neon color palette against the dark gruesome environment makes the movie worth watching. The soundtrack is also compelling with its somber tone that really captures the tension that the film tries to give out.Refn applies themes on beauty and narcissism and envy. Viewers can see the emotions that these characters present and understand why they behave the way they do. It's practically an R-rated version of 'Mean Girls'.It was refreshing to see Elle Fanning in a more darker serious film and I'm looking forward to seeing more. Refn has produced great work but I was not satisfied by 'The Neon Demon'.",The Neon Demon
465,michellevine,What a load of ****,1,22 September 2018,"Slow, boring, with a nothing ending. I read reviews saying this movie was disturbing. The most disturbing part was the slooooooow storyline with lots of pointless scenes. Wish I'd picked a different movie! Waste of 2 hours of my life!",The Neon Demon
466,colincampbell-00737,not very great,1,26 January 2017,"It were to seem that this writer and director tried so hard for this awful piece of film to be made. It was tired and drab....so much for trying so hard with visual imagery and eerie long drawn out scenes leading to a sense of the director really trying to show how ""edgy"" and ""Artsy"" he or she is. I want my money back...I want my time back......Unless this is some LA Film School senior project....and even then this film is truly rubbish. The sense of the film was different but it was to seem so contrived and it really showed us a desperate writer and director trying to flex their muscle within their own artistic universe. Simply because you have had success with another film, and you have signed actual A list actors does not mean cinematic Gold. My nephew who is now turning 4 told me a much deeper story today about a dog and his boy. A shame to be out character developed by a 4 year old.",The Neon Demon
467,futs-79610,A waste of time and one of the worst movies i've ever seen.,1,26 January 2017,"I really can't believe how many sites list this as one of the top horror movies of 2016. You have to wait approximately 90 minutes for something to happen, then they throw in, statutory rape, necrophilia, and cannibalism. The scenes take forever to get to the point, the visuals even though at times were captivating, doesn't make up for the complete lack of story and any real depth for the characters. This movie made me angry that I watched it. I can count on one hand how many times that has happened. I'm very tolerant and patient and I almost lost my s#$% at the end of this disaster. Please, for the love of cod, do not watch this movie!!",The Neon Demon
468,martintod,This film aspires to be dismal,1,24 February 2017,In my entire life have I ever seen such utter rubbish. The film was supposed to be a horror film but have seen more scarier scenes in Scooby do. I have just spent 1hr 56mins of my life watching this amateurish drivel. 1hr and 56 minutes of my life I will never get back. This film had the styling of a 12 yr old trying to emulate the classic film Bladerunner with the synth moody music and failed on a catastrophic level. For anyone to give this film a rating of anything more than a 1 seriously needs to get out more. If you ever think about watching this film with a view to being entertained can I suggest you not bother and try to find a film that is 100x better. Can I suggest a 3hr documentary film on magnolia paint. I am so surprised that excellent actors like Reeves and Fanning actually put their names to this utter tosh. Avoid this film at all cost. Unless you have guests in your home who have outstayed their welcome then in that case bang this film on. They'll be gone in 10 minutes.,The Neon Demon

472,Bronwynlovesmovies,A Neon reflection of Malignant Narcissism,10,25 August 2017,"Contains soilers. In this dark exploration of self-love and identity, the hypnotic glitter of LA LA land mirrors our obsession with youth and beauty. Seduced by the prospect of becoming a supermodel, lured and baited by everyone she meets, young Jesse is oblivious to the dark web of characters who seek to either exploit or destroy her. Rising through the ranks of plastized beauty by virtue of her natural splendor, entranced by her own image, she is slowly consumed by her inflating ego, claiming, ""Women would kill to look like a second-rate version of me."" Visionary sequences magnified by mesmerizing music combined with great acting, a surreal understanding of narcissism and its devouring delusions of grandiosity, The Neon Demon is a soon-to-be cult classic.",The Neon Demon

Because that's what makes for an interesting, engaging film. Personally, I have no idea how anyone can watch this, endure the awful, heavy-handed imagery, which is about as subtle as a sledge hammer, and think they're watching something arty or intelligent. This film so badly wants to be in the same league as Under The Skin, but it's not even playing the same sport. Please, don't waste your time, this film will spend the first hour or so teasing that it might be interesting or that there could be a story to be told, only to absolutely drop off a cliff in terms of quality and resort to really low levels in order to be edgy and provocative.If I could rate lower than a ""1"", I would.",The Neon Demon
