0,TheLittleSongbird,A beautiful debut from Sofia Coppola,9,30 December 2011,"Having loved Lost in Translation, though I had mixed views on Marie Antoinette, I was interested in watching Coppola's debut film. And what a beautiful film it is. I do consider Lost in Translation a marginally better film, but The Virgin Suicides is extremely good.What did I love most about it? Firsly, the gorgeous visuals. The production design is splendid and very evocative and the cinematography captures it perfectly as well as the quiet symbolism. The music by Air has a really pleasant lilt to it and never does it feel out of place with the mood.Kirsten Dunst, in a performance that I feel has only been matched by her performance in Melancholia, is exceptional, and so is that of the cocky(in the film that is) and incredibly handsome Josh Hartnett. Great actors like James Woods, Kathaleen Turner and Danny DeVito also give noteworthy performances.Coppola deserves credit here. She may have been savaged by critics for her performance in Godfather Part III, and I am afraid I am one of those who didn't like it very much, but I love how she bounced back and won me over with a beautifully directed and thoughtfully written film.The Virgin Suicides may be thoughtful and melancholic in tone, but a lot of it is very poignant as well. The story is deliberately glacial in place which added actually to the film's beauty, and is very whimsical, maybe too much in places but overall it was effective.All in all, a beautiful and great film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",The Virgin Suicides
1,SnoopyStyle,ethereal haunted teenage dream,6,22 March 2015,"25 years ago in an affluent Detroit suburb, math teacher Ronald Lisbon (James Woods) and his wife (Kathleen Turner) have five beautiful girls. The neighborhood boys led by Tim Winer are all fascinated by them. The youngest Cecilia (Hanna Hall) tries to kill herself. Psychiatrist Dr. Horniker (Danny DeVito) tells the strict parents to let the girls interact with boys. They throw a party for the girls but Cecilia throws herself out the window impaling on the iron fence spikes. Father Moody (Scott Glenn) tries to comfort the family. Cecilia haunts everybody. Lux Lisbon (Kirsten Dunst) is the most outgoing and catches the eye of hunky Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett). Lux and the sisters Mary (A.J. Cook), Therese (Leslie Hayman) and Bonnie (Chelse Swain) would always hang out together. After a night out, the girls are kept inside with little outside contact.Sofia Coppola brings a floating sad mysterious moodiness to the movie. She creates an unique dreamy vibe. The girls are fascinating but like the neighborhood boys, they remain a mystery throughout the movie to me. They feel like something imaginary that one can't get a hold of. That is very fascinating but after awhile, it's also very tiresome. We are forever outsiders looking in. I love the music, the mood and the style but I still want more.",The Virgin Suicides
2,claudio_carvalho,"Tragic, Morbid and Disturbing Theme Explored with Extreme Sensibility",8,8 March 2006,"In 1974, in Michigan, the lives of a group of teenage boys are affected by the suicide of five girls from the Lisbon family. Cecilia (13) (Hanna Hall), Lux (14) (Kirsten Dunst), Bonnie (15) (Chelse Swain), Mary (16) (A.J. Cook) and Therese (17) (Leslie Hayman) move with their Mathematics teacher father Mr. Lisbon (James Wood) and their possessive housewife mother Mrs. Lisbon (Kathleen Turner) to a calm suburb house. Their beauties attract the attention of a group of boys that meet in the house on the other side to watch the girls. When Cecilia commits suicide, the girls stay at home for a period, returning to school later. When the handsome football player Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett) seduces Lux and spends the night outside with her, Mrs. Lisbon locks the girls at home, leading them to commit massive suicide.The first time I saw this movie was on 15 October 2001, and I was impressed with the magnificent debut of Sofia Coppola as a director. Yesterday I saw ""The Suicide Virgins"" again and I keep my first impression. Sofia Coppola uses the opposite style of her sensationalist father, and explores with extreme sensibility this tragic, morbid and disturbing theme, the suicide of teenagers. The behavior of the American society is subtly criticized, through the condemned action of the press and the lack of attitude from the neighbors and school community, since these agents see and comment the abnormal behavior of the Lisbon family and take no attitude to help the girls. The nostalgic music score, with classics from the 70s, is another plus. With regard to the charismatic team of actors and actresses, their performances are simply stunning. Five years later, it calls the attention the modifications mainly in Josh Hartnett, who I believe was participating of his first important movie: he was a practically unknown teenager, and now is a famous adult actor. Kathleen Turner, from the sexy and gorgeous Matty Walker/Mary Ann Russell of ""Body Heat"" (1981) to this awful Mrs. Lisbon, is also impressive. ""The Suicide Virgins"" is a movie that deserves to be watched many times. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""As Virgens Suicidas"" (""The Suicide Virgins"")",The Virgin Suicides
3,kosmasp,Sisters of ...,8,5 July 2021,"Of what you ask? Well I have not the source novel/book, apparently the movie does not do it entirely justice - on the other hand, most books can or rather are considered better than their adaptations by those familiar with the book long before a movie was made out of it. So there is that to consider too.Having said that, the sisters who seem happy go lucky, reserved and quite sad at different times of the journey we take with them, are hard to describe or put into a box. While the boys who are after them seem more easy and less complex, it is through their eyes we see the story mostly. Which makes sense if you consider the suffocating love the parents dish out to the girls ... especially after an inciting incident. On one hand you may totally understand the parents ... on the other hand you may completely think they are the worst ... and I would not argue against either of your feelings.So it is a thin line this has to walk and achieve us to care enough to catch the full impact of where this is heading ... not that the movie is making a big secret out of it ... it is predictable like that one might say.",The Virgin Suicides
4,lee_eisenberg,suicide queens,7,28 May 2006,"I'm not quite sure how to review ""The Virgin Suicides"". I found it pretty interesting, if warped. Focusing on some sisters kept isolated from society by their parents (James Woods and Kathleen Turner) in 1970s Michigan, the movie sort of makes you feel like your breath got cut off.I wouldn't necessarily call this a great movie, but I didn't consider it a bad movie at all. I'm still trying to figure out whether or not director Sofia Coppola was trying to make a point with it. At this point, we'd probably be more likely to review it in terms of ""Lost in Translation"", but that wouldn't really be fair since this one came first. The cast all does quite well, namely Kirsten Dunst as the main sister (other cast members include Josh Hartnett, Michael Pare, Scott Glenn, Danny DeVito, and even a pre-Anakin Hayden Christensen; Giovanni Ribisi narrates). All in all, I recommend the movie, but be prepared to have your mind blown.",The Virgin Suicides
5,moonspinner55,"""How much can you write about dead trees?""",7,13 November 2001,"A strange, surreal flight-of-fancy of death and love, remembrance and how romanticized our memories become. It's also very funny, tending to mix the black comedy of something like ""Heathers"" with the stifling suburban scenario of ""American Beauty"" (but it's better than both). Kirsten Dunst is fantastic as the foxiest of five golden-toned sisters in the mid-'70s who feel trapped by their parents (a peculiar, but not overly monstrous couple), trapped by their feelings, trapped by time. They can breathe--and live freely--only in their fantasies (and perhaps in death), but do their realities represent a prison? It's the talent of writer-director Sofia Coppola not to push everything over-the-top; she's careful, she leaves the viewer contemplating the characters' motivations and actions. The situation is indeed unexplainable, yet it is in our nature to expect a resolution, to expect concrete evidence as to WHY and demand an answer. Yet there are no answers to the sadness of the strangers who live across the street, even as we pass through their lives and through their houses. ""The Virgin Suicides"" offers fascinating food for thought. *** from ****",The Virgin Suicides
6,BandSAboutMovies,Eh,2,30 May 2020,"This was the directing debut of Sofia Coppola, who also wrote the script, which was based on the novel by Jeffrey Eugenides. It's also the start of the creative relationship between Coppola and Kirsten Dunst.I'd listened to the Air soundtrack numerous times, but never watched the movie. Thanks to quarantine, I've given in to my wife's movie picks, which is how just about every movie this week has ended up on the site.In the late 70's, specifically in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, the Lisbon sisters rules the hearts and minds of teenage boys. These unapproachable goddesses - Therese, Mary, Bonnie, Lux and Cecilia - won't survive the summer.I really wanted to like this more than I did. I often fight the urge to tell my wife how much I dislike the films she picks. However, if given my choice, she'd be stuck watching something like Starcrash. Despite the sheer despair of this film - not what I really wanted to see while dealing with a plague just outside our door - it also made me realize how lucky I am to have such a wonderful person in my life.I still dislike this movie.",The Virgin Suicides
7,michaelRokeefe,Excellent. Entertaining. Blonde is beautiful.,7,17 February 2001,"Directing debut for Sofia Coppola. Set in the 1970s suburbia Michigan, five blonde sister's become the objects of obsession for a group of neighborhood boys. The lads cherish every moment spent with the girls, actual and imaginary. After the youngest sister takes her own life, the remaining sisters become more coveted.My favorite scene is where Kirsten Dunst, in her 'nightie', lip locks Josh Hartnett in the front seat of his car. The two were flawless throughout and help make this Drama/Comedy very easy to watch. James Woods and Kathleen Turner play straight arrow, over cautious parents. They are so un-hip it becomes annoying watching them. Great use of the soundtrack. I was impressed with the scene where the girls contact the boys and converse by playing records back and forth over the phone.The finale is very powerful and emotional. I could watch this movie another half dozen times before tiring of it.",The Virgin Suicides
8,sunwarrior13,A Great Debut For Sofia Coppola,10,15 October 2012,"The Virgin Suicides is a film written and directed by Sofia Coppola and produced by her father Francis Ford Coppola.It features James Woods, Kathleen Turner, Kirsten Dunst, Josh Hartnett, and A. J. Cook. Based on the novel of the same name by Jeffrey Eugenides, it tells of the events surrounding the suicides of five sisters in an upper-middle class suburb of Detroit during the 1970's. After the youngest sister makes an initial attempt at suicide, the sisters are put under close scrutiny by their parents and the community, eventually being put into near-confinement, which leads to increasingly rebellious and self- destructive behavior.The Lisbons seem like an ordinary enough family; Father teaches math at a high school in Michigan, Mother has a strong religious faith, and they have five teenage daughters, ranging from 13-year-old Cecilia to 17- year-old Therese. However, the Lisbon family's sense of normalcy is shattered when Cecilia falls into a deep depression and attempts suicide. The family is shaken and Mother and Father seek the advice of psychiatrist Dr. Hornicker, who suggests the girls should be allowed to socialize more with boys. However, boys soon become a serious problem for Cecilia's sister Lux. Lux has attracted the eye of a high-school Romeo named Trip, who assures Father of his good intentions. But Cecilia finally makes good on her decision to kill herself, throwing the Lisbons into a panic; and after attending a school dance, Trip seduces and then abandons Lux. The Lisbons pull their daughters out of school, as an emotionally frayed Mother keeps close watch over them. Meanwhile, Lux continues to attract the attentions of the local boys, and she responds with a series of clandestine sexual episodes with random partners as often as she can sneak out of the house. Sofia Coppola tackles the issue of teenage suicide with an assured treatment in The Virgin Suicides, effectively employing a combination of a serious and comic tone.This shimmery, darkly comic adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' novel marks the assured, often inspired feature film debut of writer-director.Also,her compelling, ethereal fable about adolescent loss of innocence is claustrophobic and uncomfortable, but profoundly affecting and gently funny as it plays like a sweet, sad dream.Added to that,the exploration of a tough subject benefits from an original narrative and the fact that the appealing cast consists of actors who are the same age as the characters they play.",The Virgin Suicides
9,preppy-3,Acting and direction save it,7,7 June 2000,"Storywise, this movie is pretty bad. It's heavy-handed, characters and motivations are never explained or explored and it's depressing (of course).However, the acting is excellent. Kathleen Turner looks (and acts) like an overprotective mother, James Woods is incredibly passive as the father and Kirsten Dunst is all grown and still a good actress (and gorgeous). The direction by Soffia Coppola is superb. She knows how to use imagery and light/darkness to create moods. It's hard to explain how good it works, but it does. Also an excellent soundtrack of 1970s hits, but (for once) they're used to help mood and characters and not sell a soundtrack album. Worth seeing...just make allowances for the story.",The Virgin Suicides
10,LeonLouisRicci,A Chick-Flick by DefinitionBut a Good One,7,6 November 2015,"Yea, Silver Spoon and all that, but Just because doors are open and You have all the Money in the World, doesn't mean You can Create Your Own Style and Deliver the Goods. Director/Writer Sofia Coppola, in Her Directorial Debut, manages to be Taken Seriously on Her own.For a Novice Filmmaker She Impresses on a surface level with Artsy shots of Girly Things and the Film is about Girly Things and the way Girly Things Titillate Boys. It's also about Parental Oppression to the point of Abuse and Torture. The Movie is Downbeat with a Backbeat of Pop Cultural and High-School Flash. It tells its Tale of Trouble in Paradise with a Good Look and Bad Outcome in a way that is somewhat Refreshing. The Visuals in Virgin are what Shine whereas the Narration and some of the Montage can be Clunky at times.Overall, it's a bit Different where it Needs to be and is Engaging enough to make it Above Average for this Type of Teen Angst Thing. But it does feel Awkward at times and some of Her Flourishes, mostly the Writing, doesn't quite have the Impact Intended. The Ending is Clumsily Handled, but the getting there is Worth It, especially for its Targeted Teen Female Audience. It is by default a Chick-Flick, and a Good One.",The Virgin Suicides
11,Boba_Fett1138,A well crafted movie but the storytelling is lacking.,6,10 December 2005,"""The Virgin Suicides"" is a sort of mixed bag. It's a beautiful made movie with wonderful directed sequences in it but the storytelling doesn't always makes sense and is simply terrible lacking at times. A case of 'style over substance' you can perhaps conclude.It isn't always clear in the movie where the movie is heading to. This is mainly because there are often characters introduced in the movie, who once after they are out of the story, make you wonder what exactly their purpose for the movie was. Characters come and go in this movie and once you think that they are going to play an important part for the movie, they are already gone again. The story isn't always told from the right perspective which makes this movie at times a bit incoherent to watch. This is also due to the fact that at times the movie is set in 'present time' (1999), while the rest of the movie is set in the '70's. Those sort of scene's make it pretty obvious that this movie is based on a book. I'm sure all those element worked just fine in the book but for a movie it is pointless and adds no extra value to the story. A lot of things still remain unclear after the movie has ended, which makes this movie as a whole an unsatisfying one to watch.I also never really got into the characters. I never quite knew what went on in those girls heads and I never felt their desperateness and their cry for help. The portrayal of their parents (James Woods and Kathleen Turner) was also a opportunity wasted. Instead as strict and tough parents they are portrayed as simply narrow minded people, who have their own ideas about what's good and wrong for their children. If they had portrayed the parents as two completely strict and tough persons, the movie would had become more, claustrophobic, sensible, emotional and more understandable.The cast is good and has cameos in it from Danny DeVito and Scott Glenn and roles from Josh Hartnett and Hayden Christensen before they received real fame as actors. The movie however isn't really a character movie. The main essence of the movie is put on the style and look of it. For that reason the movie also perhaps feels a bit as a waste of a great cast.The movie is good looking and well directed by Sofia Coppola but it seemed that they forget about the story at times. It makes ""The Virgin Suicides"" a bit of an incoherent movie to watch at times. Because of the lacking storytelling the movie never truly becomes emotional or truly understandable and therefor it's nothing more than a just average drama that is good looking but nothing more than that.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Virgin Suicides
12,phd_travel,Silly story - what a bad example to show teenagers,1,15 June 2013,This is a stupid story that shouldn't have been made in to a movie. Glamorizing suicide for teenage girls is such an idiotic thing to do. It is a silly story that really one learn nothing from.5 pretty sisters commit suicide because of some minor teenage problems and a strict mom. The reasons for their actions are mind numbingly weak.Kathleen Turner hasn't got much choice in roles anymore so I understand why she took this. James Woods as well. Maybe a young Josh Hartnett had to do this movie while he was establishing a resume. Kristen Dunst shouldn't have had to take on such a role.Don't watch this or let your kids watch it.,The Virgin Suicides
13,Wuchakk,"Artistic, profound, amusing, tragic, haunting coming-of-age in the 70s",8,3 June 2019,"A 13 year-old girl from a Catholic family in a Detroit suburb commits suicide during the late 70s and its effects are shown over the course of the next year in the lives of her four sisters (e.g. Kirsten Dunst), her parents (James Woods & Kathleen Turner) and the boys of the community. Josh Hartnett is on hand as the school stud who's interested in Lux (Dunst).""The Virgin Suicides"" (1999) was Sofia Coppola's debut film based on the book by Jeffrey Eugenides; she would go on to great success with ""Lost in Translation"" (2003) and the underrated ""Marie Antoinette"" (2006). To be expected, Sofia's style is similar to her father, as well as Peter Weir, but maybe more focused on feminine themes. The tone of the movie is artsy and deep, but not without a sense of humor. It's haunting, mysterious, beautiful and impenetrable, reminiscent of Weir's ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" (1975). There's also a great 70's soundtrack featuring well-placed songs by The Hollies, Heart, Styx, Todd Rundgren and 10cc.The subtext on parental legalism brings to mind ""Footloose"" (1984), but it's clear that the blame can't be placed solely at the feet of the parents, who are certainly overprotective but also clearly loving to a degree. Cecilia's rash actions are the catalyst and the domino effect comes into play coupled with the oppression of stifling legalism and perhaps passive revenge. At the end of the day, though, it comes down to just a stupid decision by teenagers. Yet the movie's about way more than suicide and its causes. It's about coming-of-age, seeking identity & a voice, coming-of-death and the haunting reflections of those that remain.The film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes and was shot in Toronto.GRADE: A-/B+",The Virgin Suicides
14,The_Void,Not a good film by any means,3,17 September 2004,"The Virgin Suicides tries to be a lot of things: a haunting mystery, a coming of age tale, a character study and a story of the lengths that parents will go to protect their children. Although the film is all of these things; it doesn't do a single one of them well, and I therefore get the overall impression that whoever wrote the screenplay doesn't really know what they're doing. The fact that it was written by Sofia Coppola, makes a lot of sense. Many moments in the film are excruciating, either for being incredibly dull or just for being extremely corny. The parts that see the boys recount their 'relationship' with the girls is terrible; some of their lines are repulsive and I could do nothing but roll my eyes. This whole plot involving the boys came off as being undercooked all the way through; from what we saw of the two groups together, it would seem that they hardly knew each other. So why would a group of boys obsess over a group of girls that they hardly know? I don't care if Kirsten Dunst is one of them; just no.The Virgin Suicides is based on a book by Jeffrey Eugenides. I haven't read it, or even heard of it before seeing this movie but I'm sure that it's better than the film, because for a book to warrant a film adaptation, it has to be good; and that is something that this film isn't. The story follows that of four average looking blonde girls, and Kirsten Dunst; one of the most beautiful modern actresses. The five girls live with their overly religious parents (James Woods and Kathleen Turner) and their lives are turned upside down one day when the youngest of the five commits suicide. This leads the parents to be more cautious with the other girls - the spiky fence is taken away, they're not allowed to ride in cars unless absolutely necessary etc. However, this all changes one day when Trip Fontaine, a 'heart-throb' moves into town. He and three other boys take the girls to the dance, but after it, he leaves Kirsten Dunst on the football field; which 'forces' the parents to keep them locked in doors. Although this story may sound interesting, it really isn't. Sofia tries to make the story come across as being brooding and mysterious, mostly by showing images of Kirsten Dunst on an open backdrop, but all this film really is, is mundane. When a father granting a boy permission to take his daughter to the dance seems exciting, you can tell that you're watching the wrong movie.The entire cast of this movie is wasted. Kirsten Dunst has proved on many occasions that she has enough about her to carry a movie, in fact she's one of my main reasons for watching; but here she never really gets the chance to do anything. She is lost under a sea of blonde hair, and therefore never gets her chance to shine. Similarly, James Woods as the over-protective father is never really allowed to act. His performance is dozy, and to be quite honest he looks bored. I don't blame him. Kathleen Turner is the mother of the girls, and she doesn't really get to do anything either. The man that plays the heartthrob Trip Fontaine, Josh Harnett is the standout of the cast; and when you're watching a movie where Josh Harnett is the standout, you know you're in the wrong movie.Just like her massively over-acclaimed 2003 film, Lost in Translation; nothing about The Virgin Suicides really stands out. To it's credit, the film does look nice; but as shown by films like The Insider and Road to Perdition; good cinematography will get you nowhere if you don't have a film to back it up with. Sofia's direction is, like the rest of the film, dull. She doesn't have a style of her own, or anything to make her stand out from the rest of the have-a-go directors. Except for, of course, the fact that she is Francis Ford Coppola's daughter. Music for this film is provided by 'Air'. If you want to make a film mysterious, music is a big thing; it can make or break a film. As shown by Peter Weir with Picnic at Hanging Rock; you can make a heap of stone mysterious if you get the music right. However, Air don't seem to do mysterious at all. The music in The Virgin Suicides does have moments of mystery; the music played over the opening credits, for example; but mostly Air have seem to have opted for popular songs. These songs tend to have nothing to do with what's happening on the screen, and although a lot of them are good songs; they're just not right for the film, and their only purpose seems to be so that people can think ""oh, I like that song"". And that isn't the way to a great score.Overall, you would be better of not wasting your time with The Virgin Suicides, or Lost in Translation for that matter. With any luck, Sofia Coppola will be dismissed as merely another passenger on the gravy train, but for the time being; please don't credit her where credit isn't deserved. There's many other more deserving directors that you could give that praise to instead.",The Virgin Suicides
15,zetes,"Oh, this film is so beautiful",9,18 May 2000,"If you are the type of moviegoer who constantly has to pick apart the plot of the film you are watching, disliking anything in a film that is even modestly illogical, then stay away from this film. A film's plot should be low on the importance scale for film.
There are a few small problems in a script (the big one being: the narrator keeps asking ""Why?"" when the answer is extremely obvious). What The Virgin Suicides has in spades is mood. The arts of acting, photography, music and direction mixed together so well that the film absolutely swept me away in its beautiful mood. It is poetic and dreamlike and elegaic. I loved every second of it, only slightly aware of a couple of shortcomings in the script.
I am lucky enough to have seen Sofia Coppola's short film debut a year or two ago on the Bravo cable network called _Lick the Stars_. It is very similar to The Virgin Suicides in its theme, girlhood trauma in high school. If anyone who has any influence over the DVD release of The Virgin Suicides reads this (yeah right, like any executives ever ask the fans what they want; they don't care as long as we give them our money, which we will always do), Lick the Stars should be included on The Virgin Suicides' DVD.
I hope this film finds some sort of cult status in the years to come. After all, it is similar (and a whole lot better) than Heathers. It sure enough deserves to find a following.9/10",The Virgin Suicides
16,Sylviastel,Deeply Disturbing!,8,26 March 2007,"I have wanted to see this film for a long time. I have read the book a few years ago. I was mesmerized by the plot of five teen age girls, the Lisbons, who end up as suicide victims hence the title. The Lisbon Sisters include Lux played by Kirsten Dunst who steals the movie from the other actresses. She is a middle child. There is Mary, Bonnie, Cecilia, Lux, and I forget. Cecilia attempts suicide early in the film and the parents are trying to correct the situation. Since the story takes place in the 1970s, one can only assume that there was little knowledge of depression or understanding how depression is the major cause of suicides. I was saddened that I never got to the other girls because I taped it in the middle of the night and the tape ran out so I only got up to the homecoming dance. I have to say that James Woods is wonderful as the father and Kathleen Turner who I never liked personally is very good at playing their mother. We never really get to know what caused the tragedy of why such beautiful girls never lived such a life. By the way, Sofia Coppola has truly found a calling in directing rather than acting. This film is quite controversial because of the film's nature. She did a terrific job bringing this novel to celluloid.",The Virgin Suicides
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: (DVD) The Virgin Suicides (1999),7,10 January 2006,"This film was Sofia Coppola's feature film directorial debut, based upon the novel by Jeffrey Eugenides. It's actually a sad tale recounting the lives of five sisters, as perceived by a group of teenage boys who admire them from afar.The Lisbon sisters (from youngest to oldest, starting from 13 years and each a year apart) - Cecilia (Hanna Hall), Lux (the recognizable Kirsten Dunst), Bonnie (Chelse Swain), Mary (A.J. Cook) and Therese, live an extremely sheltered and protective life from their parents, played by James Woods and Katheleen Turner.The beginning is quite abrupt with the death (an apparent suicide) of youngest daughter Cecilia, impaled by the garden fence. The town is shocked, but somehow, as the boys observed, the other sisters seemed to take it in their stride. These boys serve as eyewitnesses to a tale of their own fantasy of befriending the sisters, as they dream of taking them out on road trips, to the outside world.However, one other boy did make contact and succeeded, with his own group of friends, to get the girls out to the Homecoming. Played by Josh Hartnett, the coolest guy in school, Trip Fontaine, however suave he might be, turns out to be a marijuana smoking jock who's only for a session of ""wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am"". When Lux fails to return home together with her sisters (she was making out in the middle of a field), Mr and Mrs Lisbon go ballistic, and confined the girls in their home, like prisoners in their cells.As the younger boys engage in a series of voyeuristic observations, and eventually establishes contact with the Lisbon sisters, it's a case of too little, too late. They try to rationalize, account for, and piece together the events of that faithful night, but could not come to a satisfactory conclusion.And that's where some might find this film wanting, with some subplots never fully explained, or shown on screen. But that's the way the narrative is, from the flawed memories of young boys who never fully understood the events, nor are close to the girls enough to know their thoughts and dreams. They can only speculate, and fantasize, and that's about it.The visuals are kept simple, but made an impact nonetheless with the sisters' deaths (ok, with a title like that, you don't think they make it out alive, do you?). Plenty of soulful music make up the soundtrack, but none more meaningful that the haunting sounds of Playground LOve.While the film might have taken a pot shot at unreasonable and strict parental upbringing, it didn't evoke enough strength to see it through beyond mere suggestion. But for what it is, this movie is intriguing, though it poses quite a bit of questions on what could have happened.Code 1 DVD contains the theatrical trailer, a making of featurette, a photo gallery and a music video.",The Virgin Suicides
18,whpratt1,WOODS & TURNER SAVED THIS FILM!!!,10,8 July 2003,"James Woods as dad and Kathleen Turner as wife, was a great combination and their great acting talents made this film a picture worth watching.   It is quite possible that the daughters could not breath without having to say a prayer and feel guilty about just plain being alive and having any sort of sexual desires for the opposite SEX!   There was always a gloom and doom portrayed in this picture and it at times even effected the viewer, which means the actors were doing a great job of ACTING!  Suicide is mentioned in their High School, however, the sister's do not seem to grasp the full meaning of taking your own life.  The fact that suicide is something to take lightly, and also the fact that it is a self-centered act and is the coward's way out of life which is not any person's choice to take. These daughters had everything to live for, no health problems, which makes this film very unrealistic to view, life is really NOT THAT WAY!!",The Virgin Suicides
19,siderite,"A beautiful story, a bit slow",7,5 August 2007,"This is one of those movies that appeal to me tremendously, that is movies about childhood and coming of age written by and for adults. Most of them are based on books, making beautiful stories, with soul and originality.In ""The Virgin Suicides"" the story is told by four kids, trying to understand five beautiful girls in a very strict family, living across the street. Final tragedy makes them only less likely to understand the feelings and lives of the girls and renders them impotent watchers of a story they haven't been part of, just like everyone else.But this is not a moral easily detected. This is not a movie where black is black and white is white and the ideas of the writer/director are forcefully pushed down one's throat. The story is watched and then relayed to the viewer. You can either sympathize with the strict moral mother or hate her you can agree with the ""freedom or death"" slogan or believe it stupid; you can understand the reactions of the boys or curse them for not acting faster or better or differently.Bottom line: you have to see it to make something of it.

Sure, it's depressing & slightly longer than it should have been, but, it still leaves an impact on it's viewer.Based on the novel of the same name by Jeffrey Eugenides, the film tells of the events surrounding the suicides of five sisters in an upper- middle class suburb of Detroit during the 1970s. After the youngest sister attempts suicide, the sisters are put under great scrutiny from their parents as well as from their community.'The Virgin Suicides' is unsettling, depressing & unspoken. Coppola's Screenplay, is progressive, tight-lipped & also has depth. The legend of the Lisbon sisters, comes alive on screen, with the impact, it's suppose to leave on you. But, I felt, the film needed some trimming. It's slightly longer than it should have been. Coppola's Direction, on the other-hand, is atmospheric. Cinematography is appropriate. Editing is good. Art & Costume Design, are impressive.Performance-Wise: James Woods is excellent, as always. Kathleen Turner is equally competent. Kirsten Dunst does exceedingly well & looks the part. Josh Hartnett is nice. A.J. Cook, Hanna R. Hall & Leslie Hayman, are natural to the core. Michael Paré is fair.On the whole, 'The Virgin Suicides' is a film to watch.",The Virgin Suicides
21,StevePulaski,"We know how it will end, but we want to know why, and despite knowing, we still are left in the dark",8,23 July 2012,"Rarely does a film compliment a period's bubbling nostalgia and give us a tale of sorrow and woe so calamitous and so saddening to the soul. Let alone a newcoming writer/director. Sofia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides is a depressing, yet favorable story of five sheltered young girls, kept on the shortest leash by their heavily religious parents, who wind up receiving the intimate eyes of some local boys, and end their tragic lives by taking them.It's upper class suburbia in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, circa 1974. The girls are thirteen year old Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall), fourteen year old Lux (Kirsten Dunst), fifteen year old Bonnie (Chelse Swain), sixteen year old Mary (A. J. Cook), and seventeen year old Therese (Leslie Hayman), and their parents are Ronald (James Woods) and Sara (Kathleen Turner). They have been kept under strict order since birth, and the parents always expect the worst, especially now, what with boys entering the picture.What makes the parents become even more on guard is when young Cecilia's suicide attempt is unsuccessful. When her parents try to throw a basement party, with the neighborhood boys, Cecilia is tired and sick of it all, and attempt suicide again, this time being successful. It is then that the girls become even more forced into the box of seclusion that will eventually accumulate into depression.Those neighborhood boys are left mostly vague, possibly on purpose, but one in particular is the central focus for their team and that's the Junior stud, Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett). He wears his bad-boy jeans proudly, his clothes with a preferred slickness, and he comes with his own silently narcissistic attitude. He catches the eye of Lux, but because he is used to all the girls gawking at him in the hallways, he is stricken with surprise when she seems impassive at any approach of attraction. She, herself, much like her sisters, strives for perfection and, again, much like her sisters, earns it, yet he is drawn to her more than any of them.When Trip proposes the idea to Mr. Lisbon that him and his friends would take the four girls out to the dance, he is hesitant at first, quickly reverting to his book of strict parenting rules, but talks it over with his wife, and reluctantly agrees.The film is plagued by a rather blunt ending, yet, like always, it's how we arrive at that ending that matters, and Coppola, working from author Jeffrey Eugenides's original source material, makes a film of divine complexity, sheer whimsicality, and an impenetrable love for a dreamlike world. The Virgin Suicides is very colorful and atmospheric, beautifully capturing the heart, spirit, complexities, and eccentricities of the seventies, like the hesitation of house-parties, where parents are lingering over the shoulder, the keen passion and feeling in falling in lust with the mysterious girls next door, the hungering for more intimacy at such a tender age, and the inherent feeling of ripping through stern boundaries.And when it comes down to the majestically enticing score is when The Virgin Suicides shines bigger and brighter, with songs by Heart, Styx, and the ever-so-pleasant Gilbert O'Sullivan. It creates the seventies atmosphere and charm, not off of stale cliché, overly mixtaped music, and goofy hairstyles, but captures the destruction of innocence and the rebellious phases with sheer heart and realism. Depressing, but ultimately, very moving, touching, and meticulous in its design and craft.Starring: James Woods, Kathleen Turner, Kirsten Dunst, Josh Hartnett, A. J. Cook, Chelse Swain, and Anna R. Hall. Directed by: Sofia Coppola.",The Virgin Suicides

24,sddavis63,"Dark, Dismal And Depressing",3,10 December 2019,"If you're ever in the mood for some light-hearted entertainment - most definitely do not watch ""The Virgin Suicides."" This is perhaps the darkest, most dismal and most depressing movie I've ever seen. It opens with the 13 year old youngest daughter of the Lisbon family attempting to commit suicide and it ends a couple of hours later with all five of the Lisbon daughters having committed suicide. In between, we get a glimpse of their life as a part of this Lisbon family - with an overbearing, over-protective super-religious mother (Kathleen Turner) and a somewhat more understanding but kind of wimpy father (James Woods) who won't stand up to his wife to try to give the girls some freedom. (This is certainly a critique of hyper-religiosity.) Finally fed up with their situation, the girls become increasingly rebellious, start to hang out with a group of boys as best they can when mom isn't watching, and it all leads up to that tragic ending. I have to admit - I didn't like this movie. I can take a dark and depressing movie but this one seemed to have very little point. We knew where it was going - it's clearly stated in the movie's description - but there was nothing in particular that seemed to be compelling about the journey. Thank goodness this wasn't a true story! That's about the best I can say for it.Well ... there were some redeeming qualities I suppose. Turner and Woods actually did pretty well with their roles and - even though this is fiction - the movie did bring out a bit of an emotional reaction in me. Fictional or not, I started to feel sorry for these girls as the movie went on - perhaps because I knew exactly where this was heading - and I wanted someone to rescue them, even knowing that wish was in vain. So it's not as if this was a complete disaster. It was just a movie I didn't like, and I found watching it to be a truly bleak experience. (3/10)",The Virgin Suicides
25,lost-in-limbo,Downbeat look into suburbia.,8,23 December 2005,"This is a story of a group of sisters who are brought up under strict rules by their parents in a well of American Michigan suburb of the 70's. These sisters seem to have it all, but one day that turns upside down when one of the unstable sister's, the youngest one, commits suicide. Not too long after going through a lot of pain, memories and being overtly sheltered by their parents, they follow the same suit of their youngest sister. These deaths puzzle the neighbourhood boys who were obsessed with these five girls for some time and even today they still haunt their minds. We follow the story through entries of one the girl's diary, the memories and interviews of these boys who knew the girls, who now are grown-ups.This highly acclaimed indie flick by Sofia Coppola and produced by her father Francis Ford Coppola, is stunning and highly enticing, but it's incredibly empty underneath the dreamy visuals and poetic look into the American dream and that of the underlying dark mind of suburbia. Its vision is beautifully portrayed and there's a disturbing and insecure tone that lurks behind the screen, but I just didn't feel anything for these characters. Yeah, I enjoyed the performances, though they just didn't move me. Call me cold-hearted if you must. But saying that I did find it more interesting than 'American Beauty', which also follows a similar storyline about the dark side of suburban life. Coppola in her debut feature as director shows a lot promise and sophistication in her vision and that of adding to any small details that seem to eventuate throughout the story. She controls proceedings with such refinement and simplicity, by keeping you watching when nothing much is really going on. This is also because of the steady control behind the camera and tight editing that makes this sway along rather nicely without bogging it down. All of this definitely translates into her second feature 'Lost in Translation'. The story itself, which is crafted from Jeffrey Eugenides's novel, is explored in a documentary style with it cutting to interviews and a narration that is done by Giovanni Ribisi. The plot is elegantly slow and tremendously dour. And so are the performances. James Wood as the clueless father, Kathleen Turner as an over-protected mum and Kirsten Dunst as one of the sisters are outstanding and convincing in nature. Josh Hartnett seems to pull out the same old performance in every film he does, although it seems to fit the buck on this occasion. Also there are some small cameos from Scott Glenn and Danny De Vito. The chemistry between the casts is incredibly smooth and convincing. The dialog that comes from these characters are naturally fitting in tone and in capturing the awkwardness faced by teens and parents. Sometimes it would dry up with little or no dialog but still it concealed a certain sense of depth and also added was dabs of offbeat and hurting humour that comes off rather dark most of the time. The film looks great amongst its settings of outer suburbia; the performances are more so the film's backbone, but another factor would be the dreamy score by Air. They come up with a softly handled soundtrack that swells with its zesty vibe and also on the soundtrack are some groovy 70's tunes that fit right in. Like 10CC's 'I'm not in love'. A right choice of music makes the film hit the right notes.A talented cast and director makes a sublime film that creates an uneasy mood of realism and distraught. It's definitely worth a look. It might have been rather empty for me at times, but the flick did hold my attention greatly. I guess the ambiguity of these girls are just part of the parcel. Though if you're not into art-house cinema, you might not get anything out of it.",The Virgin Suicides
26,dromasca,A Mature First Movie,8,4 August 2002,"I liked this movie. It proves maturity, good taste and style and I am not certain if this is because of the genes, or maybe it announces a future great director. I do not know if the plot line is based on a real story, but it certainly is credible and moving. The story of five sisters, repressed by the religious environments of the parents, the story of teenage rebellion, of claustration and lack of understanding from the part of the parents, of the unappropriate tools used by the society to deal with the tean age problems, all this is told in a fast pace, painted with short but clear brushes. A mix of well known mature actors (James Woods - so close and so far from his typical reactionary CIA colonel roles, Katherine Turner playing the opposite of her 'hot' youth sex symbol roles)and young actors is led in quite sure and convincing manner.Overall this is not a great movie, but a convincing debut, and it keeps us waiting for the next one from the director. I just hope that the coming movies will not disappoint and let us know that it was daddy's help after all...",The Virgin Suicides
27,secondtake,"I grew up there, and it's too true for comfort, and yet completely bizarrely false!",8,13 April 2011,"The Virgin Suicides (1999)Is cinematic genius inherited? How could Sofia Coppola be such a good director unless by some kind of genetics, or osmosis? I mean, she has as many bad films as her father, but she has three good ones (one of them the brilliant ""Lost in Translation"") This one, ""The Virgin Suicides"" is based on a book by Jeffrey Eugenides, who has a detailed and somewhat superficial style that depends more on a sequence of events than on depth of character. And that carries over to this movie. It may not be a brilliant affair in the end, but it's inventive, it has a unique glow to it (both from the camera and from the pacing, the odd aura of the movies plot), and it's quirky, unafraid to takes some important little chances.The basis for everything is an absurd situation if you look at it straight--a tightly buttoned up family with five gorgeous girls in high school that all the boys are interested in. Pressures build inside and out and the eventual suicide or two or more take place. The nostalgic voice-over removes the emotional devastation these events would normally demand, but even the filming, with its artificial construction and even occasional liberties (showing time passing or seeing through a dress to some writing on a girl's panties) make everything a faraway experience. We are only to watch, with wry appreciation, not get sucked in and ruined.You could easily critique this film hard, and point out its inability to talk about family dysfunction, or to explore high school angst and social structure, or even to get into the head of one of the five girls (Kirsten Dunst, most likely, since she has the largest role). But Coppola isn't interested in true depth. She's making a glossy, affected entertainment, a clever and surprising one, a surprisingly original one. The feel to a lot of this seems to echo her father's failed ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" from a decade earlier, with slightly different nostalgic roots, but with a similar feeling of detachment and shiny surface feel. And in both cases with a determination to have slightly silly fun.Of course, if there was a hint of reality here the fun would be too macabre for even bad taste. And that's where the movie works. It creates a zone of humor, of insight into an era (the 1970s) that must have been the first generation X after the meaningful 60s. The acting is spot on, both among the kids, including the wry sly Dunst and several of the boys, all terrifically awkward except for suave Josh Hartnett, and among the two main adults, the parents played by Kathleen Turner and a perfect James Woods. The stereotypes are played just hard enough to seem false, which is fine for this kind of movie, but the religious zealousness of the mother might strike some people as just too much. I have to say though, I knew a girl whose mother did exactly that and worse to her, and she wasn't a religious nut at all. Records of rock music in the 1970s were often labelled as such bad influences they had to be destroyed.Let go your expectations and give this a look for what it is, which is pretty unique and filled with odd richness and disturbing and intentional irrelevance. Rather too often brilliant to brush off.",The Virgin Suicides
28,Irishchatter,A horrible tragedy story to look out!,8,19 October 2015,"This film is such a tearjerker and gives you a whole amount of fear for these girls because their parents were such religious control freaks. It was really awful to see the sisters die one by one especially Kirsten Dunst's character Lux Lisbon.Now at the beginning, I thought the parents were just ordinary folk wanting for the daughters to do well in school. However as the movie goes on, you would really be more scared for the girls sake.

There are many scenes warmly lit with orange sunlight and it is very pleasant on the eye. This made Kirsten Dunst seem even more beautiful than she is. Which is very beautiful indeed.Another thing about this movie is that the teen males are mature and behave in a dignified and respectful way. Not like most other teen movie these days when all they do is party, joke about diarrhoea and make love to pastries.

30,Dr_Coulardeau,Consumerism plus bigotry lead to suicide,10,31 January 2007,"Five is a bad omen ? Five is a pentacle of the devil, a pentad of five girls who will all eventually stage their suicide in public in order to make it what it was supposed to be a successful show, a show completely fulfilled till the real end of their life, of their five lives. On the other side four boys and a fifth one who was an outsider. The latter was to become the deadly trigger of the last four suicides after the first one was successful though only on the second trial or attempt, an encore if you want. The film is well done because it creates the right atmosphere of these teenagers, daughters and sons of the babyboomers who got absolutely bored in their life that had become long tedious useless studies, postponed sexuality, nothing to desire anymore in this over-satisfied middle class consumer's society and the list of those evil goods or good evils could be very long. Our modern society took away simple sentiments like desiring and longing for and replaced them with over-satisfaction, overconsumption, consumerizing. Then since morality and ethics developed at the same pace, sex became forbidden, hence clandestine, hence rebellious, hence a door to the unknown that everyone around you will make guilty, dirty, worthless. What the heck if life is nothing but running after some forbidden dirt ! Sofia Cappola takes the problem from the point of view of these five sisters but through the eyes of the five, four + one, boys who become the voyeurs of the scene with binoculars, periscope, telescope, cameras, pictures, diaries read to remember the girls, etc. The voyeurs appear as naive and kind of simpleminded. It does not matter : they are only the eyes Sofia Coppola uses to make us see the five sisters. Hence it is superficial and trite and the parents, particularly the mother, appear to be ogre-like monsters. It's true that Trip, the outsider who triggers the final run of the second wave of four suicides, is a real monster. He loved the girl till he took her to the football field and made her woman. That is no love. That is luring a prey into a trap with music, good looks and alcohol. He had the grossness of leaving her in the middle of the night, asleep in the grass and telling twenty-five years later that it felt differently then. Sure, since she no longer was a virgin and he was only attracted by virgins and he was a virgin lady's man (the lady of course not the rogue boy), an insatiable hungry dog who considered his ladies as some food deluxe but that became soiled as soon as they were used once. The typical consumer who buys, eats and then rejects behind him. That does not excuse the Christian bigotry of the mother and the scientific aloofness of the father, but at times it takes very little to turn a disaster into a catastrophe, a storm into a hurricane.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",The Virgin Suicides
31,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A cautionary case study of tragedy and how we cope with it,8,4 April 2011,"Sofia Coppola chose quite the challenge for her debut as a writer and director, a film based on the novel ""The Virgin Suicides"" by Jeffrey Eugenides. A portrait of suburban life in the '70s, ""Virgin Suicides"" tells (among other things) of the ripple effect that one suicide can have on a small town and a family ill-equipped to deal with it.The film focuses on the five Lisbon sisters who lead a very sheltered life thanks to their parents (Kathleen Turner and James Woods), but it's told from the perspective of the high school boys who were enchanted by these five blond-haired ""angels."" Coppola does a superb job mimicking that effect for the viewer; we constantly feel on the outside looking in when it comes to these ladies, obsessing over them in a way or at least fascinated.For the most part, ""Virgin Suicides"" is a coming-of-age film, but one that makes its sad ending very clear, which casts a sort of shadow over the nostalgic feelings and cuteness that suburban America period films are known for. Coppola creates a contrast in tones in that much of the film centers on these gooey moments (such as the homecoming dance) yet there's an undeniably tragic undercurrent. It draws a clear connection to the fact that teenage depression was largely ignored or at the least misunderstood at this point in time with the false hope that the sparkling naivety of the '50s and '60s would continue to last. At the same time, the film doesn't speak only to a specific period of time. The goal is not just to serve as a cautionary tale that shames the parents of that generation for not ""getting it"" and warns current parents to be less overbearing. The more universal parallel is how we as outsiders react to a tragic situation like the Lisbons and handle ourselves as a society and as individuals when a shocking occurrence tries to shake us from the complacency of our lives. These are times when ""It'll never happen to me/us"" takes much more drastic convincing.The portrayal of Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon, both in the script and in the performances of Turner and Woods, does provide some cautionary examples of how not to parent, but specifically shows how out of touch parents can become. When the youngest commits suicide and sets the whole film in motion, she jumps from the second story window and strikes a pointed fence. The first response of the parents is to remove the fence.However, the film does not show the grieving process of the Lisbons and keeps us on the periphery of their situation from an emotional standpoint. We know about as much as the boys spying on them narrating this story from the present day, which despite depriving us of a deeply emotional experience, does make the point that the real focus is on the reaction of others to this tale of woe. ""Virgin Suicides"" serves as a tough reminder about how we distance ourselves from tragedy regardless of how connected we are to those involved. The level of our ignorance to such issues has improved vastly, but in the history of humankind, coping has never been ""easy.""~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",The Virgin Suicides

The Virgin Suicides delivered a startlingly accurate portrayal of the awkwardness of adolescence. Sure, it's uncommon for five sisters all to commit suicide within a year, but the circumstances of the five girls lives in this film were extreme. The acting was excellent all around, and even the story held a bit of credibility, although not much.
The first problem that arises with this film is that no one asked any questions when the girls were taken out of school. One person mentions it to the father once, but that is all. Second, it seems too much that all of the circumstances put upon the girls are meant specifically to drive them to suicide. This appears to be nothing more than a bit of a transparent plot, because it is unlikely that this is what was really supposed to be happening in the story. A confusing ending also takes away from the potential of this film. When the movie is over, it doesn't seem that anything has really been accomplished. The audience is left with the same questions that were presented at the beginning; it's like the movie went around in a circle and ended up in the same place where it started.

35,freemantle_uk,A striking debut by Sofia Coppola,8,6 May 2012,"Sofia Coppola took a real critical and audience bashing after her dire performance in The Godfather Part III. She quickly left acting behind and did not have many acting gigs afterwards. Luckily she has found her calling as a director-writer, starting with her adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' debut novel.In a wealthy suburb in 1970s Michigan there are five sisters, Therese (Leslie Hayman), Mary (A.J. Cook), Bonnie (Chelse Swain), Lux (Kirsten Dunst) and Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall) who live with their authoritarian, religious parents (James Woods and Kathleen Turner). But tragedy strikes when 13-year-old Cecila kills herself. Watching them from a far are a group of neighbourhood boys as the tragedy unfolds and watches as Lux falls for local heartthrob Trip (Josh Hartnett) and the boys try to put the pieces of the puzzle of what happened to the girls.The Virgin Suicides is a tackles a dark subject and Coppola juxtaposes it with a bright, dreamy visual with a golden filter, sun dearth landscapes and dreamy editing and she keeps the girls at a distance. We do know much of the girls or why they did what they do. Admittedly I would have wanted to see the girls given more personality and be recognisable; it is only Lux we get to see or know. But I will give Coppola credit that despite not seeing the details we see the boys seeing Lux really descent down a dark path. This is a film about not knowing what happens behind closed doors, about restricting girls' social outlets and trying to dominate their lives just makes a pressured situation that is ready to go off and the ever changing nature of what it is like to be a teenager. It is particularly dark because one of the first scenes is a 13-year-old lying in a blood filled bath and it makes you wonder what would drive someone that young into doing something that extreme.The Virgin Suicides is a very well acted film and Coppola does get a really good cast. The actors were natural and the film did feel like it was set in a real American suburb with all the darkness under the surface, what teenagers get up to and the talking behind someone's back when something tragic happens. Turner played the true villain of the piece as the strict, controlling woman who does not allow her daughters to have any freedoms. Wood is a more sympathetic character if the clichéd man who keeps his feelings to himself. Dunst too was very strong as a teen with obvious problems as she slow enters in promiscuity at her young age.The Virgin Suicides is a very compelling drama and a great debut by Coppola. She keeps the mystery going as we see pretty the same things as the main characters. This is a engaging and interesting film and type a film a first time director should make, a visually striking that is story and character focus and low budget.",The Virgin Suicides

There really isn't much I feel there is to say about it, as it is a pretty self-contained little movie. Coppola satirizes the clean warmth of suburbia without the self-indulgence of most artists dealing with conformity. I'm surprised by the cover descriptions and synopses that talk about this film as if it's a mystery; it's about as mysterious as what drives Charles Kane.

40,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Intangibly Beautiful film,8,2 August 2015,"Sofia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides is a one of a kind film that evokes a certain ephemeral yearning that hearkens to the days of our teenage hood, when hormones rage, emotions flare, and life has just begun its parade of confusion, tragedy and wonder. It's hard film to put in a box as it evokes a special kind of mournful atmosphere that's hard to duplicate, and an atmospheric, lurid quality that I've never seen done so well. Except ,aye in Donnie Darko. Coppola almost borrows from Cameron Crowe's gauzy, cloud stained aesthetic with her combination of ethereal music, free flowing work from the actors and undefined narrative that leaves you feeling a variety of different emotions. In classic American suburbia, five angelic, untouchable sisters are the object of every neighbourhood boy's yearning affection, and blooming lust. Ruled over by a fanatically conservative mother (Kathleen Turner), and a repressed father (James Woods cast excellently against type as a feeble, twisted man), the sisters find their blossoming womanhood hindered by their mother and father, resulting in a confusing, stunted coming of age that only ends in tragedy. What a beautiful, intoxicating tragedy it is though. The oldest of the girls (Kirsten Dunst), becomes entranced by boyish hunk Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett), and from there events spiral downward. The cast is top notch, Dunst shows uncanny maturity, Woods is tragically pathetic, and Turner is a force of misguided religious fury. There are perfect cameos from Scott Glenn, Danny Devitio, and Michael Parè as well. It's a hard movie to describe in words, let alone a review, but if you watch it, think of it as a free form musical, visual essay on what it means to be young and influenced by your environment as you come into your own, and whether that effects you negatively, positively, or downright disastrously, as illustrated here.",The Virgin Suicides
41,RavenGlamDVDCollector,"The Virgin Suicides a Great Book, Movie Good but not the Same",9,17 April 2014,"Years ago I read the book, saw the movie on DVD more than a year ago, and it is one of my all-time favorite films. There is one major problem with it, though. The storyline in the book went much, much better. But the casting of Kirsten Dunst and that girl who was the best friend in TRU CALLING, I'm not complaining, and the music in the film sure hit the sad spot. It's very emotional to the point of being bittersweet before really hitting you. But then, the book was even better. I can say many good things about the film, but I'd always have to return and say the book was even better. The metaphor of the dying elm trees in the book as the symbol of the end of the Norman Rockwell era of America, was vastly underplayed in the film. And the way the book ended, it was surely the saddest, most heart-renderingly upsetting ending a book ever had, yet there was no such a despondent scene at the end of this movie. Although the haunting music helped...But the biggest mistake? (And the very talented Ms. Coppola should have picked up on this) In the book, the suicides are one at a time, each one precipitating the next. But in the movie, the Lisbon girls do a mean thing, luring the boys into the house, to let them find a grisly house of horrors. No, No, No. And again No! If I was Jeffrey Eugenides, I'd have put a stop to this aberration. The girls of the book committed suicide out of teenage angst, despair, feelings of hopelessness, but they definitely didn't call out for an audience!Despite these flaws, the general mood of the book was there in the movie, and I'm sure this would have been a challenge to most film-makers, even those far more experienced than Sofia, so I would say that she did exceedingly well. Another thing: The book described the house as a shambles, a gigantic mess that had to be professionally cleaned up afterward, and took days. There was nothing like this in the movie. In the book, the Lisbon girls were like chicks that had fallen out of the nest, they were wraiths. You could see a mile off that something was wrong. Nothing on this level of utter despair in the film.It's just that the movie will forever remain in the shadow of one of the most poignant books ever written. Certainly the saddest thing I ever read...Then again, the happy scene with the girls in the car which turns out to be a fallacy, not what really happened, this was pure genius, and the book doesn't have it, so even more congratulations to Sofia!To cut a long story short, I'd advise anybody READ THE BOOK, AND SEE THIS MOVIE. Definitely both. The full experience.",The Virgin Suicides
42,Agent10,Ethereal and moving,8,30 April 2002,"-may contain spoilers-The sad thing about most movies which deal with suicide, there is always an underlying reason of WHY? But in reality, we rarely know why people kill themselves, the need to take their own last breath. This is what makes The Virgin Suicides so amazing. We get some idea why Lux eventually killed herself, but why the others? Heartbreak and rejection is one thing, but killing yourself out the sanctity of your sister's love is another. A great film with a solid cast and one of the more intoxicating musical scores I've ever listened to. If flows so evenly with the cinematography, I wonder how the two elements could ever exist without each other.",The Virgin Suicides
43,Boyo-2,As enjoyable as the subject matter can be,8,28 August 2002,"Spoiler Alert, but if you can't tell what happens by the title, you shouldn't be online anyway, you should be shopping for a brain.
The movie was very rough going to start with.  The smallest Lisbon daughter has attempted suicide and when she is asked why, replies without a trace of emotion, 'Obviously, Doctor, you've never been a 13 year old girl', as though he was a moron for asking the question in the first place.  You know she is depressed only because the narration tells you she is, there is nothing about her manner that would suggest such drastic actions are in her destiny.The Lisbon parents are strict but the daughters seem to thrive on each other.  When the smallest girl successfully kills herself, during a party no less, none of them seem to be affected, which is weird to say the least. I felt like they were all living in an alternate universe, that the parents and the kids created a world that did not allow for emotion or any outside influences.That was shattered when the girls are allowed to go to a school function, all at the urging by Trip (played by Josh Hartnett), who has a crush on Lux (Kirsten Dunst), and the girls acted like real girls who live in the world. I was surprised to see Lux having a cigarette, making out with Trip, etc., the normal things a kid does.  From what's onscreen, I didn't think Lux knew what a cigarette was, so that seemed a little inconsistent.  When Trip and Lux have sex on the football field, and he leaves her there, she is naturally grounded as are all her siblings.  They don't have a trace of rebellion in them, which is not only unreasonable but slightly ridiculous. When Lux is ordered to burn all her albums, she's crying, but she's not screaming and fighting either.  Eventually, Lux and Trip are able to get together, but only on her roof (!) and only for awhile.
To back up for a second, ALL this is being closely monitored by four neighborhood boys, who are all so obsessed with the girls that it borderlines on awe at times.  They get their hands on the youngest girls journal and read it with reverence.I would have liked to have seen a fight.  I would have liked to have seen a reaction to suicide other than in the media.  And you really don't know exactly why any of them killed themselves.However, there is much to admire - Josh Hartnett's appearance, about 1/2 hour in, gives the movie a much-needed injection of life (sorry); he's Mr. Cool, and everyone knows it, including him.  He is separate from the neighborhood boys and rightly so.  When he is disposed of, rather abruptly I might add, you want to see him again.  Dunst is very good at knowing which buttons on a boy to push - she knows what she's doing, but again, her situation does not allow for much stretching.  Woods and Turner as the parents are fine but I still would have liked some insight into them as people.Sofia has a bright future behind the camera, judging from this effort. 7/10.",The Virgin Suicides
44,Sherazade,Very profound and hard to take...,7,27 March 2006,"This film stayed with me for a while. It just makes you think, you know, it makes you wonder what if? It's the story of an overly religious woman (Played by Kathleen Turner) living in the suburbs with her husband and kids and the effects her overly religious ways has on the lives of her teenage daughters. John Hartnett played the love interest of the most popular Lisbon daughter (played stirringly by Kirsten Dunst) and his character's actions in the film send the girl down a destructive path with catastrophic results. Lux (Dunst) is able to influence her sisters into joining her in making the ultimate sacrifice at the end of the film, in order to be free of their mother forever. James Woods plays the father of the Lisbon girls and husband to Turner's Mrs. Lisbon with such subdued finesse, it's heartbreaking and Danny Devito rounds out the cast starring here as Dr. Horniker.",The Virgin Suicides
45,Seraphion,Great showcase for young talents then,6,29 August 2015,"The movie brought high school movie sub-genre to a weird spot as it places the high school life backgrounds and all the complexities surrounding it facing the contrast element of death and loss and coping with them. The movie goes curiously with it's opening and builds its story casually after-wards. The time frame background permits the story to exhibit cultural practices that may be deemed strange by people nowadays. Yet these weird practices gives a great way for the story to development into it's unpredictable ending. The acting overall is surprisingly good. James Woods and Kathleen Turner did their parts well in acting out as the parents. This movie sure was a showcase to display then young talents such as Kirsten Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Hayden Christensen and even Leslie Hayman. Cameos and smaller parts by Michael Pare and Danny DeVito nicely add some flavor to the movie as a whole.",The Virgin Suicides

The actors are decent, but my main problem with this film is the writer. How could him make a so interesting subject become a boring movie with no hard reflections about it.I don't recommend this, I'm only giving it 3 stars because I'm interested in the subject and it's good at showing that doesn't matter what you as parent do, your son/daughter will want to have sex and seek for it, independently of what you say or do.

Soon, I rented it on VHS and enjoyed it. Being that it is Sofia Coppola's debut movie, with Lost in Translation being her most popular, it's worth watching again and again. The soundtrack by French new wave band Air is classy, and the casting of the women is amazing. Kirsten Dunst is pretty good in this movie during the year she became a huge star thanks in part to Bring it on, crazy beautiful and the cat's meow the year after, and in 2002 her biggie in Spider-Man.",The Virgin Suicides
48,lewiskendell,Fine debut from a promising director.,7,22 January 2011,"""Cecilia was the first to go.""What defines Sofia Coppola to me as a director is the distinctive atmosphere that accompanies each of her movies. Whether she's adapting someone else's work or making a movie based on her on material, that otherworldly feeling is there. It doesn't matter if the film is focused on the mundane (Lost in Translation) or an incomprehensible tragedy (The Virgin Suicides), you can tell that she's the director. That distinctive fingerprint is what makes her one of my favorite directors, even though I think she's yet to make a masterpiece.The Virgin Suicides is the story of five adolescent sisters of various ages, told from the perspective of the four boys that knew them. Knew them as well as the audience gets to, I guess I should say. We only see fragments of the girl's lives, as their overprotective parents keep them mostly hidden away from the world, and Coppola also follows that mold with her film and storytelling style. Of the girls, we get to know Lux (Kristen Dunst, in what I think was the best performance she's given), the flirtatious, lovely middle child, the most. This is a movie full of great performances, actually, from the five girls playing the daughters, to Josh Hartnett, James Woods, and several others. Even the periodic narration was excellent, which is not something I say very often. I think the best way to watch The Virgin Suicides is with little expectations, like I did. It's a beautiful, haunting movie that isn't perfect, but will stick with you for days and begs to be watched again.",The Virgin Suicides
49,Lady_Targaryen,First movie made by Sofia Coppola,6,8 March 2006,"I expected more from ''The Virgin Suicides''. This movie is told to be so good and even having a big name as Sofia Coppola helped me to have a big interest in watching it. But I found it a little bit boring, and also without a purpose: Okay, the girls committed suicide because they hated the life they were having with their horrible mother (Kathleen Turner) and called the boys because they wanted them to be witnesses of their suicide. And? I really lacked some reality in this movie. Not only from the parent's isolation from the world(come on,any teenager I know would try to escape from that horrible parents,me included) but some scenes after the Lisbon's girls died are so out of place, like the party where people uses gas masks.Nice thing to see Josh Hartnett as Trip in this movie. He was always beautiful,but definitely changed for better.aka ""As Virgens Suicidas"" - Brazil",The Virgin Suicides
50,DeeNine-2,A strange and original teen angst film,8,10 January 2006,"This was Sofia Coppola's first film, and it is an interesting one. Superficially it's a teen angst story featuring the usual dysfunctional parents, idiot school teachers, prom night hijinks, first love, and the inevitable loss of innocence. But on a deeper level this film is a variation on such films, done in an artistic manner and told from an unlikely point of view.Consider that the story focuses on five teenaged girls who committed suicide. Yet their story is seen from the point of view of the high school boys who adored the girls, boys who seem curiously younger than the girls (as in reality most boys are relative to girls of the same age). There is one exception and that is Trip Fontaine played by Josh Hartnett. He is big and handsome and worldly wise (for his age). He is charming and adored by just about everyone, especially by all the girls in the school. But his desire is directed toward Lux Lisbon, the oldest of the ill-fated Lisbon sisters. Initially she doesn't seem interested in him, but that only serves to whet his appetite, and then... Well, let's just say that players only love you when they're playing--or something like that.The tragedy seems a bit effete in the telling. The suicides seem excessive and monstrously headstrong. Mom and Dad, you WILL pay for this! There's the overbearing and dictatorial mother who cares only about appearances, played menacingly by Kathleen Turner. James Woods serves as both the father of the girls and as a somewhat spacey math teacher who seems to have no idea that he and his wife are suffocating their children. Kirsten Dunst is the enigmatic Lux who dies more from a broken heart than from the fumes of exhaust.In the end the boys are left wondering what happened and why and what they could have done differently. But life in the upper middle class suburban town goes on. An older Trip Fontaine is interviewed as in a documentary. He more or less shrugs his shoulders. TV reporters mouth clichés. Neighbors play golf and flirt and drink excessively. The boys grow older but no wiser. The elms are cut down, the house is sold, and again life goes on and on and yet there is no answer, no justification, no meaning to the tragedy of five girls who snuffed out their lives for...what? Bottom line: interesting and original but strangely artificial as though the girls were Barbie dolls briefly brought to life and then put back into their boxes.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",The Virgin Suicides
51,wisewebwoman,"Powerful, simple movie",8,1 January 2001,"I got so involved in this movie that James Woods and Kathleen Turner did not register with me as the stars, that is how good their performances were.  It was recommended to me in the video store, so still have not read any reviews. I gave it an 8 out of 10 for the great, mysterious script, the fabulous performances by all the young people (there is not a false note with any of them)and Woods and Turner who get so into their roles. Do not miss this one.  It is like something you have never seen before. There is tremendous empathy for both the girls and their parents and the obsession of the boys in the neighbourhood with their mystery and beauty.  The symbolism of the Dutch Elm Disease and the poisoning of the lake is wonderful also. No 2 by 4's pounding every emotional point home here.

52,Screen_Blitz,"Sofia Coppola's tragic examination on teen sexuality and lust is very mature, yet gripping in its roots",7,31 August 2017,"Sofia Coppola, daughter of Hollywood titan Francis Ford Coppola, attempts on making a striking comeback after her poorly received portrayal on the third chapter of her father's 'Godfather' trilogy. It is safe to say that the former actress may have a more promising future behind the camera than in front. That is where an enchanting adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides's novel of the same name comes into play. This teen drama, tackling on teens exploring underage sexuality and testing social boundaries beyond the incarceration of their strictly conservative household, defies against the typical light-hearted conventions known for teen-oriented films such as The John Hughes classics or screwball comedies like 'American Pie', in favor of a slightly more mature look at adolescents' coming of age. The story at hand focuses on the tragedy that ensues among teens who fail to make sense of a world in which they are never understood and instead viewed as puzzles with missing pieces. Set in 1974 in a woodsy town in Michigan, this film tells the story focuses on the life of five mysterious teen sisters of the names Cecelia, 13 (played by Hanna Hall), Lux (played by Kirsten Dunst), 14, Bonnie (played by Chelsea Swain), 15, Mary (played by A.J. Cook), 16, and Therese (played by Leslie Hayman), 17. These five girls are tightly sheltered by their strict religious parents (played by James Woods and Kathleen Turner), and as a result, lacking of social life beyond the confinement of their home. Their mysterious lifestyle gains the attention of a group of neighborhood boys who fantasy about them day-by-day. However, it is a lifestyle that drives Cecelia into depression, eventually leading to her suicide. Her death ignites a rebellion in her sisters, particularly Lux, who began to explore social boundaries including dating, sex, and staying out past curfew with tragic consequences. Who are these girls? What is the psychological nature surrounding these girls? These are questions that become the crux of the story as it explores the mystery surrounding the overprotective life of these five sisters. Their parents have sheltered them on such a short leash, and it is only a wonder of how this mysterious lifestyle has brought upon them. Although the girls are the core subjects of this tale, the story is told largely from the perspective of the neighborhood boys who expense their curiosity on what goes on behind the closed doors in a way that's lustful. Another mystery is evolved when the youngest sister Cecelia commits suicide, marking the turning point of the story. That is when the story ignites with powerful interest. As these girls began exploring into teen dating and sexuality, there is a sense of melancholy revolving around the relationship Lux develops with high school heartthrob Tripp Fontaine (played by Josh Harnett) and the consequences that ensue, leaving the sisters stripped away from their life in the social circle. Although Coppola's direction stumbles with providing a strong emotional core, she proves capable to keeping the story moving as it builds up to its predictably tragic ending, one that wraps the story in a sense of mystery and uncertainty not just for us but for the characters as well. Sure, there are occasional burst of humors injected throughout the story, but perhaps not enough that will viewers without a feeling heaviness. As for the cast, which is built up of mainly solid actors with little to a moderate amount of credits under their belts, everyone hits the right notes. There are definitely no performances that shout out for an Oscar. Regardless, this cast shows they have what it takes to tackle on such a tragic story. Virgin Suicides is an example of a directorial debut gone right thanks to Sofia Coppola and her unseen talent on tackling on mature subject matter with only small flaws at hand. This is not your average teen drama that will leave viewers uplifted, but one that will leave gripped with an important message about how everyone has a mystery surrounding them, big or small. Some people come and go without you getting the know the true person they are.",The Virgin Suicides
53,baumer,Nepotism at it's finest ( worst ),1,10 May 2000,"Warning: does contain spoilersNepotism: favourtism, especially towards ones relatives. ( Webster's Dictionary )Nepotism:  it's not what you know but who you know. ( everyone else )I am now convinced that everyone is a sheep.  I have been reading the reviews in here and from professional critics and I can't believe what I am seeing.  People are saying that this film is brilliant and wonderful and heart wrenching and such.  They say that Sophia Coppola has made a hauntingly auspicious debut with The Virgin Suicides.  And I saw the film yesterday and I can't believe I was watching the same film that these people were.  Because when I left the theater I was angry, again.  Angry that a film like this was allowed to be made simply because Sophia is Youknowwho's daughter.  And look at the cast in here.  Many of them are Coppola cronies that have appeared in his films before.  You have Kathleen Turner who was in Peggy Sue Got Married.  Danny DeVito was in Rainmaker and of course you have Scott Glenn as the priest, who was in Apocolypse Now.  James Woods doesn't have a direct connection with Coppola, work wise, but he sure is a Scorsese cronie and Scorsese and Coppola are friends so I'm sure Woods and FFC have met on many occassions.These four names, although not Hollywood heavyweights like they once used to be, are still quite a casting coup to get for your first film that looks like it has the budget of a used car.  Toss into the frey Giovanni Ribisi, Josh Hartnett and Kirsten Dunst and you have a great cast that can do wonders with almost any material given to them.  This however, is not one of those films.  I'm not sure if it's inepptitude can be solely blamed on Sophia Coppola but since she is the writer and director, where else can you look.  This is not a haunting film.  This is not a tragic film and this is not a great directorial debut.  This is a film that has very little plot that we haven't seen before, and it is quite poorly directed and very poorly paced.The Virgin Suicides tells the story of the Lisbon family seen though the eyes of the neighborhood boys that were not really in love with them, even though the script will have you believe that, but rather more confused, fascinated and in bewilderment of them.  The girls are all beautiful and they are all untouchable because of over-protective parents and moreso an over zealous mother who used Jesus as her savior and reason to not let her children out of the house.  She doesn't want them anywhere near boys and when she finally does let them go to a dance, she makes them wear identical dresses and adds cloth to the length and to the bust line.  Okay, so this is nothing that we haven't seen or heard about before.  Take films like Carrie, Mommie Dearest, The Menenez Brothers etc and this kind of thing is something that has been done before.  But then the daughters all die and we know that because of the title.  So now the rest of the film has to show us why they decided to expire themselves.  Why did they kill themselves?  That is really the question.  And of course we all know that it is because of mom and dad. Ho Hum.Now I am not opposed to ideas being recycled, after all, there are only so many stories you can tell.  Eventually they just become variations of the original.  Karate Kid is a rehash of Rocky, all Cyborg films are a rehash of The Terminator and every action spy movie is a clone of James Bond etc. etc. So now the trick is to tell your story well and do something intriguing and exciting to keep the audience interested.  Take what American Pie did or even a film like True Lies.  American Pie was a retread of Porky's, Fasttimes and many other teen films from the 80's.  But they added some 90's gross out humour along with some revamped gigs from its predecessors.  True Lies had a funny script and a funny Arnold and Arnold to play off each other and so now it stands on it's own as a great spy flick.  The Virgin Suicides not only isn't original, it isn't entertaining or even very good.  And that has to start with Sophia Coppola.I counted, ( after I began to count ) about 10 different segments in the film that had no bearing to the story, just shots really, that were there for no other reason than to be there ( was there an editor present on this film?).  There was one scene where the girls are in a bathroom together and they do nothing there.  They don't really talk, they don't give away a big secret, they don't do anything.  And then it goes onto the next scene.  Now that is maddening.  Coppola's direction is ambiguous, unfocussed and doesn't have any aim as to what she is trying to say.  Not only that, but if you want it in plain english, the film is boring, tedious and quite pretentious. Maybe she has better films in her future but she is going to have a short career in Hollywood if she keeps making films like this that are crap.The Virgin Suicides is actually one of the worst films I have seen in my life.  But it does one thing and that is it confirms one of the oldest adages in the world."" It's not what you know but who you know.

I completely did not care about these boys reminiscing about their fascination with a bunch of teenage girls who were brought up in an overly strict home.

Perhaps there would be that moment of shock where the entire movie I watched up to that point would be turned on its head, and I might actually be impressed. But since I know there's going to be more than one suicide in the film I was shrugging my shoulders and just pleased that meant the movie was ending. Most of the cast is mediocre at best, but they aren't given much to do anyways. I can't say much more, because I struggled to even pay attention to this film. It's not even a good statement on the dangers of suicide in teens because they make the living conditions for these girls so extreme that it's not relatable to real life.

56,MrGKB,It's easy to see how Coppola got further work...,6,27 May 2012,"...based on the evidence of this auteur debut (despite its flaws), but I'm thinking that if I were to read the source novel from which she adapted this precocious little fairy tale, I'd be disappointed with what she ultimately accomplished. Essentially a memory tale of adolescence ala ""Stand By Me"" and other far superior films, with a strong subtext of upper-middle class anomie and distress, ""The Virgin Suicides"" marks the beginning of Coppola's multiple collaborations with Kirsten ""Melancholia"" Dunst, with every suggestion that Dunst serves as Coppola's idealized self. I have little doubt that their latest venture, ""The Bling Ring,"" is going to explore similar territory.Well-shot by DP Edward ""The Lord's of Flatbush"" Lachman, with an evocative score from the French electronica band, Air, and a passably interesting (though somewhat anachronistic) soundtrack, ""The Virgin Suicides"" limns the absurdly romantic self-destruction of a family of five seemingly well-adjusted girls in a mid-70s setting of (presumably stifling) suburban contentment. Despite strong efforts from cast and crew, however, the story just doesn't hold much water; the back story is sketchy and motivations seem tenuous at best. The inexplicable suicide of the youngest daughter to the side, little is done to establish the sort of neurotic group-think that would lead the remaining quartet to indulge in following her like lemmings over the existential cliff. Sure, there's a somewhat draconian parental crackdown in the wake of Dunst's dalliance with the school bad boy (well-played by Josh ""The Faculty"" Hartnett in an embarrassing Prince Charming wig), but since the rest of the daughters are little more than cyphers, it's nigh on impossible to accept such suicidal solidarity as believable, let alone the exhibitionistic manner in which it's accomplished. Mayhaps my impression of it all as a fairy tale is apt; I can only leave that as a thought for potential future viewers.Nonetheless, there's still plenty to like about Coppola's maiden effort. The acting is quite good: Dunst, despite being obviously older than the 14-year-old she plays, is marvelous, evincing all the traits of vulnerable beauty and delicate angst for which she's known; support from the likes of Hartnett, James ""Videodrome"" Woods as the well-meaning but mostly ineffectual father, and Kathleen ""Body Heat"" Turner as the zaftig, domineering mother, along with bit parts from Danny ""Taxi"" DeVito, Scott ""The Right Stuff"" Glenn, and Michael ""Streets of Fire"" Paré, and journeyman appearances by Jonathan ""The Ruins"" Tucker and Hayden ""Star Wars: EpII-III"" Christensen, all contribute to Coppola's unified vision, blurry though it may be. Some of the lesser characters are a bit stiff, but there's really little for them to do anyway, and for the most part they're easily accepted.That Coppola progressed from this flawed but impressive debut to the triumph of ""Lost in Translation"" and then fell from grace into the disappointing failures of ""Marie Antoinette"" and ""Somewhere"" somewhat mystifies me, but that likely won't stop me from catching up to her latest endeavor, if only to see if her apple can roll back toward the tree from which it fell.",The Virgin Suicides
57,CitizenCaine,"A Stunning, Heartfelt Debut By Sofia Coppola",9,15 March 2004,"Sofia Coppola directs her first film The Virgin Suicides based on the novel by Jeffrey Eugenides. The film is a stunning, heartfelt debut about a group of teenage girls with odd, strict parents and the boys that admire them, yet can't understand them or what happens in their family. Very few films evoke the charm, innocence, and inquisitiveness of adolescence with such accurate sensitivity. Coppola builds mood effectively as one of the boys narrates as an adult, looking back at this time. The film creates a haunting portrait of a time when sexual mores loosened more than in any other period perhaps. This was due to increasing wide spread use of the pill, approved for use in the 60's, the passage of the abortion law in 1973, and the upswing of divorce. Yet the film is not about loss of virginity. It's about loss of innocence and lack of experience. I'm not talking about sexual experience, but life experience; therefore, the inability to obtain an understanding about life through experiences. There comes a time in every teenager's life when that loss of innocence either turns into experience and understanding, or bewilderment as a result of staying emotionally insulated from events surrounding him/her.Several scenes stand out as wonderful illustrations of teenage awkwardness, idealization, first love, strong feelings, etc. There is an absolutely wonderful scene of the kids playing records back and forth in alternating phone calls between the boys and girls that perfectly encapsulates the strong emotional connection teenagers had, still have, and probably always will have between music and their feelings. The cinematography is marvelous and the soundtrack is simply wonderful with very scene appropriate music either from the period or sounding from the period, although a few songs are out of the realm of possibility for the actual time. James Woods and a weathered Kathleen Turner play the girls' helpless parents to perfection. The young actors portraying the girls and boys are all fine, particularly Josh Hartnett as Trip and Kirsten Dunst as Lux. Hartnett embodies the misdirected, bad boy type perfectly and Dunst is a wonder as the teenage girl, simultaneously yearning to be free, yet dutifully obedient. The idealized illustration of the girls by the adult Trip demonstrates how, as teenagers, we want to think of things as they affect us only, instead of what the events were apart of in a larger context. The adult Trip is forever bewildered about a group of teenage girls. ***1/2 of 4 stars.",The Virgin Suicides

59,jhclues,Auspicious Debut For Writer/Director Sofia Coppola,10,23 May 2001,"This is a film about moments in life.  Some are so horrible you just want to forget them, but can't; others-- and they are rare-- are perfect, but they don't last.  First time director Sofia Coppola, who also wrote the screenplay, based on the novel by Jeffrey Eugenides, captures the essence of those moments in `The Virgin Suicides,' which is much more than `just' a film.  It's a poem.  And it's devastating.  The story is told from the collective point of view of four young men, friends since childhood, who twenty years later are still trying to put together the pieces of a puzzle and make some sense of what happened those many years ago.  All they know, even now, is that the five Lisbon girls were their friends, and then they were gone.  And as you watch the story unfold-- like those boys-now-men who can't forget-- you wonder how such a thing could happen, as well.	Coppola (daughter of Francis Ford Coppola) makes a strong case for the science of genetics, as her debut behind the camera as writer/director is nothing less than brilliant.  She does everything to perfection.  She knows her characters inside and out and how to best bring them to life.  And the film is so lyrically presented.  With her camera, she captures the beauty of nature, as well as the beauty that can be found in the mundane, everyday things that make up a life, using music and the juxtaposition of images to optimum effect.  Tragedy born of ugliness is one thing, but when tragic events are so poetically rendered, it's like an overwhelming darkness loosed upon the world from the abyss, which blots out the nurturing light of the Sun.  And that's what Coppola has done with this film.  She leads you through the beauty to find the beast; and though you know what's coming, the impact of it all is still staggering.	Central to the story is Lux, second youngest of the five teenagers, a character wonderfully realized by the talented Kirsten Dunst, whose angst is something to which everyone who has ever been a teenager will be able to relate.  Repressed and sheltered, she nevertheless manages to express that spark of life roiling just beneath the surface and begging to be freed. Dunst plays her from deep within, with a richly textured performance that is right on the money.  And as Cecilia, the youngest of the sisters, Hanna R. Hall gives a notable performance that is poignant and introspective, which underscores the foreboding that establishes the underlying tone of the film. 	Excellent, also, as the other three sisters, are A.J. Cook (Mary), Chelse Swain (Bonnie) and Leslie Hayman (Therese).  Coppola exacts memorable performances from each of them, and the casting of this film was terrific. Physically, it is easy to believe these five are sisters; and one especially-- Hayman-- bears a striking resemblance to Kathleen Turner, who plays Mrs. Lisbon.	As the mother of the doomed girls, Kathleen Turner turns in a performance fraught with subtle indications to the real key behind the mystery of the suicides:  The ever present cross she wears around her neck, her actions following an especially spirited sermon at Mass one Sunday, and the religious icons present throughout the house, which combined with Mrs. Lisbon's attitudes are very telling in themselves.  She epitomizes the overprotective parent in her futile attempts to shelter her girls from the world.  That she loves them is never in question; the reasons behind her extreme position in their regard, however, is.  Are her actions really for `their own good,' or for hers?  Is her overprotection of them due to the fact that she doesn't want anything untoward to happen to them for their sake, or is it because she couldn't bear it herself?  In the end, who is she really protecting?  Looking beautiful, but rather matronly-- as befits the character-- Turner does an exemplary job of bring Mrs. Lisbon to life.  She is the pivotal character of the film, and she makes the most of it with an extremely credible performance.	As Mr. Lisbon, James Woods gives an affecting performance with his portrayal of a loving husband and father whose position is never quite certain; he acquiesces to Mrs. Lisbon on just about everything, but does have at least one moment when he is able to reason with his wife on the girls' behalf and prevail.  Ultimately, however, it becomes a pivotal moment that leads to tragic consequences.  But Woods plays it well, taking a rather middle-of-the-road stance with his character, who retreats into his work as a math teacher when life gets too close.  	The supporting cast includes Josh Hartnett (Trip), Michael Pare (Adult Trip), Scott Glenn (Father Moody), Danny DeVito (Dr. Horniker), Jonathan Tucker (Tim), Anthony DeSimone (Chase), Lee Kagan (David), Noah Shebib (Parkie) and Joe Dinicol (Dominic).  Coppola's film is a taste of what it must be like to be a young girl, growing up in a repressive environment and laden with the reasonless guilt of a self-serving mother who finds sin even in innocence.  `The Virgin Suicides' is a brilliant, thought provoking film that makes a profound statement about the artifice of love and the inability to recognize denial in oneself, especially in a parent who seeks to protect, perhaps, only to assuage personal fear.  A powerful, beautiful film, and without question one of the best of the year (2000).  I rate this one 10/10.",The Virgin Suicides
60,CharltonBoy,The charming but strange story.,7,30 April 2001,"I saw from one other readers comments that The Virgin Suicides is depressing,well let me put the record straight ,this film in no way is depressing. I would go as far as to say this is a happy film, which may sound strange considering the 5 girls the film revolves around all commit suicide. This movie is about the innocents of youth, no so much the girls but the boys who are fascinated by the sisters. There are some critisism of this film , the main one is quite an important one and that is we never really find out why any of the girls take their own lives. At no stage do they look or act depressed in fact they seem like very happy sisters even though their mother and father are fairly strict in way they treat the girls. If you are after a good action movie then this isn't for you but if you like a film that makes you think the The Virgin Suicides is for you. 7 out of 10.",The Virgin Suicides
61,sjanders-86430,Sofia Coppola directed Edward Lachman cinematographer,10,12 March 2021,"Kirsten Dunst and Josh Hartnett fall in love and enjoy their prom night. The colors at the prom of blue and white balloons captures my memories of my prom night. Kathleen Turner the mom overreacts to the prom night by taking the girls out of school and imprisoning them. They can't develop their characters while being stuck in their house. The neighborhood boys watch them on the roof where they escape their mother. James Wood plays their emasculated dad. The elm tree is cut down in the front of their house. All the elm trees became infected at this time in the 70s. Cecilia killed herself first. By trying to overprotect her daughters' virginity she lost them completely. Maybe they killed themselves because the mother made them fear life and sex.
The elm trees' disease is the metaphor for the mother's fear of life. The only way they could remain virgins was by suicide. This story captures that fleeting moment when love and sex are pure and wonderful and never to be the same. This image of the girls remains in the minds of the neighborhood boys. The suicides saved the image for the boys. My boyfriend in high school died in a car accident and that death preserved his young image to perfection. A young death preserves that beautiful face forever.",The Virgin Suicides

63,perfectbond,Moody melodrama,8,14 March 2004,"While this movie might lack a standard plot structure it succeeds spectacularly in capturing the mood and feel of a certain generation. Obviously this movie will speak loudest to those who experience adolescence in the seventies but it also communicates strongly to all people recollecting that period of their lives. The great tragedy imparted in this movie is that of young beauty extinguished and the fruitless search to discover how this crime against nature could have occured. The cast is uniformly good though James Woods (one of my favorite underappreciated performers) and Kirsten Dunst really shine. I enjoyed the mood this film conveys enough to view it twice.

65,alice liddell,"This is a genuine Dream Life of Angels. (possible spoiler, but so's the title)",9,22 May 2000,"This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.  I don't know what it's about, and I don't want to, but I do now that as the credits rolled I hugged my wife so hard she couldn't breathe.  Even in independent and world cinema circles, there has been of late a refusal of enigma, obfuscation, the mystery of life - plot must be asserted, everything explained, loose ends tied up.  Coppola gets rid of all that fraudulence with stunning economy - she gives away the plot in the very title.  If, finally, she doesn't quite reach the mysterious power of her film's most repeated comparison, PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK, than maybe, creditably, it's because her characterisations are too strong.Inevitably, patronisingly, people have been comparing this film to the director's father's work, noting the same destructive families of THE GODFATHER, the teen melodramas of THE OUTSIDERS and RUMBLEFISH, the auburn nostalgia of PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED.  If we must find a link, than surely this is her APOCALYPSE NOW - a man (or a group of men) try to solve a mysterious riddle and only find a heart of darkness, paralysing him forever.
There is no explanation.  What we see is a Benjaminian act of retrieval, a scrapbook of observed reminiscences, rescued trash and journal entries. The sense of a past remembered will always be distorted, evaded, added to, mistaken, misinterpreted, but what hope is there for someone else's reality, people you barely ever saw, parties to widespread, misinformed rumours.The film's sense of magic, the faraway world of evening sun, the quiet leafy suburbs, the evocation of a timeless, indolent, magical world in decay (like SLEEPING BEAUTY where no Prince comes), of glitter, and clouds, and doodles, and colour, might have its basis in the productions of the girls, their outlets - records, letters, diaries, poems etc. - through which they expressed their pain and isolation, but they are ultimately male - mediated, gathered, interpreted, expressed by men.After all, on one level, there is no mystery - one girl killed herself because she loved an uninterested neighbour; the other four were locked up in their house, deprived of life, air (a running motif throughout the film, right down to the soundtrack's composers), flowers left to wither and die. Anyone, in the latter situation anyway, might want to end it all.  It is a typically male idea to make women mysterious, unfathomable, a black hole, a Sphinx.It is Coppola's great achievement to take them out of this dead-end abyss, to restore them to life, to celebrate their creativity, their smiles, their mocking, their desires; especially in the case of Lux, their bodies.  They are only a mystery because nobody has cared to ask.  There is no allegory here, the family are not Everyman enough - while everyone else in the real world is burning bras and hairshaking to soft rock, they are wilting, alone, petrified, ghosts in their own home, they are dead even before the film starts.How did Coppola, then, make a film of such life, of such winning wit?  On one level, the film is a great teen movie, full of recognisable youths, the footballer stud, shades-wearing, uncool buffoon, studious prizewinners; there is the archetypal homecoming dance.  The humour and insight into growing pains are instantly recognisable, and the sheer transcendence of certain scenes - the homecoming party especially - need not have any other overtones beyond the subjective self-dramatising of youths suddenly happening on the world, on life.The film here echoes DAZED AND CONFUSED, especially the climactic coupling on the sports field, but every 'normal' event cannot but take a tragic hue, shadowed by what we know, and as we see Trip Fontaine in some kind of rehab centre after the populist promise of his youth, we hear talk of the decline of the neighbourhood, the collapse of the motor industry, the descent into madness of Mr. Lisbon, the strange religious drive turning pagan that sees Virgins sacrificed, the light (lux) snuffed out, it's like the water has somehow been poisoned.  We cannot even derive satisfaction  from demonising the girls' parents:  Kathleen Turner and, especially, surprisingly, joyfully James Woods, at their warmest and most sympathetic.  SUICIDES is a female counterpart to RUSHMORE.What is most sublime is Coppola's sense of colour, of uneasy compositions (where the focus of interest is often cut off, or drastically minimised on, the screen), her use of Air's heartstopping score, her VAGABONDE-like mixture of drama and 'documentary' witness, her insistence on epiphany throughout the potential gloom, her mastery of tone - the film is surely a tragicomedy (the first burial at the cemetary guarded by striking gravediggers is very funnysad).This is nothing so simple as a 'satire' on suburbia, currently fashionable in award-donating circles - as with MADE IN HONG KONG, there is something inexpressibly, perversely, horrifyingly wrong about characters barely out of pubescence with a death wish.  What makes SUICIDES stand out, though, from the likes of MA VIE SEXUELLE or THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS, is Coppola's willingness to take stylistic risks, visual effects (eg the repeated twinkling in Lux's eyes), that, if they had failed, could have been embarrassing, but, because they don't, are immeasurably poignant.",The Virgin Suicides
66,gigan-92,"""we will never find the pieces to put them back together.""",9,3 December 2011,"Apocalypse Now (1979) and The Godfather trilogy (1972-1990) have made the Francis Ford Coopla an icon in film history. Following in those daunting footsteps is the prodigal daughter, Sofia Coopla. One naturally watches one of her films with certain expectations. I'm glad to say I wasn't let down. The Virgin Suicides (1999), based off the novel of the same name by Jeffrey Eugenides, lacks the in-your-face violence of her father's pictures, but retains the remarkable subtly in its context. Whereas Francis Coopla focused on the underworld of organized crime and the brutality of war, Sofia's debut film was one about the turmoil in the suburbs.Despite not being direct about the family's lives, the film offers many details the audience must pay sharp attention to. Notice the scene early on in the film where one of the boys enters the bathroom of the Lisbon sisters at the chaperoned party scene. As he looks around, close-ups expose the religious objects in their bedrooms, walls, and even their bathrooms. The dull colors of the room differ very greatly from the boys' dream-like fantasy of Kirsten Dunst's character, her orange hair blowing in the wind and her smooth skin bathed in the high-key lighting. Throughout the film we see the boys' vivid sequences of the girls being truly happy, free in a meadow of golden wheat, and extreme close-ups of their seductive features such as the eyes and lips. However, it is hammered constantly and rather darkly just how in contrast the girls' lives are actually lived.The scene of the Lisbon sisters readying for the homecoming dance is a vital one, seeing as the dresses they are forced to wear are drab in color and devoid of variation. It reaches its peak, at least in my opinion, in the long overhead shot of Kirsten Dunst discovering her solitude in the eerily blue low-key lighting of the cold morning on the empty football field. Remember not too long ago as the kids rode together to the dance we saw the bright yellow and oranges of the evening sky and setting sun; creating the distinction between cold loneliness and the warm feeling of belonging. By use of colorful cinematography, camera placement and close attention to details, Coopla creates a movie that hits hard in very quiet ways. Its moments of surreal beauty are constantly paralleled by the harsh grays and pale whites of the Lisbon home that was those girls' harsh reality. Was the theme to the film that religion can be an oppressing authoritarian stronghold on a youth's life, or that women's inner emotions are truly indiscernible by men. Perhaps in the broadest sense, with those many point-of-view shots of people on-looking the Lisbon family plight, the theme to be derived is that humans tend to look away from the problems of others.",The Virgin Suicides
67,FlickJunkie-2,Unrealized potential,6,21 December 2000,"When the debut of a director is bigger news than the film itself, you need to prepare yourself for a disappointment.  Sophia Coppola directs this slow moving film that is a cross between `The Wonder Years' and `Inventing the Abbots' only with a tragic twist.It is the story about five attractive teenage sisters with an oppressive mother (Kathleen Turner), whose over protectiveness drives them all to tragic ends.  Along the way, we have a typical coming of age story with awkward teenagers obsessing over members of the opposite sex despite their parents' misgivings.Though charming at times, the story really doesn't offer a fresh perspective on anything but the suicide angle, and that lacks basis.  Coppola, who also wrote the screenplay based on a novel by Jeffrey Eugenides, is so focused on the coming of age aspect that she completely neglects the motivational foundation for the suicides.  Other than Lux (Kirsten Dunst), we get zero character development of the rest of the sisters.  They all seem to be normal, well-adjusted teens, and then one day they self-destruct.Perhaps the message is supposed to be that suicide can happen to anyone without warning, but that is not how it really happens.  Usually, there are warning signs that are being ignored.  We should have seen hints of such problems with each of the girls.  Instead, we see four of the sisters whose characters are totally undeveloped and who, in the end, turn out to be little more than anonymous body count. In this regard, the film lacks subtlety and depth.To Coppola's credit, the photography was beautifully done and the seventies were well captured.  The teen scenes were done sensitively and realistically, with coy enticements by the girls and false bravado by the boys.  However, the pace was wormlike.  When the film was finished, I was sure it was over two hours, when in fact it was just 90 minutes.The acting was generally good by the teens.  Kirsten Dunst was marvelous as Lux, the coquettish daughter who routinely invites boys for sexual adventures on the roof of her house.  Josh Hartnett also gives a terrific performance as Lux's first love interest.  Kathleen Turner's character was more a looming presence than a dynamic force, but she portrayed the character well.  James Woods was terrific as her obsequious husband, the nerdy math professor who tried to convince his wife to let the girls have a little fun.This film had much greater potential than was realized.  I can't agree with all the rave reviews.  Sophia Coppola did a good job for a directorial debut, especially with the photography, but made some rookie mistakes in pacing and foundation that diminished the film.

69,cariart,Remarkable Debut for Director Sofia Coppola!,8,7 December 2000,"'The Virgin Suicides' is a beautiful, understated, and tragic drama, punctuated by great rock music of the late '70s, and featuring terrific performances, particularly by Kirsten Dunst, Josh Hartlett, and a nearly unrecognizable Kathleen Turner. What makes the film even more remarkable is that it is the directorial debut by Francis Ford Coppola's daughter, Sofia, best known prior to this by her less-than-stellar performance in 'Godfather 3'! Her sensitivity with this material establishes her as a director to be reckoned with, and a true directorial talent!The film focuses on the five Lisbon sisters, beautiful, yet repressed by a religious and overly protective mother (Turner), who encourages their intellectual growth, but tries to block any sexual or emotional stirrings. The girls turn their passions into other channels, bonding tightly with one another, and viewing the world as outsiders. When the youngest attempts, then succeeds at killing herself, the family gains an unwanted notoriety, and a group of local boys begin to worship the remaining sisters from afar, gathering materials, and creating a fantasy world about them.
Lux, the most beautiful and free-spirited of the sisters (Dunst), attracts the attentions of the most popular boy in school, Tripp (Hartnett), who confuses raging hormones with love, and begins a campaign to 'have' her. Winning the respect of their father (James Woods, in another excellent 'against-type' portrayal), he succeeds in wearing the mother down, and arranges 'dates' for the sisters, so he can take Lux to the Homecoming Dance. The party provides the springboard for the tragedy that gives the film its name, and catapults the girls into icons that the boys who admire them can never forget.There are many reasons to buy this film; Coppola's understanding of how boys and girls interact, and her sure touch with their issues about sexuality; Kirsten Dunst's best performance to date, conveying both sweetness, and barely suppressed erotic desire; Kathleen Turner's breakthrough as a character actress, sacrificing her glamorous persona for a stocky and frumpy matron. There are some excellent cameos, as well, particularly Danny DeVito as a clueless psychiatrist, Scott Glenn as a family priest who offers platitudes instead of comfort, and Michael Paré as an older Tripp, reminiscing about Lux, and their 'love'.This is a very special film, one that you will not soon forget!

The movie is completely lifeless, no pun intended. None of the characters display any emotions at all, even after the most extreme events.I watched it from beginning to end and I honestly have no guesses as to the point of this movie. It's not a message about suicidal teens because the writer deliberately ensures we have no understanding of what the girls are thinking.

72,AKS-6,Accomplished first film by Coppola,6,5 December 2000,"[There is MINOR SPOILER in this comment, in fact, I don't think most of you even think of it as a spoiler, just thought I'd mention it.]The Virgin Suicides is an accomplished directing debut by Sofia Coppola. I read the novel by Jeffrey Eugenides three or four months ago and I am surprised at how closely Coppola manages to stay to the dreamy tone of the novel. The film _does_ almost feel like a dream, there are some very beautiful scenes in the film, and the poetic language of the narrator adds to this dreamy feeling.The acting is great, I don't think there's one bad or not-so-good performance in the entire film. Kirsten Dunst and James Woods are the two stand-outs in this great cast, Dunst is very talented and Woods character in this film feels like the opposite of most typical Woods-characters. Woods really makes you feel with his character, who is really a sweet man, but you still can't see why he (the father) agrees to keep the girls at home. Josh Hartnett overcomes one of the worst haircuts known to mankind and delivers a nice and charming performance.Last, but certainly not least, Air's score is quite brilliant and suits the tone and mood of the film perfectly.While The Virgin Suicides is no masterpiece, and at times a little too slow-paced, it shows that Coppola has a talent for directing and writing scripts. Her adaptation of Eugenides novel is faithful, but sometimes the movie feels somewhat episodic. It's a good film, though, and the performances by the cast are great. (6/10)",The Virgin Suicides

While society and the Lisbon family itself avoid the reality of teenage suicide, neighborhood boys due their best to try and understand their beautiful neighbors in captivity. The mood and texture of the film works very well and captures the hopelessness of self obsession. The editing takes center stage while the film centers on Kirsten Dunst and Josh Hartnett who deliver the awkward high school experience that the girls' parents, deftly played by Kathleen Turner as the Matriach protector and James Woods, the apologetic father are ever attempting to shield their girls from. The most telling scenes were the statements surrounding the suicides without saying much, despite neighbor rumor mill and general uncomfortably regarding the subject. Wisely averting the attempt to justify, Coppola pulls that ever prominent decade feel from the events allowing viewers to reason all within the 1970's period of love sick music and uncontrollable teenage desire.

78,yris2002,"quite devastating, but truly worth seeing",8,26 April 2009,"I decided to watch this movie after I found out it had been written and directed by Sofia Coppola. Since I had appreciated Marie Antoinette so much, I got interested in it, although the title didn't promise anything comforting or soothing.In very different contexts, and so distant historical periods, in both movies attention is focused on the difficulty of being an adolescent, in two extreme conditions, where the common element is the tragedy of feeling entrapped in the family environment: the house, being the royal palace of Versailles or an anonymous house of America, becomes a prison, full of despair, anguish, grief, death.What really struck me in the Virgin Suicides is the contrast between the formal external control dominating situations and dialogues, and the sense of devastating anxiety and despair hiding behind that exterior stillness. The gentle light pervading the oneiric moments, the soft tenderness of these young refined and beautiful girls make everything appear too calm, with a strange premonitory sense that something tragic will have to happen and make this surreal atmosphere explode.Really outstanding the whole cast, I would underline the high-range performances offered by the young actors, truly capable of conveying the uneasiness, the difficulty of living when nobody understands you, when even a mother with five daughters having committed suicide, doesn't make out what lacked in her family-prison. Kirsten Dunst, with her distinguishing captivating and at the same time mysterious depth hits the mark.The movie is really worth seeing: between social drama and oneiric vision, it leaves the viewer with a sense of emptiness, of sad regret for those unjustly broken lives, and with deep unresolved questions to be sorted out.",The Virgin Suicides

It is also about the loss of a few things in life: adolescence, happiness, and the most important factor, innocence.Based on the highly praised and bestselling debut novel by Jeffery Eugenides and this film also marks the directing debut of Sofia Coppola, the daughter of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola.The film begins as the adult narrator (Giovanni Ribisi) recalls a horrific series of events that changed the lives of four young teens, all boys who lived in the same Detroit suburb where the events all took place during the seventies.Coppola shows that she has the courage to play the movie in a soft tone and not hammer down the death scenes. Wise move. Another part of the film that is simply astonishing is the cinematography by Ed Lachman (""The Limey""). The shots of the street where the homes around surrounded by elm trees is not only beautiful, but I found it astounding , too. I can say the same for the musical score, which is masterfully done by Air, a French group.The key part of the film are the performances that are definitely first-rate (and some are Oscar-worthy). James Woods is good as the harmless and witty Mr. Lisbon, and so is Kathleen Turner as Mrs. Lisbon, the religious wife who runs the home with an iron fist and no questions asked. What surprised me about Turner was that she's very soft-spoken and never uses physical force as James Coburn displayed in ""Affliction"". Kirsten Dunst's performance as Lux Lisbon, the perfect one of the five Lisbon daughters is simply a knockout. Josh Hartnett is solid as Trip Fontaine, the hunky high school heartthrob who falls in love with Lux for a short time. Danny DeVito and Scott Glenn are good in their cameos and so is Michael Pare as the older Trip, who's in a drug rehab and regretfully admits ""most people never taste that kind of love. At least, I did."" His performance is quietly touching and it's good to see him in a good movie for a change.As for the movie, the suicides are the turning point of the film and like the neighbourhood boys, I was deeply touched, yet I was saddened as well. How could I describe ""The Virgin Suicides"" in a few words. Well, there's one word that best describes it. It's indescribable. End of story.",The Virgin Suicides
80,Darkest_Rose,A Beautiful Movie That Will Not Get Out Of Your Head,10,15 March 2003,"The Virgin Suicides is by far one of the most beautiful and haunting movies i have ever seen. It's about these five beautiful sisters who all commit suicide in a short period of time at a very young age. Their story and life is told by their neighbors, a couple of young teenage boys who become obsessed with the Lisbon sisters and their suicides. This movie was just unbelievably amazing, the cast, the costumes, the music, everything was just so beautiful. I would give the Virgin Suicides 10/10.",The Virgin Suicides
81,mcjensen-05924,The Worst Garbage,2,6 August 2021,"Ok, 15 minutes into this you know that the director and writers have no clue at all how to go about making an engaging movie. James Woods, along with the young girls, are the only people in this movie who displays a hint of acting talent. Kathleen Turned is dreadful. Her dialonge is dumb and her delivery of it even worse. The dialogue everyone is given is trite illogical dung. The directing is lousy all the way around so everyone does incredible and unbelievable stuff throughout. The young boys and love interests of the girls are sickeningly bland and useless. Meandering and pointless scenes drag this film to an imperceptible crawl at times. It's astounding how awful this is. Not much anybody does makes a bit of sense. The young ladies are dazzling and gorgeous, but the plot is so insane that you lose interest very early on in this movie. The parents were cruel, sadistic monsters who say they care about and love their girls yet everything they do seems to indicate they want them to have no life or fun or satisfaction. Complete disconnect. Some of the scenes are jaw dropping asinine and clunky in their ludicrousness. Sofia has no business directing movies, and her acting talents are just as laughable and shoddy. Only in Hollywood could a talentless hack who has no vision or clarity of direction have a successful career riding on her father's bloated reputation. He's really only done a few movies of note himself, to be honest. Anyway while this movie might have a few scenes people find touching and funny, I found it an absolute disgrace. Very difficult to digest, not because of the subject matter but how it was handled. Think about the worst, dumbest movie you've seen. This movie is easily 20 times worse. I give it a star for the lovely young ladies. Soundtrack is pretentious and obvious and 100% non-enjoyable. A lifeless romp through incompetence and depression.",The Virgin Suicides

This stinker had no plot, a mostly unrealistic portrayal of the 70's (yes, I was there), horrendous pacing and no character development to speak of.  Every character in the film could have committed suicide and I wouldn't have given a damn.Usually I'm very generous when rating a film, but this movie was one of the most pretentious pieces of artsy-fartsy trash I've ever had the misfortune to watch.  Even the interactions between the characters was unrealistic, pretentious and forced (apparently to fit a badly written screenplay designed to appeal to some unknown demographic).This is one film I'll be sure to forget about as soon as possible.  I rated it a generous 2/10 (would have given it a one, but I was so relieved to see the girls finally off themselves at the end that I realized the movie did have a little redeeming value... the fact that it finally ended).",The Virgin Suicides

85,HenryHextonEsq,A slight confection; like a masque without didacticism.,7,22 July 2003,"This film is the sort of construct that seems ever on the edge of collapse; there is not actually much there, and the actual matter of the film doesn't make a radical virtue of this.One never gets to know or feel that much about the protagonists; whether the goggle-eyed, impotent boys or the inscrutable, tabula rasa girls, whose neuroses and suicidal motives are almost entirely vague and obscured. Dunst is quite a creature, I must say; the most epigrammic of all in that she allows us glimmers of real emotion amidst the stylized, sombre inscrutability. There is little point looking to the plot events or the narrative structure to cast much light on affairs; both are flimsy, summed up by the rather slapdash voice-over. The VO device, as so often in recent American films, is a pointless, glib hindrance to the effect of the film. The mystery - so studiedly evoked by Miss Coppola in much of the picture - is always muted and cheapened by the predictable, facile words spoken in voice-over.Now, James Woods - in a wonderfully cloddish turn - and Kathleen Turner - impressively dowdy and intimidating - are absolutely splendid as the subtly dysfunctional parents. Not cliched ogres, but fleshed-out characters; they alone seem to provide any sense of motivation. But also the musical soundtrack; not really Air - theirs is fair fare but predictable and lacking variation - but the oft affecting choice of 1970s period pop songs - such forgotten figures as Gilbert O'Sullivan are resurrected, and hit home.All is vague as to the exact time setting, and the choice of records seems to place the film in a very vague, part-idealized 1970s-per-se. The film can thus be seen as a neatly drawn if slight dream narrative; it is fine really, for what it is, though with maybe too many feet in mainstream waters. Also, it's a bit too transparent in construction compared to its clear precursor, ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"". Though both films hold onto their sense of a central enigma, Weir's film troubles the soul far more. ""The Virgin Suicides"" is competent film-making, and a promising debut from Sofia Coppola, but it lacks especially careful and thoughtful handling; and it lacks much of a script.Rating:- *** 1/2/*****",The Virgin Suicides

87,blakiepeterson,A Haunting Fantasy Of Suburbia,7,2 May 2015,"I've always told friends of mine that my dream girl would be a combination of Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, Liz Phair, and PJ Harvey, a sort of 1990s alt-rock hellion/cool actress who also has a slick sense of humor. It's all fantasy, sure — no one on the face of the Earth probably has all the qualities I like most about these women — but everyone, young or old, is guilty of materializing love, romance, lust, whatever you may call it. One can only imagine all the '70s era teenage dudes who saw that infamous Farrah Fawcett poster and thought ""I want a girl like that"", and one can only imagine the present-day tween girls who are still sobbing over the fact that their ideal husband, that black haired smolderer from One Direction, has left the boy band in favor of a normal life. Everyone knows they can't always have who they want, but why not obsess over the things you can't and never will have? In some ways, desire is even more dangerous than contentment; contentment is temporary, while desire can last for ages, forever.Upon the release of The Virgin Suicides in 2000, critics and audiences were perplexed as to why all the Lisbon daughters (expect for the subtly tortured Cecilia) all killed themselves on the same day. Was it the fault of their overprotective parents? The boys who looked at them as objects rather than people? Their deaths cannot be looked at too analytically because the film is far too cryptic to give too much away. The Virgin Suicides, however, is not cryptic when displaying what these girls represent: the childhood crushes you never made it with/understood/got to know, the idealism of sex in a pre-sex world, the fantasies you made better in your head but ignored in the scheme of reality. The deaths are not just tragic; they also act as the demise of idealism. What happens when you step out from the shadows and realize that a golden-haired Lisbon girl or a Jennifer Lawrence/Emma Stone/Liz Phair/PJ Harvey combination do not and will not exist anywhere other than in your dreams? The film marks the beginning of that awkward period in which you begin to shed the wool skins of rose-colored childhood and try- on the brutal truths of adulthood. The Lisbon family appears to be a healthy, picture perfect rendering of the American family. Father (James Woods) is a well-liked math teacher at the local high school. Mother (Kathleen Turner) is a doting housewife. Their beautiful daughters, Lux (Kirsten Dunst), Cecilia (Hanna Hall), Bonnie (Chelse Swain), Mary (A.J. Cook), and Therese (Leslie Hayman), are pretty in the most untouchable of ways. The neighborhood boys are fascinated by them. Neighborhood girls want to look like them, to be them. But after Cecilia attempts suicide, the pleasant landscape begins to fade. Father is unhappy, passive, almost a ghost. Mother is overly possessive, forcing her daughters to dress in modest clothes, punishing them with isolation in retaliation for the slightest mistake. But then Cecilia goes through with her suicidal intent. Lux has sex for the first time. The boys become even more intrigued. In response, the Lisbon parents keep their daughters in such confinement that most would accuse them of abuse. Then, they all kill themselves at the same time. The end.Or is it? The lives of the Lisbon girls were short and enigmatic, but their porcelain beauty haunts the pubescent boys who lingered over them for so many lusty months. The guy who took Lux's virginity (Josh Harnett) abandoned her that very same night — a sickening move, considering the location (a football field) — but in retrospect, he talks about her like she was his true love, unmatched by any other. The narrator is plagued with the confusion surrounding their deaths, as if he can't understand why the Farrah Fawcett poster on his wall would suddenly leave him alone to experience the real world. The combination of the loss of innocence and such a traumatic event leaves them stunted, trapped in sweatiness of their younger days.The remarkable restraint of The Virgin Suicides is what makes it such an exceptionally eerie piece. The directorial debut of Sofia Coppola, who has gone on to make other masterpieces in understatement, such as Lost in Translation and Somewhere, is photographed in an unsettlingly warm sepia lens and finds its music in period songs that don't quite fit, making for a soundtrack that obviously uses tunefulness to hide a souring inside. What Coppola has done here is remarkable: She creates a conceptually stunning (almost plastic) world but finds the truth in it by keeping things on such a low note. As viewers, we always feel like we're being kept out of something, only heightening the swirling mist of mystery the film initially promises.Sometimes The Virgin Suicides is just too restrained for my tastes, but it doesn't make the film any less mesmerizing. It projects a depressingly comedic but affectingly melancholy aura that leaves a lasting, dreamily nightmarish impression. Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",The Virgin Suicides
88,faraaj-1,Nicely directed little film,8,29 September 2006,"Sofia Coppola showed a lot of promise with her very first feature length writing/directing assignment in Virgin Suicides. There isn't much of a plot and the entire film is shown in flashback. James Woods and Kathleen Turner are the Lisbon's - parents of five beautiful teen-aged daughters. Mr. Lisbon isn't really anyones idea of a man or the family head and Mrs. Lisbon is too much of a puritan. What we don't know at the outset but begin to understand later is that was the reason for the first daughters suicide.Kirsten Dunst playing a spunky younger daughter falls in love with Josh Hartnett, the town stud and starts breaking the rules the tyrannical matriarch wants to enforce. There are very few events in this film but the style is relaxed and very watchable. The characters are well fleshed out even if some of their actions are uncharacteristic although this is an ensemble piece. I would rate this higher than the more celebrated Lost in Translation by the same director.",The Virgin Suicides
89,datorsiers2,''Don't let it die a virgin!'',7,24 June 2015,"A beautifully depressing and sad movie about 5 sisters, who ended their lives at a very young age. The movie has an interesting way of telling a story, the story is told by the boys who loved the girls, but unfortunately the movie feels kind of cold. It is very hard to emotionally engage in the movie, since you never really get any real and emotional character interaction, it never really showed any of the girls communicating with one another.Just 2 of the sisters had their time under the spotlight, for most of the movie, and that, in my opinion, destroyed the real lust and emotions the movie could have had. I wanted to see more character engagement in the film, i get that the idea was to make you feel sad and emotional via the lenghty sad fragments of the girls dieing of boredom, being oppressed by their religious parents, but at least they could have made them talk with each other.When you look at the movie as a whole, it was a really good movie, but then, when you start thinking about some of the details, which i mentioned above, the movie kind of loses its charm and just seems blatant and plain, so it is better to just enjoy it, without trying to figure out the details and flaws of the film.",The Virgin Suicides

Automatically you are drawn to such an interesting and tragic concept. Why? How? That is why I saw the movie, I figured it would be surreal. However, I was rather disappointed. The movie does a very poor job of developing the characters, you really have no concept of what makes anybody in this movie tick. One sister seems to get all of the attention and even still, you are not sure what she is about either. Moreover, the film's story is so fragmented and all over the place. This is a classic case of a director trying to transfer a book to the big screen. Sometimes, you just cannot do it, unless you want to make a six hour film. You leave stuff out and the story just seems incomplete. It is hard not to bring some emotion from this film, the ending is just tragic and you cannot get it out of your mind. However, the poor job of developing all of the characters just leaves me wondering, just how much better this film could have been? How much more tragic? and how much more interesting? ** out of ****",The Virgin Suicides

92,film_riot,The Virgin Suicides,7,18 September 2007,"Sofia Coppola's debut. A debut film that already keeps the promises she fulfilled with ""Lost in Translation"" and also partly with ""Marie Antoinette"". Her trademark is observing the little unspoken things between humans. This makes her one of the most modern directors today, because she is able to catch the feel of a whole generation, if you want to say it impassionately. In ""The Virgin Suicides"" she looks at suburbia with all its falseness and beauty. She looks at inhuman TV journalism. She looks at religious motivated repression. And most of all she shows us girls growing up, struggling with this system, reaching moments of pure luck, but ultimately failing. All of these rather dramatic themes she treats with appropriate seriousness, but also with a big amount of humour, and this fact raises her work on yet another level. Because often humour is the way that lets errors in our society come to light even clearer than big tragedy. The French band Air provided the awesome soundtrack.",The Virgin Suicides
93,TheFilmGuy1,"Had a good concept, needed more of an execution.",7,25 September 2014,"This is a film that has a very odd vibe throughout. There always seems like something isn't quite right. The only issue for me is, you never quite place what the movies' theme is. There bit's and pieces you can interpret and figure out, but the overall theme seems a bit lost on me. What made these boys so obsessed? Their looks? Does this mean the theme is about looks? I really don't know, and if it had been more clear, I would have loved this movie, but because of my confusion, I only liked it.The movie felt like a mix of American Beauty and Donnie Darko. I think that's a pretty good way of putting it. It has a lot of odd things going on. Some of these weird scenes work well, but others... Not as much. Perhaps it's because Sofia Coppola was just starting her directing career and she was trying to figure out her own style. That's what this movie feels like. There are pieces of Sofias style that is present in her later movies, but there's a lot that feels out of her comfort zone. I think the film shows her potential that she eventually expanded upon. One thing I loved was the soundtrack. Both the score and the 70's music used worked really well, and it was cool to hear some of those great 70's classics. Also a lot of the visual style of the flashback-esque scenes of Lux look really great and establish her and the girls as beautiful and dream like. Overall I think it's an interesting movie that has potential, but I don't think it quite delivered 100%. Perhaps the the book that this film was based on is more clear with it's themes and ideas, but this film just wasn't clear enough for me.",The Virgin Suicides

I can't help but say I love a little mystery in a movie, but in this one they just left a little too much unsolved for my taste but I suppose that fits perfectly with this type of story.

95,thinbeach,Here there is suffering,5,24 September 2018,"""We never found the answers,"" goes the monologue at the end, as if the only plausible interpretation is something incredibly mysterious, and no one will notice the deception. The girls who committed suicide were prevented from living a normal life by their parents, who were so overprotective, that in attempt to save them from the horrors of the world - namely, horny teenage boys - they shut them indoors, and in effect, drove them to one much greater. Being a religious family, its obvious where this film is sinking its teeth. I am not religious, but I do not like films designed to attack, especially when they don't even have the backbone to stand behind the very themes they provide!Furthermore, the scenario is not believable. The parents may be uptight, but not even uptight parents go to such extremes, especially those presented as relatively normal, and well-to-do. Had we learnt their backstory and motivations it might have helped, but the narrative is dictated us by a neighbour who knew it not, and the screenwriters save themselves the trouble. Despite a less than ideal situation, the girls never seem even close to distraught enough for suicide, yet alone all at once.It's a shame the films purpose is such, because it is in other ways brilliant. Much of the photography is nice. The awkwardness of adolescence, the silly conversations, the secret escapades like spying on neighbours through a telescope, kissing underneath tables, sneaking out at night, and all the humour therein, is captured expertly with great dialogue and performances. Teenage years are rarely captured so well. The mystery asking why the girls were lead to such outcomes sustains our interest, as we peak across every suburban lawn and classroom smile, as if with our own telescope, looking for clues, hoping to discover something far more profound than we do.",The Virgin Suicides

Four boys in the neighborhood get a hold of her diary and try to discover more about the girls lives and why the suicide happened. From the diary, they learn the struggle of girls to find interesting stuff,their perspective in respect to life that differs from that of the boys; they understand boys more that they do girls,they have complicated perception of the world. The girl's reason for suicide stays a mystery throughout the whole film. Months later, a famous and well liked boy from school falls in love with the most seemingly attractive/bold girl of the group and they end up them with the rest boys going in a car to a party where the lovers kiss out of people sight,under the stage.

98,AZINDN,"Gaps and Pieces, Trivial Facts, and Outrageousness of Human Beings",5,2 May 2007,"In a genteel, middle class, mid-western, middle-minded suburb of any town USA, five beautiful virgins commit suicide. To their parents (James Woods and Kathleen Turner) who wanted them to be happy, marry, and become just like them, it was the ultimate cruel mystery. To the neighborhood boys who noticed and yearned to know and love them, they were the ultimate question marks. And to the sisters, the question they can't avoid is why their sibling slit her wrists and then jumped from her window impaling herself on the fence. This perturbing situation permeates the daily lives of the family afterward as they try to settle into some obscene form of normality but never can quite settle down, nor will others allow them.Surrounding the family are outside eyes that question their every move. Was it the fault of the parents? Or, was it the sisters, their school, their friends, or ultimately the society in which the family interacted? No one has the answers least of all the boys next door who are voyeurs. They long to be with the beauties but have neither the social skills nor the courage to charge the invisible moat surrounding them. Virtual prisoners, the daughters have been made housebound by the grieving parents. Coppola centers the story however on Lux (Kirsten Dunst), who is the target of the ultimate high school magic man Trip Fontaine (Josh Harnett). He lusts after the girl that he ultimately disgraces and abandons on the football field. Never wiser, yet mournful in self-pity and nostalgia, as an adult (Michael Pare), Trip remains shallow and unchanged, a rehabilitation center patient never successful. An entire film dedicated to never answered questions, it is the first film directed by Francis Ford Coppola's daughter, Sophia. Whether this is her own work or one heavily mentored by her father is my question for her latter films seem to lack the kind of subtlety visible here. As a first timer, the deft handling of actors is both lively and insightful. Coppola leaves clues throughout the film in bits and music that answer as much as raise questions.

This is a fascinating attempt at capturing the psychological causes and effects of the terrible denouement.  I suspect that it is impossible to capture the spirit of the book, but this film almost works the impossible.Good performances by a cast of youngsters, bolstered by one or two big names, such as Kathleen Turner as the mother and a ""blink and you might miss it"" length role for Danny De Vito.

101,n-mo,The suicidal suffer - and so do the viewers,5,14 July 2010,"This is the first and to date the only Sophia Coppola film I have seen. I am an iconoclast when it comes to The Godfather part III in that I am probably the only person alive who likes it better than he likes part II. Still, it is curious that someone who was not bothered by the critiques (to put it politely) of her acting in that film because she had ""never wanted to be an actor"" anyway would choose to become a director: is not the principal role, in theater, of any director to direct the cast?Whatever Coppola's natural talent (or lack thereof), her directorial debut has to be proof positive that aristocracy, inheritance, nepotism or whatever you want to call it has its merits. For one thing, thanks to her father's fame, experience and connections, Coppola was not going into this blind or alone and there was no need to reinvent the wheel. The cast and the cinematography should be enough to clear that up.However, my problem with The Virgin Suicides is this: the characters. This has to be a fault of the writing; however, not having read the novel, I cannot say whether that is a fault of Coppola's or of Eugenides's. Whatever the case, no acting could possibly have saved these girls.I'm not particularly bothered by the unrealistically sharp reaction of the mother during the second half, nor by the parents' equally unrealistic defense of the girls in the face of the public. The story itself is not exactly literal and the embellishments must be seen in this light. The destruction of the Lisbon girls is, of course, a cautionary tale and a metaphor of the life-sucking and banalising nature of American Suburbia. The sensationalizing of the paparazzi and the confusion of the locals is a commentary on the absurdity of the whole thing.The thing is, the literal and the metaphorical elements are not well-juxtaposed. Apart from being beautiful and (mostly) innocent, there is really no life to any of these girls, nothing to be sucked out. As such, their destinies did very little to move me. But this wouldn't really be a problem if it weren't for the fact that the film tries to touch on the literal theme of suicide, not only through the commentaries of the observers wondering ""why"" but also through the film's halfhearted attempt at breathing life into one of the girls.Lux, Kirsten Dunst's character, is obviously supposed to be the exception in this ""soulless"" tribe. Unfortunately, her outlets for individuality--the typical teen-angst refuges of alcohol, tobacco, sex and rock music--are no less superficial than the insular half-acre plot she so desperately longs to escape. By the time the girls begin receiving the fliers for exotic vacations, it was too late in the film to convince me that any of them would know where to look for escapist fantasies or even be able to conceive of what a real escape would look like.In short, the script tries to do much in using egoism and suicide as a metaphor for the self-destructive insularity of suburban homesteads and at the same time touch on the literal aspects of what suicide is all about. Suicide is a horrific phenomenon stemming from terrible mental states and a film that attempts to deal with it on a literal level should definitely not banalise the reactions of the self-victim's entourage.The film makes heavy use of Roman Catholic iconography to seemingly little end. At first glance it seems the only thing it does is to give some sort of rationale for the parents' core beliefs about raising daughters, but there is no commentary on how these beliefs affect the course of action: the mother's eventual ""crackdown"" makes almost no reference to religious justification. The priest who comforts Mrs. Lisbon after the suicide of her first daughter assures her that he ""listed Cecilia's death as an accident""--in Catholicism, suicide is grounds for denying Christian rite of burial--and yet the viewer is not comforted one bit by this gentle but false cover-up. Contra the Catholic League, the commentary here is certainly not on religion itself but on the vacuousity of the religious life in American suburbs. Anyone who has spent considerable time living in the suburbs of the United States understands that religion is definitely IN but not OF them.Overall, it is a valiant first effort, though given the poor choice of source material I can't be sure whether this is Coppola's doing or simply the massive fountain of talent she has with her offering heavy padding. It makes me want to see more of Sophia Coppola--if for no other reason than curiosity--but I am not, to say the least, eager to watch this film a second time.",The Virgin Suicides

They seek answers that beget further questions and, like Mrs. Lisbon, could never quite understand the girls. Perhaps the Lisbon sisters truly were women in disguise with the clairvoyance to understand love, and even death, but could not find the noise they sought to fascinate them. Or perhaps that is only part of the truth, if at all.

It stroke a deep cord in me that I could relate to every minute of it. I loved the way Sophia Coppola presented this horrific and heart-breaking experience in a tantalizing dreamy manner. This movie is about a tragedy, but you, unlike other movies, get to examine it only from the outside. You see nothing but the surface. Throughout the movie, you never see any of the girls object or snap at her parents. They are just smiling all the time! The rage, the trouble, the rebellion (or whatever you might call it) that led to the girls' suicide is left for your imagination to speculate and develop. In this movie, the audience is nothing but a real life bystander, seeing nothing but the surface level of things.",The Virgin Suicides
105,danjakubik,Hypnotic and moody,8,9 September 2007,"*** Good Sofia Coppola's directorial debut feature film packs a lot of mood and sense of a particular time and place, largely via cinematography and soundtrack. Sofia Coppola wrote the screenplay based on a relatively unknown bestselling novel from the 90's. Set in Michigan about 1975, we follow the story of five suburban adolescent girls and some neighborhood boys who were captivated by them. The film has an unusual haunting and dreamlike quality to it. James Woods and Kathleen Turner play the parents of these five girls. Kirsten Dunst is especially effective as the 2nd youngest of the girls. The film is about lost adolescent memories and trying to understand them later in adult life. Ms. Coppola's take on the novel focuses more on the characters of the girls as opposed to the book, which highlights the narration. The film uses a voice over by Giovanni Ribisi to narrate the story. Overall, a good, solid debut from director-writer Sofia Coppola.",The Virgin Suicides

However, after a recent viewing, my opinions have changed completely. I think it is one of the most gripping captivating movies I have seen.The emotion conveyed by the acting is outstanding, and the movie on a whole leaves you with an eerie feeling, which I think is quite hard to obtain. The movie soundtrack - Particularly Air's songs - are brilliant, and add to the movies tension.Kirsten Dunst is the best actress in this movie. She comes across very strongly as is needed to play Lux, and manages to hold the attitude that is needed throughout the film. Hannah Hall is also extremely good in this movie, though it is a shame she is in it for such a short space of time.",The Virgin Suicides
108,richard-wheeler,No Parent Would Live A Normal Life If Their Kids Died Before Them.,10,1 May 2006,"A tragic story about five girls: Cecilia Lisbon (Hanna.R.Hall) , Lux Lisbon (Kirsten Dunst), Bonnie Lisbon (Chelse Swain), Mary Lisbon (A.J.Cook) and Therese Lisbon (Lesley Hayman) who all committed suicide due to their dominating mother (Kathleen Turner) and father (James Woods). The parents were so dominating, for example, the parents never allowed the girls to throw a party! And I believe that also refers to not having a birthday party. How strange! The parents were pretty paranoid about their children due to having so many! Good Lord! And that very evening when the girls had their very first party, Cecilia sure did kill herself that time by landing on the spiked fence in their front yard. Tragic! And then, Mr. Lisbon, the girls' friends: Kevin Head (Joe Roncetti), Tim Weiner (Jonathan Tucker), Jo Hill Conley (Hayden Christensen), Chase Buell (Anthony DeSimone) and Paul Baldino (Robert Schwartzman) started seeing Cecilia's ghost. That suggested that your deceased loved ones will always be with you.It was very interesting during that period in America because, there were 80 suicides a day with children in America which made it 30 000 a year! And there was nothing wrong with parents cocooning their children from danger. But they shouldn't go over board. For example, when Lux rocked up at home from the Prom at the early hours of the morning, she then shut the house for maximum security in isolation. And the girls had a curfew daily when school ended.And finally, the creepiest moment in the film was when the girls communicated at midnight with the boys, and when they came over, they found Bonnie hanging from the roof in the basement, Mary with her head stuffed in the oven, Therese took an over dose of sleeping pills. And when morning came, the paramedics found Lux gassed to death by exhaust fumes in the garage! When the bodies where seen at midnight, the music which played gave the most uneasiest, eeriest feeling. Very sensational! And when Mr and Mrs. Lisbon moved away from the house, the dim atmosphere from inside the home was amazing as it stood in silence. And the music gave me that empty feeling. Wow! This was a brilliant movie and is definitely worth owning, renting and watching.",The Virgin Suicides

110,bedazzle,no reason? that's the point,7,2 June 2001,"Interpretation, spoilers (if it's possible given the title):
A film taboo has been broken here, and the subject matter of the film makes this point all the stronger. An unwritten rule exists in cinema, it's basically a science-stripped law of causation. Behavior is to be indiscrete to start, and to build up and up in a progression so that the causes of the climax may be easily ascertained.
Why must all movies follow this pattern? There is a need to avoid confusion because we don't want to make the movie-goer feel stupid, but with certain films such as this a breach is well called for. With the first suicide, attempts were made to explain it by calling a cry for help, an accident, the result of bad parenting... Yet no answer is ever sufficient, it seems that she JUST did it, for no apparent reason.
""What a horrible statement,"" the viewer reflects, but soon the viewer is put at ease when the lockdown occurs. ""Ooohhh, THAT explains it. The parents were cruel fascists and must have done something horrible to cause the first suicide, and the lockdown will cause of the remaining suicides.""
However, this feel-good solution is soon destroyed. In the end we realize that the girls could have escaped at any possible time, and that when one such opportunity arose, they choose suicide instead. Lockdown was not the cause. More so, depression was not the cause. Though contemplative at times, the girls were never shown to be sad (perhaps while burning the records, but it is later revealed that they have another stash). Actually, they were quite happy. So why'd they do it?A satisfactory answer is never given because that is the point. Not only are rules of movie-making broken, the breaking itself coupled with the subject matter synergistically adds strength to the main point: movies are not made to placate your fragile need for happy films.",The Virgin Suicides

This is better then any film her father has made in years. THE VIRGIN SUICIDES is about 4 sisters who raised in a strict household. Their mother (Kathleen Turner) is a religious fanatic and their father (James Woods) just does whatever he's told. The four girls live in a neighbourhood across the street from a bunch of prepubescent boys, who idolize them from afar. The film tells their story and in so doing, gives a realistic picture of teenage life. This is a wonderfully directed, acted and written film.",The Virgin Suicides
113,Knewsense78,I wasted an hour and a half of my life!!!,3,25 September 2007,"I can't believe it, that I actually sat through this crappy film, constantly hitting display on the good ol' DVD remote to see how much longer was left. And, while the movie only runs 97 minutes (including credits), it sure felt like an eternity!!! Hanna Hall plays Cecilia Lisbon, the youngest of the five Lisbon daughters, and is the first to off herself, even though it takes a second attempt before she succeeds, mind you. At first she tries in the tub with a razor, but that doesn't work. She goes to see a shrink (Danny Devito) who tells her parents (James Woods and Kathleen Turner, who seems to be lost in this role) that he thinks Cecilia just did it for attention. The parents decide to have a little get together for the girls in their basement and invite some of the neighborhood boys over. Cecilia doesn't seem like she is having fun so she excuses herself and makes her way upstairs. A little while later, a noise is heard and Mrs. Lisbon (Kathleen Turner) and the rest of her daughters and the boys make their way upstairs and out the front door, where Mr. Lisbon (James Woods) is holding Cecilia, who is draped over a fence, the spike in her back. She jumped out of the bedroom window and succeeded in offing herself this time. I found the acting by Kathleen Turner in this part to be just down right pathetic.Kirsten Dunst plays Lux Lisbon, the second oldest of the Lisbon daughters. After she goes to the homecoming dance with Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett) and doesn't arrive home until early morning in a cab, Mr and Mrs, Lisbon pull the rest of their daughters out of school and keep them confined in their house. I guess you can say the girls go mad after awhile. After Morse coding the neighborhood boys across the street, they go over the Lisbon household where Lux is in the living room, smoking a cigarette. She opens the door and tells them the other girls are upstairs and that she will go out to her parents station wagon and wait for them, they plan on going for a ride to get out of the house. But they don't. The boys go down to the basement and one of the girls is there, hanging. Another one over-dosed on sleeping pills, the other one, well...I don't remember and poor little Lux is in the garage, door shut, engine running on the wagon, dead as can be.Well, la-di-friggin-da. Am I suppose to believe that this is the only means for the Lisbon girls to rebel against their parents? That all 5 of them would choose to end their lives? When you let your daughter go to the dance with someone with a name like Trip Fontaine, you're only asking for trouble. Lux was constantly screwing around with a new guy every night on the roof of her house, as we see all to well from the neighborhood boys scoping her out from the bedroom of one of them with a telescope. Why didn't one of them, LUX, just take off and go somewhere? Maybe it would of made their parents see that, no matter what is going on in the outside world, you can't keep your children confined forever. If Lux can screw around on a rooftop than certainly she can rebel enough to run away somewhere. None of these girls where shackled up, locked in their room. There were no bars on the windows!!! Needless to say, I hated this movie. It left me feeling emptier than a bolemics stomach.",The Virgin Suicides
114,ill_behavior,"Thoughtful, dreamy, full of air, no substance",6,4 June 2006,"I read the book, so my reactions to the film would not have been from someone who had no idea what would happen. But, it's pretty obvious from the title what goes on here.Themes dealt with include repression, small-town life and how it suffocates, the loss of innocence and the corruptive power of sex on teenage minds as represented by stale authoritarian figures. There are no car-chases or explosions. There is a sub-plot about a tree that might get cut down.Now, the acting. Here's my problem. The direction consists of ""stand around and look arty"". And that's what happens, Josh Hartnett is particularly guilty of wanting to make love to himself so badly it ruins his character. Trip Fontaine in the book never came off as such an arrogant moron, yes he is arrogant and yes he is a bit of a moron, but Hartnett seems wooden to the point you think he's more of a model than an actor.It's a good story, there are some subtle, funny lines (mostly taken from the book), and the music gives the whole thing a dreamy, floating on air, this-is-not-really-happening feel. I think my problem, like with Lost in Translation is that people see these films and automatically think they are art because they don't fully understand what is going on, not because it's genuinely hard to fathom what we're supposed to get out of it. ""Open to interpretation"" is the big cop-out when it comes to explaining or defending something and thats the best thing I could say about this film.

115,clydefrogg,"There is some good here, but the story is absurd.",4,2 June 2000,"The Virgin Suicides is, obviously, about some girls who commit suicide.  Why would they do such a thing?  So as to not give anything away, I'll just say that I have no idea.  I was not convinced nor do I see how anyone could be convinced of the reason, and that makes this story absurd.  Heathers was a similarly themed movie (how society reacts to teen suicide), but an obvious parody that didn't take itself seriously.  A movie about teenage suicide should either be totally serious and realistic or should be a ridiculous parody statement.  I don't believe there's a middle ground, and this book/movie tries unsuccessfully to walk it.  I understand that Sofia Coppola more or less wrote the script directly from the book, not changing much dialogue or action.  This is painfully evident at times.  The movie moves very slowly overall, especially in the beginning. A lot of the dialogue doesn't sound right on screen, and several scenes seem to have no importance whatsoever.  Criticisms aside, there are some good things about The Virgin Suicides. It's hard to call a movie shot in such a simple fashion stylish, but this one is.  As a friend pointed out, Sofia has a talent for shooting the female body.  Skin, hair, mouth, hands, they all, in a simple way, look sultry and seductive in this film.  It is a visual pleasure to watch these girls in this film.  James Woods is good as the girls father, but Kathleen Turner gives quietly over-the-top performance.  Josh Hartnett really gives the film some life at a time when it needs it as a high school loverboy who can have any girl he wants (almost).Bottom line:  The Virgin Suicides was watchable and gives me plenty to contemplate afterwards, but mostly I was contemplating how mediocre it was.

119,DaRick89,"Sometimes a cinematic dirge with some shallow characterisations, but ultimately chilling, thought-provoking and surprisingly easy to identify with",9,9 June 2009,"The Virgin Suicides is ultimately quite a fascinating cinematic piece, despite its faults. Why? Well, it provides a reminder of the damaging effects of suicide on families, neighbours, friends and so forth. Not only that, but the title itself is indicative of the mystique which surrounds the film - not all of the girls were literally 'virgins'. However, they were figuratively - the fact that the girls had barely experienced life and yet had given up on it so abjectly is harrowing, indeed. The fact that I can identify with this, having been through a similar experience myself, sends a chill down my spine. The movie isn't flawless; it can drag, the characterisations of some of the characters are surprisingly shallow and the background music only intermittently adds to the movie. I'm not sure whether the ploy of giving away the ending in the title worked, either, because it makes the movie somewhat predictable. Nevertheless, I still rate the movie highly, especially as the ending demonstrates the bewilderment and longing that can accompany the suicide of friends or acquaintances.The movie ultimately focuses on five mysterious, (variably) beautiful yet somewhat unstable young girls, with a religious nut and a metaphorically emasculated maths teacher as parents. The lives and perspectives of the neighbourhood boys who intently watch them, plus the high schoolers who get more intimate with them (like Trip) are also detailed. As the movie progresses, the youngest, Cecilla, finally kills herself after trying to do so before. Ironically, however, from here on in we get more of an insight into the lives of the Lisbons, through the eyes of Trip and his buddies, who take them to the prom. Trip predictably leaves Lux after doing it with her, leading to a parental lock-down and a final attempt by the boys to save them - which ends tragically.I've already mentioned how the girl's youth, yet indifference to life, was somewhat shocking, so I'll touch on the positives. The narrator really enhances the movie, recounting the events with total clarity, as if the suicides had happened yesterday, rather than 25 years ago.This, in itself, demonstrates the marked effect that suicide can have on the human psyche, even as you try mightily to forget about the disturbing events. You cannot, however, for you need to know the reason as to why the event occurred. This is arguably a commentary on life - although we sometimes deny it, if we cannot find a reason for an event occurring, we become mystified and try to drum up a reason for ourselves (witness the reactions to the Iraqi invasion, for instance). Try as they might, neither the narrator nor his chums could understand why the girls killed themselves - and it haunted them for the rest of the lives.The 'bad news is good news' mantra of the media also appears to be on full display, as the media outlets shamelessly take advantage of the suicides in order to gain ratings. Indeed, one of the reporters even comes to the Lisbon's door, before rightfully being told to leave. The narrator's delivery is superb - he reads his lines as if he's speaking at a funeral, which is ideal given the sombre context of the movie.The various insights into Trip's life and his retrospective admiration of Lux (even though he obviously descended further into drug abuse since the 1970's) are also interesting. Perhaps his drug use intensified as a result of Lux? I almost feel myself identifying with this - my suicidal feelings increased last year because I worshipped an older girl I knew was too good for me.Now there are some faults. As I've mentioned, the film can drag. The lead-up to the prom is not particularly interesting. Indeed, I often find myself skipping over this part. The characterisations of some of the characters also lack depth. Mystique can sometimes do a credible job of hiding this, but some of these characters resemble stereotypes. Mrs. Lisbon is just your stereotypical religious nut, like I said. You cannot sympathise with her character a great deal. Even though she didn't deserve what befell her, you cannot help but feel that she brought some of that grief upon herself, simply by ignoring her children's wishes. I'm not sure whether that's Kathleen Turner's fault, or the script's. James Woods' character is somewhat more likable, but there's little beyond the facade that he presents at school. Trip (as played by Josh Hartnett) generally just comes off as a lout, except during the aforementioned scenes. The neighbourhood boys, with their obsessions and their internal struggles, are more interesting, but the focus of the film is obviously on the five girls.So? Well, the characters of the girls are not always fully fleshed out. Only the narrator's embellishments stop them (with maybe the exception of the promiscuous, conflicted Lux) from resembling blank slates. As for Kirsten Dunst (who plays Lux) she would, IMO, never look better than what she does here. Her appearance has sadly disintegrated since.In the end, The Virgin Suicides is, despite some failings, a deeply intriguing film that serves as a great psychological terror.4.5/5 stars (although this rating may be a little generous)",The Virgin Suicides

123,Asa_Nisi_Masa2,"Well-packaged, unobtrusive, tastefully done and... without substance",5,21 September 2005,"Sofia Coppola's film is not unlike the music provided by Air for its soundtrack: nice, but a little bit hollow. All in all, I would say I enjoyed this film, just like all in all, I enjoy Air's music when someone puts on one of their CDs during a dinner party (Air is a favourite of many people who have dinner parties that I know). Air's music is immaculately packaged, unobtrusive, tasteful and on the whole, unobjectionable. Coppola's film is exactly the same. Liking Air and liking The Virgin Suicides is, if not a complete, absolute and irrefutable sign of having good taste, at least not a sign of having bad taste, that's for sure. But what exactly was this film about? The meaninglessness, hypocrisy and hollowness of suburbia and ""respectable"", bourgeois society (a favourite target for many artists). The voyeuristic nature of the media (another popular one). The spontaneity and genuineness of the young (epitomised by Cecilia, the youngest sister in the film), a spontaneity etc which is killed off and sucked dry by the stifling, unwritten rules of respectable, middle-class, white American society. The slow but steady death of nature at the hands of the human race. Yadda yadda. Can I object to any of these themes? No, of course I can't. They're all worthy themes and the film was nowhere near preachy about any of them. Credit to Coppola for that. As I said, this film is very tastefully done. I'm not sure though: The Virgin Suicides could be about some if not all of these things and more besides, yet it remains soft in focus, ""airy"" (not just in the soundtrack) and somehow, void of substance. Yet I cannot say I wasn't enjoying it as I was watching it, just as I cannot say I haven't enjoyed listening to Air playing in the background at a dinner party. But the enjoyment was never more than skin-deep. And to be honest, though I've been left with nothing negative from this film and the fashionable French band's music, I've also not been left with anything positive either - nothing that lasts, nothing to keep. This is all just... an unobjectionable lack of real substance with a very clever, unobjectionable appearance of substance. All very tastefully done, of course. 5/10",The Virgin Suicides
124,Time Tripper,"Some wonder why, others just want to walk away.",9,27 December 2000,"Any plot points I reveal here are given away in the first 5 minutes of the movie, so no ""spoiler warnings"" are necessary.  There seem to be two complaints against this movie.  The first is that it has no story.  The second is that the girls' tragic deaths has no point.  I think that holding those two things against the movie is missing the point. 
First, this movie does not have a plot in the way that ""Star Wars"" or ""Casablanca"" has a plot.  This is more of a passive story, where things happen to people, rather than people make things happen.  I would not consider the weakness of a plot to be a valid criticism, because this movie does have a story (how the Lisbon girls' lives changed after their sister's death).  The girls themselves have few lines, and the story is told through the neighborhood boys' perspective.  The narration is provided from the view of someone telling what had happened 25 years ago on the street where he lived.  Second, the entire point of this movie is that the girls' motive is not understood.  Anyone familiar with the subject of teenage suicide knows that this is common.  In an era when one in four girls has attempted suicide, I think this movie deals with the subject far more realistically than any film I have ever seen.  We're meant to wonder why these girls would do what they did.  You can either sit and wonder, or you can just shrug your shoulders, walk away, and save your money for ""realistic"" movies like ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" and ""Scary Movie.""",The Virgin Suicides
125,fullonrobotchubby,Sofia finally makes a positive contribution to film!,8,28 March 2007,"Kirsten Dunst is basically the star of The Virgin Suicides, director Sofia Coppola's (Lost in Translation) first feature length film. Based on the novel by Jeffrey Euginides, a family containing five pretty, blonde daughters live in a quaint neighborhood in the mid-70's. Cecilia Lisbon, the youngest daughter at 13 (and young Jenny from Forrest Gump!), becomes suicidal. When Cecilia tragically finds the chance to do herself in, town speculation starts to surround the overprotective parents (James Woods and Kathleen Turner) and the future of the remaining daughters. The new youngest daughter Lux (Dunst) falls for the high school heartthrob Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett), who manages to talk Mr. Lisbon into allowing the daughters (importantly Lux) to go to the homecoming dance. When Lux stays out too late, only to be left alone on a football field, the Lisbons get more strict with the daughters, putting their fate more into question than ever before. I don't think any scene in this film is meant to be favored, but my favorite scene is when the daughters make a rare outdoor appearance to protect the tree Cecilia loved from being removed by the government. The Virgin Suicides is in many ways like an after-school special, but through strong performances (especially from Woods), some of the best narration I've heard in film from Giovanni Ribisi, and foreshadowing that doesn't remotely feel like foreshadowing (the picture Mr. Lisbon takes of the daughters before the dance), it's good to see Coppola is a good filmmaker... because if you've ever seen The Godfather Part III, you know acting just ain't her thing.",The Virgin Suicides
126,stiv-7,"An impressive debut, and what a gorgeous film to look at!",9,15 January 2002,"A friend loaned me this one on the weekend, and I was completely bowled over. Sofia can finally put all those nasty comments about her acting ability to rest, since she has found her true calling in life, and that would be as an indie filmmaker. Here, she has crafted as artful and tasteful a movie about suicide as humanly possible. Were it not for the subject matter, content (no nudity, a smattering of profanity, brief drug use, and some implied sexuality) would have only garnered The Virgin Suicides a PG-13. There are so many nice touches to this film that I don't know where to begin. The use of coloured filters to convey mood is so refreshing in this age of computer manipulation of colour, the audible thump of needle to vinyl every time a song begins, the careful attention to detail in the fashion and set design... this is the most beautiful movie on such a serious subject I have ever seen. Some have said it is grim and depressing, but I didn't find it that way at all. Since we never truly get to know the Lisbon sisters, the end (and I will not spoil this) comes across as less shocking and more disappointing, since I would like to spend more time with these characters and get to know them better. This is mostly true because of the excellent performances of all involved. Kirsten Dunst is a revelation, I can forgive Josh Hartnett for Pearl Harbour, and James Woods and Kathleen Turner both do excellent work in carefully modulated performances. I would not hesitate to recommend this to friends, but at the same time, I would warn them that it's not what they would expect of the subject matter.",The Virgin Suicides

129,PippinInOz,A group of men remember five teenage girls from their youth.,7,22 March 2011,"I watched this film on video not too long after it was first released. Remember being a bit underwhelmed to be honest. However, after watching it again yesterday have changed my mind considerably. This is because this time I watched it with a different approach. The best way to describe this film (and recommend it hopefully) is probably to ask some questions which played on my mind for quite a while afterwards. These are only my interpretations, but here we go:The film is narrated by a group of boys, well, men who are remembering being boys is more accurate, although the very young sounding voice alerted me to something and led on to the first question: IS THIS NARRATORIAL VOICE RELIABLE?I would suggest the clue to this question is in the title of the film 'The Virgin Suicides' - well they were not all virgins were they. According to the male's telling of the story, Lux has been sexually active by the time of her tragic death. Also, Trip Fontaine (and this is listed in the Goofs section here I noticed), speaking as a washed up bloke approaching 40 sitting in rehab, remembers being stoned and walking into the wrong History class the first time he meets Lux Lisbon - he was, according to the story, stoned every day - and on this day we are shown him escaping being caught by a teacher in the corridor. One, the sign on the door says: 'Language Arts' and Two, he was a big pot smoker at the time so in all fairness his memories might be a bit fuddled to say the least. The fact Trip mentions 'History' is revealing as well. History is told by the victors - and the victors here - or survivors if you like, are all male, white, middle class and heading towards a Mid life crisis. At least a few have had broken marriages and relationships, handily using the Lisbon sisters as an excuse: 'They spoilt us for any future girlfriends and wives', the narrator says. The narrators are re-writing history through the prism of their own present lives - and like any history, we should be aware that this tale is both extremely edited and also an apology. Who is the object of the gaze? Who is being described and - importantly - WATCHED. The five girls obviously. I do not think it is any coincidence that during some of the boys' fantasy scenes concerning particularly Lux, the filming is connotative of old 1970s adverts for soap (Lux!!!!) and shampoo. This leads on to another question: Why do the girls organise for the boys to be the first witnesses ('audience') to their mass suicide? I argue this is the only way they feel they can speak back (have a voice). Consider it, they are virtually imprisoned in the house and their only link with the outside world is via a telephone and - vitally important inclusion - the telescope. The boys watch the girls, particularly Lux having sex on the roof of the house - and the girls know it. They are being watched like hawks by their parents and the boys across the road. Once you start to take into account the unreliable narrator of this story, you will (trust me on this one) really really be spooked. There is a nasty edge here - but like the silenced version of events from the girls themselves - it is always just out of shot. Lux gets seduced and dumped in the middle of a football field, the male narrators version of Trip 'a gentleman who never talks about his conquests' is air brushed. This is a fourteen year old girl remember, who has to find a taxi home.The dreamy way this film is shot is clever and appropriate. The narrator cannot be trusted. Watch again for the sneaky smiles that Lux keeps giving over her shoulder, again straight from an advertising campaign for just about anything - according to the boys' story, she even smiles up at the telescope when they are watching her on the roof with a series of boys. Again: pure middle aged male fantasy. The prevalence of the image of the Virgin Mary (Our Lady) is not there just because the family are strict Catholics, but part of the boys' (and then the men's) fantasy of the Virgin / Whore dichotomy. When I watched it with these things in mind, it was just a revelation. Would love to see a re- write from the Lisbon sisters' perspective. Just my interpretation - suspect there are many!Oh, one last thing: those diseased (Dutch Elm Disease) trees lining the street - like the girls, they are marked for destruction.",The Virgin Suicides

Kirsten Dunst plays the role very well and the performances given from the parents of the five elusive Lisbon sisters, Kathleen Turner and James Woods were very impressive. The film cleverly mirrors the pungent adolescent anxieties and dark trails of obsession that are laced throughout the novel, however the film is less visceral and more Hollywood than would've been preferred, Sofia polished most of the feeling out of the film, however the story and style forgive all the film's flaws.",The Virgin Suicides
131,easmith03,"Memorable, but probably a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" film",7,23 October 2002,"This is kind of what I would classify as an ""art film"".  Meaning that it doesn't fit into an typical categorization.  And doesn't seem to be trying to target a main stream audience.  I suspect people will either love it, or hate it.  It is a tragedy, and a dark movie.  If there is a message in it, I missed it.  However, there were several scenes that I found very memorable, and enjoyable.  Also, I think we all consider the music of our teenage years to be the ""definitive"" music.  This movie was set in the 70's and has some great music in it that I enjoyed as I was a teenager in the 70's.  The movie revolves around a family with 5 teenage girls.  The youngest of which commits suicide when she is just 13.  A neighborhood group of boys is telling the story in flashback (25 years in the future) as they were fascinated/infatuated with the girls in the family.  The father (woods) is a teacher at the school where all the kids go, and the mother (turner) is over bearing and constrictive, trying to protect the girls to the point of suffocating them.  The acting performances were great.  And I really did get the feeling that the movie captured a sense of suburbia America in the 70's. I recognized the characters in the movie from my own high school.  But, I don't know what the movie was ultimately trying to say.** spoilers do follow **I think there were some clever scenes in the movie, showing the relationship between teenage boys and teenage girls.  In one Trip (Hartnet) is pursing on of the teenage girls (Dunst) and sits next to her while a film is shown in class.  The voice narration on the film, about two weather fronts meeting for a storm, I thought kind of symbolized the moment of the two teenagers meeting for a relationship.  Likewise, later while watching television, a voice over about lions in Africa seemed to convey a similar message.  I could go on.  There were other interesting scenes, that I would call good/interesting film making that to me made the movie worthwhile.  But, I didn't find a message in the movie that wrapped it all up to make it seem like a really great movie.  So, I ended up kind of straddling the fence on this one.",The Virgin Suicides
132,MarshallStax,Just like adolescence...,1,16 May 2001,"...this movie is awkward and interminable! An absolutely pretentious piece of twaddle defined by both a lack of focus and a failure to present believable characters, ""The Virgin Suicides"" is ample proof (if any was needed) that nepotism will get you everywhere in show business. This film suffers from a lack of point-of-view (I dare you to define who the protagonist really is) and, even more importantly, a lack of point! We are never made to care one whit for the lives (or deaths) of the Lisbon sisters, nor are we shown any traits that make us interested in the creepily voyeuristic boys who adore them for no ascertainable reason. From the pretentious voice-overs to the first-year film school blocking of scenes, this is an amazing waste of time and resources. ""The Virgin Suicides"" must certainly be in the running for worst film ever made. And Sophia Coppola, already reviled as an actress, has proved she can't direct, either.

What the movie seems to really be about is the perception the young boys have of the women. The ""suicides"" are not so much real suicides as they are representative of the shattering of pristine and goddess-like images the girls that the little boys have.  The boys do not actually 'see' these girls, they see the goddess-like images that they impose on the girls.  Therefore, as one of the girls really gets 'real', there is a 'virgin suicide'.

135,fiozinho,Quirkily fascinating,7,22 June 2000,"An at times self-consciously quirky account of those tricky adolescent years when nothing seems to make sense and love hurts, but no love hurts more. Sofia Coppola has captured to perfection the feel of teendom - the awkwardness, the inability to articulate, the awful family parties. And the seventies themselves are re-created with wonderful (and possibly squirmily embarrassing for those who lived through them) verisimilitude. Nothing much seems to happen in this sleepy town, but the film is packed full with delicious incident.

Second, the story is told with a great tenderness and ability, like if it was only a fantastic dream. It remembers the atmosphere of ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"" with these beautiful girls and their tragic destiny. Kirsten Dunst is astonishing in her performance: her beautiful look cuts the screen and her eyes take you apart in another world. She's really one of the best actresses of her age but a good work too is done by the parents: James Woods is a stupid man, completely absorbed by the strength of his wife, played by a Kathleen Turner, never been so cruel.

Nevertheless, the Lisbon sisters get the attention of all the boys in the neighbourhood. The younger one attempts to kill herself. At first, she does it in vain, because her parents noticed early enough to avoid her success, but she eventually succeeds, when in a party thrown by her parents when she recovered from the previous attempt and after asking permission to go upstairs, jumps from the windows arriving over a grid, dying instantly. Between, a group of neighbours were gaining an obsession for the now four sisters. When Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett), asks Mr. Lisbon (James Woods) for permission to take Lux on a sort of date, he agrees with the condition of taking all the sisters with them. And so he did. Lux arrives home too late, losing every kind of freedom she had, if you can call it to what they had. The sisters never get out of home again, appealing to the obsessed neighbours help...

138,Lockout_Salties,A flawed film that could've been better,6,20 June 2021,"The primary problem with The Virgin Suicides is that it is a film about the Lisbon sisters, but we never actually learn anything worthwhile about them. If the film was about their suicide this would be excusable. But it isn't: nearly the entire film is spent with the Lisbon sisters, and even when they're offscreen they are all that's being talked about. These five young women aren't characters. Rather, they are objects to be gawked at and lusted after.The most egregious example of this is Kirsten Dunst's character, Lux Lisbon. Two words: Mary Sue. For those unfamiliar, this term refers to a female character who is so perfect it warps the fabric of the story. The Mary Sue never struggles and can accomplish any task effortlessly, and they are so perfect virtually every single character in the story is obsessed with them. Although the term is often used as an excuse for harsh criticism towards female characters (a gesture full of thinly-veiled misogyny), in certain cases it still applies. Lux Lisbon is one of those cases: every character is in love with her, she manages to become homecoming queen even though she's only fourteen, and all the tragedy that befalls her is because of the people around her. Lux's eventual suicide is equivalent to the Mary Sue dying at the end of a fanfiction so that all the other characters can cry over her and express how amazing she truly was.Obviously, there's the counterargument of ""it's from the boys' perspective, and to them she was perfect. She wasn't actually flawless, just to them she was."" However, the film isn't really from the boys' perspective. For example, the narrator is flat out wrong when he says that the only character who got to know Lux was Trip. In reality, Trip learned nothing about Lux. The short time they spent together was taken up by kissing and smoking, and not a single intimate conversation. The main narrator of the film (one of the boys) is wrong about one of the things that happens in it. This demonstrates that the movie isn't really from the persepctive of the boys, but rather a more objective look at what happened.Ocassionally, the films shines. Sofia Coppola has a great eye for stylistic flair that makes scenes like Cecilia reading her diary memorable and visually fascinating. The actual performances of the cast aren't too bad, especially considering their young age. And unlike a lot of films I've seen, it's consistently interesting. However, these positives aren't enough to overcome the problems within the script. If you're a person who loves a film with great visuals, I'd still recommend watching this one. But if you want a well-written teen drama with deep characters, look elsewhere.Final Score: 59/100.",The Virgin Suicides
139,barfly99,Beautifully made exploration of nostalgia and adolescence,9,30 May 2000,"Numerous people seem to complain that THE VIRGIN SUICIDES fails because the reasons for the suicides are never explained. I don't know if they think this was merely an oversight on the part of the film-makers, but I would have thought it was obvious that the lack of explanation is absolutely pivotal to the thrust of the whole movie. The film is about the mystery and seductive power of beauty, and about how we are left helpless and grasping for reason when beauty dies (a theme further explored with the ruthless destruction of the tree on the Lisbons' lawn). It's about growing up and trying to reconcile love and sexuality with a world full of tragedy and injustice. It's about looking back to our childhood, when life was full of warmth and magic and mystery, and thankfully bereft of the kind of cold and logical ""explanation"" that we demand as adults. We never get inside the heads of the Lisbon girls because we aren't supposed to; the film is told entirely from the point of view of the local teenage boys, who are fascinated to the point of obsession with these fantastically beautiful girls who live down the street. Although set in the 1970s, the nostalgia for the period here is refreshingly gentle and beguiling. Shot with poise and grace, this film looks fantastic (and why shouldn't Sofia Coppola borrow actors and techniques from her dad - wouldn't you?) The entire cast are magnificent - for me, James Woods has never been better - and the soundtrack (a mixture of Air and '70s classics) is perfect. This is a wonderful film.",The Virgin Suicides
140,donlhumphries,Virgin Suicides v. Serial Mom,7,19 September 2000,"I saw this movie mainly because Kathleen Turner is in it.  She usually plays a formidable on-screen presence, and this is no exception.  As Mrs. Lisbon, KT is the strict religious matriarch of the family, consisting of husband (James Woods) and five girls.  As the title indicates, the five girls die, and the only real mystery to the viewer is - how, and when, and why.  The film has amusing moments, but the sombre feeling of impending tragedy prevails throughout.  It is tempting to compare the movie to that other KT film ""Serial Mom"" because in both cases the mother is the determining factor.    ""Serial Mom"" is a black comedy, and thus not meant to be taken seriously, the mother in that film is ""extroverted"" and defends her brood by killing those outside the family whom she considers a threat or who have otherwise offended. She has some kind of mental block which enables her to live quite cheerfully in spite of any recent killing (a Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde personality). In the Virgin Suicides the mother is ""introverted"", and tries to protect her offspring by shielding them from outside influences - to the point of ""smothering"" them.  The girls feel they have no other escape except suicide. Mrs.Lisbon's religious convictions with their ""thou shalt not.."" emphasis, is evident, but she seems unaware of what her influence entails.  She's as much a victim as her daughters, and is genuinely aggrieved and shocked by their deaths.

142,AnonymousFilmLover26,Was there even a point?,6,30 August 2019,"I get that this movie is supposed to be complex, and somewhat cerebral, and that's fine. I love complex movies, I love dramas, I love complex, indie dramas - that said...this is Sofia Coppola's first effort as a director. (Yes, the Sofia Coppola from the infamous Godfather 3...) I do tend to like S Coppola more as a director; some of her more recent indie work is pretty good. So all in all, I was intrigued by this film; and I finally got around to watching it.
Let's keep things simple here: It was not my favorite.For one thing, the lack of dialogue. I'm willing to bet that even though this is a feature length movie, there were probably less than 30 pages of real dialogue. Silence can be advantageous and clever, but when multiple short, silent scenes are cut together, it just makes for a slow movie. And, what dialogue there was, seemed either overdramatic or completely unnecessary. I don't think anyone, other than the narrator, spoke more than a paragraph at a time.Two, the boys. Now, I haven't read the original book, and from what I hear, the boys played a pretty major role in the book. But the movie paints them as annoying, lovesick peeping toms who hang out on the sidelines pretty much throughout the whole movie...and for what? What purpose do they serve, I'd like to know. Side note, how silly was that scene where the ""immigrant"" kid jumps off the roof?Three, the characters. I did not get to know one character in this movie. Not one. Yes, all the Lisbon sisters are beautiful and troubled, but who exactly are they? What do they like to do, other than listen to music and brush their hair, and stare wistfully/dramatically out the window? Trip Fontaine shakes things up a bit, but then he's gone just as fast as he arrives...Four, I simply found the narrator unnecessary. I get that he was trying to convey a deeper message about the meaning of life and all, but it just came off very contrived. Additionally, the narration was very monotone and boring.One positive: I did like the soundtrack
One positive: I did like Kirsten Dunst in the role of Lux, though she was under-utilized.I love movies, and I don't ever hate on movies just because...but let's just say this was a one and done. Onward and upward, Ms. Coppola!",The Virgin Suicides

This remark should show how involved I became with the characters, I didn't want them to die.  Having spent more time than I would care to admit in Oklahoma, I know that I've met the parents and girls before.

The film almost has a documentary feel about it at times and is superbly acted by an ensemble cast. It tells the tragic tale of the Lisbon sisters who, in the Sixties, the era of freedom, are stifled by overprotective parents who do not appear to have left the forties. The Lisbon sisters are full of life, particularly Lux. Rather than let them grow, after Lux stays out all  night following the homecoming dance, the surviving four sisters, (Cecilia, the youngest has already killed herself by this point) are withdrawn from High School and only have contact with the four boys, that are obsessed by them, via the phone and records they play to each other.

147,RebelXStar,Those girls have a bright future ahead of them,7,15 November 2015,"Set in 1974, the story centres around a group of teenage boys and their fascination with five mysterious sisters known as the Lisbon girls in their final days.The story begins with the attempted, and then successful, suicide of the youngest Lisbon, Cecilia who impales herself on a metal fence during a party that was intended to cheer her up after her first suicide attempt. The family are left devastated and while the four remaining sisters, Therese, Mary, Bonnie and Lux (played perfectly by Kirsten Dunst) don't outwardly display the same self-destructive tendencies Cecilia showed, it is clear that their strict upbringing by their passive father and overly religious mother is a source of discontentment for them; most notably Lux, the youngest and easily least content of the remaining girls.A glimmer of hope appears when Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett), the cocky high-school heartthrob falls in love with Lux, who ignores him at first, which makes him want her more. He asks her to the homecoming dance and her parents reluctantly agree but only if he can find dates for all of the sisters so that they can all go. There are, of course, no shortage of potential dates.The evening goes well until Lux misses curfew because she is having sex with Trip on the football field. He loses interest in Lux immediately afterwards and abandons her, leaving her to make her way home the next morning by herself, causing the girls' parents to put them all on total lock down. They are taken out of school and withdrawn from the world almost entirely.Feeling dreadful for the girls, the neighbourhood boys do what they can to help them feel connected to the world, such as playing song lyrics down the phone to each other and using flashing lights to communicate Morse code across the street.The lock down seems to send Lux over the edge as she starts having sex with random boys on the roof of the house, much to the boy's amusement.One evening the boys think their luck is in when the sisters invite them over after Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are asleep, seemingly to go for a joyride or road trip. But when they arrive Lux appears to be in a melancholy mood. In reality, the sisters have each taken their life in a different way in a different room of the house and they just wanted the boys to witness it.I must admit that I went into this movie biased towards liking it as years before viewing I had the ear candy that is the soundtrack composed by French duo, 'Air' that compliments the movie's dreamy, surreal tone perfectly.No real reason or catalyst is ever given as to why the sisters feel that suicide is the only escape from their present reality and some feel that the movie glamourizes suicide (the movie is very beautiful), but I would argue that as the story is told through the eyes of a boy who idealises the girls, many years after the events of the movie took place, he is telling the story as he remembers it, not how things actually were.",The Virgin Suicides
148,camraman,NO EMOTIONAL TIES,5,9 September 2001,"The first death of the five daughters, Cecilia, didn't move me or touch me. The scene lacked any emotional substance. I firmly believe that the same emotions elicited in real life situations should be elicited from the viewer of a tragic movie scene. I feel the director/screenwriter lost an effective edge to involve me, the viewer, into his/their movie. When I watch a movie (since I'm not a professional movie critic), I look for the entertainment value first. How well does it entertain and involve me. It started slow and ended without truly moving me. I should have felt ""something"" for those poor girls. But I didn't. Beaches, Terms of Endearment, The Color Purple: I felt something for the principle characters- sympathy, pity, empathy, compassion.
The introduction of Josh Harnett's character, Trip Fontaine, gave the movie some movement.James Woods' character falling asleep during Trip's visit with Lux certainly showed his involvement with his daughters. Not much influence and certainly indifferent. I thought that made a good statement.The scene where the boys contacted the Lisbon daughters with romantic music was very touching. Otherwise, for me, it was just an average movie with none of the actors performing with any strength. I was expecting better.
I'm giving it a five and that's being generous. The overall average score at this writing was 7.3. I don't see it.",The Virgin Suicides
149,xterminal,Promising debut from Sofia Coppola,7,22 January 2001,"The Virgin Suicides (Sofia Coppola, 1999)If you can't act, direct! At least, that's how Sofia Coppola's foray into the world behind the lens was widely greeted by critics before the release of The Virgin Suicides. A week later, the silence where there had once been jeers was deafening.The Virgin Suicides is one of those rare birds like Psycho; a relatively badly-received book is turned into a movie that made a whole lot of ten-best lists. Every major performance in this movie is wonderful. Kathleen Turner let herself go to hell for this role (presaging Ellen Burstyn's academy award-worthy performance in Requiem for a Dream, perhaps?), James Woods is the very epitome of a math teacher, the hormone-laden neighborhood boys are-- well, teenage boys are teenage boys, I guess.Like most coming-of-age films, while watching this I found myself making comparisons to the godfather of modern coming-of-age films, Birdy. Like that film, The Virgin Suicides takes a cast of relative unknowns for its stars, surrounds them with minor characters with much bigger names (Woods, Turner, Danny DeVito, Michael Pare, etc.), and just lets them come of age. There's a plot, of course, but the theme is allowed to be derived by the actors simply existing. And despite the title of the film and the main plot point (which involves the second-youngest sister, Lux-- and who names their kid Lux, anyway?-- being romanced by Cracker alum Josh Hartnett), this is a movie about four teenage boys and how they see the world. I found myself smiling many, many times at how well Coppola captured the essence of being thirteen and male (and wasn't half as embarrassed at any time during this movie as I was at Matthew Modine on prom night in Birdy, thankfully).It's a good, solid film, but it never really rises to the level of greatness. But give Sofia Coppola some time; after all, Francis directed some real bombers before lucking onto Roger Corman and teaming up for the classic Dementia 13. This is a young director who's going places. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the younger, less-known names in the cast followed her to the heights, either. ***",The Virgin Suicides
150,Bifrostedflake,This viewers suicide.....,1,2 May 2007,"A friend recommended this film to me and I have to say, it will be the last time I ever take her advice.I haven't read the book, so I am not concerned with adaptation, more that the film was so dull I nearly fell asleep. Twice.Coppola uses, what I presume she must think are 'poignant' shots and slow-motion sequences, in an effort to try and convince, we the viewers that this is not the most slow story ever told.After a vaguely interesting first ten minutes, it was all down hill from there. Left without any weight in the script after the theme of the film (which would be young girls, committing suicide) it fails to address anything which could be vaguely interesting.There is simply no 'gotta' in this film. I didn't pause the DVD, when going to the toilet, thinking; oh, I just gotta find out what happens next. For the first time in a while, I was watching the timer, wondering when the film would just end. There is no force, no driving edge.I do not blame the fact that this is supposedly a 'thinker,' plenty of films which are merely there to tell a story, I have enjoyed in the past. It is merely that Coppola presumed the strength of the book's fan-base could carry her amateurish directing 'skills' through the 97 minutes.The film is pretentious and dull. If you want to watch a film that deals with the issues of teenage suicide which is actually good, watch Heathers.",The Virgin Suicides
151,Lambysalamby,Retrospective Review: Lingered with me afterwards... the power of a great soundtrack.,8,17 July 2015,"I came to this film being a huge fan of Sofia Coppola's other film Lost in Translation. Lost in Translation is a 10/10 picture for me and one of my favourite films ever, so I went into her first film The Virgin Suicides with high hopes..It's about a year or so since I have seen it, and while writing this review, I must express that I was initially disappointed expecting more, even dismissing the film as a little boring....However, the film kept coming back into my thoughts afterwards and I can still recall vividly the opening shots of the film accompanied by what I now consider to be one of the greatest soundtracks ever made, by the French duo: AIR. Using their music for the film was in my view, a genius choice from Coppola.I will never underestimate the power of a soundtrack in a movie and neither should you. Take for Example: John Caprenter's Halloween. The film test screened to audiences without the infamous score and the test audiences thought it was a bad film, you know what it became with the score in place, an outright classic. Music can be just important as great cinematography..I certainly took away the soundtrack from the Virgin Suicides, I was listening to the whole album regularly. Then slowly but surely parts of the film crept back in to my thoughts, the beautiful cinematography, the great performances, the wonder. The soundtrack and the film are intrinsically linked. I look forward to seeing it again, knowing I will definitely enjoy it more than the first time round.. It's definitely a grower...",The Virgin Suicides
152,Nahret,"So beautiful, it breaks your heart. 9 of 10.",9,8 July 2002,"Since I had read the book and still remembered the feeling of desolation it left me with for weeks, I was very reluctant to see this film. But then, I thought, can any movie ever mirror the deep emotions the book holds, and translate them truthfully into images? In this case, the answer is: yes.
The atmosphere is artfully set from the very beginning; a heartbreaking sense of mystery shrouds the Lisbon household in silence and elevates the girls to neighbourhood Virgin Marys. To the boys who speculate and dream about them, they are angels, not quite human. And this is what they become to the viewer, too; idolised creatures of light, since we only ever get to know them through the eyes of those teenage boys. And this is what makes both the novel and the perfect film adaptation so memorable, so beautiful and so sad; we never learn what finally pushed them so far as to end their lives, all in one single night (except Cecilia, who ""has gone before"", as Poe would have said). We never see their perspective, never hear their thoughts, and thus they retain their mystery and die the saintly death of martyrs. The film is brilliantly handled, with impressive colours and music. The actors put in high quality performances in giving life to incredibly complex characters. Kirsten Dunst deserves a special mention for her portrayal of the most visible Lisbon sister, Lux, with which she stands head and shoulders above an already formidable cast. This is a rare gem of a film, a timeless story on the beauty in the eye of the beholder. Never since Romeo and Juliet has death seemed such a tragedy.",The Virgin Suicides
153,centropolis,No words can define the brilliance here.,10,19 December 2000,"This movie is brilliant. It is handsomely shot, like a dream. This is not only one of the best movies of the year, but I am a teenager, 15 years of age, and I am glad writer-director Sofia Coppola knows what teenagers are like. I have always had mass distaste for Kristen Dunst's acting abilities, Interview with the Vampire excepted. This movie, shows her talent. I was amazed. Ed Lachman(Erin Brockovich)'s cinematography is like poem, with awesome music by Air, and editor Melissa Kent(The Rainmaker)'s very smart pacing. If a person did not like this movie, they did not understand the point of view, or was never a teenager. I love every little thing about this movie, James Woods and Kathleen Turner are two of the finest actors, and I am glad they chose to show their abilities here. Thought-provoking and brilliant. Another talented filmmaker in the Coppola family.",The Virgin Suicides
154,yaseminturkish,Cliff Notes would be useful for a film that is dead in spirit but not in body,9,29 April 2002,The feeling of being in a long daze that is finally lifted by the ending of the film is the sense of sleepy melancholy that I found myself experiencing in the waning moments of The Virgin Suicides.  The movie is one of the most quiet and subtle since the silent era and even a rocket scientist will find himself unsure of what it all really means.  Sofia Coppola appears to want to explain that the restrictions of parents with high expectations can break your heart and also end your life.  The movie is not bursting with the energy and feeling that you want to reach out and hug it as Ghost World proved but there is a sense of foretelling the fates of the four beautiful girls by allowing them to witness teenage rites of passage and experience excitement in the short moments before their untimely deaths.The Virgin Suicides is restrictive in that the focus is always on what is revealed at the end with the demise of four siblings and not on the fundamental qualities of the lovely sister's lives.  Certainly their lives are rooted in being cooped up in the home they share with Kathleen Turner and James Woods and they exist solely as empty creatures who are already dead in spirit but not yet in being.  Lux Lisbon is the only sister who seems to believe that there is a way out of the misery and appears to have an outgoing personality that will prevent her from allowing her spirit to die.  Inexplicably we find that she is little more than a facade who is not comfortable with the person she appears to be and her life ends tragically like all the rest.  Kirsten Dunst is one of the best prospects of her generation aside from Natalie Portman and Thora Birch.  Her determination to make Lux Lisbon human despite her inhumane treatment of herself is painful and yet enchanting to witness.  Kathleen Turner and James Woods find themselves relegated to the back-burner but this makes perfect sense because the four girls would never have been able to commit suicide if their parents were very engaged in their lives.  What remains unclear in the closing moments of The Virgin Suicides is the true motivation for the mass termination of life.  Lux Lisbon appears to have some reason for choosing this fate but the other girls are not well-defined in their own pursuit of the goal.  There is never a clear plot that drives home this motivation but it somehow fits together in a rather compelling directorial debut for Sofia Coppola.  Just be certain that you read the cliff notes first.9/10,The Virgin Suicides
155,keithbrown-90195,Ethereal and Mysterious,9,13 September 2016,"After 5 films now, it's clear that Sofia Coppola is a formalist first and foremost, but it's still a little alarming how thoroughly she was able to adapt the tone of the book's prose to the screen, especially as a first time director. The melancholy and mystery of Eugenides' words absolutely permeates every frame, complemented perfectly by the fantastic period detail: 1970s, suburban America, an idyllic homestead as any, filtered through a fever-dream haze. As per usual, the soundtrack choices are spot on. Filled with classics from the 60s and 70s, and a splash of modern and ethereal additions by Air; the music is essential, and expertly paired with the gorgeous images. I don't know if there's ever been a more fitting introduction to a character than Trip Fontaine walking down the halls of his school to the guitar wails of Heart's ""Magic Man"".I love how the narrator is never specified beyond being one of the boys. They, as a collective, share an experience, and then they share it with us. Even though we see more of them than their book counterparts (perhaps due to Coppola relating more with them than Eugenides did) the girls remain mysterious, elusive, and the boy's obsession with them is transferred to the audience. We watch and wonder, forming assumptions based on brief glimpses behind the curtain. Of course, we never come to understand them (because when have teenage boys understood girls?), but we make assumptions anyways because it's human nature. Surely the parents are at fault? But what about their peers? What about the media they consume? It's left deliberately vague and mysterious, and the desire to unravel and understand is certainly a reason for the continued relevance of both book and movie.While the book was languid, the mundane turned extraordinary through expertly designed sentences; I often overlooked the sharp, black humor in favor of the mysterious beauty. The movie, to my great delight, is full of tiny moments – often provided by the actors, professionals of the highest order – where the smallest gesture or a look can bring the largest laugh. James Woods in particular gives a fantastic performance, all awkward positioning and uncertain conversation.By the time the movie ends, it feels as if we've witnessed and experienced these events alongside our group of boys, the way that stories we've heard in our lives over and over seem to become our own memories. The aimlessness of the narrative feels like a group recollecting a series of events years later, unsure of the order in which the stories should be told. Like the character's memories, some stories linger in my mind, while others fade and are forgotten. Moments like dancing to ""Come Sail Away"" at the homecoming, or discovering the girl's bodies are forever burned into my cinematic mind. It's a pretty great achievement for Coppola and her team (and I think it's her warmest and prettiest looking movie too, credit to Edward Lachman where it's due).",The Virgin Suicides
156,charbrom,7/10,7,13 September 2001,"Beautiful images, teasing music by french-group 'Air' and a more than promising debut for Sofia Coppola as a director. Woods has the best bit-part as the absent-minded father. The only negative thing I can mention about this film is the failure of uncovering the mistery behind the suicides. That's somewhat unsatisfying after seeing such a pleasant film. Dunst must have been very pleased with the way she was photographed, she looks stunning. (7/10)",The Virgin Suicides
157,francescof86,"""The virgin suicides""",8,3 April 2013,"Sofia Coppola is undoubtedly one of the most sensational director of the last years. Her films deals with inner loneliness in spite of a pressing world around you populated with people who can't or doesn't want communicate with you. In this delicate situation, the protagonist reacts by creating a private world for himself. In ""Lost in translation"" Bob and Charlotte establish a close bond to survive in a foreign country and to a delusional marriage. On the contrary, in ""Marie Antoinette"" the young foreign bride and future queen of France reacts to a sexless and affection less marriage and a hostile court of Versailles by living a luxurious life and in doing so cementing her bad reputation. In ""The virgin suicides"" the oppressive parents(James Woods and Kathleen Turner) force their five beautiful young daughters to live a life a part from their peers. Lux(Kirsten Dunst)in turn indulges at first in innocent flirts and then in anonymous sex with strangers after the fatal decisions of her parents of retiring their daughters from school due to a late return home after their only school party in life. The tragic end of the five sisters is witnessed by five infatuated boys who won't be able to forget them. The film perceptively stimulates many important themes such as alienation, the difficulty to draw the lines between imaginary drama and actual life, the immediate necessity for the parents to provide an effective help for their troubled offspring. Technically, the film is outstanding. The adaptation of the Jeffrey Eugenides novel is well done. The script is original in every way. The direction is fine and absorbing. Even the light conjures to express the characters' feelings and obsessions. The music is also a key factor and adds to the general beauty of the film. The acting is at the top with James Woods, Kathleen Turner and Kirsten Dunst delivering riveting performances. The latter truly shines in her complex role and is able to convey every emotion despite an almost silent performance. My vote is 8/10.",The Virgin Suicides

There is a sense of impending doom that hangs over the film from the first frame.Is it really about death, or is it a metaphor for that feeling one has before, during and after puberty, that everything is ABOUT life and death? Are the girls' suicides meant to represent the fact that they simply mature faster than boys and are ready to advance to the next level?We may be debating these questions for the rest of our lives, which is always the mark of a thought-provoking film.

The story is poorly adapted [it is too all-inclusive and ""full""].  Simplicity should have been the inspiration -- taking the girls and their darkly fascinating destiny into a bold, one-lined trip.  Instead, it was overwhelmed with details, with one thing rushed in so another could be included.  Perhaps with the subject matter, I was expecting something more controversial.  Instead the movie is a light-weight, polite, feel-good documentary trying too hard to respect everybody's memory and viewpoint. Barely an extended episode of some WB Network, teenage, school-stagnant, monotonous consumerism/commercialism that needed the title ""Virgin Suicides"" [which ends up being the most erotically interesting thing about the whole film] to hook in viewers.You'll be snoring.

163,jimrin,Disappointing...,6,20 February 2012,"Like many others, I was wondering what the meaning of the movie was. However, unlike others, the more I found out, the less I liked the movie. I think most people dismiss the idea that the meaning of the movie is to criticize draconian-style parents, but if that's not the point, then what is the point. Unfortunately, the movie made that a rather ambiguous point. What lead to my disappointment were the Sparknotes on the book. URLs are not allowed in reviews, You can find it pretty easily and start reading from the character analysis.First, while I thought the intro of Trip in the movie was great, it seems that there is much more to Trip than the movie reveals. While it showed Trip smoking weed in the movie, Sparknotes refer to his ""burgeoning drug trade"". Perhaps it was Coppola's desire to make Trip into a likable character, but I don't know why based on what happens in the movie.Second, the following page in Sparknotes refers to all the symbolism in the movie, such as Lux's bra on the crucible which Peter takes and the long bath Cecilia takes prior to putting on a dirty ill-fitting wedding dress to her party... What...? Did I miss these points in the movie?So then I wonder what else I missed. What seems to have happened is that since it is impractical to fit an entire book into a movie, they did the next best thing (being sarcastic here) which was to take the Cliff Notes version and make that into a movie. Although Sparknotes may reflect one person's view, I can at least better understand perhaps what the author was trying to say better through Sparknotes than I did from watching the movie. Since the original author was male, and the narration of the story was from one of the boys' point of view, perhaps the movie was about how the girls seemed inaccessible to them. The movie partially got that point across, but only partially. Or perhaps the movie was about the mundane and hypocritical life in suburbia and that for Lux, Trip was her escape, and even for Trip, Lux was her escape... I was also wondering about the title of the book since we know Lux was not a virgin... However, what also seems to be missing from the movie is the fact that it is a line from a song from Lux's favorite band... Whooops, somehow that was left out of the movie, too, wasn't it?In a way, it would be nice if someone else would do an adaptation of the book... but I imagine that is unlikely.Anyway, despite my disappointment, I felt the movie was worthwhile with a 6/10 rating. I thought there were strong performances by Josh Hartnett and Kirsten Dunst, and a good supporting performance by James Woods. Based on what I read about the character of Mr. Lisbon, he played the role well.",The Virgin Suicides

James Woods and Kathleen Turner (why didn't she get more roles??) were fantastic as the uptight and old fashioned parents of the 5 virgins. Also a fine turn with a bad wig from Josh Hartnett as Trip, who has only one thing in mind. And another surprising role for Kirsten Dunst. I still don't know if I like this movie (I gave it a 5), but certainly it holds my attention until the end. With lesser actors I'm pretty sure that this could have been a misfire, but with this cast it is an impressive debut for writer/director Sofia Coppola (who I hated in her role in ""Godfather III"").",The Virgin Suicides
165,dunbare,Haunting,10,18 January 2007,"The virgin Suicides is in my opinion Sophia Coppola's best movie to date. I have read the book and found the movie to be faithful.******Spoilers******This movie reminds me a bit of a beautiful nightmare. Five pretty blond sisters in an upper middle class Midwestern community kill themselves NO! The story settles on neighborhood teenage boys obsession with the unattainable Lisbon sisters, Therese, Mary, Bonnie, Lux and Cecilia. Lux is the main focus and is portrayed by Kirsten Dunst, an excellent choice. The viewer becomes equally entranced by these girls wanting to know everything about them and knowing absolutely nothing. Being a female I related better to the girls story and had to wonder after awhile why are these boys so interested in their lives? After all none of the boys are particularly appealing except Tripp FOntaine (Josh Harnett and a bad wig). I had to watch this movie twice one time right after the other. To me, at least the second time around and after learning more about the book, I realized this is a book and movie focusing more about the boys. They are desperate for these girls and have no way of knowing what to do. One would think that they would simply talk to them instead of resorting to finding the meaning in a diary. Apparently boys do not think this way. They look and wonder and get tongue tied at the very sight of the girls. It is almost as if they are prevented from getting too close to them. These boys essentially just cannot relate or know a female in any sense. They just loved them. The whole plot is very much up for debate and bound to have different opinions. Why did these girls kill themselves? What were they really like? even simpler questions like what made them laugh or cry all result in the same answer. The boys do not know. What is even more confusing to them is that the girls seem to know exactly too much. Lux of course is considered the fairest sister. She is aloof and very aware of her beauty. She of course causes the school hunk Trip to turn to mush. Funny how someone can have that affect even for a hunky guy who was 'never one to pursue'. They girls are slowly fading throughout the movie leaving the boys more and more anxious. They question the Lisbon suicides even when there adults as if the answer will magically appear or the girls were suddenly come back to life.In fact this movie was really a thought provoking piece. I found it depressing at times and quite lovely as well. The whole cinematography is beautiful and the teenage actors were very good. Definitely a movie worth seeing.",The Virgin Suicides
166,terceiro-2,Well made but ultimately unsatisfying,7,23 October 2010,"I had not read the book before watching the movie, so I did not know what to expect. I was immediately captivated by the movie - it is very well made, well acted and the lead characters are very engaging. However, I was not too sure the director was very focused on what she wanted to achieve. It seemed to move back and forth between seriously dealing with the issue of youth suicide and making jokes about the topic. I have seen in some other reviews which suggest that the pointlessness of the suicides in the movie is intended to emphasize how pointless suicide it. However, I think that mixes up cause and effect. While suicide is ultimately pointless, it usually occurs for a reason. Therefore, it is important to try to work out the causes of suicide if there is going to be any way of preventing it occurring. In this case, the causes of the suicides are not really explored.",The Virgin Suicides
167,andyman618,Good but not great first effort,7,14 October 2004,"I've heard a lot about this film and finally got around to watching it tonight. I have to say that most of the praise I had heard was well deserved. This is a great debut film for Coppola.The Lisbon family is your typical suburban household. There's Mom and Dad and their five daughters, aged 13 through 17. All the girls are beautiful, but beyond the reach of any of the boys at school. After the youngest daughter, Cecelia, commits suicide, and another event that I won't spoil, the girls are kept in virtual isolation by their religiously strict parents. This starts them all on a slow downward spiral of self-destruction.This movie is a lot funnier than you would think from the synopsis, but there really is a lot of humor throughout. The cinematography is great, with excellent use of light and color, and the performances are all good, especially from Kathleen Turner and James Woods who are both brilliant as the well-meaning but clueless parents. But there's something missing here. Parts were funny, and parts were charming, but I never really cared about any of the girls the way I thought I should. I never came close to shedding a tear in what should have been a heart-wrenching story.The Virgin Suicides is very well done, beautiful, funny, and gives you plenty to think about afterwards, but....I dunno...it seemed a tad shallow. Funny, these are almost the exact same comments I made about Lost In Translation. I guess I just don't get Sofia Coppola. I liked this one much better than LiT, though, and it gets my recommendation (for whatever that's worth).Can I give a film a 7 1/2 rating? If so, this one gets it.

170,ztruk2001,A rare gem of a movie,10,24 February 2005,"Sophia Coppola's feature film debut in the director's chair is a unique accomplishment. The movie is extremely stylized both in look and subject matter. It follows the lives of several young sisters coming of age and a group of neighborhood boys who become fascinated with the enigmatic and youthful beauties living next door. The movie takes place in the 1970's and it's obvious a labor of love for Sophia Coppola as she paints the film along with Edward Lachman's gorgeous cinematography as a sort of dreamscape walk through a distant memory. It's an enchanting and surreal vision of the moment in time, which these sisters and their infatuated neighbor boys grew up in. Kirsten Dunst is remarkable playing one of the Lisbon sisters, who is the only of the bunch who dares to defy their wicked mother played by Kathleen Turner. Turner is good as the ridiculously strict mother who wants to keep her girls locked away and virginal for seemingly an eternity. James Woods plays the well to do hen-pecked father, who also happens to teach. Teaching is his only means of communicating. In any real conversation or situation he is extremely awkward and uncomfortable, as he is when trying to side with Josh Hartnett when he pleads his case to court Dunst. Woods is a highly versatile actor and shows how good he can be outside of his typecast tough guy roles. The Virgin Suicides showcases him at the top of his game. Oh and of course, the suicides. And this is where the movie does an excellent job. It shows the traumatic day-to-day struggles of what it might be like to be a teenage girl when your emotions and hormones are firing on all cylinders and each day is a monumental struggle just to keep your sanity. Kirsten Dunst is a revelation in her role as Lux Lisbon and recaptures the brilliance she showed at an early age in Interview With the Vampire. Dunst is a true combination of talent, instinct, and beauty. The surreal film is done with so much style and grace that it's breathtaking. It's beautiful movie to look at and has a way of speaking to the audience through the hazy mind state of dreams and memories as few films can.",The Virgin Suicides
171,Julian_Lie,Goosebumps,8,13 February 2006,"Sometimes, in very rare occasions the talent of a person go to his children and this is that case. Francis Ford Coppola is an awesome director but Sofia can be better.OK the movie is about five sisters that end up commenting suicide, and why and the events that end up with their dead is a mystery. And that basically is the plot of the movie.There are just a few movies that may gave you goosebumps one time, most of them at the end, but this one give you that sensation every five minutes. Is a trip to a girls mind, that we (men) really cant understand, but this film gives you an idea whats happening there. I would like to hear the opinion of a woman of this flick.Rent the movie, watch it on TV, I don't know how but you have to watch it, is one of those you don't wouldn't want to miss.",The Virgin Suicides

Breaking some new ground here with the story.More than anything I got the sense the movie was floating or wafting by as the story slowly and evocatively unfolded. Left me with the same sense I got watching ""Picnic at Hanging Rock."" We see what is going on on the surface with the characters, and we get rare glimpses inside. But in the end you're left with just the mystery.See this movie!",The Virgin Suicides
173,etai,a healthy signal,8,28 October 2000,"This film signals that not all is decaying in American cinema. With a generous helping hand (and some solid connections) from dad, Sofia Coppola has gone and quite bravely adapted a pretty slow paced philisophical shocker of a novel. She does this with talent and inspiration and comes up with a stylish perspective on gender politics, generation gaps and suburban humdrum lives.The soundtrack, as beautiful as it was when I purchased it 6 months ago, is nothing compared to the way it sounds whilst watching the film. It is an integral part of the piece, creating an almost ethereal atmosphere.The acting is generally of a high standard, standouts include the (almost) ever excellent James Woods and the totaly miscast Scott Glenn who reminds us that even the power of your dad's connections should be handled with care.",The Virgin Suicides
174,complications123,"Surreal and Intoxicating, but also Disparate",6,28 July 2013,"I feel the need to quickly preface this review with two facts. One, I have not read the book, which I think in most cases is a good thing when one reviews a movie as it sets an unrealistic point of reference across mediums with varying strengths and weaknesses. A film should stand on its own regardless of however far it has (or hasn't) strayed from any source material. Two, I admit to not understanding what exactly the point of this film is. Maybe it's because I didn't grow up in the 70's, or because I'm not a girl/woman; I don't really know.The first third or so of this film (before Trip's introduction) is dreamy and mesmerizing. The plot line likes to float a little, but used correctly it can leave the audience that much more interested in whatever over arching theme is being presented. I especially enjoy the awkward teenage humor not to mention the humor innate in the narrator's reflection on his youth. There's some very vivid imagery that would seem to lead to some character development and we get to learn a little about the people whose perspective we're getting the story from. The calm surrounding such a young and seemingly unprovoked suicide also adds some serious intrigue. As an audience, we're all asking ourselves ""why,"" or after some thought, ""what clever ripples will resonate throughout these characters' lives?"" Unfortunately, what made this first bit so darkly magical is jerked away in a flash. Abruptly the film shifts to focus solely on one sister, Lux, and even then we are only really witness to her actions, not who she is. The argument is of course that this is precisely what part the boys/narrator sees, but without really knowing who's telling the story, there's no real way to connect the dots, to gain any understanding what level of profundity this has on our spectators or how much gravity it holds. Does any of this affect THEIR actions? Do they change what they think because of watching Lux, or are they simply mystified by Lux? We're all mystified by Lux by now, and I'm mystified at why the film isn't spending much time on why we aren't asking any questions about the other sisters aside from ""why are they even there?"" From here on out, ""The Virgin Suicides"" takes on an episodic approach that in effect shows us what we've already been shown about Lux (that she's rebellious), reinforces the isolation of the remaining three sisters, and continues the theme of bewilderment by the boys. I don't have a problem with any of this; what I wish is that the movie had explored the consequences of this behavior, the impact that these changing opinions and lifestyles had on the characters. But in this film, the characters are all very fuzzy to begin with and only remain fuzzy. We know the changing situations affect them, but not in an emotionally, relatable way.The appropriate and expected shock moment comes and goes with all the reflective voice-over, yet there's no gratification. OK, I can live with not exactly understanding why the girls did what they did, I understand that the film isn't about them, it's about the boys who observed them. But with all the contact near the end and the invitation to the boys to discover the horror, there's no sense in why the girls wanted to share this sort of twisted intimacy with people who didn't even seem to be their friends. Furthermore, the audience is alienated even more because we don't know the boys/narrator either! Frankly, the two main parties involved in this film didn't know enough about each other to produce a substantial impact. And I really hope someone doesn't read this and think something like ""the whole point is how this tragedy between barely-acquaintances can stick with you..."" I mean maybe that is the point, but it's not a very good one, and it went through some really interesting stuff to get to a really dull conclusion.I like it, its fun to watch, but there's such a disparate element to all of what's presented that I find myself not believing that it actually ended without any further revelation. Is it a good movie? Maybe. But is it one you'll really need to watch more than once until you forget it? No.",The Virgin Suicides

They don't have fun and their parents take so much away from them. They all commit suicide in the end.The movie really shows what being couped up can do to you. It not olny hurts you but it also makes you choose wrong decisions for yourself and other people. This movie isn't over the top, it may be slow pacing, but it's because it wants to show realistic events in an fiction movie. The actors and actresses are great, and the movie as a whole is cinamatic. It is rated R but it's not to bad besides some sexual content. Thsi movie isn't telling parents to let their children do anything, it's just warning them that if you shelter them like in this movie, they may end up just the opposite like in this movie.My rate is 9/10rated R- strong thematic material",The Virgin Suicides

I cannot wait to see what her next project will be.However, everything else about the movie is also worth praise, particularly Kirsten Dunst.

177,thelastjedi_good,Sofia Coppola makes an artsy-looking movie with no depth,7,6 October 2016,"I expected ""The Virgin Suicides"" to be a heart-wrenching study of five repressed and abused girls who commit suicide. Instead, I got a movie that was... empty, more than anything.Right off the bat it is established that the five sisters of the Lisbon family, aged 13-17 have killed themselves. We hear this from the narrator, a boy who lives across the street from the sisters. His voice-over is retrospective, and it implies that many years have passed since the events of the movie. The movie covers roughly a year leading up to the suicides, and all of the events that transpire in that time (spoiler alert: not much happens).""Romeo and Juliet"" is a tragedy. If you read or watch the play, you see the two main characters live their lives and you understand how they are led to suicide. In the play, all the characters are fleshed out and have clear motivations behind their actions. ""The Virgin Suicides"" is like Romeo and Juliet told from the perspective of Balthasar, Romeo's servant. We don't get the whole picture. In fact, we don't really get any picture at all. All of the sudden, the teenage kids are dead, and we don't know why.Why did the girls do it? The parents don't seem to be abusive. A little strict, sure, but no reason to kill oneself. We get quick glimpses into the mother's supposed cruelty, but she's really not that bad- as far as the viewer can see. The most memorable line in the movie comes from the youngest sister, when she goes to therapy. The doctor asks her why she has attempted suicide, saying he sees no great struggle in her life. The girl responds by saying ""clearly doctor, you've never been a teenage girl."" This is the closest thing we get to a reason that these girls kill themselves, and it's pretty flimsy and uncompelling.There's nothing wrong with this movie technically. The acting is fine, the writing is good, and the sets look like they are from the 1970s. The soundtrack is pretty good, and I'd say that Coppola has a nice directing style in the movie.There isn't enough substance in this movie for me to recommend it. The credits rolled and I felt like I had missed the whole thing.",The Virgin Suicides
178,tanya_lamb,Hurtfully beautiful with lasting impressions,10,11 February 2003,"The Lisbon sisters will live on forever in the memory of the neighborhood boys who narrate this tragically beautiful story.  The beauty of this movie is that while the Lisbon sisters were beautiful and interesting, they were also very ordinary.  The narration, music and style of the film are very unique as well as effective. For those of us with Catholic backgrounds, this movie also speaks to the old school Catholic mentality of solemnity, guilt and suffering.Kirsten Dunst is fabulous in her role as Lux Lisbon, the oldest of the four sisters.  Kathleen Turner and her husband, played by James Woods, portray detached parents who treat parenthood as if it were a cold, mechanical project. This leaves little room for tenderness or a saving connection with their children, resulting in a failure to emotionally thrive.",The Virgin Suicides

Sorry, I know some people like this film (there are always people on IMDB who enjoy any film, no matter how poor, what a sweet place this is) but I was BORED!
Where are the characters for me to care about?How anyone can make a film about suicide that fails to touch so badly is beyond my comprehension?  Sophia Copolla must count herself lucky that her father can muscle the money for such cack.  Were those her friends that she put in this film?  Was she paying them?  Did they have fun, because they didn't exactly go through their paces?I don't really know what to say.  I can think of few movies that have had less of an impression on me.  I forgot I was watching a movie it was so dull.  I have to give at least one star to this movie, and that star is entirely for the original soundtrack by AIR.  However, the subtly music they put together is lost in the film's clumsy sound.Pretentious, a pretence at direction and story telling.  Don't waste your time.  There is a whole world of better movies out there that will enhance your life.",The Virgin Suicides
181,1981,This could have been a painting or a photograph.,9,13 June 2001,"""The Virgin Suicides"" is resplendent with still-life photography. Somehow the camera manages to unravel a little of that human facade that often obfuscates a person's internal makeup and character. You don't have to be unusually perceptive to slice through the outer layers of these characters and find a glimpse of their affected souls, the camera does that for you. There were moments, especially when watching Kirsten Dunst as ""Lux"", I found a light emanating from the cavernous insides of the characters and glowing amidst a drab milieu. The montages revolve around a central point, a epicentre where the will of the character dictates the movement of the surroundings. Sometimes, while watching Lux, the scenery seems to pullulate elliptically about her. When you consider that the scenery was fashioned like still-life photography, with every inch fixed and significantly conspicuous, this rotation exuberantly guides the observer and the film's periphery elements, towards the emotional centre.What do I mean? I think Sophia Coppola quietly unveiled the inner lives of her characters and did so while remaining taciturnly committed to allowing the story to tell itself. What is interesting is that at times, with the possible exception of Lux's character, the story and the characters are inseparable. There is a melding of the two, a fusion of body and motion that guides the viewer through movements, not unlike a symphony gliding towards a finish, or crescendo, or maybe resolution? I admire Coppola's ability to remain quiet, in modern American film this is a rare quality. It is also noteworthy that Coppola did not exploit the sexuality of her characters to make up for the lack of gratuitous violence in the story. The sexuality of the characters is never denied, never overlooked, but is allowed to flourish organically, slowly unfolding like a flower whose moment has come and whose world is anticipating its arrival.One could criticize this film because it appears that Lux dominates the story and she does. However, I do find that she provides an appropriate apex, a needed centre for the rotation and litany of the film. We also could criticize the screenplay for shrouding us in a thick mystery, a persistent rhetorical refrain of Why? How? Who? But there is a reason there isn't an omnicient narrator, for, like a portfolio of still-life photographs, we are left with images and the narration they exude, not the philosophy or paradigm rendered putative by pedagougery or didactics.",The Virgin Suicides

How good it does it is shown by the fact that, through the movie, you really feel what the boys feel about the Lisbon girls, I mean, you will be as drawn to their beauty, but mystified by their personalities as well, while, on the other hand, you also get to know the struggle of the girls, and be suffocated by their circumstances, just like they are.

And this leads to a disaster of course.I didn't read the book, some says it's better than movie but the story is OK. But, the film is BORING, trust me. You ain't gonna love it if you're not in a very very patient mood.Also, some absurd things happen in the film like maximum security and panicked parents wait till morning for Lux(one of the girls) to come home, at HOME.

You can be subtle and still give some clues (see _The Graduate_).

She made a great choice. The Virgin Suicides is a very good film. Because it makes no secret of its pending doom, it never allows you to watch in comfort. Even so, you still get caught up in the frenzy of the high school homecoming dance and you can't help but revisit your adolescence no matter when you actually lived it.At the same time, you watch with a knot in your stomach and you almost resent the innocence playing out before you. At points, it is brilliant movie making with a wonderful soundtrack that is often diegetic (like in Rear Window, which this film clearly nods to). As far as the screenplay, my wife said Sophia Coppola's writing credit is laughable, since she lifted all but maybe five lines straight from the novel. No matter. The wonderful performances by so many young and green actors suggests that Coppola had to have done some pretty good directing. (Better than that death scene in Godfather III, no doubt.) Given the timing of its release, I doubt this will happen. But James Woods might deserve a Best Supporting Actor nomination for the job he does as the ""virgins"" father.",The Virgin Suicides

What was the disease that caused the tree's leaves to yellow and die slowly?  Why are people so insistent in cutting it down, why was it such a big threat to them?  Why did the sisters hug it together to protect it?  ""Let natural take its course"", why did they talk about yet another extinct species early in the film?  Why did the sisters commit suicide?  Why are the boy's attractions to the girls so remote, with so much intimacy, yet disjoint?  How come the girls and boys seems to be living in parallel and disconnected worlds, this high school today?  Why were none of the parents seem awake?  How many trees were affected already?

It has sweetness and sorrow at the same time. It talks about friendship, innocence, love, attraction, adolescence and much more. It also talks about music and the way it expresses our sentiments.It reminds us all when we were teens -a period of life when we are half mature, half innocent- and the way we felt about the opposite sex, the way our parents behavior was decisive for our personality as a whole -in this film tragically involved to the death of the girls. It also reminds us the way a piece of music used to affect our feelings and express our mood, when we were young.Very good directing, acting, and musical score. Everything was very good.

Nothing else released this year will take its audience on such a ride from laugh out loud comedy, to heart felt affection, to, in possibly the best scene I have ever seen, shock and amazement at the brutality of the moment.

Then the story drew me in further.The five beautiful Lisbon sisters are living in a virtual prison run by their fanatically religious parents (Woods, Kathleen Turner). Things go from bad to worse when one of the girls commits suicide.Josh Hartnett was pretty fresh off his very solid performance in The Faculty. Here he plays Trip Fontaine, a school football player. Kirsten Dunst plays Lux Lisbon, the object of his affection. When Trip and three friends manage to get permission to take the sisters to the homecoming dance, this is when things take a little turn for the bizarre. Lux arrives home way after curfew and their parents, particularly their mother, lock them down even tighter.The scene I found the most touching was the girls and the boys communicating by phone using records to say what they wanted to say. The story was set in 1974 so yes, records.On the whole, the movie was a real downer. No happy ending for anyone. As I write this, I've not read the book, so I have no basis for comparison there. I will say that the time I spent watching this movie was time well spent.

One main complaint that I've read about the movie is that there is no explanation on why the sisters decided to kill themselves; however, I thought the reasoning was quite apparent.  Was Cecilia's death ever spoken about after the fact?  Did the Lisbon sisters know how much they were really loved?

My heart ached as I watched the isolation the girls were in and the parents who just don't get it.  The performances were outstanding.  Kirsten Dunst is radiant and broken, trying to fill a void that she can't quite reach.  Kathleen Turner is harsh and strict, thinking what she is doing is best for the girls, but making the matter worse.  James Woods seems to shrink after the death of his daughter, unable to stop or comprehend what is happening around him.  Josh Hartnett is also outstanding, and you some how feel satisfied with the misfortune that appears to have befallen him as an adult.  I think the two scenes I will always remember are the scenes when Kirsten Dunst wakes up alone in the football field.  You can feel her sense of betrayal and pain.  The other scene is with the scene where the sisters are exchanging songs with the group of boys across the street.  They don't say a word, instead the music speaks for them - the girls reaching out trying to explain how isolated they are and the boys understanding them amazing well, but not quite enough to stop what is going to happen.I am eager to see what Sofia Coppola does next.",The Virgin Suicides

The story follows the short of lives five teenage daughters of strict, religious parents.  The world that Coppola paints of the mid- to late-seventies, the time during which the story takes place, is one in decline.  Coming of age in this world proves to be hard for the girls, and their lives at home only add to the hardship.Discovering themselves and boys is challenging, given their confining existence, and the one thing Coppola does achieve is capture the sexual tension that goes with being young, beautiful and untouchable.  When boys finally do enter the picture, first there is glorious escape, then the inevitable disaster that only tightens the restrictions placed on their lives.  This is the point when the movie goes exactly where you expect it to, but it takes its time getting there and the only ones who don't seem to know what's going to happen next are the people onscreen.For a better meditation on life in the seventies, watch the jubilant ""Dazed and Confused"" or Ang Lee's quietly melancholy ""The Ice Storm.""",The Virgin Suicides

Early in the movie, the youngest sister attempts suicide, which serves as the catalyst for the movie's events. 5 Neighboorhood boys become fascinated with the girls and try to get to know them in any way they can.

As in the book, we are given some insights into the thoughts and feelings of these young people.The movie has many strong points: The narrated monologues, the dialogs, the characters, the way it's shot, the acting, the plot: it's all very very well done. The movie enchants its viewers effortlessly and subtly. Many people will also find this movie easy to relate to, because of its universal themes.What also strikes me about this movie is the way it shows the media's take on the dramatic events in the film: Always emphasizing the negative, making a spectacle out of it and missing the point completely. The town's other families also have their opinions about the Lisbons, without actually knowing what happened and why. This to me is just like real life.If you haven't seen this movie, go watch it. I recommend paying close attention to every word and every image. Only then will this movie's subtle magic really creep in.",The Virgin Suicides
201,colemarisa,"ultimately a vain, unsatisfying, and silly film despite the brilliant acting and lovely visuals",2,7 January 2018,"It starts as a bad analogy. Detroit did not die simply because of the auto industry collapse, but because the diversity that came in made it too dangerous for people to stay. So it is the lack of borders and boundaries that killed the towns. I feel the same about the girls. NONE OF THE GIRLS WOULD HAVE KILLED THEMSELVES IF THIS WAS REAL LIFE RATHER THEN FICTION. The truth is children are made stronger and happier when they interact more with their family, and when their parents set strict boundaries. Even too strict, if done without abuse is not a big problem. They were not lonely, they had each other and their parents. They were too young to actually need boys in their lives. I mean it would have been OK, but in real life, kids seldom act out because of strictness. I have seen families where the parents have strict expectations, and are overprotective, and the kids that come from such homes are extremely stable and successful. Familiarity and routine are great for teens, even though they say they don't like them. All I am seeing is a writer who knows very little about life, or about girls trying to fit what happened into his unrealistic point of view. No, diversity is not great for neighborhoods. No, strictness, and overprotective behavior that is loving and unabusive is NOT BADS for teens, and would never result in suicide. And a BS story, no matter how pretty is not great art.",The Virgin Suicides
202,colemarisa,"No substance, but very pretty.",2,7 January 2018,"I just didn't buy the story. Or the allegory. The reason neighborhoods in Detroit ""died"" is not because they were too insular. In fact, they died because of the auto industry, and because the diversity upped the crime rate. So, really it was the opposite of insulation from the outside that did them in. So much for the allegory. Now the story. IF THIS WAS REAL LIFE THOSE GIRLS WOULD NOT HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE> Now don't get me wrong; I do not think that parents should be this overprotective. Of course not. But I can think of many, many, many things that would make teenagers loose their way more then an overprotective parent. Especially because they were extremely kind about it. No abuse, no cruelty. They cared about the girls. They were not locking them up, and the girls knew perfectly well that eventually they would move out of the house, and go live their own lives. They were not lonely, they had each other. So it isn't like they had no one to talk to. Plenty of kids are home schooled, and on average their mental health is better, not worse. My thought is this; the writer WANTS to think that not embracing diversity, and being too careful letting your kids interact with people is bad. So he wrote a story where it is. I bet if this was reality, all of those girls would have gone on to be healthy and successful, and they would tease their mom for how she never let them go out with boys, but secretly they would be really glad the parents kept a careful eye on them until they were old enough to decide. The girls I know who had sex in high school were all raised by single mothers who could not control them. That is reality.",The Virgin Suicides
203,JoeMiddletonAlba,"Attractive looking, ultimately hollow, suicidal farce.",2,27 May 2000,"I started off enjoying this movie with its stylish visuals and neat soundtrack, but half way through I began to dislike it and by the end I absolutely detested it. The first suicide almost made sense since the little girl seemed sad and was almost granted a personality by the director. Though she wasn't in it long enough to develop much she sympathises with the Downs syndrome kid while the rest are all needlessly cruel, good reason to top yourself, probably not but maybe a  kid of 13 *might* think so (I doubt it personally). The later suicides made no sense, they seemed to be added in as an afterthought. Why at all and why altogether? What kind of  three teenage sisters would be in agreement to end it all because mummy and daddy burnt their records and kept them all in away from boys? Particularly when they didn't seem to even be bothered by the youngest sisters demise? It all struck me as exploitative rubbish. Sick drivel that really has no place in a movie aimed at a teen audience. This was supposed to be a stylish movie, it was. It also had a good cast but the story was horribly lacking and the 'message' if there was one was pretty sick. The ghoulish male teenagers (overly geekish to a man or strutting around like John Travolta) were if anything more unsympathetic than the girls, stealing diaries and memorabilia and basically just not fitting in. These guys had some *real* issues. Why on earth phone up these girls and then just play pop records? Why be *so* obsessed with a bunch of stuck up bitchy blonde bimbo types (that was all they ever actually acted like) at all? As for the point of the film, what this movie seems to suggest is that if you are a teenager who commits suicide 1) It will be widely reported by the media who will all say how awful and what a shame it is 2) Everyone will remember you fondly for years, hell you'll be practically immortal! Both these scenarios are absolutely wrong. A) Your death will statistically go unnoticed by the media. B) Your friends will remember you as sad and pathetic if they ever remember you at all. Suicide is a tragic pointless waste. This film is the same. Avoid, avoid, avoid! - 2 out of 10 (Crap!)",The Virgin Suicides

Watching the movie, I realized how important it is for some people to just want to be normal.  I mean you can perceive people you know and interact with as normal, but you really don't know what goes on behind closed doors.  But enough on the gloomy side, the sound track to this film was phenomenal.  I mean just mesmerizing.  It really captured the mood the scene wanted to portray.

Coppola's direction pulls out the best from the cast and the photography is at times simply stunning.I only have 2 complaints, and they're fairly minor.  The first is Josh Hartnett's constant mumbling  of his lines - this is probably on purpose for his character but at times he was very hard to understand, if at all.  The second was the casting of Kirsten Dunst as Lux Lisbon.  Although she was excellent in the role, Lux was supposed to be the 2nd youngest at 14 years of age and Dunst is clearly older (she was 16 when the movie was filmed). When you see her alongside all the other sisters (in particular Cecilia the youngest) it's easy to understand why many of critics mistakenly thought Lux was the eldest daughter.  However her performance was great regardless so it's only a picky problem.All up, I'd give it 4.5 out of 5.",The Virgin Suicides

207,TheHumbleCritic,The Audience Suicides,2,18 February 2005,"Everything about Sophia Coppola's debut film here tries to scream small, or maybe that should be whimper loud because Coppola's everything-but-subtle direction pretty much drives the film's shallow meaning into you, while she then proceeds to back up her empty dump truck over you repeatedly. Awful analogy, I know, but so is this portentous moral lesson in self-congratulation. This probably can't be helped,and it really isn't all Coppola's fault. After all, the book the film is based on is by none other than that moral relativist Jeffrey Eugenides, a writer the LA Times has described as a ""great American writer that we all suspected of being."" I didn't get the memo, but what do I know? ""The Virgin Suicides"" is about a group of strange sisters, led by the extremely effervescent, or ditzy, Kirsten Dunst, who are held to scrupulous moral standards by their oppressive and conservative parents (played by an ancient-looking Kathleen Turner and a tranquilized James Woods). Dunst is met with stagnation when she wants to go to a dance, or date boys, or fawn over Josh Hartnett, who here dons a long, Kurt Cobain-like hairdo in an attempt to give him more bad-boy gravitas, but the result is just a girlier-looking version of Hartnett himself. Long story short, the girls end up committing suicide by the end of film because of the stymieing influence of their overly conservative parents. Don't worry, I'm not ruining anything; they say this much in the beginning of the movie. You see this easy plot conclusion coming after the first 20 minutes. And it's also the title.This movie isn't the ""thinker"" everyone has made it out to be. For one, it's a movie ENTIRELY about Kirsten Dunst. Her fellow sisters might have been developed more in Eugenides' novel, but here I challenge a person to find any distinction between the other morose, sad-sack sisters. Think I'm kidding? Count the close-ups of Kirsten, count the number of times there are slow-motion shots of Kirsten running or jumping or some other physical activity, and then include the number of lines Kirsten gets over anyone else in the film. I would say it's about the same number as the film's running time: 96 minutes that stretch. Dunst has a fantastic body and some charisma I admit, but I still contend she's just too homely to keep carrying these goddess-whom-all-the-boys-drool-over roles (see ""Spiderman,"" ""The Cat's Meow""). She has a lazy eye, for one, and her razor-thin lips have a pursed, sneering granny look to it. I'm sorry, but there it is. Here, she is the oldest looking 14-year old you will ever see.While the film is also tauted as being ""indie,"" the designation isn't quite appropriate when the acting relies on the young star-power of Hartnett and Dunst. Now concentrating on one character itself isn't necessarily a fault, but when the story is so small and trivial you kind of need some more substance to the film. Critics have stated the film is ""challenging,"" and I suppose it is to some backwards dweller in a mythological hick town. In the real world, there is no conflict of views here because the sisters are the rebellious, sympathetic martyrs and the parents are the oppressive, empty tyrants. We, on the other hand, are the obviously more educated and tolerant beings observing on the outside while smirking to and nudging our fellow enlightened ones, right? It's ""Cuckoo's Nest"" minus the great acting and pacing. Or even a rehash of that other movie that solves its moral problems for you, ""Dead Poet's Society."" And that's all there is, save for the Wes Anderson-like random bits of welcome quirkiness that save the movie from complete oblivion. Those who've criticized the boys' ogling over the mysterious girls might have missed the one clever idea Coppola has extracted from the story; boys who innocently know nothing can ergo fantasize over what they know nothing about.But in the end, the film could've used some of that brilliant subtext that could be found in ""Lost in Translation."" Coppola wants to make the message and moods of her films painfully clear. In this film, there is no more evidence of this fact when you hear Dunst complaining to her mother that ""she can't breathe"" from being trapped in her house. Yes, we get it, thanks for reminding us, being stuck in a house with James Woods is tough stuff. So is, I suppose, a review so needlessly long for a movie so short on ideas.",The Virgin Suicides
208,DVLefferts,"Terrific, but highly misunderstood",8,8 April 2007,"Movies like this, including Lost in Translation and Marie Antoinette, are so highly misunderstood because viewers don't know how to watch them. The Virgin Suicies, and Coppola's other films, are not about plot or even character. Her concerns are more with era, beauty, youth, innocence, and a general pathos of longing that transcends the limits of our exterior identity and melds, like the noses in I Heart Huckabees, with our surroundings.To look for a plot with this movie in particular is to look for a reason for the girls' suicides. Some argue that the parents' strictness was to blame, others argue that they only wanted attention (a misguided idea picked up by the tone of the boys in the end of the book and movie). Really, the reason matches the entire mood of the movie. The girls were bored with mundane life in America, having nothing to look forward to, and The Virgin Suicides is a beautiful study in just that--mundaneness. Its simplicity and unpretentiousness are what most astound.",The Virgin Suicides

210,kystilla,"Depressing, beautiful & thoughtful",10,14 November 2004,"""Virgin Suicides"" is a movie by Sofia Coppola that talks about the Lisbon family. A group of boys, who adored them, come together after 20 years and try to solve the mystery of the Lisbon sisters. Parents (James Woods, Kathleen Turner) think that the world is too evil and cruel for their five beautiful daughters, Lux (Kirsten Dunst), Mary (A. J. Cook), Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall), Therese (Leslie Hayman) and Bonnie (Chelse Swain). After the youngest of the girls, Cecilia, commits suicide on the first and only party of their life, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon change the rules to be more strict. When Lux decides to brake the rules, they are taken out of school and their lives become full of misery and pain.To me, ""Virgin Suicides"" was one of the best movies I have seen in my short life. It made me think a lot about those girls and feel sorry for them. They were so beautiful and just in desire to live, but they were miserable under the strict commands of their parents. They knew about the boys who adored them and after the imprisoning, turned to them for help. They were all trying to find a way out of the misery and sadness in their own way.10/10",The Virgin Suicides
211,Jenni2,A Brilliant Film...Sorta,10,5 January 2002,"***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** Oh my gosh, this movie rocks. It shouldn't be rated R, it should be PG-13, except anyone under 11 SHOULD NOT see it. The images are a lil frightening to a 12 & 13 year old...Kirsten Dunst did an excellent job. That goes for Josh Hartnett, James Woods, Kathleen Turner, and the girls who potrayed the sisters as well. This is a lil review I wrote:I must say that The Virgin Suicides may be one of the greatestmovies of all time. It most annoys me while I watch the film, and theperson watching it with me asks ""Why did they kill themselves?"", ""Isit almost over?"" and all other questions. They simply do not understand the beauty of the film.From the opening scenes, untill the devastating end, you feel real sadness for the neighboorhood boys who went through their lifes adoring the Lisbon sisters, and never having the chance to interact with them.After 13-year-old Cecilia's first un-expected suicide attempt, the Lisbon household starts to warm up, and the Catholic parents become less strict, they through the girls their first and only party. This was the first accqauintance of the boys and the Lisbon girls; where Cecilia suceeds and ends her life. There are only four sisters left, Lux, 14, Bonnie, 15, Mary, 16, and Therese, 17. After the girls go back to school, they act as if nothing happened. One of the most significant happenings to the Lisbons, is when Trip Fontaine, the new high-school stud, starts to have feelings for Lux. Trip asks her to the homecoming; after lots of consideration, the parents allow him to take Lux, as long as he has dates for the other girls also. When Lux is too late, Mrs.Lisbon goes wack, and locks the girls up, for good. There for there was no longer any more communication with the outside world.This film is outstanding, congradulations to Sofia Coppola, on making a favorite movie among many Americans, and non-Americans at that. The cast was choosen great. Each girl chosen to potray the sisters, did an excellent job.If I were to rate tht film myself, I would have to give it a 4/5.The only reason I did not give the film a 5/5 is because I have also read the novel by Jeffrey Eugenides. Sofia did indeed leave out lots of information, and the narrator didn't provide enough. The look and feel of the filmdefinatly seamed set in the 70's. Ms.Coppola could have done better, but not by far.",The Virgin Suicides
212,btongninjaturtle,Aesthetically beautiful though watery plot,7,2 September 2020,"Amazing camerawork, awesome performances, fun, teenage celebration, overall a very solid movie. That said, loses a lot of points and potential for a few reasons:1. Pacing: everything was pretty good until the end, when the suicides do happen. The final scenes feel very rushed and don't develop the girls sadness at all. Quite the contrary they offer a sort of reprieve in their communications with the boys. This might read to some people as a ""twist"" but knowing from the beginning that they're all going to kill themselves doesn't support that idea.2. The resolution: Again, why did they kill themselves? And in such spectacular fashion? I don't think its crucial that Sofia answer these questions explicitly, but the obvious answer given (fundamental Christian mom smothers her kids) is so unsatisfying and boring that I can't believe that was all there was to it. Unfortunately the film doesn't expound on this, there's this sort of stupid mystique to why 5 girls would decide to kill themselves, when that decision would have been highly personal and important and could've been used to say so much more.3. The pseudo-philosophical lamenting by the narrator: Kind of charming when they're looking through the sister's diary, watching them from a telescope, talking with the other neighborhood boys. But this idea is really not central to the plot until the ending scene where the narrator states he was in love with the sisters, and that he wishes that he could put back the pieces together of why they killed themselves, wishing he could solve the mystery, etc etc. With the lack of any substance (points 1 and 2) to actually take meaning from, its annoying how much meaning and nostalgia the narrator has. This is also exemplified by Trip's proclamation of true love to Lux, despite leaving her on the field in the middle of the night and never calling her. These things just don't add up. There's too much mystery for mystery's sake, without any reason or explanation outside of ""its weird""Sad the movie missed the mark in such crucial ways, could have been really great.",The Virgin Suicides

Filled with great imagery (the Lisbon house and the sisters themselves among them), wonderfully shot, and surprisingly playful,  the movie also contains several nicely captured awkward moments, mostly whenever someone from outside the family attempts to talk to the sisters.  Even though the film centers around Lux mostly (who gives off an angelic aura greater than any TV ""angel""), the other sisters never fall into a simple group category.  They're never completely anonymous, only distant.

For a movie as beautifully filmed as ""The Virgin Suicides"", it sorely seems to be lacking a major theme. I enjoyed the cast, the performances, the score, the direction; but I just don't understand what Sofia Coppola is trying to say. At first I though it was a meditation on overly strict families, and then I thought it was trying to say something about how mean teenage boys are to teenage girls. Then I was confused as to whether it was a drama or a black comedy or both. I suppose it helps to read the work that it was based on, which I will do shortly, but in the meantime I mostly feel cheated. It seems that the appeal of this movie lies in either revealing something beautiful or something sinister about white, upper-middle class kids of the 1970's which #1 would give it a rather narrow audience, I suspect, and #2 it fails to do so simply because a main point to the whole thing is never clearly defined.

218,supernova88,A visually poetic film,9,8 August 2000,"I thought that The Virgin Suicides was one of the most visually poetic films i had seen in a long time. The use of a very nostalgic, almost blurry yellow/blue hue on the entire film creates this feeling that really makes the film a beautiful experience to sit through. I guess you can't deny that part of the visuals is also the 5 Lisbon sisters, adding to the whole golden sunny 70s feel. I think the set production people did a great job, and of course, Sofia Coppola.My favourite scenes from the film, well, one of the most striking to me is when the camera shoots the house from exterior and the lighting, shadows, weather, everything changes in high speed. I thought that scene was extremely poetic, if you don't mind me repeating the word. I also thought that in Lux's final scene, when the boys watch her from behind, through the back glass door, and then when she turns... i thought that scene was really beautiful-scary, in a weird way. She seemed almost like a ghost returning. Very uncanny, or something like that.Plus, a few final notes about the show - when watching it, i was very often reminded of Brian De Palma's Carrie. I guess the similarities are there: the 70s straight haired blonde look, the impossibility of going to the prom, finally going and becoming prom queen, and the horror the ensues... i thought the scene when Lux became homecoming queen, i was almost expecting the bucket of blood to splash on her (!) and i guess it did, in it's own way later.Plus, i thought that Coppola inserted humour in very subtle but effective ways. A few examples would definitely be the way Trip Fontaine swaggered around school, tucking his hair around, and when the camera revealed Lux's underwear with Trip's name on it. That was really funny, because it used a very 70s dissolve which really set the tone as well. I thought Sofia Coppola's style was very subtle and gentle but also very powerful as well.I liked The Virgin Suicides on many levels. I'd give it a 9/10 (and I've voted!). But to me, the most striking and commendable thing about the film is the visuals. I think Coppola really captured the mystery about the girls that the neighbourhood boys went through. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to see how beautiful a film can be.",The Virgin Suicides
219,Misanthropic_Disease,Superb approach about a delicate occidental crisis,8,17 May 2006,"The first, and literally the main, good thing from this movie is the subject and the way the story brings it. Few movies achieve to righteously express the disturbing inner affective, sexual and emotional trouble of teenage, and the way parents successfully worsen it. For a period, it even has somehow been a sort taboo subject. I mean, it's a phenomenon that always existed, and most peoples, in some way, went through this kind of rough and frustrating period. The extreme, though, is another story, and the Lisbon sisters life tells it with beauty, thanks to Jeffrey Eugenides, but especially to Sofia Coppola's superb adaptation.To place the story in the early 80's is a wise choice, sure, it visually uses well the kitch and brownish ""clean"" style of this period, but especially 'cause it both limits communication technology to reinforce sisters isolation, and successfully helps viewer to take a distant look, as this movie has been released in 1999. Still, we (well; I did) easily remember some sad and strange memories from our teenage, which give us this weird charm that keeps our attention.Otherwise, casting was excellent, even surprising, if you consider the usually dry performances of teens playing a period of their life which still isn't over yet. I may repeat myself but, teenage is a delicate and hardly well rendered subject, probably the worst age to deal with, but here... it was just flawless and natural! I'm pleased, really, 'cause usually I just hate and avoid any production mainly involving teens, but Coppola's daughter managed to produce a mature and professional job, thumbs up, really! Although, some actors were older than their characters, but nobody noticed, did you? Anyway, Wood is a pleasure to watch, while Turner isn't exactly as good, but definitely professional. Dunst is just as sweet as a female actress can be, anyway, since her early and so wonderful performance in ""Interview with a vampire"", it would take a fool to deny such a talent.Great photography, superb soundtrack, constant and effective art direction, authentic reproduction of a deplorable phenomenon, perfect succession of events and great, although depressive ending.

The film is however saved by the cast and crew.I'm not sure most viewers will really adhere to the characters as none really stick out or is really central to the story. It's more of a composite, made of the tales of many. This IMO makes the end product a bit lacking as it's a bit difficult to get involved.In the end it's not an unforgettable experience but definitely worth watching if you want to escape the usual hollywood production.",The Virgin Suicides
221,rafasalin,How can it be possible that such a lovely girls kill themselves?,8,20 July 2006,"The Virgen Suicides (Sofia Copola, 1999). Rafael J. Salin-Pascual MDThe beautiful girls that look very normal to everyone had a teenager disease, and some of them already kill themselves, without to be depressed. The question that hooks most of the people first, when reading the novel (By Jeffey Eugenides, The Virgin Suicides, 1993), and later to watch the film with suspense is: How can it be possible that such a lovely girls kill themselves?The cascade of hormones that circulate in their bodies can be hold for any longer, but cultural, moral, an religious all are plotting against that girls, and as always happens in any family, one member became the amplifier of all the members conflicts, and even without knowing what happens open one door to death an keep it open. Sofia Coppola, as a young woman, was the right filmmaker to look into the feminine way in which ex-girls live their lives. Emotions, nostalgia, mixed with deep thoughts, those girls looks very matures, but at the same time naives, savants specially in the perceptions of other people feelings. That is way Lux Lisbon (Kisten Dunst), was able to deal with Paul Baldino (Robert Schwartzman), the heartbreak boy in the high school. The reminiscence to other filmmakers as David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" and Peter Weirs's Picnic in the Hanging Rock (Australia, 1975), are very noticeable along several scenes (Watering gardens in a nice looking suburbs or the fragrance and innocence of the five Lisbone's girls). Of course the other parts of this story are the boys of around, that became in love in a platonic way with the Lisbone girls, and at the same time, they became the only contact with the external world. This is a very touching part for the audience, because lunch a target into everybody memories of the girl next door that you never talk with her, and only for that she became an icon. Because these girls that were brutally kidnapped for their own mother. Mrs. Lisbon (Kathleen Turner), is the intolerant element, selfish, and with a black and white vision of the world, that remember me about one some them of Nostalgia (Andrei Tarkovsky, 1983), where Domenico the mad man of the Italian town also kept all his family secluded and the Mexican film of Arturo Ripstein ""El Castillo de la pureza"" (1973), story that by the way was true. Mrs. Lisbone, she is the one who had that estrange reaction, when one of the girls (Lux) just arrive very late, the next day after a party. The mother seclude all the other girls at home, while Mr Lisbone (James Wood), extreme his state of dissociation, talking with plants and mumble. He is a guy that always has a great capability for denial, of course he can't face his wife, an there is a shocking scene in which the priest arrive ate his home after the first suicide and he is keeping watching the baseball and drinking a bear, without paying to much attention about the counseling that the priest is proposing. Because the title of the film some element of intrigue and suspense are involved, as spectator, people are waiting that something very heavy was about to show up, but Sofia Coppola made a wise choice, this is not a horror film, is a movie about the inexplicable aspects of human soul, and specially about teenagers that have to confront with life almost bare hands, and with a body full of love.rafasalin@yahoo.com",The Virgin Suicides

'Air' deserve an immediate mention for what they added through the soundtrack.'Crazy' is the easiest way to describe the girls actions.Not having read the 'book' but only having watching the film...I garner from the movie that the tragedy is from 'christian America' and 'middle-class America' (much like most of those of similar ilk) is in not understanding either their children, or, social changes on the whole.This film is probably more relevant than ever.I imagine Sofia succeeded with her debut, in part, because it meant something to her...And, I imagine the stresses of being 'young' and trying to hold an 'identity' that 'may' go against those of your parents is stronger than ever... and, that is the crux of the film - identity, in the face of those who demand you to be in likeness of themselves... sometimes, that's a contradiction too far, and the stresses too harsh.Stylistically, a film that I will watch again. Thematically, I cannot understand the rationality of ALL girls wanting to commit suicide... In reality (despite the oppression) it's more likely they'd take drugs etc",The Virgin Suicides

224,Fredalba Road,"""Triumph of tone"" is not always a good thing ...",5,30 April 2000,"In this case, Sofia Coppola has achieved a richly atmospheric film, both in look and feel, but it unfortunately works to the exclusion of everything else in the film.  The film's dreamlike mood is impressive, but it never wakes up -- kudos to the cinematography (especially the gas-mask debutante party), the score by Air, and the 70s tracks on the soundtrack, but the film screamed for even the tiniest bit of urgency; as it is, it feels like the cast is sleepwalking through significant portions of the movie.Additionally, the film suffers by being told from the point of view of the boys across the street -- again, we are distanced what should be allowed to lead the way in the film.  But at the same time, the boys are central to the story, and I can't imagine another way to capture their importance; perhaps this suggests a deeper unresolved flaw in the film.  We could also use some additional focus on the other sisters -- Kirsten Dunst gives a great performance, and is clearly the dominant sisters, but none of the others ever develop much personality or character of their own.In sum, a sometimes interesting film, but not a good one.  I can't recommend it, but if you were intrigued by the film's trailer, as I was, it may be worth a couple of hours.",The Virgin Suicides
225,hchiu,Sub-Par Snob of a Movie Masquerades as a Think-Piece,1,6 December 2000,"The virgin suicides tries to be a thought provoking movie by being slow and boring.  One might try to find a surprise conclusion as to why each of the daughters committed suicide besides the obvious fact that the parents were very strict disciplinaries.  The odd thing is that normal teens would not be as submissive but instead retaliate such strict rules. 
The character's never get fully developed and much of the questions are left unanswered.  Why is the mother so deep into religion that she becomes out of touch with reality and the father so helpless to act.  If suicide is the answer for imprisoned souls then it is indeed sad.  But the problem is that there were not enough examples of the mother treating her children in such cruel ways to justify the imprisoning of their souls and gave them such hopelessness to drive them to sub-sequential suicides.  Yes, we do see obvious symbolism to their imprisonment but badly placed such as the gas mask choke party held by the locals.  Suicides were merely used as shock value because the director had no good ideas on how to develop the plot to a climax much like an action movie using explosions and car chases as a gimmick to further the plot.  Because that is the only time that I questioned why in the beginning.  Why did that girl commit suicide? Why the hopelessness?In the end this movie is slow, boring, and amateurish.  Slow because the characters did not act out the conflicts.  Boring because nothing amusing happens but instead the director forces you to think by placing obvious symbolisms.  If you want me to think, the director should at least offer me something amusing in return.  Instead, teenage suicide became the only visual gimmick (which visually could have been so much more) that the director had to offer.  This whole movie does resemble a scene in the thought provoking film, ""American Beauty"".  The scene of the plastic bag twirling around in the wind because that seems to be the only essence that Sophia Coppola was capable of capturing much like her acting, amateurish. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give Virgin Suicides a -5 for being snobbish and -5 for insulting my intelligence. A total score of -10",The Virgin Suicides

228,Samsterp,Very disappointed,2,1 December 2009,"When I heard about this film I thought there's a good chance it could be well worth watching, with some good reviews and being the same director (Sofia Coppola) as for a film of which I did enjoy, Lost In Translation. However, when the film came to an end all I felt was disappointment.Before I go into what I didn't like, I'll get the positives out the way. I DID like the soundtrack, I thought it suited the mood of the film, and the acting was mostly acceptable (apart from a few scenes, such as Kathleen Turner's pathetic reaction to seeing her youngest daughter's suicide). The cinematography was fine.. and that's it.Now on to why I felt the film was such a let down. The biggest problem for me was that there was absolutely no way I could become emotionally connected to ANY of the characters on screen. None of the individuals were focused on in enough detail for me to care what happened to them. I couldn't feel sorry for any of the girls that ended their lives because, apart from the one played by Kirsten Dunst, we hardly saw any of them. They had very few lines and like all the other characters there was no development of who they were. Furthermore, when their youngest sister ended her life, none of them seemed to care. They just seemed to get on with their lives as if nothing had changed.I couldn't care less what happened to the boys either. By ""the boys"" I mean the one's that hardly ever spoke to the girls and yet seemed mystified and infatuated with them, not the one's who went on a date with them and then strangely lost interest forever.I didn't really understand why they had to try and 'put the pieces' together to explain the suicides of the girls, who were clearly just unhappy from obsessive and overly-strict parenting, although you would only be able to tell this from the actual suicides, as they show very little emotion throughout. It also seems strange that Kirsten Dunsts' character could sleep with multiple men on the roof without her mother realising, and yet she couldn't simply walk out the front door (the same door that these men surely entered through?). Although this doesn't make me feel sorry for her, because all I know is a name and a face, nothing more.I couldn't sympathise with the parents either. The mother seemed unrealistically strict, while the father's character, played by James Woods, was wasted. He was rarely shown and really didn't have much of a part to play in the film.The ending was extremely poor in my opinion as well. I was confused as to why the girls deemed it necessary to lure the boys - of whom they rarely ever spoke to - to their house, just as they all ended their lives. Following this, the neighbourhood doesn't really care what happens, which projects onto the audience. Why should we care when hardly any of the characters care about each other? And then as I explained above, there was no reason for the boys to be unable to explain why it happened. It's simple for all of us to see it, so why can't they? And that's all the 'mystery' blown out of the film. Besides, I thought that in the film the neighbours labelled this event as the start of negativity in the neighbourhood.. but apparently they didn't actually care.I didn't find The Virgin Suicides to be all that well written either, which is why I'm unable to share any memorable quotes.. because none of them are memorable. This film just generally has very little to offer. So eventually I was left asking myself why did I watch this? And the only reason I could come up with is that I hate not watching a film fully, because it's unfair. It's certainly not a film I'll ever voluntarily watch again though.",The Virgin Suicides
229,deconstructing,"Beautiful, but not a great adaptation of the book",7,17 April 2011,"Sofia Coppola's film is an adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides excellent novel of the same name. It is a beautiful, visually stunning movie, but it fails to capture the book's spirit.The Virgin Suicides presents itself as a story about five mysterious Lisbon sisters. It all starts when the youngest one, Cecilia, tries to commit suicide, but, unsurprisingly, tragic events don't stop there. In essence, this is a coming of age story for the group of boys, who watch the Lisbon sisters and fantasize about them long after they're gone. It's also the story about the death of suburbia in the 70s.The cast is very good, if a little surprising. Kathleen Turner and James Woods are excellent as the parents. Kirsten Dunst might not seem as the perfect person to play the most rebellious of the sisters, Lux, but she is quite good in capturing the character's spirit. Josh Hartnett as the school hearth throb Trip Fontaine, proves to poses an acting talent in one of his earliest roles. Too bad some of his later work was forgettable (or embarrassing). But bringing Trip Fontaine to life was not an easy task, given the importance of the character and the fact the screen time was limited, and he pulls that off with ease.Copolla does her best to keep all the important dialogues and scenes from the book. Great attention is given even to the little details only people who've read the novel will notice: the bracelets, brown-and white saddle shoes, Trip Fontaine's necklace. Directors and screenwriters rarely do that these days, and it's a big plus.However, the film never manages to be more than just average, if stunningly beautiful. It somehow includes all the details, but completely misses the atmosphere and spirit of the novel. It's probably because of Copolla's choice to focus on the sisters themselves and not the boys; this way, much of the mystery about them is gone, and it was one of the driving forces in the book.But a film doesn't need to be a great adaptation of the book to be good. However, The Virgin Suicides is never fully able to exist on its own; there are many scenes and situations that seem confusing if you're unfamiliar with the book. So at the same time it fails to capture the novel's spirit, while being too dependent on the novel to fully stand on its own.",The Virgin Suicides
230,imemz,"Haunting, quirky and beautiful",8,30 March 2005,"Being a massive Sofia Coppola fan, I was looking forward to seeing this film. When I finally got the chance, it wasn't what I expected - it was different, and perhaps, better than my interpretation.I think it was really the fact that there was dialogue than I'd have imagined and that it was restrained and passionate in equal amounts. Getting criticism out of the way first, I really hoped there'd be more focus on the sisters separately and less than on the boys, but perhaps that's what made it so special and poignant.It's an odd and difficult for some, story to swallow, but it's captured by Coppola's unique, eclectic style of script and direction and transformed into an absolutely beautiful, mesmerizing piece, camera-work reminiscent to that used in ""Heavenly Creatures"" and the teenage boys' points of view similar to ""Stand By Me."" While the narration and views on the captivating Lisbon sisters is thoughtful and sensitive, what really makes the film arresting and irresistible is Coppola's vivid imagery: Hartnett and Dunst entwined on the crisp playing field, the youngest daughter floating in the bath...these are images you don't forget in a hurry.If there were more focus, perhaps, on the Lisbon family, then more could've been done with it, but the actors make the most of what they have: Woods is typically brilliant as the father, Turner heartbreakingly reserved as the mother, Hartnett cocky and charming and you can tell Coppola thinks Dunst's face is something special - it floats over every other shot like a beautiful angel, contrasted with her bad-girl Lux.The film may come as a surprise, but you won't want to switch it off: from the opening scene to the end, it'll stay with you - and you'll want it to.",The Virgin Suicides

232,Macadamian-Nut,Stunning cinematography makes this film the masterpiece it is,9,21 October 2004,"I've never read the book, so I don't know how different this is. The only thing I know is that this adaptation by Sophia Coppola is fantastic.The movie is about the Lisbon sisters, whose parents are overly protective. After one of the girls, Lux, stays out late with boyfriend Trip, their grip tightens, and the girls find themselves under house arrest. This leaves one option, which everyone knows from the title.When you read the title, you automatically assume that this movie will be insanely depressing. It's not so, as you have plenty of time to prepare yourself. There is some pretty funny dark humor, which is mostly used by the guys, and is foreshadowing what's to come. This is one of Kirsten Dunst's best performances. I also now know why so many people fell in love with Josh Hartnett. He's absolutely handsome as popular guy Trip Fontaine. Throughout the movie, I watched with disgust at the parent's actions. It's not right to break curfew, but do you really need to put them under house arrest? This movie has an R rating in the U.S., but it's not really that inappropriate. There are some really touchy parts, but nothing to drastic. The cinematography is stunning, and the best part of the movie. Sophia Coppola is a fantastic director, and I love her work.--9.5/10",The Virgin Suicides
233,J[oe],Memories of places I've never been,8,2 June 2000,"This is a film that sticks with you. With its beautiful cinematography, the commendable performances from a strong and largely unknown cast, the ingenious touches of humor and flashes of wit, the haunting and brilliant score by the French band Air, this movie continues long after the credits, replaying and changing inside one's head like a memory half forgotten but always there.I must admit was not looking forward to seeing The Virgin Suicides. There have been quite a few films to deal with the 70's, with the suburban hell hidden behind white picket fences, with loss of innocence and realization of death, and enough stereotypical teen flicks to make any movie-goer weary. Even the good ones boarder on the cliché and worn. And yet there is something very refreshing about Sofia Coppola's approach.
This is the best representation of memory I've ever encountered, Coppola drifts through these unexplainable people's lives much the way P.T. Anderson does in Magnolia. However, Anderson's sense of tense immediacy in replaced with a dream-like recollection, a deliberate ode to loss. Instead of the omnipotent eye of Anderson's camera, we are offered the point of view of a neighbor boy. The viewer in fact becomes the main character. We watch, we view these girl lives, becoming one of the rarely seen boys whose adolescent sexual awakening manifests itself in these girls. A film not so much about the girls, as it is about the our own misunderstanding, obsession, love of these unflawed Odalisques, our own recollection of first love. Reality has no bearing on adolescence, events become mythical Greek tragedies and metaphors for existence. Time becomes timelessness, immortalized in the vacuum of memory. What strikes the deepest chord is the air of mystery. We, like the boys, don't really understand. Or do at a deeper subconscious level. The outcome of the film is stated in the beginning, the title no less, and yet we are helpless to stop it. This knowledge only makes that moment more powerful, we see only glimpses hidden in the shadows, but we know what happened. In the end we are left with incomplete facts and assumptions. Why? If the answer had been given, the parents being the easiest and most understandable target of attack, then the true sense of tragedy would've been ripped from the story, making everything up to that point useless. We, like the young boys, are left to speculate.",The Virgin Suicides

This sense of loss comes, I think, when you recognize that, even if such a scenario was viable, it's for naught, because the Lisbon girls are already gone.

244,Bendrix,"Stylish, but misses mark...",3,1 June 2000,"While this stylish film applies some of the engrossing, elegiac prose of the Jeffrey Eugenides novel of the same name, it misses the intended mark of the text and subsequently defuses the intense messages behind the story.  It's too bad because this book really could be conveyed to the big screen with these intense messages in tact.  Some aspects were handled competently in this version (narration, cast and initial mood).I've noticed in reading reviews and comments that most people had not read the bookand some of those who had had not comprehended it well enough to acknowledge the defusing rendition offered in the Sofia Coppola screen-play. After applying useful filming techniques to appropriate the mood of the content, Coppola then candy-coated nearly everything tangible involving the plot line.  The violence was absentthe depression was thrown outthe severity of everything was lessened, and the point of the characters actions were lost. What could've been a really powerful movie turned into an MTV style seventies tragedy without reason or substantial mysticism.  Coppola hereby made the film more accessible to teenagers (two girls around the age of 13 sat in front of me without a guardian), and yet irresponsibly portrayed the actions of the Lisbon girls as a trendy little game.  This film is not for teenagersit gives those who actually are depressed no positive help, and makes those who are simply confused amidst their adolescence wild ideas of permanently liberating the suppression, insignificance, and microcosmic frustrations of conscious life.
While both the book and the movie express that suicide is not the answer to one's anxiety and problems, only the captivation and intensity of the book give you grounds for believing it.  With the actions of the characters in the film being so ambiguously contrived, and tainted with a puddle-deep mystique, closing statements lose their punch amid the viewer's impressions of the first hour and a half.  An anti-suicide movie about pointless, candy-coated, bubble-gum suicide is pretty ineffectualif not counter-productive.  Good thing Coppola had enough fashionable sense to make an elongated Air (did the soundtrack) video out of it.",The Virgin Suicides
245,newung,a good first outing for Sofia Coppola,8,21 November 2001,"After hearing and reading reviews on Sofia Coppola's directorial debut, I was perhaps a little apprehensive(?) about seeing this movie, but a friend of mine convinced me to watch it, and I did. After I had hit stop, the first word out of my mouth was ""Wow"". (note, not Wow! as in excitement but Wow. as in Deep.)This movie had a good storyline, great photography and even better acting. While the story had the occasional dull patch (what movie doesn't?), it had enough to keep me intrigued, almost as much as the boys who spent their time trying to figure out the five Lisbon sisters. Several scenes in particular really stood out - Lux waking up alone on the football field, the boys playing records over the phone to the girls after their entrapment, and the burning of the records by the overprotective mother. The occaisional, subtle one-liners (Cecilia after her first attempt, ""Obviously, Doctor, you have never been a thirteen year old girl"") lightened the mood at the right time, and reminded you that these are real people.The pick of the actors were quite obviously the one's whose characters we got to know best. Kathleen Turner's (""The War of the Roses"") overprotective mother, James Wood's (""Riding in Cars with Boys"", ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"") distant father figure, Josh Harntett (""Pearl Harbour"", ""The Faculty"") as Trip, the guy who got the closest, and the best of them all, Kirsten Dunst (""Bring It On"") as Lux, the rebellious daughter, if you could call it that, who tried to buck the system, ie, her parents, and ended up doing it in the most poignant of ways.While a fair amount of other people who have commented on this movie have stated that they wanted to know WHY they killed themselves, I believe it is one of the standout features of the movie. Of course the parents, in particular the mother, were a factor, but it comes across that they are not the only reason, and asks you what you think, much like the boys.

I would've appreciated a more explicit introduction of characters like old Trip Fontaine and his current life, I thought it was rushed over and it didn't mesh with the rest of the film. The ending was also disappointing, they completely skipped over the moral of the story (as it was said in the book) and chose to leave the film on an eerie cliffhanger. Not a fan.Something I did like about the film is how they depicted the boys (or the Greek chorus, if you will). They captured their teenage infatuation perfectly, I especially liked how they read scenes from the story (or at least gave very descriptive narrations).

I'm glad that it was directed by a woman rather than a man, because I can just imagine how the focus could have been tawdry and sexual. The story is told from the neighborhood boys' point of view, which adds to the distance and mystery surrounding the Lisbon sisters.  Coppola did subtly show how the house was beginning to fall apart, an analogy to the girls' deterioration, but in the book it was more extreme--more trash on the stairs, the rotting newspapers on the front step, a foul stench.  Also in the book, right from the start the parents were shown as more strict--in the film their sudden strictness after the dance comes as a surprise.

Sofia, you're so very contrived, but not so very cool.This was a five million dollar production design with a twenty dollar story. If plot, character arcs, and depth are important to you, then steer clear of this movie -- this movie had the depth of a baby pool.  Thanks to Air and some other classic self-loathing pop tunes of the 70s, the music was the strongest part of this film.  Outside of that, this was probably the least likeable film I've seen this year.Of all the things Francis could buy his daughter, he forget to buy her a strong sense of cinematic story-telling ability.",The Virgin Suicides

I first saw this film, without any prior knowledge of it. Perhaps that is why it struck me with such a force.It has been said, that The Virgin Suicides belong in an art gallery rather than in a theater, and I reckon that is true. Throughout the film I felt like a poem was read to me, and its ""words"" stuck to me for an unusual long time. (To be honest they are still with me)In only a few minutes, I was sucked into the universe that Sophie Coppola had created, and for the next hour and a half, I found myself in various moods, ranging from sadness and compassion to delighted happiness and even laughter. And finally I was left asking myself (as I think it is intended) why it happened.""Why DID they do it?"", you might ask. ""Well, why does anyone do it?"", I would answer (Is is not, what the film too, asks its audience?)For once, I have trouble, pointing at a thing that bugged me...I gave The Virgin Suicides a 9 - The first film to achieve  such a score from me...",The Virgin Suicides

The best thing about this movie are the photography and the soundtrack; the image of Lux alone on the football field will touch you so much such as the songs, the boys, listen at the phone together the four sister.

256,cinemaisdope,A depressing movie that is beautiful and timeless,9,27 March 2001,"As far as really really good movies I've had the fortune of seeing recently the one that really stands out is a overlooked movie that came out last year called ""The Virgin Suicides."" The movie while one of the more depressing movies in recent memories is just brilliantly directed by first time director Sofia Coppola (it was also her first screenplay - quite impressive indeed). I thought you know going into this movie A) I'm a guy and B) depressing movies just sometimes make it really really tough for me to like the movie they have those endings where its like you emotionally feel like you have just fallen off a cliff... yet despite A) and B) I was very moved by this movie... the directing, cinematography, acting, music - all work extremely well hand in hand complementing each other. This movie will make you even more so want to enjoy every second and moment with those rare & special people you meet on the roads of life.Josh Hartnett as Trip Fontaine turns in a very cool performance. Kathleen Turner turns in a performance that is so good you wonder how she got overlooked when it came Oscar time... and of course James Woods is incredible as are all the Lisbon sisters. Kirsten Dunst is intoxicatingly beautiful in this movie and really proves she is going to be an amazing actress to watch in the years ahead.Probably my favorite sequence in the movie is the telephone sequence towards the end... the scene starts out and your not quite sure where it's going to go... but once the needle on the record strikes and the Todd Rundgren song ""Hello It's Me"" starts to play it transports you into a genuinely touching movie moment (and a great use of split screens) as you watch the boys and Lisbon sisters phone each other back playing music that perfectly fits. Another favorite scene is where Josh Hartnett leaves the Lisbon house... and you know he is sorta on this ""not-really a date - date. The montages throughout the movie and their interludes with the music by the band ""Air"" combined with the beautiful cinematography by Edward Lachman are just pure movie magic.All in all a movie that draws you in despite its slow moments, depressing moments, and haunting moments... a movie full of life, quite moments, passion, imagination, reaching out, and those moments in life not usually seen in movies that are beautifully captured in a very passionate way. Going back over the movie I find that when the movie works you become much like the boys in the movie fully enthralled with the Lisbon sisters and searching for clues and answers as to ""why... why... why""... as key and subtle moments pass by... its very hard not to fall in love with the Lisbon sisters... and though they exist solely in the realm of this movie... you feel that they are real as if they were someone you know in your life either as sister or a friend that you care about deeply and you feel their ups and downs... yet at the same time you can't reach out to help... though you desperately want to...",The Virgin Suicides

258,welsh_freak,"Slightly disappointing, and not enough depth.",6,31 July 2002,"The theme was good. The acting was good. The directing was good. The music fitted the film well. So, why was I disappointed at this well made film? The problem was that the story centred around the five sisters who the film just didn't make much of an effort to get to know.The only main character we really get to know is Lux, a fourteen year old, played by Kirsten Dunst. It's easy to empathise with Lux, as most people understand strict parents and growing up problems. But, she's just not a very deep character, and we don't hear even her side of the story at all.The whole thing is narrated by one of five boys looking back at the mister of the suicides. Because he and his friends didn't know the sisters well enough to understand them and tell us the story, he cannot narrate it well enough for any real depth.I really don't understand why the parents felt the need to cage the sisters from the entire world in such a drastic way, but then again, I can't say it's unrealistic. This kind of story is definitely worth telling. Not worth overlooking, ""The Virgin Suicides"" is a warning of teen suicidal tendencies, one which is hard to put across any other way.Despite the fact that the film doesn't go into enough depth on the sisters, most people, especially strict parents, need to watch this film as one with a deeper meaning, a meaning that shouldn't be ignored.",The Virgin Suicides

260,Oddba11,Not so much a 'film' more a sequence of events,3,26 December 2002,"There isn't much to be said about Virgin Suicides, yes, the performance from the cast was good, the sound track was good, and the cinematography had nice touches here and there but the rest of the film was poor.Although the cast give very good performances, you are unable to immerse yourself in any of the characters, this is because the entire life of the girls is portrayed by the boys so we don't get to really know the girls characters, and whilst the boys are so busy telling us about the girls we don't get to understand their characters either.  The film comes across as being more a 'sequence of events' or 'this is what happened' rather than a 'movie'.  Perhaps this is because of the way it has been lifted from the original novel, that said, I haven't read the book so is it just as bad?There have been certain criticisms from IMDB users aimed towards people who didn't seem to 'get it', there is nothing to get, try as you might to read into it more, there is no opening anywhere to read into it, no hidden meaning or message, no twist, nothing, it doesn't even really try to make a point.

This is about the atrocities that follow the suicide of the youngest of five sisters. The remaining four girls find themselves in a situation that climaxes with a cult-like phenomenon of mass suicide. If you decide to watch this movie, do it for Kirsten Dunst. She is terrific and spares no minds (nor belts). The story is boring, although a few laughs here and there, it is mainly meant to be a sad, but powerful movie meant to, if not shock, at least make the viewer wonder ""What happened?"".In this viewers opinion, it is a mundane, obvious movie with no plot twists nor turns.",The Virgin Suicides

This film struck a cord with me maybe because I've had suicide in my life I relate to it a bit more than the general viewing audience. Sophia does an outstanding job with such sensitive material even making it funny at times ( the taking down of the fence and the neighborhood wives serving lemonade while the whole town watches). Many minor details help the viewer feel what its like living through the experience the priest coming over to a disheveled house and being of no comfort, Celcia ""haunting"" those around her and the diary. I read a lot of different comments about this movie and read things like ""you never find out why.."" well thats the point. You don't know the real reasons why anyone does it you can only guess, hence the boys trying to figure out the mystery. It makes the film that much more real. I give this movie a high mark for many reasons the photography, the music,the way it made me feel like I was 14 again and dreaming all the time.

264,Feelgood_rev,The Virigin Suicides,8,30 January 2006,"I had been meaning to see this film for a while, ever since it had been released in 2000. I picked up the book, and read it through the course of a week. The book itself is very unique in the sense that there is no one main character, all of the girls are blended so we think of them as one. I was highly impressed with the book, and was anxious to see how this would translate to the screen.First time director, Sofia Coppola, with much to live up to her father's credits, does a fine job here. The cinematography was simply gorgeous. The way Coppola captures the era of this time, along with the colors she uses gives this film the feel it needs. That is what I was most impressed with. The young cast also does a fine job. Dunst portrays Lux Lisbon in a way that is true to the book. Josh Hartnet does a nice job as well. The rest of the cast, while not experienced, portrays their characters how they should be portrayed. James Woods is the winner in this film, however. Playing Mr. Lisbon, he demonstrates everything I thought he would be in the novel. There is not a weak link in this cast.My only complaint with this beautiful film is the script. As with all movies based on novels, I expected for there to be some differences. Where I thought the novel to be too long, I felt the film was 30 minutes too short. I felt Coppola robbed us in the ending. Where I expected this dramatic, long finale, I was left with a 10 minute disappointing ending. I also felt she took the wrong route as to how the whole movie was laid out. While many scenes were very true to the novel, I would have liked to have seen more interview-type scenes, such as the one's with the older Trip Fontane. The Virgin Suicides is a book of theories and evidence, and I didn't feel that Sophia used that to her advantage. She tried to much to tell the story plainly, and not showing just how obsessed these boys, and this community really was with the Lisbon girls. She does show this kind of in a secret way, where a one time viewer would not pick up on it. And those rushed scenes don't give us the feeling as too how sheltered these girls' lives really were.However, if I had not read Eugene's brilliant novel before, I probably would have appreciated this film even more. A very tough film to translate and Coppola does an above average job for a first time director. 4/5",The Virgin Suicides

I'd had it recommended to me and had taken a look at it on IMDb, which I don't usually do, so I knew a it about the film before I watched it. And I was enthralled, enchanted and entertained by the film from it's opening line of ""Cecilia was the first to go"" .If this line seems a little too dark and discerning for your taste, don't watch this film. I think it is a bit of an acquired taste, but then again often the best films are. It is haunting, beautiful and the images presented are some of the most beautiful I've ever seen on film. The music is wonderful and it manages to be romantic, heartbreaking, funny, magical and truthful all at the same time.So sure, it's not really a good film to watch if you want to have a laugh with your friends go watch Legally Blonde instead of this, but if you want to be caught up in something really interesting to watch and think about long after the credits roll, watch this because it's just so beautiful in so many ways.",The Virgin Suicides

I read half of it in the store and finished the rest that afternoon. It was so good I couldn't peel myself away.The movie is just as captivating.I scoured theatres so I could see this film, which follows the book almost to the letter (kudos to first time director Sofia Coppola.) It's a spellbinding story of neighborhood boys smitten with the oddly alluring sisters across the street. Set in 1970's suburbia, this deeply moving look at adolescent obsession revolves around the Lisbon family:the over protective mother, the aloof and clueless father, and their five intriguing daughters. Forbidden to date, touched by tragedy, the girls are seen as an enigma by their classmates, until heart-breaker Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett) is bewitched by Lux Lisbon (Kirsten Dunst.) The unusual events that follow will leave you thinking about this film for days. Despite the main characters being high school aged, there's not an ounce of ""teen movie"" to be seen. Beautifully acted, a mesmerizing and poignant tale of desire, passion, and love. Be sure to read the book (by Jeffrey Euginides) as well.

The teenagers, especially the boys, are more indicative of the 50's, the school that they attend reflects the environment of the 40's, the teenaged girls represent the 60's, and the writer hasn't a clue that a science teacher with a housewife spouse would ever be able to afford the house and furniture, let alone the acceptance of his neighbors. Well, you get the picture. The story, pure fiction, cannot bridge the gap between the improbable and the ridiculous.

But the story, which is one of a voyeuristic genre, follows the sisters through the eyes of a group of boys that pine after them.

What the heck was this movie about anyway? how it has a ranking of 7.3 is perhaps the most disturbing of all. What are you people thinking? the movie stunk, case closed.  If you are looking for a real movie, with a good story and interesting characters to boot try Sophia's daddy Francis Ford, who is a genius in his own right.

Although the Lisbon girls are in fact the central characters in the movie, the viewer can only know them as the neighbourhood boys do---from the outside looking in. Kirsten Dunst's portrayal of Lux Lisbon was well done. If you are used to seeing her in movies such as ""Bring It On"" or ""Get Over It"" or other so-called ""teen movies"" with a conventional plot, I wouldn't classify The Virgin Suicides as a typical teen movie.

It seems as though the director tries to do to much with too little and ends up leaving the story empty.  You get a little bit about all the characters but not enough to really feel for them or really care much about them.  the only exception was the parents.  woods and turner did an excelent job with their rolls, the sublime details really brought some emotion to the parents but no understanding.As the audience you get little pieces of a story but end up with missing pages.  ribsi's naration was great but there wasn't enough.  same with the girls, i just wanted more of the characters not a little bit about everything.  this movie lacks direction and true story telling.I'm left wanting to read the book because it seems like sophia coppola tried to do to much in to little time and ended up with a hollow ending because its no suprise what happens and the characters where to incomplete to realy care what happend to them.Not a bad movie, worth the little time, the book would probly be a much better way to catch this story though.",The Virgin Suicides
278,superman1129,no focus,3,18 May 2001,"**SPOILERS**Child actors just cannot play the complex role demanded of them for something like this movie.  The attitudes of the eldest four sisters are completly incongruous throughout the movie.  Have I missed something by not reading the novel?Take for instance these facts: parents essentially lock up their daughters in the house, and are quietly nutty about it.  This goes on for weeks.  All four manage to successfully kill themselves in four unique ways in the same evening--when, mind you, not ten minutes of screen time before this moment, they look serene and mostly bored just browsing their catalogues.  Totally misrepresented actions and character portrayal.Why are there no clues as to just how miserable they are at that Homecoming Dance--as excited as they might be about getting the heck out, wouldn't some of their psychosis have taken hold by then?  Wouldn't there be any clue that they're that miserable?  Or, whenever!  during their brave and off the wall protect-the-tree episode; they're all lucid, smiling, pretty, camera shy.Okay, fine.  They're repressing and denying and it won't show up in everyday interaction with kids at school--what about a breakdown when alone with their thoughts?  We can see Lux wake up alone, and her troubled looks at that point--why not with the others?  Why not when they start talking about it with each other.  Anything--ANYTHING--to make it seem possible that they're miserable enough to commit suicide.Even Lux's (actually thoguht the name would be horible, but it turned out great) increasing deception, with her rooftop forays with highschool boys, somehow doesn't mix with her unconcerned-slightly-devilish attitude she displays just as the boys enter the house, planning to wisk the girls away to freedom.  Since when did she learn how to play Mrs. Robinson?  From travel magazines and Beetles records?There's some really nice moments in this film.  The parallels drawn between a description of hurricane formation and Trip and Lux's flirtation in a movie theatre.  the girls' first and last party.  Kissing underneath the bleachers.  And I really liked that a few people saw the first daughter in the days after her suicide--heavy-handed and style-less, they were still nice.But it seems generally unstructured--especially for an audience who hasn't read Jeffrey Eugenides' debut novel.  The POV of the story shifts all over the place, from the girls, to the narrators, to that guy Trip, looking back as a 30-ish AA member.  The off-the-wall ending.Besides all of that, there's some heavy-handed scripting for some of the scenes that seem to come from nowhere.  The story jumped around.  Is it about the girls and their struggle with their stifling parents, or is it about these four boys and their search for sexuality, or is it about rebuilding a nostalgic teenage memory of five beautiful and tragic girls? I guess it tried to be all three, and didn't pluck the right chords in my head.But, hey, what the heck, Coppola's already accomplished more as a director than I have--so who am I to talk?!",The Virgin Suicides

Most adults don't know, and this movie tells them about it.Even though I'm not the biggest Kirsten Dunst fan in the world, her acting was very good. And Josh Hartnett, who I fell in love with after seeing Pearl Harbor, played his of the high school hunk football player very well. But, I think the best acting was done by Hannah R.

The aesthetic of the film alongside its heavy topics work to portray the stories of the sisters. The film is a time capsule to the culture of the period, including the stigma surrounding mental health. There is complex commentary throughout the film on this, but I think the fact that it is so beautiful to watch is what makes it so enticing.",The Virgin Suicides

Having read the book I went to see this film thinking that it could not possibly live up to my expectations - however, apart from a few minor emissions it followed the story wonderfully and was well acted and directed. The director dealt with a difficult subject and did so with class and understanding!",The Virgin Suicides

The acting is superb, the direction and cinematography flawless, and the score is brilliant. I really cannot say enough good things about this film. I must say, though, that if you loved this film, READ THE BOOK. It delves deeper into the story and the characters, and is so rich and fascinating to read, it will take your breath away. I cannot watch ""The Virgin Suicides"" enough times. I've already seen it four times...I absolutely adore it. Thank you Sofia Coppola, for such a beautiful film, Jeffrey Eugenides for writing such an amazing story, Air for the breathtaking score, and Kirsten Dunst, James Woods, Kathleen Turner and Josh Hartnett for their wonderful performances.",The Virgin Suicides

Remarkable script, beutifully shot, this film is a must for all who loved ""The Ice Storm"". James Woods acts (as always) with great conviction as the father, although the part isn't that big, it's a really big reason to see the flick, Kathleen Turner is convincing as the mother, the part that really makes the story. All other parts are played as good as needed, but are essentially just works of the story line itself (wich isn't a bad thing!), and give little chance to shine. The casting is just about perfect and makes the film feel very real.",The Virgin Suicides

I felt the actors put on nice performances. However, for me the movie come off as the epitome of ""anemic"". The continual narration which permeated the whole movie sounded quite nice - if you didn't actually listen to the words. I found very little cohesion of substance. In summary I was quite disappointed.",The Virgin Suicides

I wasn't too sure what to expect from it, knowing only that it was Coppola's debut and that it had a rather ambiguous title, but I was completely blown away by it. The haunting music, the nostalgic montages and truly fantastic performances combine to create an extremely evocative snapshot of the trials and tribulations of teenage life. The frequent references to the time it is harking back to are also very strong, allowing the viewer to be fully submerged into the era. Kirsten Dunst is indeed a revelation, somehow managing to be sexually precocious, childishly innocent and standard stroppy teenager all at the same time. (The record-burning scene was remarkably convincing). At the end I felt rather unsure what its overall message had been, and it is perhaps slightly lacking in substance, but with a mood as powerful as this, substance seems like an irrelevance.",The Virgin Suicides
288,darknessamber,Something Special,7,3 July 2006,"I saw this movie before I read the book, and though the book got off track from the main story occasionally, I found that the movie itself lacked something. It was very well done, the atmosphere was excellent, the acting superb, the narrator, however I wasn't satisfied at the end of the movie. Perhaps it was the lack of music in the background when the boys ran out of the Lisons' house after discovering Bonnie's body.From the trailer I thought this movie would be better. It wasn't quite what I expected, but for first time director Sofia Coppola it wasn't a horrible movie. It had it's good parts. Like the school dance the girls went to, that was a beautiful part of the movie. Or when Lux woke up on the football field and she took a taxi home, I found the atmosphere wonderful.So all in all this movie isn't anything spectacular or amazing, but it is something special.7/10",The Virgin Suicides
289,bastian002-1,Nostalgia tinged with melancholy.,9,28 February 2006,"What made write this review is the fact that I found the soundtrack CD at music store & bought it just 2 days ago. Upon playing it, a rush of memories & images came back from 6 years ago when I first saw the movie & my own memories of the 70's. This movie affected me. Six years ago I walked out of the theatre thinking ""WOW!"" I felt drained, but glad that I had seen it. This film transported me back to the mid-70's when I was a kid. My sisters were the same age as the eldest three characters in this story. I felt that I was in some way, watching a film made in that era. From the costumes, art & set direction, the photography capturing that golden hazy effect that many American films had back then. It made me remember and flashback all manner of things that I experienced then. The choice of French electronica duo ""Air"" to score the film was inspired. This isn't my favorite film. But Sofia Coppola created a film that I keep recalling & reviewing in my mind from time to time. A heady mix of nostalgia tinged with melancholy. If you were a kid or a teenager during the mid-70's from a Western cultural background, please watch this. It will transport you back. But if you're an average viewer with no emotional ties to the 70's, enjoy it for it's artistic merit & emotional themes. We all sometimes forget what it was like to be an adolescent.",The Virgin Suicides

We are taken along on a journey exploring the lives of 5 young sisters, their family,  and the community they live in. As the story unfolds we are given a new (and beautiful) perspective on what is mostly a common American adolescence. There is nothing outside of the story and the film title that should surprise anyone, yet we are able to take a profound look at the coming of age experience that many of us are so familiar with. Audiences of all ages should come away with the message to ""live life."" To do any less would be suicide.",The Virgin Suicides
292,trav-8,Haunting first feature from Coppola with some great performances...,7,26 June 2000,"Sophia Coppola shoots out of the gate with a skilled first effort.  This film is filled with a haunting romanticism, told from the viewpoint of a group of neighborhood boys who seem like they could have been any of the friends I grew up with.Set in the seventies, the film could have played up the kitsch factor, but instead, takes everything extremely seriously, which adds a sweetness and truthfulness to the story.  Great performances all around, especially from Dunst, Hartnett, and the voiceover from Giovanni Ribisi.  You can hear the hopeless resolve and confusion in his voice as he articulates the useless pursuit of trying to understand the beauty and suffering that was the Lisbon girls.  Highly recommended!",The Virgin Suicides
293,ambi,Hauntingly beautiful,10,5 May 2000,"Sofia Coppola has made quite a splash with her directorial debut. A feel-good movie this is not, but the emotions are real here, perfectly capturing what can go on in the minds of our youth in those hectic years known as adolescence. The film is very faithful to the book and brings all of it's vivid description to life on the screen, in a hazy almost surreal light, and is perfectly complemented by a haunting score from Air. The casting is dead-on and exceptional, allowing us to feel the pain and longing of the girls and their plight, and the boys who are infatuated with these mysterious girls. The scenes between Lux (Dunst) and Trip (Hartnett) are pretty powerful (the car scene especially!) as was the homecoming dance scene. Coppola uses quick fantasy cuts that are well placed (especially the one at the end of the movie, where the boys finally ""rescue"" the girls, which brings us a quick glimpse of what could've been and the horrifying truth that shatters their dream). This is a film that you will be thinking about long after you've left the theater.",The Virgin Suicides

Personally, I enjoyed it, but do not see it as a masterpiece.  Nevertheless, a great number of comments are focused on the lack of meaning of the suicides. These people often focus on the apparently flippancy of the deaths and the lack of reason behind them.  Those who feel this way are unknowingly playing the role of the parents in this film.  Sure, the girls are provided for, but one needs more than the necessities to thrive.  The burning of the records serve as a symbol of the removal of what makes life worth living.  The records themselves are meaningless; it is the mother's need for control and protection that eventually cause the total loss.  The suicides are not simply teens throwing around their angst, but instead a state which was slowly drifted into after the color was removed from their lives.",The Virgin Suicides
295,ryanskog,A unique and poetic film,7,9 December 1999,"I just saw this film in a test screening and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's really a film unlike any I'd seen before because it is about memories.  Not even individual memories, but a sort of collective recollection of the lives of five girls as seen through the eyes of the neighborhood boys.  The movie is deliberately vague and stylistic, and it left me with the impression that I was not watching events as they occurred, but as they were remembered. This is not a film about causes or resolutions, but about the feelings and impressions we take with us as we grow.  Although I was of the minority opinion in the theater, I thought this was a very good film.",The Virgin Suicides

Characters would come and go, with minimal development to any of them.  As an earlier posted comment stated, it wouldn't have mattered if everyone committed suicide,we never really know who anyone is.Best part of the film was the cinematography, especially the time-lapse with the front of the house.Depressing with no explanation for suicide, which is the case in life.

I was rather disappointed in the book, but since the movie got such great reviews, I figured I'd give it a try. This movie did NOT keep my attention. (I should throw it in that this was my vacation to catch up on movies that I haven't seen but always wanted to - ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" was the other film, and I turned that one off too. I always thought I could appreciate good cinema, but now I'm starting to worry!) The last movie that I saw that I actually finished was something about winning a date with Tad Hamilton.

I never got around to it until the other night when I rented it on video.Oh. My. God. This film was beautifully done with its easy-on-the-eyes cinematography, the shades of colours, the portrayal of seasons, the flawless actors (all of them), the way they moved & spoke.As in the book, this film is told as a memory of a group of boys' fascination & obsession with the lives of a group of very blonde sisters.
It's not your typical formula film & includes a wondrous soundtrack, to say the least, with hypnotic contributions by Air. It still lingers in my mind - the true mark of a great film, in my eyes.The book, the film, the soundtrack: I recommend them all.",The Virgin Suicides
302,arbinamuc,A UNIQUE FILM,7,3 August 2021,"I have never read the book but I have to say that after reading a bunch of articles about it and a lot of reviews I understand that some people feel like the movie failed to capture the story the way the book beautifully does. Like I said I have never read the book so that is why I am just going to talk about the film. In the begining I felt like telling the story through the male gaze sort of dehumanizes the girls and does not help the audience comprehend the girls motives, but I remembered that after all the movie is about the grief of this group of men, it wants to focus mainly on that which, is actually interesting because it is unexpected, it is different but in a good way. Secondly, I still wanted to see more of the girls stuck at home, the depressing side of that, I wanted the film to potrey how sad it is to be stuck at home for weeks while also being a teenage girl. Another point worth mentioning, is that I think they spend too much screen time on Luxs and Trips relationship which, was not needed. Insteed they could have shown more of the girls lifes and their personality beacause, the film did not let us in the caracters minds that much. Finally, I found the end a little weird with the party, the masks, adults making fun of the situation? But I guess it wants to show the cruel side of the world which I loveee. Dispite of some cons I have to say that the movie is worth watching, it has such preaty cinematography, nice music and the plot is really interesting and touching.",The Virgin Suicides
303,ijkidd,A non-depressing suicide film with class rarely seen in US flicks today,8,26 September 2001,"I had only just been lamenting the pitiful output from the US (after seeing Moulin Rouge, hyped beyond belief even in these pages but a loud & lurid, sprawling, overemotional mess) in the past 12 months when I at last got around to renting this classy number.  Having been put off by the prospect of it being a touch maudlin considering the subject matter I found this one of the most genuine and enchanting movies I have seen in a long while, and if ever from a US film.James Woods is approaching mythic status after this enormously restrained and affecting role, consuming the part and never exposing himself as being anything other than the maths teacher he played.  Kathleen Turner transformed herself into a character actress with a long career ahead and the younger elements in the Lisbon family (only two of whom are really exposed here) are as alluring and awe inspiring as the film narrators (neighbourhood boys besotted with the girls) suggest.What I loved most about this movie is that it never gets on a moral high horse or tells you how to feel or who to feel for, it tells it like it is without any emotional manipulation.  The music (by Air) may feel cold but suits the blissed out and dreamy seventies hues and the cordial formality enforced by the domineering mother (Turner).Sofia Coppola surpasses much of her fathers work with one film and engenders much excitement as to where her career will take her (hopefully not to the depths of her fathers ""Jack"").

304,hugmedont,Will never get over this movie.,10,11 May 2021,"This movie portrays the male gaze in a way I have never seen done before. I could talk about this movie with someone for hours. All the little hints the writers drop pull everything together. I mean at the beginning of the movie when the girls were getting out of the car and they each had a scene where there names were printed in different fonts and colors for all the girls was just one of the small ways the writers were trying to portray this image that all those beautiful girls were there own people. They weren't just the lisbon sisters, they were Lux, Bonnie, Mary, Cecilia, and Therese. They were 5 individual and deep characters the boys never even took the chance to learn about. The girls were so desperate for the boys to see them for their personalities they did the last thing that could signify a difference in them and that was literally to kill themselves all in different ways from each other.This story is so heartbreaking and raw. It deserves so many awards.",The Virgin Suicides

I was maybe fifteen when I saw it, and had no prior knowledge of the book, or even the title of the movie as I watched it. The movie is absolutely compelling, it really gets you to sympathize with the characters, locked away from the outside world in seeming perpetuity, then in a shocking (to me) ending, pulls out the rug out from under the viewer in an extremely morbid way, the way only tragedy can. The worst part about how the movie ends is the inevitability of the conclusion, when the entire time you have a feeling what is going to happen, then know for certain, yet wishing for the ending to change cannot make it change. Watching the movie really made me question religious fundamentalism and social conservatism, especially around the subject of sex, but it is the ending that has haunted me for quite some time, and even been present in some nightmares I've had since I first watched it. It really is a tragic tale, and definitely not appropriate for younger viewers, and while I don't think I want to ever see it again, I will definitely remember it for the rest of my life.",The Virgin Suicides

The overall impression I got from the movie was a very dark and suffocating emotion that flows around the Lisbon house, just like the ultimate control from the Mrs Lisbon (played by Kathleen Turner who was excellent in her role of a controlling mother). The chemistry between Josh Hartnett and Kirsten Dunst was mesmorizing.

It's one of the most beautiful stories about teenagers that had ever been written. The suicides of these five beautiful girls aren't to be taken seriously, it's a metaphor the author uses. He wants so write about the strange and often really terrible feelings teenagers have. And Sofia Coppola created an atmosphere I can't describe. Just as a light wind on a hot summer day, if you know what I mean. She's really one of the greatest young directors (especially female) of our time. ""Lost in Translation"" is a masterpiece as well. The actors were good, Kirsten Dunst is such a great actress, she should do more movies like ""The Virgin Suicides"", where she really has to act. Josh Harnett is wonderful as Trip and the girls who play Therese, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia, are great discoveries. If you like films with depth, films you have to think about, this one here is remarkable for you.

The Film captured all of this wonderfuly starting at the end and then retreating back to the beginning, traces the fate of the five young femmes des formidables.I cried when I read the book; it having reminded me of my own lost friend whose life was self-extinguished. Such an event truly touches us all and to see it captures in film is endearing, nostalgic, and sad all at once.Bravo",The Virgin Suicides
314,anglozaxxon,I nearly followed suit after watching this trite film with mildly redeeming visuals. (May contain spoilers.),6,8 February 2004,"I just watched this movie after my girlfriend bought it for 12$CAN at MusicWorld.  And I must say, YOWZA!, what a pointless movie.  Nothing happened in it except for what was expected from the title.  None of the characters evoked the least amount of interest for me except James Woods' one (and that was simply on the virtue that it was James Woods).  This was certainly meant to be a character-based movie, and Dunst's and Hartnett's characters were vacuous and I found I didn't care one iota for them, both apparently promiscuous just because they are teens.  Personally, I'm sick of the teen sexpot stereotype, and I thought that maybe an independent film would provide a little freedom from it.  Suicides certainly doesn't, and it doesn't in a conniving way.  The story is equivalent to that of a teen sex romp or a bad softcore porn, minus the porn, minus 3 years from the main character's ages (so that it's outright wrong to be turned on by it, despite the absence of nudity), plus some suicides tacked onto the beginning and end of the film to make it seem like a clever drama.  Not that I like teen sex romps or softcore porns per se, it's just that I like movies to be what they are.  Also, I found myself pretty bored for most of the thing even though I usually like slower movies and it was only 1:37 long.In it's defence, I was drunk, tired, and uncomfortable whilst I watched the movie, but I've done that before and enjoyed movies that were like this. And there was one good aspect about the film, and that was its presentation. The visuals were crisp and artistic and the music was good when it was present.In summary, the flick gets a 6/10 - 3 points for an almost decent story, 4 points for presentation (mentioned above), and -1 for that awful wig Josh Hartnett wore (or -2 if was -- God help us -- real).",The Virgin Suicides

Sofia's ability to capture both the painful normality of these five girl's lives, with an edge of mystery, mystery that consumes the boys who lead the audience through the story.Wonderfully narrated, this film follows through the memories that neighbour boys still have (25 years later) of the Lisbon sisters. Sofia's camera work is beautiful, with a haunting soundtrack by Air. What touched me most - was the story of the first sister,Cecilia Lisbon,played by Hanna Hall.Cecilia, being the youngest of the sisters seems to see the world in a different light, a shocking opening, as she is found to be laying in a bathtub of blood-stained water. An early scene shows the girl's having their first (and only) party in the basement of their home. Sofia captures the awkwardness of teenage boys and girls alone in a room together, outside school - for the first time.It is in this scene that Cecilia commits suicide, creating somewhat of a chain-reaction through the girls - and leading the audience of a journey that shows the dangers of a strict up-bringing and misunderstood adolescence. Not to mention - the loss of beauty, and innocence, shown in Lux's downward spiral of sex and depression.",The Virgin Suicides
318,rainbowsheeps,If you think you might have missed the point (or there is no point) of the film...,8,25 March 2007,"... than you may care to read this. Be wary, this is only after you've seen the movie and is simply an account of the thematic elements, not a complete review of the film... there are spoilers.One of the most notable themes/messages from the movie is how a parent's totalitarian, overprotective ways can suffocate children and cause them to lash out in numerous ways. Of course, ultimately the parents suffocation of the girls leads them to kill themselves, as well as a string of things prior to that, all throughout the film... most notable is Lux's various acts of rebelliousness. Ex: running out to the car to make out with Trip, making love to seemingly random guys on the rooftop, smoking, drinking, breaking curfew, doing several of these things simultaneously...) This theme can be examined, expanded upon and applied to parents, their parental strategies and their mistakes all over the world, everywhere, everyday to varying degrees. I hardly think the parents of this film would ever admit, acknowledge or even realize they are the primary cause for their children's suicides. They had love for their children, but solely because they had total control over their every action. Whenever a child (like Lux) disobeyed them or broke one of their overbearing rules, the love seems to be pushed to the background and replaced with strict discipline in the most relentless ways.Another strong element is the message of how the death of someone, in this case a suicide of several people, can affect many people, even people that you might not think would be so affected. And, it can affect and shake people on many different levels. (The aftermath shows glimpses of the parents, the boys, the boys' parents and the reporters, all affected, at different levels.) Personally, though, I find the Trip Fontaine/Lux relationship the most compelling part of the film... most notably the climax of it, and the aftermath. Lux is clearly the most dominant sister of the film... and the scene of her waking up in the field, alone with her dance crown, slipping her shoes on before she sits in the back seat of the taxi, driving home in the morning, knowing the punishment she's about to endure.. It is the most poignant sequence of the movie in my eyes.The reason that part, I think, is the most powerful (at least to me) is that Lux is seemingly untouchable throughout a major portion of the film. She appeared to be the most mysterious, even as other guys claimed to have talked to her and done things with her, she seemed rather untouchable, the most majestic of the girls. Finally, she opened up to a guy that worked hard to win her over, Trip... his name on her underwear. Finally she's opened up to a guy, only to wake up in a field alone... hours after her curfew, no way home.Fast forward to the snapshot of Trip in the present. He recalls the relationship as a bittersweet nostalgia for him... claiming it was just ""different"" for him when he woke up in the field next to her. He had conquered her, and to him he had unraveled the mystery that was Lux by getting into her pants, though he didn't really unveil who she really was. The older trip remains ignorant of the effect his actions that night had on her, the pain that he caused her, just how wrong what he did was to her. It's a stronger expression of a statement many other TV shows and other films have tried to depict of the teenage male dominance mindset that some, not all, males have... as soon as they have sex with the girl there's less mystique to them, and rather there's nothing left for them to do but move on.Then there are the boys... so deeply enthralled by the girls even after their deaths, for years, according to the narrations. One has to wonder at the close of the film, would the boys still be putting together the pieces of the girls' lives together to figure out just who they were if they had the same experience that Trip had in the field? Might they have lost interest and let the girls fade from their lives and memories once they thought they discovered who they really were by seeing their name on their underwear. Would they have lost interest once they thought the veil was pulled... or perhaps did the girls really just lose, within minutes or hours, their chance of encountering a love that just might have saved their lives from boys who were as dedicated more than anyone, even their parents, to finding out who those five girls were and what made them feel the way they did? All in all, the film has a lot of thematic elements that can be pondered for hours into the night. I have encountered many other films that are more keen to discussion than this, but there is definitely bait for intelligent and thoughtful conversation if you give it some thought and some time.",The Virgin Suicides

Plus, Hayden Christensen is in this( in a minor role). :D The actresses that play the Lisbon sisters, including A.J.

The neighborhood boys are all obsessed with these beautiful blonde girls who are all young, and pure except Lex played by Kirsten Dunst who did lose her virginity in the movie. Josh Hartnett plays Trip the guy who takes her virginity and breaks her heart.I loved the idea of the daughters dying to show how they could rebellion against their parents.

His daughter, Sofia, in my opinion is highly overrated because of the hoopla her last name allows her to bring in terms of clout and hype, but she fails to deliver. Frankly speaking, this movie is garbage. the story is pointless! so this middle class in suburban America decides to be ridiculously uptight and severe with their daughters, who in turn kill themselves! so what? big deal, i don't care ! give me substance, give me a story that matters and that i can relate to. James Woods should be flogged for appearing in this piece of crap. the only performance worth mentioning is Kathleen Turner's, well she'd been out of work for a while and this was good for her.

If the director (Sophia Coppola) had developed her characters, namely the Lisbon girls, and allowed us to get to know them; had she helped us understand why the girls became suicidal; had she portrayed the parents as monsters as opposed as to just your average strict, conservative, fundamentalist Christians; and had she portrayed the girls as deeply morose, distraught, and desperate as opposed to simply bored and dejected.... then, maybe, just maybe, this movie would have been believable. I mean, c'mon, there have never been a cheerier bunch of suicidal teenagers! And the idea that all four girls would have the courage to take their lives------at the same time, no less-----you must be kidding! LOL! Much too unrealistic and phony to elicit any visceral emotions in me or to get me to adopt any deeper perspective/message Coppola may have wanted to impart.

The performances from the all the young leads (both male and female - including a young Haydn Christianson) are fantastic. I know that the subject matter related to youth but even as a 37 year old I found something to relate to. Most importantly this is an adult film with complicated and difficult themes at its heart.

Not because the movie struck me as a stunning masterpiece, but rather in the hopes the book will do a better job of telling a potentially good story.Pretty cinematography, settings and music make for some nice eye and ear-candy (not dissimilar to Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette""), but don't help in communicating the plot.The supposed ""mystery"" of the Lisbon sisters failed to draw me in. While the subplot ultimately leads to their punishment, too much time was devoted to Lux's relationship with Trip and the time spent locked up in their rooms was not investigated. Apart from Lux, there was no character development and I didn't care for any of the characters.What mystery was there that plagues neighborhood boys?

328,kenhoho-2,Sofia Coppola has now wasted 2 nights of my life.,1,21 May 2000,"First in ""The Godfather 3"", now with ""The Virgin Suicides"".  What was the point of this movie?  Was it:(a) To engage the viewer in the trauma of suicide?  I hope not, because we never got to know the girls well enough to care about them -- they came across like zombie-chicks in a Palmolive commercial, always smiling gently but vapidly.(b) To share in the experience of those who cared about the deceased? Again, I cannot imagine so.  The boys across the street cared about them, for sure, but did anyone believe in their passion?  They seemed to like the girls simply because the script told them so, not because they were acting like real teenagers act.  For example, what actual teen boys would subscribe to travel magazines in order to fantasize about going abroad with the objects of their crushes?  Teen boys may fantasize about a lot of things, but picturing girls as Taj Mahal princesses is not one of them.(c) To show the horror of modern American suburban life?  Haven't we seen this before, and better? James Woods played a math teacher who caved into his wife's demands while sporting short-sleeve collared shirts.  How unoriginal.  Same for Kathleen Turner, who burned her daughter's records and couldn't imagine she didn't love her daughters enough.  Been there, seen all that before -- only in non-cliche form.Coppola's direction was amateurish, as well.  The Danny DeVito scenes, for example, should have been placed further apart, and the shot of the boys holding a lighter came across not as the homage of real humans, but more like the encore of a 1984 Night Ranger concert.",The Virgin Suicides
329,septsixteen,An incredibly subtle and deft cinematic exploration!,10,19 May 2000,"I have not seen a better film this year, or a better work set in the 1970s. Unlike recent attempts, the near-melodramatic, horror story, ""The Ice Storm,"" or the cartoonish (though well-acted) ""Boogie Nights,"" ""The Virgin Suicides"" deftly explores important and certainly more human issues faced in that era.  Instead, of cheaply using pop imagery and music which could have reduced itself to a, ""wasn't the 70's just a fun and psychadelic"" period, ""Suicides"" opts for a deeper exploration of the interior dialogues of an often misunderstood American time. The film exploits cinematic techniques from the 70's to contextualize the challenges faced by upper-middle class white society in 70s America, by focusing on a group of teenage sisters, hence the ""virgins"" in the aforementioned title.  In contrast to her recent work ""Dick,"" which ironically could have occurred in or around the same time period as ""Suicides,"" Kristen Dunst offers a more plausible image of a young woman living through conflicting messages.  She, along with her sisters are forced into externally placed, conflicted filters. There are neighborhood boys and classmates who eroticize and exoticize them, artificial neighbors who gossip incessantly, a news reporter who comodifies the sisters' stories, a mother who is deeply religious, a distant father who is unable to relate to anyone.  Then there are the confusing media images by way of fashion magazines, and travel brochures; on one hand serve as connections to a world outside of their household, but also further alienates them from reality - fantasy, escape.  Unlike other films, which have added soundtracks to decorate a film, ""Suicides"" seems to collaborate with music, making music integral, heightening these conflicts in very specific scenes.Throughout the film issues of the time are introduced in subtle ways and are dead-on without being didactic.  During one scene a sister responds to a doctor's Rorschach Test by saying one of the blots looks like an afro; the only (semi-)mention of race in the film is somehow infused with an incredible weight, perhaps because afros lay in stark contrast to the film's setting.  There's an interwoven theme of environmentalism, beautiful trees killed and torn out of their suburban environments because of disease, not unlike the beautiful sisters. There are brilliant links between trees in the film, one, made by the reporter of how one of the sisters loved the tree in front of her family's lawn, and an image of the sister lounging, naturally, cat-like in its branches.  The sisters appear beautiful, but are internally dying by dis-ease, like the trees, like the seemingly beautiful suburbia they inhabit.  Above all, the sisters run counter to the burgeoning feminism of the time.  Here are five young women who at once wield incredible power in their position within their community, but at the same time, are powerless because of the realities under which they live.  Feminism, perhaps, is another construct the sisters are conflicted by.  It's likely they were aware of the seeds of feminism, but were they able to nurture them within their realities?  The trees, as beautiful as they were, the trees, much like the sisters, were unable to control or choose their fate.  In the end, like trees, they shadow the community in which they lived.",The Virgin Suicides

I didn't feel that their characters had been developed enough to get me emotionally involved in THEM and I really was annoyed by that nebulous blob that was their male admirers.

334,Paul Haynes,"Rather disappointing, at best a poor Anne Tyler book.",4,7 June 2000,"Nearly 24 hours later I am still trying to work out what this film was about (apart from suicide!).  If it was a story, it wasn't a very good one, if it was about teenage angst, I missed the point it was trying to make.  If it was about suicide, it dodged the issue completely, and if it was about young boys coming to terms with the 'mystery' of young women, then it was about as subtle (and interesting) as a kick in the testicles.In fact the more I think about it, the more I think this film is a waste of time.  It could have done so much, but it failed to meet the challenge of any of the possibilities, even the characters weren't very well drawn.  I gave it a 4, but writing this makes me wonder if that was rather generous.But if you want to find out how the rich kids of America live their over-privileged lives (yet again!), and enjoy watching less than a tenth of the world's population consume half the world's wealth, then this film could be for you.

It is very well done despite the fact that industry laughing stock Sophia Coppolla (Godfather III) is getting all the credit for it.  If she did write and direct this on her own then good for her, she has finally found her niche. I think the best character in this movie is Giovanni Ribisi (Boiler Room)as the narrator.

336,gern_b,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING,1,31 July 2000,"I was really looking forward to seeing The Virgin Suicides, even though I've seen it seriously panned by some critics. Unfortunately, my excitement quickly turned to agitation very early into the film, which actually felt more like an after school special than a poetic movie about ""Love Sex Passion Fear Obsession"". Wasn't this supposed to be something of a black comedy, too? The maudlin narration, done 25 years after the events which turned the Lisbon sisters into objects of further obsession by the neighborhood boys, begins the unfortunate descent.To me, the story, which was well-acted by most of the cast, doesn't work as the remembrances of a collective adolescent imagination. The point of view of the narrator, who is speaking for all of the neighborhood boys, is completely unbelievable. The boys' memories of the girls don't ever feel mythical or mysterious enough to make the narration work, even though we're constantly told how hard to understand all of this is. These definitely don't sound like boyhood memories, even when 25 years of introspection and growth are taken into account. We could rely on the story as a straight narrative, then, but the characters are too thinly sketched to be believable. This, is intentional, but just doesn't work to the desired effect. The bond between the sisters, though, seemed to come across (powerfully, at times), and the young actors are definitely likeable in the movie - including the keen teen dream Trip Fontaine, a young womanizer who steals the hearts and loins of his female classmates. Michael Pare's role as the older, all-too-obviously-in-a-clinic Trip Fontaine, however was the worst acted and written role in the movie.My biggest beef is with the direction and the dialog. I hear Sofia was true to the dialog in the book, which makes me more than reluctant to pick it up. What was meant to be poetic came across as banal. The scenes which appear to strive to be the most powerful were the most annoying - especially James Woods' and Kathleen Turner's discovery of the body of the first daughter to successfully take her own life. And what about that sprinkler? Was it supposed to be a punctuation mark or was it supposed to be funny?  I could only survive through these moments if I forced myself to understand what Sofia Coppola was trying to achieve. Even the wonderful score by Air sounded trite in certain meant-to-be-powerful scenes, some of which even seemed to be lifted directly, but to less effect, from other movies.I encourage Sofia Coppola to keep making films, of course - even if I was extremely disappointed in her first feature-length attempt. It's easy to see that her career has the potential to produce some gems.",The Virgin Suicides

338,Pandora's Box,"Good story, but even more amazing directing",8,25 October 2000,"When I first watched this movie, it was in an art house cinema. And that is where this movie really belongs. The directing is really superb ! What an eye for small details; i.e. the squeeking right shoe of the priest. Those small details sure make it worth watching some more times. Also the soundtrack fits very well in the mood the story projects upon your retina. But when the movie ended I was left with an strange feeling that something still was missing. I wondered about it the whole night but I think a feature length movie is not the perfect way to bring this story to life. I think it'd be better if this was a mini-series, with more background information on each sister. The story now mainly puts focus on Cecilia and Lux. But what about the other sisters ? And this is what I think I missed something; the movie lets one assume the girls all acted as a group, like all the shots of the sisters together in their room, but they were all strong individual minds, all with their own strange behavior and emotions. And they could have elaborated that a bit more in the movie.But this does not make it a terrible movie; it's a good movie, but they could have made it even better.

I think she can hold her head high with a film like this under her belt.
What pleased me most about this film was its dream-like qualities, like when the guys turn up at the girls' house in the middle of the night, offering to take them wherever they want, then it cuts to a shot of them all piled in the car, euphoric, free. Next thing you know, we're back in the house and the girls are dead.Despite the title, there can be no doubt that this film is viewed from the guys' standpoint.

It was impossible for me to care about any of the characters and, let's be honest, it's not too hard to guess what is going to happen based on the title alone. There is little beyond this to say, because the film provides so little. The acting is good, but without a story that is at least somewhat engaging, goes completely to waste. Also, when a film is already this bad, continuity errors (one is shamefully obvious) are simply not acceptable.I suspect that some people liked the film because it feels artsy and poignant, with its fuzzy, warm shots. It is well-packaged indeed; the cinematography and soundtrack are good, but never before have I watched a movie in which so little happens! It gave me a headache, quite literally. I do, however, now have a renewed appreciation for the basic elements of storytelling that are adhered to in even the most mass-market, fluffy Hollywood pieces of junk.If you want to see something artistic and meaningful, watch anything else.

343,lori_b23,Haunting portrayal of repressed suburbia,9,27 January 2001,"With her short independent film, ""Lick the Star"" and her full-length debut, ""The Virgin Suicides,"" Sofia Coppola demonstrates an understanding of the pain of growing up a repressed teenage girl in suburbia.  The lives of the Lisbon sisters are beautiful on the surface, but underneath a facade of happiness and innocence lies a curiosity for the ""dark side"" and rebels with good cause to commit suicide.  Central to the cause?-- The Lisbon parents, who are neurotically protective of their daughters, to the point of driving them to their deaths.  Although the viewing audience knows from the title that the girls will ultimately commit suicide, the end is still chilling and somewhat unexpected.  The viewer is left haunted and unsettled by the final moments of the virgin sisters.  The girls are frozen in a moment, and will remain that way because of their deaths.Perhaps the most important component of the film, however, is not the girls' suicides, but the boys fascination with them and ultimate empty sadness at losing them.  We the viewers identify with the boys, wanting to claim the loveliness of the girls for ourselves.  Like the boys, we too are left baffled and hollow by their loss.",The Virgin Suicides

345,kevin-1199,One of the Worst Book to Film Adaptations Imaginable,1,11 January 2007,"This adaptation of the book is hardly worth a mention. I'm only writing because I was so appalled by it watching it the second time (the first being in the theater some years back). Watching it last evening, I couldn't get through the first sixty minutes and had to turn it off (this rarely happens). The book, which I'd read between my first viewing and the ill-fated second, is an amazing exploration of the decay of an American era and the explosive domestic drama that results thereof, in a world where physical reality and society (personified in the film by the Church primarily) collide. It is a book about men and our inability to access women, thus also our emotionally ""gooey"" sides. It is a tragedy in that great tradition, so much so that the tragedy within the narrative transcends the narrative itself to comment on a greater tragedy... which is what good art can do.But we get none of that from this train wreck of an adaptation. Which is really a shame.Coppola instead opted to present a nostalgic view of an era, lingering on what I think are meant to be humorous shots of out-of-date cars and suburbia... bored moments of awkwardness... first kisses... Basically it looks like an after school special or a long but semi-serious episode of Saved by the Bell. She presents a view that (and this is the great failure) sympathizes clearly with the inscrutable sisters when the text of the book in no way even accesses the character of these sisters. That's the problem. These girls aren't supposed to be sympathetic. They're inscrutable. Lux isn't a heroine, which she's clearly made into through this film. She's not some kind of grand dame answer to sexual repression. She's the victim of it.This is a book about young men, and men of age, trying to understand their world through the collective totem of the Lisbon sisters. Emphasis on ""totem."" It is not an after school special romanticizing the supposed dreaminess of female adolescence. Ultimately, this isn't a film or book that women should appreciate any more than men or men more than women - it's a human story about men trying to understand women, not women's supposed superiority over male ignorance.Really, thinking on it: it's a story of how girls age more quickly than boys. Most boys are awkward and clumsy at 14 (granted, well portrayed in the film) when many girls are quite grown into their adult shapes and can attract men far older than themselves, rendering them dangerous when coupled with the ""off-limits"" element. This is a physiological reality that comes into conflict with the values of a society. This reality isn't a male or female reality. It's a human reality, inasmuch as there exists filial and legislative restriction against premarital and youthful intercourse. But in this movie there is none of that nuance.Instead we see a clear, banal, crude sympathy for the suicidal girls. That is a failure, particularly considering the book is written - self-deprecatingly, at times, of course, but still written - by the male characters who, I should mention, don't despise men as much as this movie presents. They admit male foolishness and adore the memory of these young women, but they aren't self-loathing. Neither do they sympathize with the girls. They can't. They don't understand them. So the film shouldn't presume to enter that landscape, which is clearly not laid out by the book. There is room for a film-maker to embellish upon a narrative, but for a Freshman who clearly didn't get the text she was reading, this spells train wreck.We could have been told a story about gender in America and the post-sexual revolution landscape as it related to a decaying Detroit. That would have been nice. Instead of the story the book presents, this film adaptation presents a systematic misandry lacking any nuance or creativity or artistic merit. Better had David Lynch directed this film than Sofia Coppola, who's going to have to do a lot more than put Bill and Scarlett in a room together to convince me she's a real directorial talent and to make up for her performance in the Godfather III, which was the pinnacle of celluloid dross and artistically unforgivable.Last words: don't bother. Give the book a read.",The Virgin Suicides

To anyone who's seen ""5 characters looking for a writer"" (I think that's the title but may be wrong), the feelings of intrigued addiction are similar, and much like the boys narating the movie, you too become obsessed with the girls, and find yourself retracing key moments in the film trying to decifer the true causes and true drives leading to the film's climax. At different moments the film drifts from ""feel-good"", to spooky, to scary, to hopefull, and depressing. Whilst Sophia Coppola demonstates a fantastic talent for capturing the less obvious (or at least less pronounced) emotion within each scene (for example the scene at the dance behind the curtain where the camera is far enough back to focus on the awkward, unsuccessful relationship between one sister and her date, instead of the passionate example of the other). All the actors did a fantastic job, with the 5 lead girls showing talent for projecting obscure, subtle, and confused emotion in their characters, lending a realism to the parts not many actresses would be capable of, and even less at such a young age. However, even though she had relatively little screen time, pride of place goes to Kathleen Turner's cold portayal of the mother, more interested in covering her youngest daughter up than the fact that she had just attemped suicide. Overall this is a fantastic film that I'd advise everyone to see, not all the answers are given, and it doesn't really try to push home a point. It's kinda like one of those psycological ink blot tests - all you're told is a story, the conclusions you have to form yourself.",The Virgin Suicides
347,sexy american girlfriend,a film so dull i found myself also contemplating a self-inflicted end,2,15 May 2001,"No. Not even the ethereal mix of Air on the soundtrack and that constant, nagging sunlight beaming through the Kirsten Dunsts hair could stop this film from looking like a 2 hour Midol advert. The characters, other than Lux, have no depth what so ever...the film is set in the post-hippy suburbs of America, but it's done all wrong. What gives the suburbs their charm is their illusion of non-activity. Sofia Coppola should have known better. For a family of beautiful, blonde, popular, middle-class girls to be suicidal for NO APPARENT REASON is rather unlikely. While almost interesting in concept it does not shine enough for the silver screen. No quaaludes, no disco, no prog-rock. No cherry lipgloss or Sasson jeans? Rent FOXES instead!",The Virgin Suicides

The soundtrack includes excellent original tracks by Air, as well as some of the best mid-late 70's songs by Heart and Styx to name a few.
Several reviewers have complained about the lack of plot or character development, but this is intentional.  After the ending, one can't help but watch scenes again to try to figure out exactly what happened.Overall, a very good film.",The Virgin Suicides
350,jacannariato,Powerfully Emotional,10,12 December 2006,"This movie was one of the first movies that I had ever seen that truly kept my emotions moving through me throughout the entire film. From the very powerful opening sequence of shots, to the laughter of the boys trying to figure the girls out the very end aria, it was completely intriguing to me. The movie is set in the 1970's in suburban Michigan. Almost immediately you notice an almost morbidly seductive quality about every single one of the girls, not least of which Lux(Kirsten Dunst), the prettiest of the group. While many believe that this movie is about the girls, I disagree, the movie is really about the boys of the film in their search for the understanding of the girls that haunt them. The Protagonist of the film, I believe, is the narrator (Giovanni Ribisi) who we assume is one of the boys although it is never actually said. The antagonist(s), The girls, who slowly, seductively, and emotionally torture the boys. Great performances by James Woods who plays a seriously out-of-touch father, Kathleen Turner who plays a strict catholic mother afraid of letting life touch the girls, and Kirsten Dunst who plays one of the mysterious Lisbon girls she gives an absolutely amazing performance as a seductive and rebellious teenager. All-in-all a very well directed and powerful movie that you shouldn't miss.",The Virgin Suicides

More than their family and those boys were affected, the whole community was. The music for the film is very appropriate for the film and the directing is excellent.",The Virgin Suicides
353,Moviefied,...most beautifull shot in movie history,10,16 November 2002,"This movie really got my attention, even though I had no expectations on this movie. All i knew before I saw this movie was that (I am giving away the end now) the girls would all commit suicide. I don't know why a critic would give away that? However, once i have seen the end i thought i was just excellent. No real reason why the girls did it, only speculations. This is not a ""Hollywood""-feelgood movie, and that's what i love about it. No hero in the end who will save them, no smart endings. It is just sad and beautiful. What now strikes me also 3 years after it's premiere is that 3 of the characters have made it huge in cinema today, Kirsten Dunst (Spiderman), Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor) and Hayden Christensen (Star Wars Ep2). So the cast crew most be happy.The acting in this work of art is at its peak, Kirsten Dunst who posses more charm then the rest of the filmindustry combined, and she's talented too, is really glowing with charm in this movie. Josh Hartnett (Trip), is a very good match with Kirsten (Lux). James Woods is doing a good solid role as the girls father who tries to let them have some fun in their short lives, and Kathlen Turner is the non-understanding mother, who eventaully locks the girls up in their house. We also se Danny De Vito as the shrink. All of them are one with their characters. The do not play it is almost real.The camerawork is nice, no more no less, just perfect in this movie. Sofia Coppola who did not do such a great job on Godfather III, is now forgiven, since this is her real strength, directing. Some of the scenes and the mood in the movie is the BEST i have ever seen. When Lux is waking up on the football field is the most beautiful shot in movie history, early morning, wonderful girl (lux that is), blue shade. That is better then the magnificent views you get in LoTR or in any other ""great"" movie. It is just so darn good.Air is providing the movie with splendid music. The song ""playground love"" is so happy, slow, so strange (like all their music), not only that the music is so great it also fit the movie.I would say that the message is ""Too much love will kill you"" (a Brian May song), their mother kills them with too much loveDo yourself a favor and see this movie, or see it on more time. This is artwork.",The Virgin Suicides
354,FrenchBeauty,And Lux was the last to go...,10,12 April 2008,"From my European point of view,""Obviously, Doctor, you've never been a 13-year-old girl."", says Cecilia To Danny DeVito's Dr. E.M. Hornikerrom character, who seems totally distraught, focus in a concise way the subject of this movie.My first 14 years old's vision, in 2003, made me smothering, I remember the atypical Television and the Taped Cassette of bad quality. Since my childhood, I fancy the American way of Life of the 70's,The Doors,the Beatnik Movement...the First thing I've noticed was the Photo's Grain which, by the 35 mm Camera, brings me back to this other frigid and airtight America, ""Obscure as Hell"", with the munificence of the Edward Lachman's cinematography. Secondly, Every word, simple, deep and full of life, used by the Narrator, aka Ribisi, flows to my ears like a poem, it runs through my head, my veins..like the poison. Sofia Coppola by depicting in a realistic and haunting way the life and death of these five teen girls, from a conservative and puritan married couple( nice played by Woods and Turner), blew away my eye on girls for the rest of my life. Gradually I was looking the movie, I felt more and more touch, and it gave me the impression of being beside they. The music composed notably by the French Band Air ( yeah !! ) which is dreamy, subtle and slight, leads this smart work to dreamlike Lands ( as the Boys ' Lux Dream, i cried when she died). The casting is awesome, notably Hartnett who makes an nice effort since H20.Moreover, when my eye came to rest on Kirsten Dunst, it was the love at first sight, Lux represents all the stake of the film, the inherent conflict which seems to animate every girl. Then I remember me when i was watching Spiderman in the theater, asking my self ""who's that beautiful red hair girl? She's a stone fox !"" it's her !, Since this date, I idolize her, she's my favorite actress and to my mind it's her best performance.In my feel, by transposing the Eugenides's epic fresco, this first trial shot by Sofia Coppola is a master stroke, this movie is full of grace and enigmas like his creatures. We can catch sight of the beginning of Sofia's Fluo universe which is also full of humanity. At the end of her masterpiece, I was saying to my self "" I'll give anything to be one of these boys just to touch them, to have this romantic memory"". Since 2003, I've saw it 2 times and i can't get enough. I'm carried away with delight and pain, I wan't it to never ending like Sean Penn's Into the Wild, another great book's adaptation. It's my favorite movie, and i'm a little bit ashamed of that.However, I can truly understand that some people find it boring, creepy as a ""cliché"" film.

The profound sadness that is portrayed serves to enlighten the general public how even in well off middle class suburban kids can feel depression. It's so beautiful and relatable. I felt the the boys across the street in the movie just looking at the girl you love. Coppola captures young love, heartbreak, depression, affluence, apathy, and leads to suicide. It's one of the most heartfelt films I have ever seen and it remains one of my favorites. Dunst is remarkably empathetic and relatable and Coppola's lens loves her.

The ridiculousness of some of the characters as well as the dialogue kept me laughing throughout the entire movie.  The soundtrack is excellent as well. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should be cautioned not to take the plot seriously; this is not a sad dramatic movie that some have mistaken it to be.  Sofia Coppola, as well as the author of the book, purposely meant this otherwise tragic type of story to be transformed into truly ridiculous situations and occurrences; don't get hung up on the whole suicide thing because that's not the point of the movie.

360,kiks-1,wow. Goes deeper than the first glimpse let you think...,9,9 January 2002,"Virgin Suicides by Sofia Coppola.Can´t understand why it took me so long to find this movie...
""We felt the imprisonment of being a girl. The way it made your mind active and dreamy, and how you ended up knowing what colours went together. We knew that the girls were really women in disguise; that they understood love and even death, and that our job was merely to create the noise that seemed to fascinate them. We knew that they knew everything about us, and that we couldn't fathom them at all.""Wow. This was said by the narrator in the movie, a guy who in his youth was one of the boys admiring the Lisbon girls. I think this was not only a fairytale-like movie about a tragic, though fictional, event in the 70's, no, this was also a statement... or three:1. effects of bad parenting and the people around these children failing to take proper actions, though clear indications was shown that help was needed. A sad flaw in our society...2. the difficulties of being a teenager (A doctor said this to Cecilia after her suicide attempt: ""What are you doing here honey? You're not even old enough to know how bad life gets"". reply: ""Obviously Doctor, you have never been a thirteen year old girl"".)3. though an exaggeration of it (perhaps necessary to catch it in the movie), it says alot about how girls, and women, are perceived by men in our society. Boys/men don´t really understand girls/women. Our society is at large built on the way men perceive the world. It's the standard and ""correct"" way, though sometimes not the best way...hint hint...to understand and act in our world. Some women therefore yield, and fall into or pretend to fall into their given roll and become menadapted and menpleasing beings (note: like the reporter checking her boobs before ringing the doorbell!). It's getting better though. More and more women today keep and develop their independant thinking, breaking their given roll. The prewritten roles that women, and men, have are stereotype and are holding us all back. I think we are different from eachother. Men and women. Certainly biologically but perhaps even psychologically, and even though we sometimes don't really understand the other gender, we sure need and continue to amaze eachother!!
Now back to the movie. The five boys awareness of the biological difference between boys and girls is just waking up, and they are totally obsessed with the girls sexual appeal and the almost magical/mysterious aura around them. This happens all the time in real life too. Also the opposite. Although magical/mysterious is sometimes the wrong way to describe how girls sees boys. Exciting and fascinating are probably better words.This is a lovely movie. Though tragic. I could write a lot more about Sofia Coppolas first movie (the acting, cinematography, character description, the great soundtrack and so on), but I think I'll just stick to what I have already written.See it and make up your own mind about it!9/10",The Virgin Suicides

The atmosphere in this movie is so different than in any other movie I've ever saw. I really respect the work that Sofia Coppola has done by making this movie. One of the best movies ever made! Kirsten Dunst's and Josh Hartnett's characters make such a lovely couple in the movie that you just have to keep on watching the movie because they look so great together! Trip Fontaine is definitely one of the finest(and hottest) male-characters in history!

365,ricker0904,The Virgin Suicides MOVIE Review.,8,1 June 2010,"Since there are so many reviews about this film, most of them mixed saying this movie was an exhilarating and tauntingly lustful watch, to others saying the film completely flopped, was superficial and lacked any real meaning what so ever. I also found a common theme among bad reviews, most of them comparing this movie to the novel it derived from saying it didn't transcend the emotion and detail that the novel had brought them. Comparing a movie to a novel to which it is based is completely irrelevant on so many levels, one because nothing is as pure and complex as the human imagination that brings a story to life off the pages, turning words into action as if it were a repressed memory we had long forgotten until someone reminded us and wrote it all out on paper. Also, the novel ""The Virgin Suicides"" received great reviews, some calling it an instant classic among American contemporary work, which was the foundation upon which inspired Coppola to write and direct this movie. That said, I want to let people know what I personally thought about this movie, not comparing it to the book (which I haven't read) which, like I said, is really apples and oranges, it's just not fair to compare the two. So, from a movie-goers perspective and regular film enthusiast, this is what I thought of the film. I first saw this movie late one night on cable television back in the early 2000's. I remembered thinking at the time that it looked like an 'indie' film by the way it was shot, the script and all, but with headline actors playing the major roles. I was younger then and didn't fully appreciate the certain aspects of what made this movie so captivating to me the first time I saw it, entranced by the beautiful shot work of the film that gave it such a mystical dreamlike feel. It seems like every scene took place at the summertime dusk, bringing to life these emotions in myself that were triggered visually, along with an amazing soundtrack that assisted my eyes, keeping me glued to my television. As a teenager at the time, I was truly entranced by this film as it opened my eyes to a world I had never seen before. (Off topic) I was recently doing research on what movies I wanted to add to my collection when I stumbled upon ""The Virgin Suicides,"" and upon seeing the cast and plot I immediately knew I had seen this movie before. Easily 8-10 years have gone by and I remembered this film and the impression it made on me. I picked up the movie at a local used DVD store a couple of days ago and watched it again, the second time, years later, now as an adult in true appreciation. I can't explain in words how well this movie flows, music hitting right in stride, relating with the characters and as I'm watching, remembering why I feel in love with this movie the first time. Giovanni Ribisi narrates throughout the film as the story unfolds, his voice so eerily familiar and smooth. James Woods gives an excellent performance as does Kirsten Dunst, who's more likely to be remembered playing the role of a bubbly cheerleader in the teen movie ""Bring It On,"" is so easily and rightfully forgotten as she brings to life a character that is nothing less than spellbinding. Josh Hartnett, in probably one of his first roles, embodies the essence of what it is to be cool and the staggering infatuation his character develops in the film. I would advise viewers to be wary when watching this film not to confuse what seems to be a lack of an established meaning with a lack-luster film, which is certainly not the case. I feel that other reviews have trashed and tarnished this movie in whole because they didn't understand or get any point to the movie, or, they just couldn't grasp any major theme. To me, that's exactly the point! In relation to the characters of this movie (specifically the attention of the young boys' lustful obsession), not being able to put together the pieces (what,when,why,where and how) sometimes gives an illusion of poor film making but, in reality, is exactly (in my opinion) what Sofia Coppola intended. Being able to immerse yourself in the emotional value and confusion of the characters in this movie is what makes it so good. I won't call this movie great, because it does have it's flaws in such ways that it changes pace about 2/3 of the way through with such haste that it leaves me feeling unfulfilled and that it needed more substance where it probably could have made for a truly great film. This movie will pull you in the direction of romanticism and obsession, back to another of a heartfelt sickness that begs to be tended to that never seems to come to fruition. Probably not every movie-goers dream, but I feel like this movie was a significant accomplishment by small time director with a big time (last) name. I'll stick this movie in my collection of over 150 movies that I have meticulously hand picked and will remember what a gem of a movie that I have resting on my shelf that will later beckon me back for another go 'round.",The Virgin Suicides

With two sisters down, and one just about to do the deed, I hit the eject button. Like Dan Grant (review here) I was angry for having wasted time, money and brain cells on this most undeserving of films. There is no point in elaborating further, as Dan's most accurate review has covered all of the salient points. However, I will say this is one of the best modern day examples of the Emperor's New Clothes that I have encountered.Its been two weeks since I watched (half of) this film.

370,cdhay,Almost Pure Beauty & Tragedy,10,3 February 2005,"Until the maelstrom around Sofia Coppola's 2003 smash ""Lost in Translation"", this early work had gone largely unnoticed; a great shame, as in many ways this is the finer work. From the film's opening moments to the closing montage and voice-over, it works as a stunning portrayal of the power of beauty and tragedy to transform people's lives.From the title and the opening credits, the viewer knows what is going to happen in the film, and what the plot is going to be, but the pleasure here lies in the steady unfolding of events. The family of beautiful girls, that no-one can believe is the offspring of the high school Math teacher (James Woods) and his conservative wife (Kathleen Turner) waft through the film like beauty personified, and so they serve the dual purpose of the representation of both of the important concepts of the film. The focus of them is Lux (Kirsten Dunst) and her transfixing beauty, as experienced by the neighbourhood boys who had just enough contact with her to make them long for more. Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett) is the only one who can get close enough to her, but their relationship can never be the same as the boys who long for the ""pieces to put (the girls) back together"".The performances are simply stunning; Woods and Turner have been criticised for overshadowing the child actors in the film but to me the power and raw emotion that they bring to these most tragic of roles is stunning. Dunst has never been finer, and she has proved herself to be an actress to watch in more recent times, and even Hartnett who has mellowed and become a much more wooden actor is powerful as the boy who ran away. Giovanni Ribisi achieves perfect balance as the narrator. So the combination of these powerhouse performances with the sheer beauty of Ed Lachman's cinematography make for an impressive film.And that is before you even consider the input of director Coppola - her trademark shot of the sunlight through leaves and other tracking shots of the neighbourhood; shots of the football pitch at night; and the stunning set-piece of the disco and balloons for the homecoming ball are all powerful images that strike at the heart of the nature of beauty in the world. For me, this film deals with the essential concepts of life, death, regeneration and everything that makes human life so special, and so fragile with its breathtaking combination of cinematography, direction, voice-over, soundtrack and acting it becomes one of the few great films ever made, and should be compulsory viewing for all young adults.10/10.",The Virgin Suicides

You don't have to like deep movies for this one because this movie is so touching!! Thanks for listening!,The Virgin Suicides
374,lanadelgay,Rad,10,31 May 2014,"There is no denying that this film romanticizes suicide as a response to escaping a strict parental grasp, but the way this is executed is perfect.Its brilliant and very thoughtfully created, i would recommenced it without a doubt. The way that it is filmed is perfect and the chosen actresses, they don't even need to be as attractive as portrayed because the importance of the boy attraction is what is important not our own attraction. If you like odd films this one is something i would recommend, it is sad but not emotionally challenging to watch which means it is suitable for most viewers, of course the underlining plot line is adolescent suicide this should be taken into context of course. However it is done brilliantly and is a must watch!",The Virgin Suicides
375,jdrolet,A brilliant movie,10,30 January 2005,"At first, I didn't know what to expect from this Sophia Coppola's movie. I was totally and positively surprised. This movie is a series of raised conflicts. You can't figure out what is the real problem. All the conflicts are raised. It is one of the saddest movies because it is about the real life. The movie does not solve any problems, they are all abstract, philosophical. This movie is brilliant because we, as viewers are able to feel the emotion even if there is no way to photograph it as problems in the heads of the characters. This is a pure example of modernism cinema or art film. The content is totally intellectual, it deals with something complicated, it's an open form. This movie is amazing!!!",The Virgin Suicides
376,rowbox,"The Virgin Suicides brings different joys to different viewers, despite a lack of character development.",6,15 February 2005,"A person with much respect for Sofia Coppola after her untouchably perfect job on Lost in Translation would understandably have high hopes as he starts to watch The Virgin Suicides, Coppola's debut film as a director. With the startling opening scene of a 13 year-old girl in a bathtub full of bloody water, the viewer's excitement builds. It continues to rise with the nostalgic '70's setting, the voice of an adolescent boy as the intimate narrator, and the array of interesting characters (think oppressive parents, girls at the prime of their youthful beauty, and a gang of neighborhood boys on bikes).Unfortunately, The Virgin Suicies did not take full advantage of all this potential. It had all the makings of a memorable movie, and yet did not do much more than to wallow in its depressing glory. Perhaps there were just too many characters to develop fully, and so the writers settled for an idealistic aura of tragedy and beauty to surround the Lisbon girls. As the movie was narrated by one of the neighborhood boys who set out on an obsessive mission to understand the five sisters (four after Cecilia, the youngest, commits suicide within the first 30 minutes), this look from afar at the motives (or lack thereof) and conflicts of the girls is fitting to some degree. However, the sudden impact of the ending, with all remaining four girls committing suicide simultaneously, does leave one with the feeling that the writers were at a loss for a good way to finish off the story and decided to take the easy way out by killing the main characters (and thus fulfilling the movie's namesake). The fact that the suicides were presented in a montage did not help the viewer understand why he was seeing what he was seeing. One thing is for certain: there were enough shots that screamed ""IRONY!"" of heartless, dolled-up suburban neighbors talking about the suicides at the Lisbon house while wearing tragic looks of utter pity on their faces to nearly silence the viewer's need for substantial character development but not quite. The Virgin Suicides did have its notable parts that made the movie worthwhile. The cinematography was exceptional, especially when the boys pore over Cecilia's diary and relive the entries in their imaginations. The smooth transitions between the reading of the diary and the sunny, home video-like memory are superb. Kirsten Dunst as Lux Lisbon makes the audience forget that she is acting. Her downward spiral throughout the movie seems genuine, and she truly assumes her character. The music that guides the movie along is seamless and original. The Virgin Suicides transforms the bluesy song ""Playground Love"" by Air into an ominous harbinger of bad news, never failing to accompany a dark scene. A cameo by Danny DeVito as a homely psychiatrist is a pleasant surprise. The Virgin Suicides brings different satisfaction to different viewers. It is not lacking in poignantly haunting scenes and certainly has much that the audience will be able to relate to. The movie has a timeless quality to it, similar to digging up an old record and finding that it still plays perfectly. At times, the timelessness gets to be a bit much for one looking for honest dialogues that explain characters' histories or motives. The movie jumps into the culmination of a fate that has long been coming, and the viewer is supposed to assume that the parents' oppressive nature is the underlying problem at hand. For the unsatisfied viewer looking to watch the movie a second time in an attempt to better understand the Lisbon girls, the prospect of hearing ""Playground Love"" yet again may prove a considerable adversary.",The Virgin Suicides
377,Larim,very disturbing,6,25 February 2005,"I found this movie to be quite disturbing. Although it was excellently acted and directed, it left me with the irritating feeling that something I had eaten was trying to climb back up my throat.I'm completely shocked by what transpired in the movie. From the thoughtlessness of Josh's character, to the simple act of parenting gone wrong. After all, had they been my children, I probably would have acted about the same way.The very worst moment in the entire film had to be the ending. Not the very end, where things were put to a rest after the suicides commenced, but during the suicides themselves. I watched in admiration as the girls called out to the boys for help through their imprisonment. I watched the boys do what any boy would do, and that is go over there to help them. I watched Kristen's character talk with them, lead them on. Then I watched in complete horror and disgust as the boys were left hanging as the girls killed themselves.Suicide is one thing, but to take the feelings of another, and throw them away after all they had done for them, that is just wrong. I still can't fathom the reasoning behind calling them over there and then committing suicide. The question ""why"" isn't enough when watching this movie. There has to be a better word out there, and if not, we need to create one.Other than my personal problems with the story, this was an excellent movie, but of course, I pretty much like any movie with Ms. Dunst in it. It's one thing to be beautiful, but quite another to take on so many different personalities in different situations. She always seems to make me believe that she is who she is playing, no matter what the movie is.",The Virgin Suicides

As always Kathleen Turner gives a masterful performance. Melancholy pervades throughout. This is not a feel-good film, but one that sticks with you afterwards,giving you much to think about. I know I will remember this one for a long time. The characters seem so real. I can't compare it to anything I've ever seen recently. For its plot and its stunning cinematography, the convincing performances given by all, I think it is a gem of a movie. It makes me want to read the book on which it is based. If you can't imagine this happening, believe me, I grew up in a house like this. Maybe that's why it had such an effect on me, but nonetheless, I believe anyone will find it a compelling film. The period costumes and songs are well-done but the theme is timeless.",The Virgin Suicides

I know there might be flaws, maybe in the technical aspects, maybe in the story, I know all that... but this is the best movie I've seen so far. I saw it for the first time when I was at the local Blockbuster and the title caught my eye. The story reminds me of a time when boys secretly adored girls. When it was normal to ""collect"" information about them, to watch them from afar. Innocence. There's tragedy in all this, but this movie has a magic that just makes me love it. The choice of actors is good, the story is captivating and the soundtrack is wonderful. I've lost count to how many times I saw it and it's always like if it's the first time.",The Virgin Suicides

Kirsten Dunst was amazing as Lux and I thought that she really got into character. She portrayed the girl who is willing to do anything just to get out of the house while her sisters souls just rotted away. I wish that the parents weren't so strict on the girls after one of the 5 committed suicide. It surprised me how much the movie was like the book and that only the ending was slightly different. I found it quite depressing to see the ending and that I thought about the movie constantly for the next week after I saw it. It kind of haunted me, it was all I could think about and it gave me some scary thoughts.",The Virgin Suicides

I like stories where in the end it's not really clear. So it stays a mystery. And it's very good to know that by this kind of movies there will be no second movie or anything. It's beautiful when it stays a mystery. I thought that to with Final Destination until there was made a second movie. It's a shame. I think Sofie Coppola did an excellent job with this movie. There's only one thing I really would like to know. Has the story been based on true facts or is it just fiction? I really would like to know that.,The Virgin Suicides

I wasn't sure what to expect, from anything in the film.It was amazing. It was less than inches away when it came to being close to the book. Sure, it left out a few select things, but the time cuts and flow of the film was terrific.The actors were terrific, as well. Josh Hartnett was the perfect Trip Fontaine, Kirsten Dunst captured every aspect of Lux, and Giovanni Ribisi had the ideal voice for the narrator. That's just to name a few. As for filming techniques, it was flawless.I give this film a 9 out of 10, and recommend it to anyone who has a fancy for dark humor and serious themes.",The Virgin Suicides
383,gracek-2,am I the only one who has noticed this?,5,29 May 2005,"Perhaps I am the only one on this site who has noticed, or perhaps I am the only one who reads. The classic play ""La Casa de Bernarda Alba"" by Federico Garcia Lorca, which was written long before the novel, is almost the same. I feel that Mr. Lorca should receive some posthumous credit for outlining the plot for this movie. Although originally in Spanish, this daunting story of female oppression has already been produced for the stage, and not the camera. It is an outrage that no one has bothered to credit Mr. Lorca for the original idea for ""The Virgin Suicides."" I am appalled that Mr. Euginides' novel has been received by the public as an original work.",The Virgin Suicides
384,wonderae,Pretentious Nonsense.,3,25 October 2008,"Seriously, it's not that great. The reasoning behind the storyline is never explained, but rather poorly implied through pseudo-intellectual photography and random narration. There are no heroes (just self-centered/absorbed sisters and stalker boys), no villains (just clichéd, stereotypical 1970s parents), and no point to speak of in this film, and it is basically pretentious bullshit. ""Look how deep and insightful I am"". Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're a Coppola, we get it. Now could you please make a film that isn't completely overrated and doesn't suck? Thanks, Sofia. In all truth, the movie just doesn't make any sense. Some girls commit suicide because they are completely ridiculous, and they drag the neighborhood boys into their scheme for some final attention. That's the entire movie. They weren't facing insurmountable odds, the world wasn't completely unfair - their parents kinda sucked, big whoop. The only character of real substance is the youngest sister, Cecelia, who might actually be facing some real issues of neglect from her family, being the youngest of 5 and all. Her sisters are completely infatuated with themselves and seem uninterested in her or anything about her. Furthermore, they do not show any remorse following her death or concern after her first attempt at suicide - like she was never really there. I can rationally comprehend Cecelia's suicide and feel sadness for it... as for the other four, good riddance.",The Virgin Suicides
385,octarian,A film definitely worth watching !,9,13 August 2005,"I was glued to the screen (which doesn't happen often). Kathleen Turner was a good enough reason to start watching the film in the first place, as well as James Woods. Kirsten Dunst is also superb here. Such a natural. I was pleasantly surprised to see a slightly different film for a change. Not OBVIOUS. There are so may films that you will see that you can practically guess half of the script. The photography of the girls was exquisite. May I just add that I cried my eyes out at the end. Totally unexpectedly too. And I've seen hundreds of movies. I myself am a mother of daughters, although they're not teenagers yet, I WAS one once, so I could relate oh so well to this movie. Beautifully done. Well done Miss Coppola !!!",The Virgin Suicides
386,lossomo,"It seems to be good, however, it's not",3,28 March 2006,"To start with, I was totally shocked in the end, because I couldn't imagine it will be so bad. Some people like this movie, and I think they like it because they haven't seen ""Dead Poets Society"". These movies are same thematic: strict parents, no freedom, no independence. The film begins with suicide of one of the 5 sisters. She was only 13. We should wonder why has she done it. Then it's shown what a strict mother those sisters have, what a week father they have. Finally, all alive-left sisters kill their selves after having no permission to left the house. There's not shown any depression, any bad mood or sadness. They're just lying on the bed, reading magazines, dreaming, being together, having telephone talks with boys next door. It's not shown they are stressed or can't stand anymore etc. In the end, they just kill their selves and the main idea of the film is that parents hadn't understand the reason of suicide and neighbors don't care about what had happened. Same thematic is the movie mentioned in the beginning. ""Dead Poets Society"" is about teenage boys, studying in a private school. One of them kills himself in the end, 'cause parents don't let him to do what he wants. It's a great movie about this problem with parents and to compare with ""Virgin Suicides"", the last one is very poor-movie. It seems like Coppola wanted to make 'strange' movie, which would pay teenagers' attention. There are also starring today's young stars: Josh Hartnett and Kirsten Dunst - Plot and stars are guarantee of the fortune. It's normal when teenagers think of suicide and they are interested of this movie because of stars and the suicide. In Another way this movie is zero. I recommend you to watch this movie after/before watching ""Dead Poets Society"" to compare with.",The Virgin Suicides

390,feralkkitty-12043,More questions than answers,7,25 September 2017,"The first time I watched this movie a couple of years ago, I wasn't too impressed with it. I've seen it several more times since and it's not a bad movie; its more than watchable, but left more questions than answers in the end.I'll leave the cinematography reviews to others who know more about that subject.**** SPOILER ALERT **** In the end, my feelings at the end of this movie were mixed. Now I love a movie with an ending that leaves the viewer to ponder the whats and whys of a character or their actions.However, this movie isn't a suspense so these questions, I feel, are pretty crucial to the plot.The first and biggest questions to me is: WHY oh why do the girls signal for the boys across the street to come over, say they are going for a car ride and end up all killing themselves either before or while the boys are waiting for them to get ready. What is the point in that??? It's not like the boys found their bodies and alerted anyone. They ran away.Another question is the fact that Lux is having sex with multiple men and boys on the roof of her house. Why the roof? Wouldn't her parents hear something on the roof and possibly inspect what it could be? Why not in the guy's car down the street or in the basement or, well, anywhere but the roof?I realize this is taken from the novel (that I haven't read), but surely I can't be the only one with these questions. There are others but I'll leave it at that.",The Virgin Suicides
391,nextmullen,Why did they do it?,8,3 January 2007,"****!!!CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!**** The girls don't commit suicide over their parents. They commit it because of love and life.This movie is adapted from a novel and contains all the elements of a great novel such as foreshadowing and metaphors. There is more to it than what is said and done.In Cecilias diary she mentions...""The trees like lungs filling the air. My sister the mean one pulling my hair"" The trees were all tainted on the block. The musty smell, the asphyxiation and the tainted air. This was a metaphor for the girls themselves.The suicides were committed over love and how love is depicted by the opposite sex. The boys couldn't figure out why they did it because they were the catalyst to provoke the girls to do what they did. They thought the girls were getting better when they were only making it worse.Being ""quarantined"" by their parents only helped them see how tragic life really is.Cecilia realized this right away and further more with Joe, the boy with down syndrome and the charitable efforts of everyone around them sacrificing their own humility to make this boy happy. My thoughts are that she sees the definitive hard ships that life offers first hand and chooses the only other option to get away from it.However, as someone commented before, i don't think it was ""glorified"". They don't show her slit her wrists, they don't show her take the leap, no expression of fear, anxiety, depression or remorse. Sophia just depicts a solemn expression and a child's lifeless body enough to express the horrifying image as it is.The rest of the girls follow suit in the same manner.And a point to express interest in , is the final shot of the boys standing on the street staring at the house.IMO this shot contains a lot of information about the movie.They are standing on that front section of the lawn between the road and the sidewalk. Amongst the rows of the trees. The camera pans along the road displaying several cut down stumps as well as the trees that are still standing.The boys are left standing as well and metaphorically speaking... the girls have been cut-down.It seems the internal struggles are synchronous with the lives of the trees throughout the entire movie. Sophia symbolizes life as a blight, and the only way to end a blight is to cut it down. A brilliant directorial debut.",The Virgin Suicides

393,riksmit86,"Intertextuality, allusion and narratological context within film adaptation of",8,5 May 2006,"The Virgin Suicides is a fine example of a modern work wherein allusion and intertextuality play an important role. Written in the early nineties and set in the range of the late sixties to the early seventies, the novel constantly refers to pop culture, art, and even Classical texts. Through the use of excerpts and song lyrics Coppola places the narrative in its time and place and gives us the chance to peek into the emotional world of the featured main characters; namely, the young Lisbon girls who are lusted after by the boys their age.The Virgin Suicides as a title derives from a title song from the fictive rock group Cruel Crux, making the concept of combining fiction and reality both original and creative. (Virgin Prunes, The Sisters of Mercy, The Cruxshadows, are but an example of similar names of bands popular in the early nineties.) We see this combination further worked out with the 'Virgin Mary Calling Cards' in the film. This shows the new mentality and view on religion developing in the time setting of the film.Not only do we see a clash with the religious ways of thinking considering the older generation versus the younger. The rusty beliefs, ethics, morals and mores of the parental establishment (Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon) of the late sixties and early seventies represented in the narrative oppress those of the youth (the Lisbon girls and the boys).Juxtaposed to the easy-to-swallow readings and church music for the parents of that time are the heavily political, philosophical and spiritual influenced lyrics of the songs the Lisbon girls are attracted by. In the musical conversation between the neighborhood boys and the Girls, this idea takes a prominent place. Alone Again, You've Got a Friend, Where Do the Children play, Dear Prudence, Candle in the Wind, Wild Horses, At Seventeen, Time in a Bottle, So Far Away, Bridge over Troubled Water, do not only possess a certain melancholy in their lyrics and melody, especially the songs the girls play; also, they present an attempt to touching feelings and emotions instead of triggering dogmatic religious response and emphasizing apathetic daily grind. The musical preferences of the girls implicate their need to escape from the surrounding bars of their strict upbringing. Escapism is a term that states this attempt and functions as a Leit Motif throughout the narrative.The recurring concept of escapism continues within the film adaptation of the novel. In a critique, A.O. Scott states: ""Edward Lachman, the director of photography, shoots the bright colors of the 1970's as if through a layer of gauze. His dimmed, fuzzy tones suggest the darkening shades of memory."" Also, by constantly shifting from shots from below to shots from above and from sinister establishing shots to creeping close-ups, Coppola evokes a feeling of misplacement and captivity; the Girls need to get out.Movies that came out in the same period in which The Virgin Suicides takes place present a similar need to escape reality. In the midst of the Vietnam Conflict and the U.S. domestic racial war, films like: 2001: A Space Odyssey (d. Kubrick, '68), Planet of the Apes (d. Schaffner, '68, and The Exorcist (d. Blattey '73) appear on the white screen, taking the audience to another world. The storyline of The Virgin Suicides, however, does not reflect the national and international turmoil of that period, but shows the domestic problems of an average suburban American nuclear family. This implicates that there is unrest everywhere in this turbulent time.Also the urge to protest and stand up for own ideals and values (common in the late sixties early seventies) is featured within the narrative. The girls literally embrace nature in order to save it. In 1970 the first Earth Day came to exist; the Environmental Protection Agency was created; and Nixon signs the Clean Air Act. These events all connote to the novel and its adaptation.The Virgin Suicides places the characters and settings in their time and place. Also, the narrative itself and all its connotations, allusions and intertextuality gives the reader a clear few of what is going on in the world, domestic as well as (inter)national, artistic and realistic. In this particular narrative a family with all its struggles, trials and tribulations, symbolizes a greater significance. On the battlefield are parents versus children instead of U.S. versus Vietnam. It's a micro war in which more than seventy percent of the population dies and in the end the battle is still undecided. We are left with one question: Who won Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon, or the Girls? As Roger Ebert quoted and adjusted Tolstoy's statement in a review of the film adaptation of The Virgin Suicides: ""All happy families are the sameYes, but he should have added, there are hardly any happy families.""",The Virgin Suicides
394,rikrissewijck,beautiful movie,10,5 March 2006,"Loved this movie. Also great about it is that it shows so much flaws in American society. example: the neighbors thinking about how long these girls are going to be trapped in their house by the parents but not doing anything about it, like calling an institute for child abuse or talking with the parents about it. example: the Christian strictness of the parents resulting in the suicides. (you can say that it is the Christian strictness of America that has made it the most violent country in the world, prayer in schools (brainwashing, because it rules out a lot of thinking kids should be doing about the world and society), having the flag of your country in the classrooms (nationalistic, it breeds respect for a country just for being that country while a country should gain respect by the way it handles it's internal and external problems and therefore what it stands for), the Christian\republican lobby that still holds a lot of power in a so-called democratic and progressive country (it's just like Europe in the middle-ages, church and state are not separated fully which leads to bad legislation and illegal differencing people for what they think) etc. i really think that is what drives people to their limits because who can cope to live with these things from even childhood and on, some will but most won't and they will rebel and resort to violence and\or crime or just simply go crazy because there's no normal way like talking to people to get rid of these things as there's always a powerful minority that will stop ""non-christian"" propositions like abortion and legal prostitution for example. Even though a rational thinking person can see these things are a solution for at least some of the major issues surrounding these situations\problems).",The Virgin Suicides
