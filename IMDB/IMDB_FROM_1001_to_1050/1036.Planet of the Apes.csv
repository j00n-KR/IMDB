0,TheLittleSongbird,"O Tim Burton, where art thou?",3,2 May 2010,"I really like Tim Burton- Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, Ed Wood, Batman, Beetle Juice and Sleepy Hollow are all great movies. The thing is this remake(or re-imagining if you like) is not, in fact this could very well be Burton's worst movie, even worse than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and that could have been much better. Tim Burton, what has happened to you? Before I get to the many negatives of this film, I will say the apes are very well done. Their mannerisms and the way they move are perfectly convincing. Plus Danny Elfman's score was pretty good, it's no Edward Scissorhands or Big Fish but it's good enough. And the scenery and special effects are fantastic.However, that is all the praise I can give it. I am briefly going to say it is vastly inferior to the 1968 classic, which was much more exciting and much better written as well. The script is awful, not quite Pearl Harbor kind-of-awful, but some of it is lame and unintentionally cheesy. The story takes a while to get going and meanders all over the place, not helped by pedestrian pacing and drawn out scenes and very rarely gets interesting. Plus is it me, or does the film get unnecessarily loud at times? Tim Burton's direction was also a disappointment, usually his films are full of heart, that's what made Edward Scissorhands especially such a gem, but here he seems lost, bogged down might I say. On top of that, the character development is non-existent, as is the chemistry between the actors and the characters are extremely clichéd, especially Kris Kristofferson's character. And the acting didn't fare that much better, Mark Wahlberg is a bland lead, while Estella Warren acts like a zombie throughout. Then we have Tim Roth trying hard and giving the only credible performance as Thade, and Helena Bonham Carter wasted as sympathetic Ari, while Paul Giamatti is useless. Not even the talented David Warner can save this film. And don't get me started on the ending, what a bummer, so predictable and obvious.Overall, a case of all style no substance. Definitely not Burton's finest hour. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Planet of the Apes
1,Leofwine_draca,"Burton's worst, by a long shot",1,13 July 2013,"You know, I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with Tim Burton. I like where he's coming from, and he shares much of the same taste as me: a liking for the offbeat, the Gothic, a love for the Hammer horrors of old. But his films are a mixed bag and for every great one (MARS ATTACKS, ED WOOD) there are ones that leave me ice cold (CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, ALICE IN WONDERLAND).My favourite Burton film is SWEENEY TODD, so it may be that I get on better with the ones aimed at adults rather than kids. Sadly, his PLANET OF THE APES remake is aimed purely at kids, and in fact there's no material that ever goes above the intellectual level of your average 4 year old. And if ever there was a film that didn't need remaking, it was PLANET OF THE APES! Everything goes wrong with this picture, and I mean everything. The muddled, dumb-ass script which never goes beyond characters running from A to B, then B to C, and so on for what feels like hours and hours. The ridiculous-looking apes, never menacing for a second and looking more dated now than the ones from the original back in the '60s. Burton's clear disinterest in the material, as evinced by his mundane direction. Wahlberg's embarrassingly wooden performance, or Bonham Carter's embarrassingly mannered one.It's all a great shame, in that it wastes money and the talents of lots of interesting supporting cast members whose skills could have been put towards something more genuine and original. Instead this is one of the worst films I've witnessed in a while, a truly abominable production.",Planet of the Apes
2,SnoopyStyle,Great ape style but ending makes no sense,6,27 August 2015,"In 2029, USAF astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) is training chimps to fly spacecrafts on a space station. They encounter an anomaly and send a chimp. The chimp's pod disappears. Davidson disobeys orders and flies off after him. Both pods are taken by the anomaly. Davidson lands in a strange land where a human tribe is hunted by intelligent apes. He is captured along with Daena (Estella Warren) and Karubi (Kris Kristofferson). General Thade (Tim Roth) is gorilla military leader. Limbo (Paul Giamatti) is the human trader. Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) is a pro-human chimp.It's got great ape style. The human in this version can still speak English. The story doesn't have the simple symmetry of the original. It is an inferior movie. There are interesting additions like Thade opening up Davidson's mouth to ask if there is a soul in there. It's got some B-movie goodness until the nonsense of the final ending.",Planet of the Apes
3,Hitchcoc,I'm Up a Tree,5,5 October 2001,"The technology, the make up, the scenery, just marvelous. A good cast, although the male lead was about as dull as dry toast sitting in a toaster for a day and a half (I hope the apes do whatever they want to him in the sequel). It isn't even the obtuse ending that bothered me. It's that there was something so lacking. With the gifts of computer animations and the advancements in the craft of movie-making, why couldn't one care less what happens to these characters. I don't like Charlton Heston, but when he told off those apes in the first movie, I cheered him. As with the original, why are the humans so docile and disorganized. They have evolved to the upright state, fully clothed, communicative--but they aren't more than silly critters to the apes. How would you feel if your dog started making sweaters, got married, and lived in a cave? Would you be interested in whether he had become a sentient creature, capable of more advance thinking.Another question is why those apes were able to bounce in the air so much. I've never seen a monkey bounce; I've seen them swing, not bounce. The bad guy (excuse me, bad simian) can come flying like an oversexed kangaroo at any point. I have to admit, I liked the battlefield scenes. They reminded me of a kickoff at an NFL football game. Apparently they planned to take over the planet by running into each other.I really did like the physical appearance of the apes--there was great expression. I got a kick out of the humans being sold as pets in stores. As usual, of course, the gorillas are the dumb ones (It's because they are big--right--big people are supposed to be dumb). Oh, wait! They may have been the script writers and got exactly what they had coming to them!Once again, a disappointing summer--two blockbusters in the science fiction field, this thing and Jurassic Park III. Maybe I need to take up golf!",Planet of the Apes
4,classicsoncall,"""Never send a monkey to do a man's job.""",8,17 January 2016,"I tried watching this film probably about five years ago and gave up the effort about half way through. Figuring I might have been having a bad day I decided to give it a try again. I'm glad I did because there was actually some thought provoking stuff here just as you had in the original film, with ideas explored concerning racial/species intolerance, animal rights, and the concept of equality in general. Some of it was presented in clichéd dialog, which I agree can be a turn off, but if you listen attentively, a lot of it is applicable to the present day. One of the most insightful was the observation that ""The human problem cannot be solved by simply throwing money at it"".There's an idea that occurred to me while watching the picture I haven't seen expressed anywhere else and it has to do with the names of the principal characters. The anagram of each name has a connotation that intrinsically describes the nature of that character. For example, take General Thade. An anagram of Thade would be Death, and he was certainly the personification of violent, deadly hatred toward humans. Others I came up with include: Semos = Moses, the mythical ape who was considered the savior of his race, having insured the place of apes above humans in a 'Promised Land' of sorts.Ari = Air, as in having an ethereal quality required to bridge an understanding between the apes and human inhabitants of the planet.Even the name of Mark Wahlberg's character has a Biblical reference if you will. Davidson = David's Son, or Son of David, a name often associated with Jesus Christ who was descended from the Family of David. I haven't read the Pierre Boulle novel on which the film was based, so I don't know if these were names he gave his characters, but if this word play regarding the characters is merely coincidental, the odds I think would be astronomical.Anyway, that's what I thought about while watching the picture. And what is good science fiction if not making you think about what you're watching and/or reading? Beyond that, there's no question the time/space implications of the story lend themselves to serious head scratching. Upon first seeing the ruins of the Oberon space station, the representation called to mind the spires on the crown of the Statue of Liberty which signaled an obvious swipe from the original movie. But then we got to the crux of the Calima business, and I thought that was done pretty cleverly.So all in all, I thought the film makers did a decent job here in re-imagining the original screenplay, while offering food for thought in any number of areas touched upon in the script. Probably more so than even the awkward ending with the Thade Memorial, my biggest question was why Captain Davidson left Pericles behind.",Planet of the Apes
5,lee_eisenberg,apelike,1,12 January 2006,"How in the name of everything holy could Tim Burton do this to us?! The director best known for ""Beetlejuice"", Batman"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", and ""Sleepy Hollow"", gives us something that looks like it should star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Everyone knows what happens, but the dialogue is just silly - mainly mocking the original. Mark Wahlberg, as hero Leo Davidson, does as good as he can, but he can't escape the fact that this movie (correction: this remake) should have never been made. The only remotely interesting scene is the end. All in all, Wahlberg suffers, as do Helena Bonham Carter, Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, and everyone else. Dreadful.",Planet of the Apes
6,jboothmillard,Planet of the Apes,6,15 September 2005,"I will admit I only saw this the once and thought it wasn't a great film, in fact, for a while I hated it, but seeing it again, I can see why critics give it three stars out of five, and that it actually is a pretty good film from director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street). If you have seen the original 1968 film, plus the sequels (""Beneath the..."", ""Escape from the..."", ""Conquest of the..."" and ""Battle for the..."") then you would know this is a new vision, and mix of all of them (well, besides Escape from, that takes place of Earth). Basically it is 2029, and in a space station, where monkeys are trained to carry out missions, one monkey is sent out, and disappears in the large space cloud, and without permission his friend Captain Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) speeds after him in a space pod, and doing so gets sucked into the wormhole, and crashes in the jungle of an unknown planet, similar to Earth (well, it is). Soon enough though he is captured along with many other humans by human acting and talking apes, and like Charlton Heston before, almost the first words spoken, by ape warrior Attar (The Green Mile's Michael Clarke Duncan) are ""Get you stinking hands (paws) off me, you damned dirty human (ape)"". Anyway, the planet is afraid of humans, and will only use them as slaves, and sympathetic chimpanzee activist Ari (Helena Bonham-Carter, Burton's fiancée) is pretty much the only ape who thinks humans should be treated equally. Eventually Leo manages to escape with some other humans, including Daena (Estella Warren) with the help of Ari, and they head to where Leo sees a signal on his still working locator. When they get there, the ships appears to have crashed, and there for thousands of years, well, you did the see the travel clock going up rapidly. Meanwhile, the army lead by the great vicious villain Thade (a very aggressive performance by Reservoir Dogs' Tim Roth) is preparing an army to fight the battle for the planet. In the end, thankfully Thade is trapped for lying about humans and apes originally getting on, Leo gets a new pod when his monkey friend lands, and he heads back to Earth, but when he lands in front of the Lincoln memorial, it has the face of Thade (!), just like the ending of the original with the Statue of Liberty buried on the beach. Also starring Paul Giamatti as Limbo, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Krull, David Warner as Sandar, Blade's Kris Kristofferson as Karubi, The Mummy's Erick Avari as Tival, Luke Eberl as Birn, Chris Ellis as Lt. General Karl Vasich, Lisa Marie (Burton's ex) as Nova, Deep Roy as Gorilla Kid/Thade's Niece, and a cameo by the star of the first original, Charlton Heston as Zaius, Thade's Father. The changes besides most of the story are that the humans are not dumb, there's no Dr. Zaius (Heston's character isn't him, he's a general), there's no Roddy McDowall or Kim Hunter, and of course the make-up is obviously more updated, a good remake. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Make Up/Hair. Good!",Planet of the Apes
7,ma-cortes,Tim Burton's rendition about known story of an astronaut crashes on a far planet and finds a simian civilization,5,30 July 2013,"Inferior remake from first and best of the primates series ; despite time passed the original energy remains and resulted to be an agreeable fantasy ; however this re-imagination of the tale looks more to the original novel by Pierre Boulle , titled ¨Monkey planet¨, that it does to 1968 Franklyn J. Schaffner rendition . It deals with an Air Force astronaut , Captain Leo Davison ( Mark Wahlberg) crashes lands on a mysterious planet where evolved, talking apes dominant a race of primitive humans . As he encounters a culture where the simians rule over humans . Later on , he discovers humanity has gone awry and now is slave and reduced to beasts . Man is treated as animal of burden and regarded as scum . He escapes , being accompanied by a gorgeous native (Estella Warren) and with the help of a sympathetic chimpanzee activist named Ari (Helna Boham Carter) and a small band of human rebels (Eric Avari , Kris Kristofferson) . Leo leads the effort to evade the advancing Simian Army led by brutal General Thade (Tim Roth) and his most brave commandant Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) . Now humans and simians are on to reach a dark secret within the Forbidden Zone .This is a retelling from classic and energetic science-fiction movie with metaphysical significance and reflexion about origin of human being, though also packs action, adventures , intrigue , satisfying brisk pace and entertainment . This known story provides full of sour and intelligent references to first adaptation but doesn't have its sense of political commentary , neither sociological implications . The picture delivers enough energy and results to be a passable flick full of action , battles and suspense ; however it is light-years ahead of original . Mark Wahlberg as an action man takes the Charlton Heston character but without his charisma , neither impressive screen presence . Tim Roth stands out as a furious militarist with loathing for all human beings . Helena Bonham Carter excels as a clever as well as sensitive simian . Remaining cast formed by enjoyable players playing as Gorilla , Chimpanzees , Orangutans and other apes are nice . Superb makeup courtesy of Rick Baker creates realistic pseudo-simians of Paul Giamatti , Michael Clarke Duncan , David Warner , Chris Ellis , Lisa Marie , Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, and even Charlton Heston who appears as an old primate , a feeling homage to classic flick in which gave one of his more plausible acting . One of the important attributes of this work, is the magnificent and colorful cinematography by Philippe Rousselot . Epic as well as emotive musical score by Danny Elffman , it's full of fury and sound .The motion picture was professionally directed by Tim Burton , using a great visual sense but with no originality . Other adaptations based on the characters created by Pierre Boulle are the followings : The original and the best is ¨Planet of Apes¨ by Franklyn J Schaffner with Charlton Heston , Roddy MacDowall, Kim Hunter , ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (1970) by Ted Post with James Franciscus , Linda Harrison , Maurice Evans ; it's followed by three inferior sequels that get worse and a TV series , such as 'Escape of planet of apes'(71, Don Taylor), 'Conquest of planet of apes'(72, J. Lee Thompson), 'Battle for the planet of apes' (73, J.Lee Thompson) . And recently , ¨Rise of the Planet of the Apes¨ (2011) by Rupert Wyatt with James Franco , John Lightow , Freida Pinto , Andy Serkis and preparing ¨Dawn of the Planet of Apes¨ (2013-2014) by Matt Reeves with Judy Greer , Gary Oldman , Keri Russell and Jason Clarke .",Planet of the Apes
8,dbdumonteil,Escape from the Boulle planet.,6,29 August 2001,"Visually,this film is sometimes a splendor;the light falls on a crepuscular world.The Apes' town is quite scary particularly when you see it from a distance ,as it stands out against an ominous sky.In the very beginning,the cast and credits are also successful,with an adequate martial music.The first third has some funny,parodic and sometimes politically incorrect lines.In the second third,the movie begins to lose steam,although the discovery in the wrecked spaceship is a rather good idea. But that's not all good news.First of all,the hero lacks charisma and the apes and their sensational make-up simply overwhelm him and drown him out.On the contrary,majestic Charlton Heston,even when he was in chains,displayed a Shakespearian grandeur in the first version.The last third consists in battles,a ""second coming"" and the ""astonishing"" ending without which..that would not be ""planet of the apes"".Actually,the new ending was borrowed from Pierre Boulle 's novel,but not without adding a mathematically unlikelihood which will give you headaches if you begin to think too hard:the least they can do:Everything ,even the proper nouns from the French writer's book have been removed,even if some characters recall some of the Boulle/Shaffner version.Shaffner had contented himself with changing the astronauts' name(eg:Ulysse Mérou=Taylor) Hats off to Helena Bonham-Carter who brings warmth and emotion in a rather vapid cast:in a part close to that of Kim Hunter/Zira,she really asserts her distinctive identity. Tim Roth is effective as well,but his part is less so.David Warner and Kris Kristofferson are wasted.As a tribute to Shaffner(?)both Linda Harrison (an unidentified woman captured with Leo) and Charlton Heston (moaning his curse,which is,admittedly,funny)appear unbilled.Tim Burton might be a director to remember.Although he has not made a genuine masterpiece yet,his filmography is already rich:""Sleepy hollow"",""Edward Scissorhands ,the marvelous ""Ed Wood"" (Martin Landau is unforgettable).But redoing ""planet of the apes "" was a hard task.Shaffner's movie followed a progression,it moved slowly,from the long introduction showing the three astronauts making their way across desolate landscapes to the stunning final shots with Heston and Harrison 's roaming down by the sea.Remember how long it took Taylor to convince Zira he was a thinking man!Here it seems natural to Ari almost as soon as she sees him,that Leo is no dumb idiot animal.And that's the last straw,even Tim Roth (some kind of cross between Shaffner's Cornelius and a pulp fiction baddie)pretty damn quickly believes too that that human is too clever for his own sake.Tim Burton's so-so remake epitomizes the dearth of good scripts.Pierre Boulle's book is a golden mine and one could have written a coherent story out of it,different from that of the first version.Why not,for instance,introduce the two ""astronauts"" whose scenes open and close it,and turn Leo's adventures into a flashback?What about showing the love between the hero and the woman-animal ?And the son they had?And the menace this son represented for the simian race? All these ideas were left over by Shaffner's script writers and could have built a strong new tale.The main flaw lies in the human beings:here,they speak -English!- ,they can reason,they can swim (!),they are (except for bubble head Warren)clever,so why the hell did the apes tame them?",Planet of the Apes
9,Quinoa1984,"Very, very low rent (and sloppy) version of the classic film",5,1 August 2001,"Tim Burton could've done better, but instead he chose to do this, a remake of a movie that didn't need to be remade (could the reason for the remake possibly be for, oh dare I say, MONEY?  Maybe Fox didn't have enough yet?). And while I guess if by some dumb luck Burton is the right choice for a re-telling, but that's not the point.  He has made many fine re-makes (Batman the topper, also Mars Attacks, and Sleepy Hollow) but this isn't one of them.  This is in the overall view over-flashy, conventional (much, much more than the first if that one had any convention in the first place) and confusing. I mean, at least the ending in the first one was exciting and questioning. This one just almost says the point of this film was Back to the Future (or past) with primates.  Dumb logic.  Also the characters have less charm, humor and coolness that came with the first one; Wahlberg has nearly no emotions in scenes that parallel the ones in the first, and I can see why Heston is now Sir Heston.Only things to possibly watch for- a hilarious cameo from Sir Charleton Heston himself (I'd just as well sneak in the film for that one scene again), makeup that nearly matches the first one, although the first one was a breakthrough, and some OK visual effects.  Some Die-hard Burton fans will find some use here (once in a while it gave a thrill or two), but other than that, keep your damn paws off of this damn, dirty film!  Between C- and D+",Planet of the Apes
10,wes-connors,Tim Burton Goes Ape,4,7 March 2009,"The good news is that this re-make doesn't completely ruin the original; still, if you haven't seen the 1968 ""Planet of the Apes"", view the older film first. That film's ""landmark"" moment is one of the all-time great moments in science fiction films. The ""memorial"" in this new version is a science fiction failure, a cheap stunt, which makes no contextual sense. What else well, this film has all-talking, clean-shaved humans. The sophisticated 1968 model apes are abandoned in favor of goofiness. The ""attraction"" between human Mark Wahlberg (as Leo Davidson) and chimp woman Helena Bonham Carter (as Ari) dies on the vine. And, worst of all, Roddy McDowall is no longer available...**** Planet of the Apes (2001) Tim Burton ~ Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter",Planet of the Apes
11,BandSAboutMovies,"Yeah, this won't do",4,1 January 2020,"Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner (The Legend of Billie Jean, Superman IV: A Quest for Peace, Sometimes They Come Back, The Beverly Hillbillies and more) worked with The Polar Express and Cast Away writer William Broyles Jr.After decades of trying to reboot the franchise, Tim Burton was able to get this script to the screen, even if nearly nobody was happy with the end results. Sure, it made money, but even the ending - spoiler, the Lincoln Memorial is now dedicated to General Thade and everyone on Earth is an ape - is the most nonsensical surprise ending of nearly all time.Mark Wahlberg - the man who potentially could have stopped 9/11 - plays Captain Leo Davidson, a United States Air Force astronaut who opens a portal to another world and ends up captured by the apes sometime in the future of 5021.After being captured, Leo and a female slave named Daena (Estella Warren) are bought by female chimpanzee Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), who brings them to work as servants in the house of her father, Senator Sandar (David Warner). Of course, Leo is destined to free the slaves and battle for freedom against Thade (Tim Roth, who turned down the role of Snape in the Harry Potter films to be in this movie) and Colonel Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan).This is a movie packed with actor spotting opportunities, from Paul Giamatti as slave trader Limbo to Kris Kristofferson as Daena's father Karubiv, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Shang Tsung!) as General Krull, Lisa Marie as Nova, Erick Avari (who has portrayed 24 different ethnicities in his career) as Tival, Glenn Shadix (who was the voice of the Mayor of Halloween Town in The Nightmare Before Christmas) as Senator Nado, Freda Foh Shen (the voice of the Chinese takeout in Hey Dude, Where's My Car?) as Bon and cameo appearances by the two actors most associated with the human side of the original films. Charlton Heston plays Thade's father Zaius and Linda Harrison appears as a slave.The films looks great, the Rick Baker effects are amazing, but sadly the film has no soul. There was plenty of studio overinvolvement in the film and Burton was in the midst of ending his relationship with Lisa Marie and beginning a new one with Helena Bonham-Carter. When asked if he'd make a sequel, Burton replied, ""I'd rather jump out a window.""Planet of the Apes won Worst Remake at the 22nd Golden Raspberry Awards, while Heston (Worst Supporting Actor) and Estella Warren (Worst Supporting Actress) also won awards. For what it's worth, Tim Roth had major issues with Heston and had no idea that the NRA spokesperson would be in the film with him.Wahlberg would later say to MTV News, when the next series of reboots was released, ""I haven't seen it yet, but I heard it was pretty damn good. Well, ours wasn't. It is what it is. Ours wasn't. They didn't have the script right. Fox Studios had a release date before Tim Burton had shot a foot of film. They were pushing him and pushing him in the wrong direction. You have to let Tim do his thing.""One last weird thing: Two apes in fill makeup appeared on the August 6, 2001 of WWE Raw. They entered the building to the theme song of Kamala and briught gifts for Stephanie McMahon before helping Chris Jericho throw a pie in her face. However, the apes were presented as real and not actors, which made the whole thing appear leven more ridiculous.",Planet of the Apes
12,michaelRokeefe,Human-like apes rule the world.,6,5 August 2001,"After digesting the hype and then taking in Tim Burton's remake of ""The Planet of the Apes"", I felt cheated or let us say disappointed. It was by no means any better than the original. An astronaut(Mark Wahlberg) lands on a planet where apes rule over humans, ok. He then tries to lead a revolution, ok. The twisted ending is the only captivating part of the movie. The set designs were awesome, cinematography out of sight and the special effects very good. This is a very interesting movie, but lacks the impact of the original. Danny Elfman proves again to be a wizard when it comes to scoring a movie.Supporting cast features Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Clark, Kris Kristofferson, Michael Clarke Duncan and Estella Warren. There is no reason to not think this movie can last over thirty years like the original and still be worth viewing. Hang on to the youngsters and your popcorn. A fun flick.",Planet of the Apes
13,sunwarrior13,It Just Cemented The Original's Status,5,3 April 2016,"The Planet Of The Apes is loosely based of the 1968 science fiction film of the same title that stars Charlton Heston and the 1963 French novel of the same title by Pierre Boulle.It stars Mark Wahlberg together with Helena Bonham Carter,Michael Clarke Duncan,Paul Giamatti,Estella Warren and Tim Burton,who also happens to be the film's director. The year was 2029.It involves a story of an astronaut named Leo Davidson whose spaceship crash-lands on a planet that are inhabited by apes who apparently have evolved to acquire human-like attributes like culture and intelligence.It was worth noticing that the apes have built a society and have treated humans as slaves.With the aid of Ari,Leo starts a revolution to overthrow the apes.The humans win and managed to overthrow the apes.It concludes when Leo going to the spaceship and traveling back in time and landing at Washington D.C. particularly at Lincoln Memorial wherein he witnesses a statue of General Thade instead of the late President and surprisingly a group of police,fire fighters and news reporters surrounding him. Aside from the improvement of the characters' make-up particularly the apes and the use of computers for special effects,the remake definitely is inferior compared to the original in many aspects of the film.The themes it covered was more about fight for freedom and rebellion rather than issues concerning the world today which the original covered such as the world's environment,possibility of a nuclear war and slavery.With it,it only fell trap into becoming just another Hollywood action flick instead of a film that is trying to convey an important message.Finally,the conclusion will only bring confusion as it was nowhere indicated in the story that its possibility would happen.",Planet of the Apes
14,Theo Robertson,Uninvolving Remake,6,30 March 2002,"I despair when Hollywood does remakes , they never get it right. The script to this remake of the classic PLANET OF THE APES contains far too much self referential humour where characters quote Hitler , Orwell and Charlton Heston , and go on for far too long about human rights. Yes we get the message , just a pity the screenwriters didn`t spend so long on developing the script more.Visually the sets are good as is Tim Roth`s make up , but this is the only success Tim Burton has with the film. Didn`t he realise that in the original apes were split into differing castes down to their species ? Here we see an ape army composed of all types of apes.Why ? I have no idea . And worst of all gone is the mystery and other worldliness of the original. Remember the scenes where the Earth astronauts trek through the forbidden zone and the first appearance of the apes  or that final scene ? In the remake we have no similar impact.There`s a rumour that there might be a sequel in the pipeline. I hope not",Planet of the Apes
15,preppy-3,Not up to the original,6,6 August 2001,"Tim Burton's ""rethinking"" of the 1968 original.  In this one Mark Wahlberg takes over the Charlton Heston role.  He's trapped on a planet (not Earth of the future as in the original) where apes rule over humans.  He tries to find a way home.The visuals are impressive--visually Burton knows how to direct. Unfortunately, he's never been very good with scripts and actors. That is painfully clear here.  The script moves slowly and the dialogue is comic book level.  The acting is pretty bad too with the sole exception of Helena Bonham Carter as a kind scientist ape.  Tim Roth as an evil ape scowls all the time and throws tantrums--it's not funny or cute or scary--just dull. And Wahlberg is truly terrible in the lead.  His character is so passive and accepting--a total wimp.  At least Heston's character in the original had some edge--Wahlberg has nothing.The makeup on the apes is good, a definitive improvement over the original. Also there's a good score by Danny Elfman and a terrific battle sequence at the end, but it's too little too late.  So, I give it a 6 for the visuals, Carter and the score.  Also the new ending is really really bad.",Planet of the Apes
16,poolandrews,A decent enough remake.,6,24 December 2009,"Planet of the Apes starts in the near future of 2029 where Captain Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) is stationed on the Oberon orbiting a distant planet, a huge space station where Leo looks after the genetically altered Apes who perform test flights. The Oberon detects an electromagnetic storm & sends a Chimp out in a space pod to collect data but the Oberon loses contact with the pod & Leo pilots a pod himself to go after it, Leo also flies into the electro magnetic & travels far into the future where he crash lands on the planet only to find that talking human like Apes are the dominant species & rule the planet while any humans are treated like animals & enslaved. Leo is captured & manages to convince human sympathiser Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) to help him escape, however the evil General Thade (Tim Roth) hates all humans & wants to kill them all & after learning of Leo's origins h sets out to hunt down & kill him before he leads a human uprising against the Apes...Directed by Tim Burton this big budget remake of the sci-fi classic Planet of the Apes (1968) completes my Planet of the Apes double bill today, I watched the original & then less than an hour later I watched this remake which I believe Burton actually described as a re-imagining rather than a straight remake & I have to say I enjoyed both films, sure the original is maybe the slightly more intelligent & better film overall but this remake is none to shabby despite a more shallow script & a baffling twist ending. I mean I think the ending is supposed to evoke memories of the original classic Statue of Liberty twist ending by again including a instantly recognisable world renowned iconic monument but no matter how many times you think about it or how many explanations you can come up with it doesn't make a blind bit of sense & will leave most of us scratching our heads in confusion. Again based on the novel Monkey Planet by Pierre Boulle this remake follows the original's basic first half premise fairly closely, astronaut crash lands on a planet where traditional roles are reversed as Apes are the dominant species & man considered the mere animal before all sorts of religious & moral issues raise their heads, this doesn't have the biting satire of the original & the moralist is kept to a minimum & dumbed down somewhat but at least it's still there in some form. The second half of the two films is where they differ the most with a huge battle between Apes & humans here & an A to B trek across the forbidden zone, there's a bit of comedy relief here as well while the main villains are different as the original it was a superstitious scientist & here it's a power mad General warmonger. The general idea that all Apes are afraid of water is also a stretch & the way our heroes escape hundreds of Apes is to simply cross a stream since they can't follow. The ending is also different with a definite answer to the origin of the Apes & their history. This remake places heavier emphasis on action & adventure than the original too which is fine I suppose as it's nicely done.Like the original 1968 version the make-up effects are outstanding here, even better in fact with some fantastic Ape make-up that just looks so realistic & utterly convincing as you can even make out details of the actors face beneath the mask's. The CGI computer effects are alright, there are one or two dodgy ones but nothing too major. The fights & action scenes are cool with particular detail given to the Apes like mannerism & movements which look great on screen, unlike the original the Apes here actually act like Apes as the swing in trees, leap high in the air, write with their feet & run on all fours into battle. The tone of the film is also darker than the original with creepy jungles & dark Ape cities.With a supposed $100,000,000 budget (almost twenty times that of the original made just over thirty years previous) this looks great as it should with great effects, sets & production values. The acting is good although Walhberg is given virtually nothing to do while Tim Roth makes for a good bad guy & original star Charlton Heston has a cameo as Roth's father. Kris Kristofferson has a small role as does David Warner.Planet of the Apes is a decent enough remake to a classic sci-fi film, having seen both in the space of a few hours I can honestly say I liked both of them & while seeing similarities between them I could also see differences too. Maybe not as good a film as the original but this is still a worthwhile watch.",Planet of the Apes
17,Boba_Fett1138,Unneeded and uninteresting.,4,6 February 2004,"Not even Tim Burton's unique and great style can save this movie.There are several bad things about ""Planet of the Apes"". (One of them is the fact that this movie should never have been made at all but let's put that aside.) It might sound strange but the thing that troubled and disappointed me the most was that the humans in the movie could all speak normal English and all acted like almost normal humans and some even seemed to have make up and hairdressers! Another troubling thing was Mark Wahlberg. Now, I'm not one of those people who have something against Mark Wahlberg, not at all but he was simply totally miscast. He is too much of an hero, which is not the right type of guy for this movie. And let's not even get started about Estella Warren or Tim Roth's overacting and some of the unneeded and weak characters in a disappointing story with an ending so weird that not even the smartest person will understand it.Now, I must say that the movie has some nice sets, costumes and make up that are typically trademark Tim Burton, the special effects are also quite good. It's also good that there still is plenty of humor to enjoy but it's not enough to make the movie interesting.There are some nice scene's but there also are some extremely disappointing scene's. The hunt is pretty cool (although still not as cool as the '68 hunt version) but the end battle is extremely weak and disappointing and ends too abrupt. Especially the Colonel Attar vs. Krull battle is laughable and a disgrace for the two characters that were about the most interesting two in the movie.I do not hate this movie I simply did not enjoy it.

I had vague memories of the T.V. show from when I was a kid, but not enough to give me any real high expectations of the movie. Now, even with no high expectations, and not knowing what the eventual outcome would be, I was still disappointed.This movie was really predicated upon action and suspense, but little other content value. The standoff at the end was OK minus the incredibly stupid and cliché stunt by the young boy. The story just lacked creativity, especially in light of my having seen the original Planet of the Apes. There was absolutely no comparison. The story, the dialogue, and even the ending was so cutting edge and socially relevant. Planet of the Apes 2001 did not do justice to its predecessor.",Planet of the Apes
19,neil-476,But are looks enough?,6,1 March 2011,"As always with Tim Burton, you know the film is going to look good even if it is rubbish. Well his remake of Planet Of The Apes does indeed look good, but is it rubbish? Although it has vastly different bookends to the 1968 original (in which respect it is, perhaps, closer to Pierre Boulle's original novel) it treads broadly similar grounds in terms of a spaceman from Earth whose arrival disrupts ape society in a big way.There is much to savour. There are quite a number of very well-known faces which you don't see because they are covered in ape makeup. That ape makeup, and the ape physicality of the actors, are both fantastic, and far superior to their 1968 equivalent. And Tim Roth's chimpanzee General Thade is a stunning performance - very physical, and very intense. On the other hand Mark Wahlberg was not, at this point in his career, the right man to play the lead, Helena Bonham Carter's society gal chimp doesn't work visually, and the final twist scene is a downright cheat.The fact remains that although the remake is not a disaster by any means, the original didn't really need remaking. Even so, there is something poignantly pleasing at witnessing Charlton Heston, at the very end of his career, revisiting his classic line from 30-odd years earlier from the other side of the species divide.",Planet of the Apes
20,evanston_dad,Just Not the Same Without Charlton Heston in a Loincloth,5,1 February 2007,"Tim Burton takes a disappointingly literal approach to remaking the 1968 cult classic, and what he gives us is an undistinguished action film, not necessarily worse than any number of action films produced in a given year, but so much worse than it could have been given the source material and Burton's fierce imagination.Tim Roth is the standout among the simian characters -- he actually scared the crap out of me. The shock ending to the original was so well known that Burton knew he had to come up with something different, and to tell you the truth I can't even remember what it was; that might give you an indication as to how effective it was.The opening credit sequence is this film's high point, and it all goes downhill from there.Grade: C",Planet of the Apes
21,ferguson-6,Get yer stinkin hands off me,6,28 July 2001,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Somewhat unstable director Tim Burton offers us a very dark, bleak and action-packed re-make.  Yes, it is a re-make despite all attempts to categorize as something other than.  Some wonderful characters here, including the best non-human villain in film history.  Tim Roth creates a truly evil being in Thade.  His walk and talk had me believing!  The sound, make-up and costumes are outstanding, and really had to be in order to pull this off.  Burton provides a few nice nods to the original, but none better than including Chuck Heston in a real flip of roles.  The usually outstanding Danny Elfman (yes, Jenna's bro) has some fine score moments, but overall a bit of let down.  Marky Mark is OK in the lead, but Estella Warren (from ""Driven"") is downright awful.  No other human has highlights in their hair!  Michael Clark Duncan (""The Green Mile"") is chilling as the sargeant of the ape army.  Again the sound comes into play everytime he speaks or roars.  Not really sure of the purpose of the ending. It is not a surprise ending, but I cannot tell if this is a tip of the cap to the original remakes, or if Burton thought he was providing a shocker. The ending kind of flops on both accounts.  But that should not prevent you from seeing the movie.  Just make sure you go to a big screen, with great sound!",Planet of the Apes
22,anaconda-40658,This Ranks Amongst the Worst of This Franchise.,2,11 August 2015,"Planet of the Apes (2001): Dir: Tim Burton / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Helena Bonham Carter, Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti: Pointless remake about a dominating factor higher than man. This planet is dominated by advanced apes who conquer human tress passers. Mark Wahlberg leads a team in space and they send a chimpanzee into orbit. After crash landing they are enslaved by ape warriors. Ending is a laughable mess that makes one wonder whether Tim Burton is losing his touch. This is not the superb work he demonstrated with Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow. Wahlberg delivers one of his worst performances as this space captain thrust into a constant ass kicking by apes. Helena Bonham Carter plays a female ape who has compassion on him. Unfortunately that compassion boarders heavily on bestiality. It is disturbing watching these two ogle each other. Tim Roth plays a heavy tempered ape who just wants to use Wahlberg as a trampoline. Michael Clarke Duncan plays a humungous warrior ape because this is what we all call type casting. Paul Giamatti plays an orangutan meant for comic effect but the joke is on him. The makeup effects and visual elements are about the only aspect worth going ape over. Hints of bestiality are totally disgusting but the screenplay is totally monkey brained and without the complexity of the original. Score: 2 / 10",Planet of the Apes
23,AaronCapenBanner,Pointless Remake.,2,26 August 2013,"Director Tim Burton was behind this big-budget, but ultimately pointless, and unsatisfying ""re-imagining"" of the classic 1968 original. Here, Mark Wahlberg takes over the lead astronaut role, as he finds himself(through a muddled set of circumstances) thrust into a future earth where(no surprise) apes now rule over men, and he must find a way to survive this ordeal, and get back to his own time, assuming he ever can...Good makeup F/X and supporting cast(including Charlton Heston, in a knowing cameo) cannot redeem such an otherwise uninspired and purposeless film, which really has nothing new to offer, and provokes no new insight.Final twist at the end is so arbitrary and crass, that it may make you scream, or at least say ""Huh?

24,Aaron1375,Wahlberg is just plain horrible.,6,7 March 2003,"If it wasn't for him, I would have liked this movie a lot more.  Part of it isn't his fault as the stupid story has his motivation for going into space to find his monkey that disappears.  So he risks his life and that of the ship's crew to find his monkey.  I can't really back a guy that stupid. Then the parts that are his fault is that he is just a bad actor and has a look about him I just don't care for.  Of course, he ends up landing on a planet run buy super monkeys.  The people playing the monkeys do a very good job with their parts.  I don't have anything bad to say about them, except that their good job makes Wahlberg look even worse.  Tim Roth is great as is Carter.  All the apes do well.  Kris Kristofferson is not in the movie enough and is killed relatively early.  I wish he were in it more; they needed one good human character in this one.

25,Wuchakk,"A Mixed Bag, but Ultimately a Decent Addition to the Apes Saga",6,14 March 2014,"YEAR: 2001 DIRECTOR: Tim Burton COUNTRY: USA RUNTIME: 119 minutesTHE PLOT: An astronaut (Mark Wahlberg) crashlands on a planet ruled by apes where humans are considered animals and slaves, even though they are intelligent and can speak. The astronaut soon leads the humans to revolt.I don't think there's any question that Tim Burton really knows how to make a film look great. And so it is with this remake of ""Planet of the Apes."" The locations, sets, ape make-up, costumes, cast, score (Danny Elfman) and direction are all outstanding. Just as good as the original film and, in many cases, even better. Unfortunately, the overall results are a mixed bag.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The biggest problem with this remake is that there is no build-up of mystery. Wahlberg crashlands to the planet very early on in the story, just like in the original film. Unfortunately, as soon as he lands he's IMMEDIATELY thrust into the ape/human conflict, captured and taken to the ape city. This flashes by so quickly that the viewer could easily MISS IT ALL if s/he got up for a few minutes to get something from the kitchen!! The original took its time in this matter; Taylor (Heston) and his fellow astronauts obviously crashland in the middle of nowhere and explore the planet for a long period of time before eventually encountering the inhabitants of the planet. It's all very mysterious, and there's a lot of build-up to the ape revelation.It's also highly unbelievable that Wahlberg would crashland right into the midst of the human/ape conflict. The planet is the size of Earth, so what are the chances that he'd land right in the middle of the fray? I suppose Burton and the writers didn't want the film to bog down once Wahlberg crashlands, but couldn't they have at least given us FIVE MINUTES of exploration time, giving the impression that Wahlberg searches for a fairly long period of time before encountering the humans and apes? As it's presented it's simply too unbelievable.This is a major misstep; and because it happens so early in the film it strongly tempts most intelligent viewers (who naturally MUST have some reasonable amount of believability to enjoy sci-fi) to lose faith in the picture and tune out or, at least, become excessively critical of the remainder of the film.Another problem with the picture is that I just simply failed to really get caught up in the characters and their story. There needed to be more character-defining dialogue. A well written script causes the viewer to be CAPTIVATED by the storyline. Well, I never fully got captivated.These factors explain why I was severely let down when first viewing the film at the theater in 2001.WHAT WORKS: Seeing the film again recently, I was braced for these flaws and willing to suspend disbelief to (try to) enjoy the story. I now conclude that there are numerous worthwhile qualities to the remake.For one thing, although Mark Wahlberg is no Charleton Heston (Taylor was Heston's greatest role and performance IMHO), I think he does a great job as the protagonist. Helena Bonham Carter is also fabulous in the Zira-like role of Ari; she really brings Ari to life and makes her unique. And as beautiful as Linda Harrison was as Nova, Estella Warren pretty much blows her out of the water in the counterpart role of Daena. Unfortunately her character is shallow and we never get a satisfyingly good look at Estelle in all her voluptuous glory. But, no matter, what we DO see is breathtaking.Tim Roth is utterly evil as the villainous Thade. This is very much in contrast to Dr. Zaius in the original, who was actually a very noble character. Lastly, the giant Michael Clarke Duncan is magnificent as the gorilla general, Thade's ""friend.""As to be expected, the ape make-up is WAY better than the original, even though I still love the job they did in the earlier film. The ape characters don't only look more like highly evolved apes compared to the original, they walk, talk, howl, grunt, jump, fight and climb more like real apes.The ape city sets are fabulous too, albeit a bit too dark for my tastes. I find this unbelievable and verging on cartooney. I know Burton is into Goth and therefore prefers dark lighting, but it would be nice to actually SEE the wonderful sets made for the film (or perhaps he doesn't want the viewer to get too good a look and see how artificial they really are? I don't know, I'm just guessing).I also liked all the homages to the original film -- the various lines, Linda Harrison, Charleton Heston as Thade's dying father, etc.Although numerous people had a problem with the ending, I think they did a good job. How else better to end it? Notice how the camera mysteriously shoots from behind the ""Lincoln Memorial"" just like the original does with the Statue of Liberty.FINAL ANALYSIS: Despite a couple major flaws there's a lot to appreciate in Burton's remake. It's not as good as the original or ""Beneath,"" but it's, at least, on a par with ""Escape."" And it's certainly better than ""Conquest"" and, especially, ""Battle.""The bottom line is that Tim Burton's remake of ""Planet of the Apes"" is a worthwhile addition to your apes film collection. For serious ""Apes"" fans it's even mandatory because, even though -- OVERALL -- it doesn't come close to the greatness of the original (or ""Beneath""), it has numerous singular aspects that surpass it.GRADE: C+ or B-",Planet of the Apes

Sure the ending was ambiguous, but no more ambiguous than a Christopher Nolan movie right?",Planet of the Apes
27,zetes,"Planet of the Apes, the Remake: Now with 75% more snarling!",5,27 July 2001,"SPOILERS (also for original PoA, 1968)You would have to look far and wide to find a bigger fan of the original Planet of the Apes. I nearly went berserk a few months ago when a woman I know said that Planet of the Apes was a so-bad-it's-good type of movie. It took all of my mental power to remain calm (she wasn't even speaking to me). Yes, I worship the original Planet of the Apes and disdain its cheap, money-hungry sequels. It was those that lowered the original's reputation. Now comes the remake, directed by Tim Burton, a director whose work, IMO, is often visually brilliant but more often narratively incompetent. After I saw Sleepy Hollow, I wrote on imdb how I thought Burton should make sure his next script is okay before filming commences. Obviously Tim doesn't care what I think. His Planet of the Apes is a decent, run-of-the-mill summer actioner, but it has these weird attempts at social commentary and, even worse, at comedy.The jokes referencing the original are very cheaply made and only inspired embarrassed laughter. Charlton Heston's cameo is so gauche it's unbelievable. I pity him. The only self-referential gag that worked was a visual one that few people in the theater seemed to notice: the spaceship that Leo (Mark Wahlberg, who is so bland I almost forgot he was in the film while watching him) and his crew find in the forbidden zone is a visual pun on the Statue of Liberty ending of the original, even quoting camera angles. I laughed at that bit of cleverness.The make-up ought to be criticized a lot, for it is so much worse than the make-up of the original that it is startling. People nowadays might scoff at the original's make-up, not realizing that it was Academy Award-winning at the time. It is not bad at all, and the emotions could be seen on the faces of the actors. My favorite expression is one that a gorilla soldier has on his face when he is hosing down Taylor, Taylor exclaiming: ""It's a madhouse, a madhouse!"" The ape shouts back ""SHUT UP YOU FILTHY HUMAN!"" The expression on his face and his tone of voice are powerful. In this one, the make-up artists foolishly tried to ape real apes. What results is once and a while amazing (the orang-otans, especially Senator Sandar, whose corpulent orang-otan politician is the greatest and most underused creation this film has to offer; the other orang-otan, Limbo, is the best character in the film (Paul Giamatti, a good character actor all-around)) but more often terrible (Ari (Helena Bonham Carter, a poor actress in most respects), apparently a chimp, looks so much worse than her counterparts in the original, Zira and Cornelius; Thade seems more like an invented ape or a werewolf than a chimp). The apes' movement in this film is also ridiculous. They move basically as humans in the original, simply because they were supposed to have evolved. Evolution has given us humans straight backs. These apes run on all fours and jump a hundred feet in the air. What is this, Crouching Chimp Hidden Gorilla? Maybe a chimp can do that, maybe even an orang-otan, but not a gorilla. Thade (Tim Roth) at one point throws a fit where he leaps around like crazy. It's so ridiculous, several people in the theater were laughing. Also ridiculous was the decision to make these evolved apes sound just like their natural counterparts. There is so much squealing in this film that it ends up hurting your ears. Heck, I wish they would have just gone for broke and had them whip feces at the humans during their battles.In the original, characters were well developed and defined. The apes' society and civilization was well displayed, including the complex ape class-structure. The original film had patience in setting things up, it didn't overburden us with unnecessary action sequences. All in all, the new Planet of the Apes is only worth seeing if you are bored and in desperate need for an action film. It does not work on any intelligent level. 6/10",Planet of the Apes
28,JamesHitchcock,A Remake of a Film that Never Needed to be Remade,6,3 November 2004,"If one wants to remake a movie, the best option is probably to choose and original that was good, but not a great classic. Clearly, any attempt to remake a concept that failed first time around is fraught with danger, but an attempt to remake a classic runs the risk that one's film will be unfavourably compared with the original. The original 1968 film of 'Planet of the Apes' is one of cinema's great science fiction classics. More than an adventure story, it touches on some of the concerns of the late sixties- the fear of nuclear war, race relations- and also raises more fundamental issues about the relationship between man and nature, the relationship between religion and science, Darwinism and animal rights. It was therefore a brave move on Tim Burton's part to try and remake it. The main concept of Tim Burton's film is basically similar to Franklin Schaffner's. An astronaut from Earth travels to a planet ruled by intelligent apes. Humans exist on this planet, but they are regarded as an inferior species, despised and exploited by the apes. There is, however, an important difference. In the original film, the apes are the only intelligent and articulate beings on the planet. Although they have only attained a pre-industrial level of civilization (they have firearms, but no power-driven machinery, and no means of transport other than the horse or horse-drawn vehicles), they are a far more advanced species than the planet's human inhabitants, who lack the powers of speech and reason and live an animal-like existence. In Burton's remake, humans and apes have similar powers of speech and intellect; it is only the apes' greater physical strength that enables them to dominate the planet and to treat the humans as slaves. It was this ironic role-reversal, with apes behaving like men and men behaving like beasts, that gave Schaffner's film its satirical power. That film was advertised with the slogan 'Somewhere in the Universe, there must be something better than man!', and the apes are indeed, in some respects, better than man. Their law against killing others of their kind, for example, is much more strictly observed than our commandment that 'Thou shalt do no murder'. There is no sense that the apes are bad and the humans good. Even Dr Zaius, the orang-utan politician, is not a wicked individual; by the standards of his society he is an honourable and decent one. His weakness is that of excessive intellectual conservatism and unwillingness to accept opinions that do not fit in with his preconceived world view. (In this respect the apes are very human indeed). Burton's film takes a less subtle moral line. It is a straightforward story of a fight for freedom. The villains are most of the apes, especially the fanatical, human-hating General Thade. The heroes are Captain Davidson, the astronaut from Earth, the planet's human population who long for freedom from the domination of the apes, and a few liberal, pro-human apes, especially Ari, the daughter of an ape senator. The apes are more aggressive and more obviously animals than in the original film; they still frequently move on all fours and emit fierce shrieks whenever angry or excited. There are some things about this film that are good, especially the ape make-up which is, for the most part, more convincing than in the original film and allows the actors more scope to show emotion. (I say 'for the most part' because Ari looks far less simian than do most of the other apes- Tim Burton obviously felt that the audience would be more likely to accept her as a sympathetic character if she looked half-human). The actors playing apes actually seem more convincing than those playing humans. Tim Roth is good as the militaristic Thade, as is Helena Bonham-Carter as Ari. Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, is not an actor of the same caliber as Charlton Heston, who played the equivalent role in the original film, and Estella Warren has little to do other than look glamorous. (Heston has a cameo role as an ape in Burton's film, and even gets to repeat his famous line 'Damn you all to hell'). Overall, however, the film is a disappointment when compared to the original, a simple science-fiction adventure story as opposed to an intelligent and philosophical look at complex issues. It tried to copy the device of a surprise ending but failed. Schaffner's famous final twist is shocking, but makes perfect sense in the context of what has gone before. Burton's makes no sense whatsoever.Tim Burton can be a director of great originality, but with 'Planet of the Apes' he fell into the standard Hollywood trap of trying to copy what had already been done and remaking a film that never needed to be remade. It was good to see him return to form with the brilliant 'Big Fish', one of the best films of last year. 6/10",Planet of the Apes

The film itself was a dud, and got a ruthless beating from critics and the general public, despite making a profit in theaters.The problem is that they tried to ""re-imagine"" the original much in the same way that ""Batman Begins"" was a restart of the Batman franchise - but ""Begins"" did it well, and ""Planet of the Apes"" was not as skillful.Tim Burton has some die-hard cult fans on this site who are quick to blame studio interference, but I think the real problem is that Burton was given too much free roam. Armed with a $100,000,000 budget and a very mainstream, action-oriented picture - something he had only ever ventured upon with ""Batman"" more than a decade prior - he just couldn't get a grip on any aspect of the feature. It's a very loose, jumbled, unfocused picture - full of absurdity, stupidity and downright hammy acting.Mark Wahlberg plays the hero, an astronaut who is transported through a black hole to another galaxy where apes rule the world and humans are their slaves. Leading a revolt against the apes, he fights for the rights of humanity - becoming a Jesus Christ figure for all the other humans...a ""savior.""

31,DKosty123,Why Do This,4,19 February 2008,"Tim Burton proves in this one that improving a modern sci-fi classic is nearly impossible. When remaking the 1960's classic, it created some ticket sales because of the original franchise. The trouble with this remake is that the golly-gee whiz special effects of today are put in as replacements for the original dramatic script of the past epic film.The result is definitely mixed, and skewed towards the lower end of the scale. The remake is so focused on using these new special effects, they create a new ending for this film which is truly horrible compared with the original Rod Sterling epic.The story of reverse evolution theory is classic with Ape evolving from man, and Tim Burton's legion of fans might get a kick out of this, but my take is to see the original. It tells the story better and is dominated by drama more than special effects.",Planet of the Apes
32,KineticSeoul,Felt outdated for it's time and lacked what made the original at least intriguing,4,11 January 2012,"This wasn't a terrible remake but it wasn't really good either. I like remakes that change things up a bit while having some essence and premise from the original. And this movie did change things up a lot compared to the original but it took a lot away from what made the original good. The movie felt like it was more about racism than sci-fi ideology and theory which I found to be interesting in the original. And it lacked the creepy and mysterious sci-fi elements that was in the original. It's a watchable movie but it just goes in a very narrow and direct direction and not in a good way either. Nothing is really imaginative and it just didn't get me immersed or interested on what was going on. I was just going along with it until it ended. The original ""Planet of the Apes"" was far-fetched but this was is more non-believable and even absurd. Also maybe if it tried to modernize it in a cool sci-fi direction it might have been at least somewhat entertaining but it lacked that as well while having the similar corniness of the original. The apes being apes didn't even play a crucial part in the story.4.5/10",Planet of the Apes
33,sddavis63,"Very Good, Original Story",8,22 December 2001,"This movies deserves a rating of 8 just for the surprise twist at the end, about which I will say no more.I hadn't really been expecting that much from this when I rented the video; I rather thought that the ""Apes"" franchise had been done to death back in the late 60's - early 70's, with a collection of movies and a TV series that went progressively downhill and became more nonsensical with each installment. But I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie, which was very entertaining and - if I recall correctly (although it's been many years since I read it) is more consistent with the story of Pierre Bouille's original novel. So, my advice is that if you're either avoiding this or watching it because you expect it to be like the ""Apes"" movies of thirty years ago, plan to watch it on its own merits instead.The cast was in general very good. Mark Wahlberg did a fine job as the astronaut Leo Davidson, stranded on this nightmare of a planet (for him) with no obvious way of getting home. Tim Roth as his primary ape antagonist, General Thade, was also very good. I had a mixture of reactions to Helena Bonham Carter's role as Ari, the human-loving ape. Her performance was quite good, but, frankly, I found her character to be rather irritating. It's a necessary role. We have to see these divisions in ape society, but the character just didn't appeal to me in the same way as, say, Cornelius and Zera did in the original movie. I also thought the ape makeup was rather weak. Frankly, they did a better job thirty years ago.But those minor criticisms aside, I really did enjoy this movie. It was a fast-paced story that held my attention, there was enough humour to make it fun, and enough drama to make me wonder how Davidson was ever going to get out of this. And - as I said at the start - the end itself is worth watching the whole movie.I rate this as an 8/10.",Planet of the Apes
34,bowmanblue,Good film. Bad ending.,7,10 September 2014,"Okay, if you don't know... the original Planet of the Apes movie was hailed as a classic. Despite being basically a B-movie with a load of men in rubber masks, it had a unique ending which will be remembered throughout cinema history (if you don't know what it is, then I won't spoil it by telling you). Therefore, now we have the remake (or 're-envisioning' as the film-makers like to call it), it had two choices: either copy the original ending and leave everyone saying they ripped off the first, or try to match it for shock value.I don't think they would have won doing either. They tried 'shock value' and failed.However, if you ignore that, Planet of the Apes (the remake) isn't actually a bad movie. If you like sci-fi (and can forgive the blasphemy of remaking such a classic) you should at least enjoy the make-up - which is awesome for creating new and varied races of apes.Not counting the ending, there are other negatives, too. There are more human characters, most of which don't get the screen time they deserve to be fully developed (and any fans of Kris Kristophen will feel short-changes as his addition is basically an extended cameo). Plus the action isn't that action-packed (but then Tim Burton is hardly an 'action director').However, despite the negatives, it's still not a bad movie. It'll never be the classic that the original was and it was a disappointment at the box office (meaning the ending will never get the explanation it deserved). Don't expect too much and enjoy the grisly performance of Tim Roth as the evil ape leader and not being able to recognise Helena Bonham Carter in her make-up.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Planet of the Apes
35,ThomasDrufke,Adds Nothing New to the 1968 Classic,4,15 September 2016,"Reinventing a classic film is one thing, but if you're going to remake something beloved by film fans worldwide, do it for a reason. This Planet of the Apes reboot brings little to nothing new to the series with a brutally dull outcome.Look, it's easier said than done. Remakes and reboots have a lot of pressure and usually wind up being a waste of time. But there was serious potential here. With Tim Burton coming off a few solid films with Johnny Depp and box office success with Batman, you'd think he would have a grapple on what to do with the Apes franchise. Sadly, it was the exact opposite.The original 1968 classic was thought provoking and lead to a couple really well done sequels, but Burton's take is disappointingly more creepy and awkward than it is cerebral. I'm sorry, but I just don't care for seeing Mark Wahlberg have a strange romantic relationship with a female ape. Or, rather, an equally dull relationship with a human, played by Estella Warren. No chemistry between the two, whatsoever.But there are a few redeemable qualities surprisingly. Instead of a massive Statue of Liberty reveal at the end, Burton makes a few middle act changes that actually benefit the story in the long run. Having the very cause of the apes taking over earth being due to Wahlberg's mistake was interesting, but I'm just not sure it was earned. Something else that wasn't earned is the entire third act. Talk about an atrocious piece of mess, the third act tries to propose so many ideas and take twists and turns that it just all feels tiresome. Unfortunately, by the time the big battle comes around, you just don't care.It's easy to look at a film in hindsight and say it shouldn't have been made, but seriously, this Apes entry should not have been made. It wasn't yet the time where visual effects offered up the opportunity to do great motion capture or picture perfect-looking Apes (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, 2014) and using old make-up was the wrong choice. It's nice for the 60's but using it in 2001 is a completely different entity. But the main problem is that the characters and story are second to an attempt to build out impressive set pieces. Tim Roth's one-note villain and the film's choice for romances make for one brutal viewing.+Some interesting subtle changes-Lack of reinvention-Awkward romances-No reason for 2001 to be the time for a remake4.6/10",Planet of the Apes
36,MLDinTN,A monkey could have done a better job,5,2 June 2002,"Overall, this movie pretty much sucked.  I mean this could have been great, and the studio even thought it would be by talking about sequels before the first one hit the theater. Boy, were they wrong. I don't guess the sequel will be made because it will be too expensive to make such an awful film.
There is one good thing about this movie. The make-up.  The actors really do look like talking apes. And all the apes look different with their own unique face. The teeth even look real.
Now back to the plot.  Why was Estella Warren even in this? She did nothing. At least the female ape did something.  (SPOILERS): And that chimp landing the space pod at the end, which basically saves the humans, is so convient. I mean, come on, why did it take so long for the chimp to land when Leo crashed his ship days earlier.  And leo is not well written.  I think he should have been more shocked and stuff when he first saw apes talking.(END OF SPOILERS)
FINAL VERDICT:  You might want to watch it for half an hour just to see the realistic looking apes.  But, don't waste 2 hours to see this flop.",Planet of the Apes
37,Cineanalyst,Chimp God and Marky Mark Moses,3,4 April 2020,"Tim Burton and company definitely double down on ""Planet of the Apes"" as a Jewish parable, with Mark Whalberg playing a slack-jawed Moses to the human slaves, along with a few apes, whom he leads through the desert of the forbidden zone, evading capture by crossing a sea of sorts, even, and to the mountaintop, where, near by, he wanders off to communicate with the burning bush of his ruined spaceship. He also wars with the various tribes of apes, to deliver the promised land of equality to all... or some such thing. There's the chimp god from the stars, too.It's an entirely unwarranted remake. Although the makeup and CGI effects are OK, I, at least, had no desire to see an attractive, talking, super-intelligent chimpanzee, such as Helena Bonham Carter's Ari. Nor do I care for the suggestion of a love triangle between Ari, Whalberg's Moses stand-in and a female human, who unlike the original film's Nova, can talk, but still has nothing worth saying. Worse still, Tim Roth merely snarls and jumps around, jacked up on CGI, and the human boy who wants to be on the front lines is just laughable.",Planet of the Apes
38,g-bodyl,I Don't Much Care For This!,6,15 July 2010,"I see why people hate this film. In fact, the first time I saw this, I hated this film and I rarely hate films. I couldn't even watch the whole thing. I'm reviewing this movie after viewing it for a second time. I thought it was OK. Tim Burton certainly made much better movies.Leo Davidson lands on a planet with the humans the minority race. The majority race is none other than evil gorillas. Now, Leo needs to help the humans and escape while he can.The acting is so so. Mark Wahlberg is a decent actor. Tim Roth played a great villain. Estella Warren needs to quit acting(maybe she did). Her character is awful.The special effects were pretty good even though there are lots of movies with better effects. The makeup is solid, nothing extraordinary. The ending- well, I didn't like the ending too much. I really hope the prequel is better than this. I rate this film 6/10.",Planet of the Apes
39,cricketbat,"Impressive makeup, lousy movie",4,27 December 2018,"Aside from the impressive makeup jobs, Planet of the Apes doesn't have much to offer. The plot is bland and predictable, with a heavy-handed message and an unnecessarily confusing ending. The acting is over-the-top and uneven, as well. This doesn't feel like a Tim Burton movie, which could be a good thing, because Burton should distance himself from this mess as much as possible.",Planet of the Apes
40,Bored_Dragon,Unfairly underrated,8,10 June 2017,"I sat to watch this movie full of prejudice based on bad reviews, and in the beginning, I was thinking to give up on it. But, I saw it through and my opinion has completely changed. This is a very good movie. Almost all arguments against this movie are based on the premise that it is a remake of the cult classic from 1968. If that was the case, compared to the original, this movie sucks. But it is a very wrong angle and it is understandable that conclusions based on the wrong premise, filled with emotion and prejudice, will be wrong conclusions.Just try to watch this movie from a point of view of someone who did not see the original franchise and have no idea what is it all about, and you'll enjoy a great movie. Because this is not really a remake. The only thing they share is the basic idea that in distant future apes will rule the Earth. Other than that those are two completely different movies. Characters are new and different, the story begins slightly similar, but develops and ends completely different. This is typical Tim Burton's dark fairy-tale, original in every way, except for stealing the basic idea from cult classic. The story is interesting and brings completely new ideas that make it essentially different from 1968 movie. The way apes rise to be on the top of the evolutionary scale, the event that stops the battle and the way the main character ends his adventure are three main and totally unexpected twists that are completely new. I saw all five movies from the old franchise and I was still surprised by every plot twist here. Nothing was already seen or too predictable. Because this is not really a remake. The crash-landing scene is the only one visually similar to '60s movie. But if you think about it, he had to land somehow, and there are not so many ways to do it and survive. I mean, he could not teleport himself or catapult from ship and land by parachute from outer space...8/10",Planet of the Apes
41,tabuno,A Non-Intimate Version of the Original,5,27 January 2019,"6 August 2001. This updated version reverts to the clash of warring parties and focuses more on ape authenticity, then the more intimate original version which focused more on the individual diversity and complex interaction between man and ape. The silent humans in the original version gave the movie a much more dramatic feel. The original ending was one of the best stunners in the league of ""The Sixth Sense,"" and ""The Crying Game."" The original held much more of sci-fi instead of the usual us versus them wargames. The original was more thrilling, mysterious, and scary, ominously.",Planet of the Apes
42,The-Sarkologist,The nature of the animal within us.,8,26 July 2013,"This is a remake of the old classic starring Charlton Heston, though as happens with a lot of remakes these days, while following the theme, the plot works out differently. In the original film, Charlton Heston travels to the Andromeda Galaxy and when he returns 2000 years in the future, he discovers that he has landed on a planet that is ruled by apes. It is only by the end of the film that he discovers that it is Earth. This film had the memorable lines of 'take your stinking paws off me you damned dirty ape', and 'You Maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell!' This version doesn't end as dramatically as the original (he returns to Earth to discover that the Earth that he knew was gone and is populated by apes) and the first line spoken by an ape to a human (instead of the other way around as in the original movie) is 'Get your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human!'. Further, the film begins in a space station orbiting Saturn where they are investigating a magnetic vortex and the hero lands up on the planet of the apes when he travels through the vortex and lands up a thousand years in the future.I have probably given away a bit too much of the movie, but considering that it involves time travel, and also involves changes to the time stream (such as the space station entering the vortex and arriving at the planet centuries before our hero) I am at a loss to see how 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' (which I have not seen at the time of this writing) could possibly be a prequel to this movie. Somebody has suggested that it involves the scene at the end, however it is clear from the inscription behind the statue that Thade, the bad guy in this film, somehow came to earth prior to our hero and upset the order, so we have another time travel dilemma. It is quite clever how Tim Burton constructed this movie since it is its own sequel and prequel (though we do not know how Thade managed to get off of the planet of the apes and to earth).Like the original film, the apes are an advanced iron age culture similar to Rome, and they borrow the title of senator, and also have their weapons and armour similar to that of the Romans. However a major difference is that the humans can speak in this film (though as slaves they are forbidden). However, that is likely to be because in the original, the action occurs after two thousand years had passed, whereas the action in this movie only occurred centuries (though it appears that the genetic manipulation of the apes on the space station had quickened the apes rate of evolution).There is a subtle dig at religion in this film. The apes have a religion and they worship the first ape who had created them, and believe that he left and will return. However, an ape does come from the sky at the end of the film, and it turns out that it is the ape that our hero had originally gone out to find. I guess the suggestion is that while our religion may have some truth to it, in reality it is simply a load of myth that is manipulated by the power brokers to create the world that they want and to force the population to submit to their will. Well, all I can say to that is that we live in a pluralistic society, and the times when one denomination would call the shots in any one country (or region) are long gone, at least in our Western Society. These days, if we don't like what our church is teaching us we can simply walk out and find one that we do like. Some say that is good, others say that is bad, however as far as I'm concerned, the bible is legit and I shall continue to believe it.The other interesting thing that I noticed is the idea of the animalistic nature of us humans. The idea is that despite all of the trappings of civilisation that we surround ourselves with, in our hearts we are still barbarians. While the apes have rising to become dominant, reducing the humans to the status of animals (much in the same what that certain races of humans were relegated to the status of animals in the past), in many cases they are still beasts. While they can talk and reasons, their behaviour suggests that they are still little more than animals. In a way this aspects reflects us as humans because despite the fact that we are able to put somebody on the moon, we still behave in a way that would make an onlooker believe that we are mindless animals driven only by lust and desire.",Planet of the Apes

46,Movie Nuttball,2001 POTA in-depth Review!,10,22 February 2003,"Many people think that the original 1967 Planet of the Apes is a classic and a master piece. Sure its one heck of a film especially back in the day when it was made. It had great costumes and makeup with great music by Jerry Goldsmith and a tremendous shocking end. This Planet of the Apes has awesome costumes and very realistic makeup and/or masks. The music is outstanding by Danny Elfman and the 2001 version has even a more shocking end. It seems to Me many people are against or hate this POTA. I really don't know why, it has such an interesting cast and they play their parts very well and sure it may not be director Tim Burton's darkest film but in My opinion it is one heck of movie! The way I see the film it has a lot of emotion and all of the characters are so likable. I'll try to explain this as best as I can about Helena Bonham Carter is a very good looking woman and her character Ari is beautiful. I know she is under tons of makeup and looks very realistic as an ape but whenever she is on screen I can't help but think how neat she is with her voice and personality. Tim Roth's Thade is an awesome character and his character deserves a lot more credit. Roth's performance is truly menacing. Charlton Heston put on another solid performance as Thade's father. Another thing that gets into this movie so much is the music. Each scene is so great with the fantastic score! Below is in My opinions an in-depth look at most of the characters that is in the 2001 Planet of the Apes!-------------Mark Wahlberg as Captain Leo Davidson - Leo Davidson, after the incident of going after Pericles he is stranded on another world thanks to a magnetic storm. The planet he lands on has unbelievable talking apes. He is prisoner but after Ari frees him he gets to know her and her mentor, Krull and some other humans. He joins these two different factions of intelligent species and travels to the forbidden area Calima! Leo is out for himself and to go back home as soon as he can!Tim Roth as General Thade - The great General Thade, a mighty warrior who is afraid of nothing. His mean voice sends shivers down his soldiers back and he hates humans to death!Thade and Ari were once in a relationship but now Ari has other things to do. He loves his father Zaius very much and he is very saddened about his father's illness. Helena Bonham Carter as Ari - She is a beautiful ape and very intelligent as well. She helps Leo escape. She is through with Thade and even though she has feelings for Leo even though he is human. She loves Krull as he is her mentor and in fact he is with Ari all the way with her,Leo,and other escapees from the city.Michael Clarke Duncan as Colonel Attar - The huge Attar is a force to reckon with! He is General Thade's great warrior and best friend. He is a very religious and serious ape.Paul Giamatti as Limbo - The always funny Limbo loves to smell and look good. The human keeper if you will takes his job seriously but when he is forced to follow the escapees his life turns around. Estella Warren as Daena - One of the many prisoners in Ape City,Daena wants out just as much as everyone else but when she meets up with Leo and escapes with the group she has feelings for him but much like he does for Ari he doesn't think much of it. She loves her father Karubi very much and she is shocked and very sad about his death.Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Krull - The massive Krull was one of the greatest warriors and a brave leader. He is the mentor of Ari and he is one of the apes who is in the escaped group. His favorite weapons are swords and handles them excellently!David Warner as Senator Sandar - Ari's father, Senator Sandar let Thade have control. He is an ape that believes in manners such as washing hands. He tries not to get on Thade's case and he loves his daughter Ari.Kris Kristofferson as Karubi - The father of Daena,Karubi loves his daughter very much. He is a brave human man but his death in a fight against Attar didn't last long and he never knew what hit him from behind which it was General Thade.Thade's sword decapitated him.Erick Avari as Tival - The male house human is one of the escapees in the group with humans and apes.Luke Eberl as Birn - A stubborn teenager, Birn is a brave young man.Evan Dexter Parke as Gunnar - Another escaped male human. He too is brave.Glenn Shadix as Senator Nado - The great senator Nado. He loves his job and his mate!Freda Foh Shen as Bon - The female house human is one of the escapees in the group with humans and apes.Chris Ellis as Lt. General Karl Vasich - Leader of the Oberon.When the magnetic storm caused malfuctions in the ship a video image played on the monitor. Little does he know that what he just saw was himself in the future!Anne Ramsay as Lt. Col. Grace Alexander - She really cared for the modern day apes in the Oberon.Lisa Marie as Nova - Senator Nado's mate. She is very attractive for an ape and she is always worried about her looks.Linda Harrison as Woman in Cart - Could it be possible that this woman was on another planet at another time or in another lifetime? Could it be that she is reincarnated?Charlton Heston as Zaius,Thade's Father - Thade's father is very ill. Before he passes he wants to make sure to tell and show his son the shocking truth about humans.---------------I just like how everything is in the film. The ending may have been rushed and not make sense to others because it really had several endings but Burton could only pick one. In fact you can also tell as great as the music is if you listen closely some of the tracks are alternatives than the released music on the CD. Also a short time before the final release of the film the producers wanted the movie to be more epic than it was and they wanted it to be like or more like Gladiator and back to the music they wanted the composer Danny Elfman to change the music. I thought it was silly for the movie makers to do that and I am glad it came out the way it did even if the ending is sad and is a mistake or an error. I hope you have enjoyed this in-depth look at Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes. Like I said I love the 2001 version!",Planet of the Apes
47,Dr_Coulardeau,Without the zippers and the masks it is funnier,10,1 September 2010,"This version is a remake of an older film that was not exactly one of the best films under the sun. Here Tim Burton manages to give some new life to the main story and to add a punching line that is most surprising.In 2001 Tim Burton played with black holes and he could since the famous 2010 the Space Odyssey had come out some time before, exactly seventeen years before and everyone started knowing that in space we have these black holes of highly concentrated anti-matter that maybe lead to another time or space dimension, if we believe Stephen Hawking and his Brief History of Time published thirteen years earlier. It starts a little bit romantically since a monkey, an ape if you want, is being trained to go in a special space shift into one of these highly tormented and agitated areas to see what is in there. Unluckily he is lost within minutes. So his trainer decides against his own superior officers to follow suit to recuperate the monkey or share his lot.He falls onto a planet that is dominated by apes which enslave humans who are living in some forbidden zone. The description of slavery is just banal in many ways except that we are dealing with apes dominating humans, and of course no matter how intelligent these apes can be or may be they of naturally, like most slave masters, neglect the simple fact that these humans are maybe intelligent. You will not be surprised of course that everyone speaks English, including the apes who must have gone through a lot of mutations since their normal anatomy has never made them able to pronounce more than three vowels and four or five consonants assembled in seven or eight frozen signals. They can't pronounce more sounds and they have never been able in their many hundred thousand years of life as a species and evolution to even come close to the rotation of consonants or vowels that produce series like bat-cat-dat-fat-gat-hat-lat-mat-nat-pat-rat-sat-vat-wat-yat-zat, some of which words do not exist in English but do in other languages and some being spelled differently in English like ""what."" Note with three vowels and five consonants you can produce fifteen consonant-vowel words, fifteen vowel-consonant words and seventy-five consonant-vowel- consonant words. In other words monkeys have the sounds necessary to invent at least 105 words and these monkeys only have seven or eight frozen calls. And in this film they speak fluent English. All the humans do to and they are hundreds on this planet. Where are they coming from?Note the hunt for human slaves looks a lot like the Morlocks against the Eloi in H.G. Wells' Time Machine. But that is all as for this resemblance.The new comer, the astronaut, space man if you prefer, Captain Leo Davidson, gets a human psycho-mechanism working again, resistance, rebellion and escape, and then an all out battle. In the mean time he will have found the space ship that brought all these humans or all these apes, or both on this planet. Why and How is beyond any real explanation. It is a fairy tale after all. And the humans will win when a monkey ghost appears from the vast sky and is at once considered as a god by the apes. Lucky Leo Davidson who is saved since he will leave the monkey with the apes and use its space craft to go back home! Well back home will be a long trip in ten seconds back to Washington DC where he crashes smoothly on the steps of the Lincoln Monument. And there a surprise is waiting for you.Of course Tim Burton could not resist and have two women fall in love with the handsome Leo Davidson, an ape woman and a human woman, and as a normal human male, he leaves both of them behind on the now pacified planet of the apes that has become the planet of the apes and the humans.Gosh it is sweet and honey-sugar-pie-licorice. Luckily the punching line gives some humor, very black somber humor, to this Hollywood-picaresque fable of war and love.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Planet of the Apes
48,Floated2,Bizarre and feels outdated,5,25 April 2019,"Having watching this film for the first time and not having high expectations, one came away from the film having somewhat enjoyed it at parts but yet again this Planet of the Apes feels very much outdated.Not having seen the original film from 1968, but seeing two of the more recent Planet of the Apes films, it is clear that this 2001 version feels very much different in tone, content and is more silly. The visuals are obviously not as great as the more recent films due to technology and even so the story and content isn't as great.Now as a stand alone film, it is watchable and not as bad as some fans and critics are claiming. It could have been better with more humor and more lightheartedness. A lot of the hate for this film seems to stem from the fact that this remake wasn't necessary and that it's a downgrade from the original.Yes this film is strange and the plot doesn't go very far, as the pace is somewhat dragging at times. Much of the plot focus is Mark Wahlberg's character trying to escape from the Apes planet, doing so along with the help of other humans and some other apes.Not much of note left and the very ending was somewhat confusing. Where exactly was he? Did he not go back far enough in time? As a rewatch 11 07 21' opinions remain relatively same. This 2001 version pales far in comparison to the 2010's trilogy of the Planet of the Apes. Although watchable, this film is only decent.

Tim Roth steals the show as the psychotic Thade, Charlton Heston's cameo is still worth the price of admission (a rental?), and the Ape Lincoln ending is STILL funny, after all these years. Carter's makeup, however, DOES look like- as more than one reviewer has put it- the late Michael Jackson. Paul Giamatti is great in a supporting role as a slaver and the late Michael Duncan makes the most impressive gorilla since James Gregory as General Ursus in BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES. The Rick Baker makeup is (of course) the Highlight of the show and underscores the problem I have with cgi (no matter HOW competently executed it might be): cgi removes the ACTOR from the equation. From the beginning, it's been the makeup- and the ACTORS BEHIND THAT MAKEUP- that made these movies worth seeing. (Of course, the philosophy didn't hurt one bit, but most of that was abandoned this time around.) The music was another plus that's often overlooked (at least, the martial music that opens the movie). Humor supplants horror this time around, but it's the overall weakness of the writing that makes this one not quite the classic it should've been.",Planet of the Apes
50,filipemanuelneto,Decent enough to be seen but not to be memorable.,5,20 April 2017,"This film, directed by Tim Burton, is a sci-fi work based on a simple script: an astronaut inadvertently falls on a planet similar to Earth, where humans are subjugated to a dominant monkey race. From there, he tries to organize a resistance and create conditions to return to his ship and travel back to Earth. That is, Burton didn't know how to use his famous creativity to show us something new. This story is almost entirely something we have already seen and read (if we consider the origin of everything, Pierre Boulle's book), dressed in new clothes, more modern or different. The work of the actors is generally acceptable, with Marc Wahlberg standing out with the main role, followed by Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth.

The interesting moments of comparing human to slaves, of discovering a world fit to apes are just outlined. The production is cheap, the image is blurry and the cast is a big disappointment: Wahlberg does his macho type as usual, Warren is totally transparent, Carter begins her boring relationship with Tim. Roth is the only character that makes efforts to act actually like a ape.The end is a good surprise but it's too little, too late and above all it shows an entire movie behind: as some wrote on the board, during the absurd fast return trip of Whalberg, we must understand that Thades uses the second time-pod to get back on earth before Walhberg.

55,funkyfry,Terrible remake of a movie that was only halfway good anyhow,2,29 October 2002,"Absolutely the worst film yet by Burton, who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs.  A miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film.  This is the kind of movie where every time something happens, you'll be sure to hear someone shout out ""he's lost his gun!"" or whatever it is to let everybody know.  Carter is really awful and so is Wahlberg, who can't play this straight and be convincing.  Very nice effects and photography, but poor music in the John Williams mold by Burton's crony Elfman.  Heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch-phrases from the first movie.  Very poor results.If anyone else out there also saw ""Sleepy Hollow"", they will probably have noticed, as I have, the declining quality of Burton's films.  I've heard that this particular project was produced by others and that Burton was brought in as director, in which case his judgement should be questioned. But I think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip; the evidence is there in the films.  In ""Sleepy Hollow"", he couldn't decide what kind of movie he was making, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of british character actors (Chris Lee, etc.) made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film (those are never scary, as horror fans know).  The movie couldn't succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic, and no style had been developed to smooth the two together.  ""Planet of the Apes"" is much the same way, and the result comes off more like ""Total Recall"" or ""Tango and Cash"" than like sci-fi.  He's also fallen into the rut of so many other ""big"" directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience.  Word to Burton, if you're out there -- pick something and do it straight, or use some style to peice it all together (as in ""Mars Attacks"" or ""Beetlejuice"") or you might as well retire, because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going.",Planet of the Apes
56,Anonymous_Maxine,Planet of the Oops!,5,29 July 2001,"I'm not entirely familiar with all of the other Planet of the Apes films, but I don't think there could be anything in any of them that would change my mind about the 2001 version. We start off with an electrical storm in space that results in some serious time travel, just like we saw in Lost In Space, which results in our hero winding up thousands of years in the future and on an unknown planet. Seconds after surviving the crash landing of his pod on this mysterious planet, Leo Davidson (Mark Walhberg) finds himself surrounded by fleeing HUMANS. The first thing I thought was that there are humans and apes on an unknown planet in an unknown galaxy roughly 5000 years in the future, but later we learn (also as seen in Lost In Space) that Leo's ship also passed through that time warp and landed in the same place, leaving the humans to go into submission to the out-of-control apes that were on the ship for experimentation, and the apes themselves were left to evolve and take control, ultimately turning into the hard-nosed apes that ruled the planet when Leo crash landed. That was a mouthful. Pretty creative though, once we are eventually informed as to what the hell is going on. So Leo is stuck on this planet where the roles are basically reversed and exaggerated between humans and apes, and now it is entirely up to Leo to save this planet's version of the human race from the oppression of the apes. Tim Roth delivers a horribly annoying performance as General Thade, the militant leader of the apes who is so filled with hatred for the humans (for reasons never made entirely clear) that he operates just like a machine. He's always grunting and growling and always has his head tilted downward like he's expecting physical confrontation at all times, and his constant guttural tone of voice makes him almost amusing after a while. One of the biggest problems with this movie is that the apes are so well made up, but they also have tremendous intelligence, as is made evident by their strikingly human eyes, and yet they switch back and forth from normal speech to the same screeching and screaming that you hear from the monkeys at the zoo. There is a scene where General Thade is told that the humans crossed the river using the apes' own horses, and he jumps all around the place, screeching and jumping and breaking things, and then he's back on the ground talking like a warrior. It's so hard to take this stuff seriously.Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as Ari, the weirdly attractive ape who is disgruntled with the way that the humans are treated by the apes, and who turns against her own kind to help the humans escape. There is a childish scene at the end of the film where Leo kisses Ari that is sure to get a laugh from any audience, while the stunningly but almost weirdly beautiful Estella Warren provides the human love interest. It's a good thing that they had a human woman in this movie to take romantic interest in Leo, because without her we only have Ari, who is 100% ape but who acts exactly like a human woman while interacting with Leo. For the first half of the film, I was a little nervous about the possibility of a little bestiality happening somewhere in there. So we know that Ari is helping the humans because she is disillusioned with her violent species, but they are also accompanied by another ape - Attar, I think (hey, half the fun was trying to figure out who was underneath all that make-up, right?) - and we never know why he agrees to go along, knowing that he will face severe punishment upon returning, which is one of the movies more simplistic but peeving oversights. It is, however, the ending of the film that ruins it beyond all hope for being saved.
At the beginning of the film, when Leo took off in the pod toward the electrical storm, he was going after the pod of his chimp, with whom all communication had been lost. He gets swept away in the same electrical storm as the chimp got caught in, and winds up on the planet described above. At the end of the film, the chimp comes through right in the middle of the climactic battle between the humans and the apes, and the apes bow down to him as their god. This was actually a pretty clever scene, because he was, in fact, one of the first apes of their civilization, and then Leo trades places with him, leaving him with Ari (and with an obviously broken leg, which we're left to assume turned out okay) and taking the ship back to his own time. And General Thade, I guess, was just left sulking under that console on the ship forever, doomed to live the rest of his life as a loose end in a sub-par sci fi movie. It was bad enough that everything on the ship still worked after thousands of years, now they have to leave stuff everywhere unexplained.So we get back to Earth, Leo survives the entrance through the atmosphere and then miraculously survives another violent crash landing without a scratch, and he finds the Lincoln Monument is an ape (when I saw Lincoln from behind, I jokingly said to myself that it would be an ape. I was disappointed and amused to find that I was right). This could, of course, mean only one thing. Seeing how there was barely an explanation for the English speaking humans and apes on the planet on which most of the film took place, and there was literally none at all given for the apes replacing the humans on Earth, we can only assume that they ran out of money or they are just setting up for a sequel. My money is on the latter. Stay tuned for part 9 (or so).",Planet of the Apes
57,Vartiainen,"Style in spades, weak in story",6,4 April 2016,"Tim Burton's remake of the classic 1968 film of the same name and in many ways the film that shows both his strengths and flaws as a filmmaker. Many have praised its visuals while also condemning its confusing story, weak characters and an ending so baffling and weird that the film would instantly jump a couple of ranks if you left it out.And yeah, there's a lot of truth to that. The visuals are great, which has always been Burton's main forte. The ape costumes are still amazingly beautiful, the set and background designs are innovative and filled with small details. The colours are great, the cinematography is nice and it's an all-around good visual experience. Plus, some of the characters are nice. Mark Wahlberg as the main character is pretty bland, as he usually is, but he's a decent actor in his own way, so I guess we could have had worse. I especially like Helena Bonham Carter as Ari, our proxy for Zira from the original film. Easily the character with the most charisma in the film.But yeah, then the flaws. The story is pretty weak. At times it simply copies the plot of the original film to the nth degree, while at the same time making lame jokes at its expense. And at times it does not do that it veers into directions all its own, none of them making much sense or serving the overall story. The third act, when we learn all the secrets behind the world, is especially weak and will leave you at least somewhat disappointed.And then there's the final twist ending that tries to up the ante from the original film. but with none of its shock value or finesse. It's simply moronic.There is value in this film. If you haven't seen the original film, you'll probably like this one fine. It's not a very clever piece of science fiction, but it's not insultingly stupid either – aside from the ending – and the visuals are good enough to warrant a viewing.",Planet of the Apes
58,FiendishDramaturgy,"Generally Despised, But If You're Not A Fan Of The Old 1960's Originals, This Can Be An Entertaining Two Hours.",7,13 May 2007,"The modern remake has two purposes, A. to modernize the setting, characters, film technologies, etc., and B. to generate interest in the original work it remakes. The latter is used only when the former is weak and they have no idea how to really make the remake a better attempt than the original. This is one of those times.The main problem with this work is not the other the top apes, the shortened story line, the effects, the story itself, or the premise. The problem with this work is that Mark Walberg, though I do like him as an actor, is NOT a lead actor. Sorry Mark, but you're not. Mark Walberg is a great supporting actor, but he does not bear the presence on screen to bolster any movie, unless it is something small and weak enough to make him seem stronger. It's not his acting, it's his presence, or lack thereof.As far as this film goes, he IS the weakest element of what otherwise could have been a successful attempt, but Burton's works seem to deteriorate in the third act, with few exceptions, thereby calling for a strongly-written ending, something completely unexpected, or something totally over the top, in order to strengthen his inability to keep it together. Sleep Hollow is one example of a Burton work which does not fall into that generality, but only barely. A good example would probably be Ed Wood, which was bad enough on its own, and for other reasons.The reinvention of the Planet of the Apes was generally despised by Baby Boomers who loved the original campy, sometimes horrid Apes run, by virtue of fond childhood memories. The idea of combining several of these ""beloved"" works into one movie failed to generate the positive response the studio hoped for, and even served as a catalyst to bring down the work entirely, were it not for the name Tim Burton.As it is, this work went on to almost quadruple its initial budget, but the studios listened for once, and did not continue on with this line. At the base, this whole work was weak, from script to post production work, and in every way in between. So why the 6.8 rating? Because it served well to make younger audiences seek out the originals, and in spite of it all, this work IS entertaining! It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Planet of the Apes

60,freemantle_uk,Not as good as the original,5,27 August 2008,"When the first good comment for a film is great make-up, then you know your in trouble. The Planet of the Apes remake is no where need as good as the original film. It was filmed by Tim Burton, but he really was just a gun-for-hire, a film that was not made with his usual Gothic style.Planet of the Apes is set in 2029, and focuses on Leo (Mark Walberg), a US air force pilot based on a space station. On the station the air force use apes to help do tasks and pilot small pods. A wormhole opens and one of the apes is sent to investigate. When it seems that the chimpanzee was in trouble Leo follows the apes through the wormhole. After going through it Leo crash-lands in a strange jungle and encounters humanized-apes. He is captured with other humans and sold to slavery. Leo is brought by a human-sympathiser, Ari (Helena Botham Carter), and with other humans escape from the city. This leads to them getting chased by the ape army, led by General Thade (Tim Roth).As I say, the make-up by Rick Baker was very good and truly Oscar-worthy. The special-effects were good, and there was some good action scenes. However the film was lackluster and really a by-the-numbers affair. There was a poor script with this film, and the story telling was nothing like the original film. There was nothing deep about this film and just shows apes as evil and humans as good. In the original film humans were neutral and all except Charlton Heston were mute whilst the apes were more of a mixed-bag. The original Planet of the Apes was seen at time as a satire, for example the backwards issue of not teaching the theory of evolution. In this film the idea of religion was decent, but could have been more. The remake was really just a chase movie. The acting for the apes was good and well casted. Helena Botham Carter is always good and Tim Roth loved playing the evil general. Michael Clarke Duncan was also decent in it. However, the human actors were not so well-developed and this film was not Walberg's finest hour. I also didn't like Paul Giamatti as an Oranga-tan slave trader, he was only in the film to add comic relief. The other major problem with this film was the ending. The original had a great ending which everyone should know. This film's ending was sub-par. I did not like how the battle ended and the aftermath of the battle (similar to my opinions to X-Men 3). Everyone has also criticised the plot-twist at the end.I admit, when I was younger I did enjoy the film from an action-adventure viewpoint; but even then I did not like the plot twist. However, this film does have it fans like Mark Kermode and Richard Roeper.One to miss in my opinion.",Planet of the Apes
61,dfranzen70,King Simian's Mines,8,28 November 2001,"In 1968, the world's fascination with outer space was still largely in the science-fiction realm. Sure, we'd put some men in space, but no one had landed on any foreign worlds. We imagined, through the voices of such authors as Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov, interstellar travel and advanced civilizations. But all of that seemed to be part of the distant future in 1968.Here were are 33 years later, and while we haven't traveled to other galaxies or met any other civilizations (advanced or otherwise, Whitley Strieber's experiences notwithstanding), we have put a man on the moon and are hard at work on the international space station. In short, in 33 years we've come a long way, baby.Anyone who has seen the original 1968 Planet of the Apes knows that the ending is a real kicker. I certainly won't give it away here, because there's an entire generation that hasn't seen the movie and most certainly should. Suffice to say that the original is unique, not simply another sci-fi flick.The new one is termed a ""rethinking"" of the original. Tim Burton, who gave us Edward Scissorhands, Batman, PeeWee's Big Adventure, and Sleepy Hollow,is the director here, and the film is full of his stylish touch.Mark Wahlberg is Captain Leo Davidson, an astronaut in 2029 on a small space station that is conduction experiments on chimps. An electrical storm strikes, and a chimp is sent out to survey the cause. When the animal does not return, Davidson launches himself - against his commander's orders - to find him. Next thing he knows, his space pod is crash landing on an unknown planet inhabited by talking, aggressive apes - with humans as slaves.Davidson is captured by the apes along with other humans, but escapes. His plan - get back to where his pod crashed, find his GPS-like device that will allow him to locate his mother ship, and get back home. But it's a long way back to the pod, and he suddenly has thousands of apes after him.Luckily, he has on his side Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), a kindhearted ape who feels empathy toward the humans. Ari, of course, symbolizes animal lovers on Earth; she cannot understand why her fellow apes treat their humans so badly. ""We can learn much from them,"" she claims, but her claims fall on deaf ears. Davidson, with the help of Ari, leads a small band of refugee humans (including the Daena, played by the delicious Estelle Warren) to his pod, where he makes some startling discoveries, none of which will be revealed here. (If you've seen the original and know the surprise ending, the discoveries Davidson makes are as intriguing as that ending.)Hot on the trail of the astronaut and his friends is the evil General Thade (Tim Roth) and his fiercest warrior Colonel Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan). The makeup jobs on all of the apes are astounding, and the actors are completely unrecognizable under their disguises. The general has been told by his ailing father (an uncredited Charlton Heston, who starred in the 1968 original) that humans, in the time before time, humans brought violence to their planet; now that apes dominate, humans must be destroyed.
As with the original, this is a fascinating treatise not only on how we treat  other animals but on how we treat ourselves. Is it truly accurate to say that humans are civilized and the apes are the savages? The film actually makes you think about such things, but it's no philosophical hodge-podge of mumbo-jumbo. It's a exciting, powerful movie, worth watching on just about every level.",Planet of the Apes

63,XweAponX,Planète Des Singes,10,12 May 2014,"Revisiting this film 13 years later makes me wonder why I hated it. I found this in MovieBox on my i-Pad. Loaded it up, fired up AirServer and streamed it into my main Media PC, then I sat back and got absorbed by this story like I never have been.And I actually enjoyed it - I first saw this when it came out, thinking it was a pompous bloated misrepresentation of the original. Mainly I hated Mark ""Stumbling Rock Star"" Wahlberg- But since then I have seen him in a few roles that suited him, especially his character from ""The Departed"".So I think that is what I had to get past, my initial distaste for an actor I didn't know. I don't know why I didn't like him, I just wasn't familiar with him.Compared to other Tim Burton films, this one keeps the Camp level down compared to ""Sleepy Hollow"" or ""Mars Attacks"" - He returns to the Grimness of ""Batman"". Burton approaches this as pure Science Fiction and treats it with more respect than ""Mars Attacks"". In fact, compared to Mars Attacks, this is a serious movie.In 1963 Pierre Boulle, author of ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" wrote a book called ""La Planète Des singes"" aka ""Monkey Planet"", which is told 3rd- person to a kinky space-faring couple who find a manuscript in a bottle floating in space. That story was the basis for the 1968 film and some of the events in the sequels. One of the aspects of Space Travel used in that 1963 novel was the prospect of Time Dilation, in which time moves more rapidly on Earth than it does for Travelers moving at relativistic speeds. This was used heavily in this film as Wahlberg's monkey's pod gets sucked into a Wormhole and the Ship he is on starts seeing transmissions from all times instantaneously. But we see later that it is just not the ""Time Barrier"" that gets crossed, some heavy Alternate Realities are taking place.This 2001 film returns to some of the original aspects of the book, in that respect, it is not as grim an ending as the 1968 version- So the whole surprise ending of the Heston version is missing- However, the ending of this film is based on the ending of the book.As far as the ""Planet of the Apes"" in this film, it looks good, the CGI is great and does not look phony, and Tim Roth is one nasty piece of work. The ""Nova"" character is played by Lisa Marie but not as a Major Character, in fact they made Nova a Chimp in this one. The Hero's Squeeze is played by Estelle Warren, ""Daena"". The Ape Prosthetics are very well made and it is difficult to see Helena Bonham-Carter as a Chimp or Michael Clarke Duncan as an Ape. But Tim Roth's ""Thade"" is a piece of slimy business and perfect casting. Not to mention Charleton Heston's Final Cameo and statement that denounces his own beloved NRA.We have no modern day Rod Serlings to write scripts, but I think this script has given several nods to his work.I think this is one of those films like ""Bringing up Baby"" that is appreciated more and more years after it's release, as Bringing up Baby is considered to be the classic example of slapstick comedy, this film will have a place in the Film Vaults- Visually it is astounding, it's not at all like any of Tim Burton's other work of the time. Maybe this is why it did not go over that well, just like 2001's ""Evolution"" with David Duchovny, which also was not appreciated that year, but today has been picking up fans who realize just how funny it really is.Ultimately, time is the final judge, not box office figures or the ratings of Websites that no longer exist. Nor does it matter that 1,350 bad reviews of this were posted on IMDb, many of those made by one person. As far as this movie goes, it is worth it to go back and revisit. But when it comes to ""Planet of the Apes"" versus ""The Phantom Menace"" I choose BOTH versions of Planet of the Apes. I can find all kinds of good reasons why this is a much better movie than all three Star Wars prequels.",Planet of the Apes
64,Chris_Docker,Nice plastic suits - shame about the rest,4,27 August 2001,"Tim Roth seemed a bit apologetic at the Edinburgh Film Festival premiere of this movie `It's just a bit of fun . . . treat it as a bit of fun' he kept saying. Well Tim, get a family of four together with nowt to do on a Saturday afternoon and it might be a bit of fun. Gather several hundred film addicts together for the surprise movie of the festival and expecting the same reception is a bit much (especially when they could see it at half the price the next day when it went on general release). The costumes are very good: technology and makeup has come a long way since the first cult movie classic of the same name. Unfortunately script seems to have gone backwards. The movie starts promisingly enough with a space station time-slip introduction. But having gone to enormous lengths to create the situation and life-like apes, the whole thing is ruined by resting on awful dialogue and corny 20th century jokes that are guaranteed to avert any suspension of disbelief. These super-intelligent apes toy with humans that they capture and one can't help feeling the filmmaker is toying with the audience too. One is reminded of Director Tim Burton's reputed comment that he only wanted to make movies in order to make money. If he has shown great originality and creativity in recent films to suggest he didn't mean that, this film, on the other hand, simply looks like little more than one narrow filmmaker's dream come true again . . .",Planet of the Apes
65,MaxBorg89,"Lots of style, little less substance...",6,26 January 2006,"The original Planet of the Apes (1968) will always be a landmark in the sci-fi genre (more specifically, the apocalyptic sub-genre). It's an excellent movie, which didn't need a remake, if not to make it more appealing to a new generation of film-lovers. Tim Burton's ""reimagining"" of the movie was interesting on paper, no doubt about that, but it's also the most disappointing film he's done so far.Burton already did sci-fi in 1996, directing the hilarious Mars Attacks!. Now, that movie may have looked like his most un-Burton-like project, but it worked, thanks to the witty script, which perfectly reflected the director's freaky sense of humor, and the terrific cast (Nicholson, DeVito, Natalie Portman, Pierce Brosnan et al). Planet of the Apes, on the other hand, contains the quintessential burtonian theme (outcasts feared by other people), and it's really, really dark compared to the original, but its strength is all in the style: from Rick Baker's utterly realistic make-up to Danny Elfman's ""simian"" score, the movie is perfect, technically speaking. It's the storytelling and acting that aren't always as good as expected.The screenplay, while repeating the same basic idea - human astronaut ends up on another world where intelligent apes have enslaved mankind -, is supposedly more faithful to Pierre Boulle's novel, especially the ending (I won't spoil it, but it's far less shocking than what Charlton Heston saw back in 1968), although it suffers from one detail: much of the original version's charm had to do, among other things, with the fact that humans didn't talk on the Planet, making Heston's presence more intriguing. In Burton's movie, they can talk, which leads to an obvious question: why did no none try to have a reasonable conversation with the apes? Sure, that would have killed the movie right away, but it just feels pointless to introduce this new aspect and not develop it.The other weak element is the acting, particularly the ""humans"": Mark Wahlberg has none of the charisma he had in Boogie Nights, and his co-stars (Kris Kristofferson, Estella Warren) don't impress that much either. It's the monkeys that deserve our attention, most notably Helena Bonham Carter as the human-loving scientist and Tim Roth as evil general Thade (a treat for fans: Charlton Heston plays Roth's daddy). They bring intensity to their characters and Carter in particular succeeds in bringing new life to one of the most loved primates from Franklin J. Schaffner's classic.Overall not a very bad film, but we expected more from the man who gave us the ""new"" versions of Batman and Ichabod Crane.

The ape actors could have been doing voice-overs for animatronics for all the make-up let them emote, which I hadn't felt in the original movie, and Roth's voice really got into the role (he'd turned down the Snapes role in the Harry Potter movie for this?).But sound was the best part of the movie, and it was really loud.

I can't explain it, but there's something so otherworldly and exotic about the production design, makeup and effects, a true storyteller's touch used, resulting in a piece with elements of fantasy and world building brought lushly to the forefront, whereas the newer films just felt somewhat clinical and sterile, going through minimalist motions without any real sense of wonder applied. Oh and another thing: real, tactile makeup on actual human actors, which will win against motion capture/cgi any day. There's also an old world, medieval feel to this planet, as the 'humans being subservient to apes' dynamic has already been in full swing for generations, as opposed to a lengthy origin story that takes up most of the newer trilogy. No build up here, just Marky Mark getting marooned on a distant world dominated by simians, fighting his way through their ranks, sort of falling in love with one (Helena Bonham Carter as a monkey=kinky) and attempting to find a way back to earth. There's various apes of all shapes and sizes at war, the most memorable of which is a sleek, snarling Tim Roth as Thade, a volatile warlord who despises humans. Michael Clarke Duncan towers over everyone as Attar, his cohort and fellow soldier, and seeing already be-jowelled Paul Giamatti as a cumbersome orangutan is priceless. The human faction is led by weathered Kris Kristofferson and his daughter (Estella Warren, quite possibly the most beautiful girl on the planet), leading the dregs of humanity as they exist in hiding and fight for their lives. No expense was spared in filling every frame of this planet with lived-in splendour and atmospheric decoration, from suits of armour and architecture to the overgrown thickets of mountainous vegetation that grow on this world. As for the apes themselves, it's terrific how real they feel. It's the same thing that happened with Lord Of The Rings vs. The Hobbit, and the switch from practical Orc effects to the overblown cgi madness of the goblins in the later films. The human eye is inherently adept at deciphering what is real and what is not, and the effects of the later Ape films with Andy Serkis just felt lifeless and orchestrated, whereas here the makeup prosthetics are organic, authentic and wonderful to look at. Don't even get me started on the ending either, it's completely brilliant and will leaving you in cold isolation as the credits roll, a perfect gut punch to a film that could have easily turned sappy in the eleventh hour. So that's my two cents. Bring on the backlash.",Planet of the Apes
70,JoeKarlosi,Planet of the Apes (2001) *,3,10 March 2013,"Never mind about a ""plot"" for this thing. This film is Tim Burton's ultimate disaster, an abomination of a re-imagining that should never have been made. Burton hasn't got a clue as to what made the original Apes Franchise so appealing and timeless to its legion of loyal supporters. I know that as a lifelong fan I had waited nearly thirty years for Twentieth Century Fox to green light another Apes project, and my hopes were high because I had liked Burton's dark and dreary BATMAN. But - as some behind the scenes footage would prove - Tim just thought of this whole undertaking as a goof and a joke, as he would break out into laughter after yelling ""Cut!"" while trying to maintain a straight face. Indeed, there is an over-use of comedy a-plenty in APES 2001, which appears to take precedence over everything else compelling, and it just made me sick. There are some gag-worthy perfunctory elements from the original 1968 classic tossed in which come off as an obligatory bone to throw fans: idiotic turns of iconic phrases, such as ""Take your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty Human!!"", and even a non-credited (thank God) cameo by Charlton Heston himself in ape makeup as he parodies his own persona with a mighty ""Damn Them All To HELL!!"" yell. The human characters in this version can speak but are completely undeveloped; even Linda Harrison's mute 'Nova' in the first two original APES movies had managed to make her someone we could relate to and care for! Oh, and I forgot about Marky Mark Wahlberg in the part of the lead astronaut who lands on this dopey planet ... the less said about him here, the better.Many people are completely confused by the ending of Burton's picture (so was Burton, if you hear him stammering and trying to make sense of it himself on the DVD commentary). I get it all right myself, but it was just badly realized. Within the whole movie you get the feeling that there is no story attempt, or that maybe a lot of things were edited and then just haphazardly reconstructed. But the main insult is that the core idea behind Planet of the Apes is not supposed to be about laughing at a bunch of silly monkeys in clothes bouncing all over the walls and shrieking and hollering. That misses the entire point of the message behind the series. However, as vomit-able and insulting as Burton's pile of gorilla manure may be, there are a merciful few things which prevent it from being totally unwatchable: For starters, Tim Roth makes a delicious villain as the evil chimpanzee Thade. Paul Giamatti's comical orangutan character Limbo is spirited, but overstays his welcome and would have been tolerable only in very small doses. I must respect Rick Baker's new apes makeups to some extent, even though I don't think they can best John Chamber's original 1960's designs. Whatever compliments I'd give to the makeups are only with respect to the male apes; the females are very badly realized... Helena Bonham Carter's female chimpanzee here is just terrible ... she looks more like Paula Abdul rather than an ape. Fox would fare better with its second stab at a reboot ten years later. But Tim Burton really dropped the ball for this instantly forgettable travesty. Yes, Tim, you did it alright -- you cut out this series' brain, you bloody baboon!!! * out of ****",Planet of the Apes

That said I just sat back and enjoyed the movie,, Mark Wahlberg,, aka,, Marky Mark. plays an astronaut on an American Space Station sent to do some research he has an ape with him,, and then they hit an electromagnetic storm and are sent crashing into a different planet in the future where apes rule the humans,, pretty fascinating concept if you ask me,, anyways, I enjoyed the movie,, mainly because I never seen the original,, so I didn't have time to sit there and judge one versuses the other,, maybe when I do see the original , I will change my mind,, but for now , I 'll stick with this opinion.",Planet of the Apes

Estella Warren and Kris Kristopherson had no business being in this film, as did Markyoops, Mark Wahlberg. The only actors who helped this film were Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter and Michael Duncan Clarke. The story was just far too convoluted in many parts.

Then there's the story and all that which are mediocre at best.The problem here is that this movie has to do the Burton thing and go to the weird and bad places whenever given the chance. Put someone, anyone but Burton here and I legitimately believe this is a vastly improved movie.As it stands, this is background noise. The less you pay attention, the better.

I thought it would give them some perspective and that it would be more accessible for there age group than 'Charlton Heston's' original. I was very disappointed as a result to find that this version changes the storyline so much that it doesn't fit with the newer films at all. Why can't you just leave things alone Mr Burton?In general though, it's not the worst film I've ever seen, but it put one of my nephews to sleep and the other barely looked up from his phone. I think if you take it as it was meant to be, which is a complete re-invention of the story, then you can watch it without any problems. I was just aggravated that I had to explain the original version to the boys so that they could understand how it fits in with the films that they already know. I also then had to explain this one too, based on my IMDB Trivia findings as I had no clue what was going on.Tim Roth probably gives the best performance, whereas the others all play themselves.I don't hate it and I would watch it again in the distant future, but I would hope that I remember that it doesn't fit with the other films.",Planet of the Apes

Mark Wahlberg's pallid turn doesn't help and neither does the PG-13 rating which proves confining",Planet of the Apes
76,davidmvining,"Rushed, shallow, and uninvolving",3,8 September 2020,"It's hard to talk about this movie without touching on its production history. This is a poster child for a studio using a recognizable name to hit a release date. They were going to release this in July of 2001 no matter what, and they rushed everything along. It's possible to deliver a good movie with a constantly changing script like The Great Escape, but it's more of a recipe for a mess. Tim Burton was not given any time to figure out his vision for the film, and he just filmed, at breakneck speed, a script that didn't know what it was or what it was about.Captain Leo Davidson is a pilot on a space station orbiting Saturn who's in charge of ape pilots. When an unusual electro-magnetic storm sweeps by, they send in an ape who promptly gets lost, and then Davidson jumps into a pod without orders to try and find him. He gets hit by stuff and crash lands in a forest on a new planet. Before he can settle, he's swept up in a chase of apes looking to round up humans. By the time Davidson is in a cage, being carted off to Ape City, a grand twenty minutes have passed in the film, and that's the greatest source of the movie's problems. It just simply moves too quickly, covering everything too shallowly, and more concerned with visual spectacle than actual storytelling.On the space station, we get introduced to two humans beyond Davidson, and neither of them matter once he's off the station. On the planet, we get views of about half a dozen humans who are going to tag along with Davidson through the end of the film and they never make any sort of impression. The apes do a better job, though. There's Thade, an ape general and the chief protagonist, and Ari, the human rights loving daughter of a senator. The thing is that this movie feels like their story, but they don't get introduced until the half hour point and they are very much not the focus. Davidson never gets any sort of emotional connection to anything on this planet, insisting on just getting off as soon as possible. So, our main character is a vessel obsessed with a single object and refuses any emotional attachments, while two of our supporting characters have the actual emotional support but are so far pushed into the background that every moment feels like it comes out of nowhere.Davidson escapes, brings along his human companions and Ari, picks up the slave trader, Limbo, who had bought the humans from the military (whose only purpose seems to be picking up humans in forests), and they walk into the Forbidden Area. Meanwhile, Thade visits his father in the one scene that probably exemplifies everything wrong with this movie in microcosm.So, Thade's father is played by Charlton Heston, proving that he's a great actor even under fantastic ape makeup. In this scene, we get introduced to a character who's never been seen before and gets discarded by the end, an object of great value we've never seen before and gets destroyed by the end in what's supposed to be a great dramatic moment, and callbacks to the original movie that end up falling flat. There's no setup to anything that happens in this scene. It all just happens in quick succession, and none of it impacts with any emotion. It's a dead scene that's supposed to be full of meaning and winks to the audience that end up working against it. Much like the rest of the movie.The thing about callbacks is that they are jokey by nature. It's hard to make a callback of something extremely well known work dramatically because we all have the, ""I know that reference,"" reaction that undermines the dramatic import of the moment. So, when Attar looks down at Davidson and says, ""Take your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human,"" the audience is chuckling instead of feeling any kind of fear. When Charlton Heston says, ""Damn them...damn them all to hell!"" we have the same kind of guffaw instead of any other emotion at the death of a character, who we haven't seen before this very scene.I'm not sure when it became de rigueur for pretty much every action/adventure movie of a certain budget to end with a battle scene against two armies, but Planet of the Apes is one of the most ridiculous of them. An army showing up out of nowhere in the minutes before the battle, flying apes with super jump abilities, and the death of side characters with dramatic feel that fall flat is how this whole thing works out. It's bizarre and it betrays the fact that no one understood where the dramatic core of this movie was.There are no ideas at play in this film. It's just a bunch of people running around for two hours without ever giving the audience any time to think about any ideas or characters or even setting.I've avoided talking about the original because this re-imagining of the idea works so poorly on its own that there's really no need for comparison, but I do think that a comparison is justified in order to help explain why the 2001 version fails so badly. Just look at the first half hour of each of them. In the original, we get a very clear idea of who our main character, Taylor, is and what he believes. We get a steady build on the setting of this new world that comes to a shock at the sight of apes riding horses. In the re-imagining, we have a bevy of characters running around talking in inanities that don't matter, special effects, and then an action scene without ever getting to know anything about our main character, Davidson, other than that he loves his ape and wants to get it back. It's thin at its absolute best, and that's not very good.This was Tim Burton's lowest point, but because of studio pressure on the production timeline, it could be excused to a certain extent. However, he went on to make Alice in Wonderland, so we all know that he had further depths to explore. This is a prime example of how not to reboot a moribund franchise. But, the ape makeup is absolutely fantastic, the movie looks pretty good most of the time, and this might be my favorite Danny Elfman score. So, it has that going for it.",Planet of the Apes
77,winner55,"Full of sound, occasional fury, signifying nothing much",1,29 September 2007,"All right, I give up - why was this film ever made?I tolerated Burton's Batman and Chocolate Factory remakes, because he demonstrated real respect for the original materials - the Bob Kane comic book, the novel by Roald Dahl. But this ape film not only undercuts the original (while trying to look oh-so-much-more impressive), it also trivializes the novel by Pierre Boulle.Pierre Boulle's novel was a fable exploring the post-WWII problems of racism, nationalism, war and nuclear war. The world had already danced close to the brink of self-extermination in WWII: if we believe all the reports (and alas, there's no reason to doubt any of them), some 150 million people lost their lives during ten years of one major conflict after another, from the invasion of Manchuria and the Spanish Civil War to VJ day. That was a larger number than that of the population of the US at the time.Military-Industrial Complex profiteers notwithstanding, it became clear to intelligent people across the globe that ethnocentrism was not healthy for children and other living things, and it was a decent person's duty to say so as clearly and decisively as possible. ""Planet of the Apes"" may not be a great classic of literature, but it's no throwaway for a rainy day.To rip the heart and mind out of Boulle's story - well, what is the point? The world doesn't need yet another ""alternate universe"" comic book display of flexing ape muscle and tasteless jokes masquerading as wit. If all this is merely taking place in an ""alternate universe"", just so we can have a peek at a possible ""alternate universe"", then the ""adventure"" is nothing more than the protagonist's daydream.All we can do is shout ""Wake up!"" at protagonist and film-makers alike, and hope never to see such a self-indulgent waste of money on a theater screen again.",Planet of the Apes

The action and story was good.Well, what's wrong with the ending? It's one of the most pathetic excuses to leave open a sequel (AKA: The cliffhanger). Ugh, if only that would be different, I would recommend this good picture. The one liners were cheesy but I didn't mind it. The makeup effects were excellent (you couldn't tell which actors/actresses were which). Some CGI shots were also pretty good.I like Tim Burton's look on the whole world is great. The plot was surprisingly complicated (not like a mind puzzle, though). Mark Whelberg plays one handsome protagonist. Tim Roth plays a surprisingly creepy and angry antagonist and Helena Bonham Carter's performance was really sympathetic. And last but not least, Paul Giamatti gives a great comedic role.I'll say it again: The ending ruined the film. I hated it.

But, after that, the story resorts to Sunday afternoon serial tactics, and throws cerebral thought into the tar pits. A battle scene where bodies are constantly being tossed in the air: come on. The whole battle scene is just a mass of extras shouting, grunting, and slashing each other to bits. But no meaning to why it's being fought, or what the outcome means.Loud stupid, unintentionally campy. The director's paycheck was unearned.

81,Howlin Wolf,Triumph! Why I believe 'Planet of the Re-Makes' IS better than the original 'Planet of the Fakes'... !,7,10 May 2006,"(Original: 3/10. Remake: 7/10.)Firstly, let me warn readers that this will be more of a rant than an even-minded critique; so if balance and objectivity are what you're searching for, you'd be better served by seeking out a positive review of the '68 version... I'm in the mood to make possibly unfair comparisons, and I'll make no attempt to hide that - so if you don't find yourself disgusted with me at this point, then read on...* I watched the original last night; Heston put a black mark on the film for me straight away. He has the sense of authority and presence only of a poor man's Clint Eastwood; and he looks like he would be better suited to working in Infomercials, with his manner of gazing earnestly into the camera and intoning gravely. OK, to be fair; Wahlberg is no better here, but it makes for a more believable crew and surroundings if the 'leading man' has gone AWOL and you don't have someone who carries his reputation before him constantly looking to unduly milk significance from the script. Wahlberg makes a better Everyman, so you see him more 'in character' than when you watch Heston, who typifies a Hollywood landmark.* You don't think of Kubrick and his Odyssey, when you watch this update. The sinister overlords are revealed much more stealthily. Unfortunately, Stanley cornered the market for 'primate roaming barren landscape' imagery just a few months after Schaffner's work opened, and there's no doubt which is the more memorable image in these modern years. Such is life. Burton doesn't even try to approach from such an angle, and it works. I suppose that's one reason I can get aboard the 're-imagination' train, because at least we get a newer look...* There's less 'blithe imperialism' tossed about in our politically correct days. ""Give it a few weeks and you could own this place"", someone mentions to Heston on our first trip. OK, now I as the audience think you DESERVE to be subjugated for your arrogance! All our modern young explorers want to do is repair their mistakes, though; so yep, they're the winners of my sympathy vote. Chalk up another 'moral victory'...* A bigger budget and more 'experimental' supporting cast may mean we get better makeup; but what's much more crucial is the improved interpretation of speech. No more do we have to put up with creatures who intimidate and horrify us with their appearance, but nevertheless all have voices that remind us uncannily of the nearest fishmonger from down the high street. Happily, this time our villains manage to sound unfamiliar and scary, to boot!* The forefather possibly started a flagellation fetish for those would be conquerors of brave new frontiers, further exploited by ""A Man Called Horse"", amongst others... Luckily, Burton opted for uneasy laughs instead; hanging our human friends in cages as an in-joke. It would thankfully be another few years before ""The Passion of The Christ"" caused some squirming in seats and revived masochism as the cinematic trend of the age...If you ask me; it looks like the passage of time does favours for ALL civilisations... !",Planet of the Apes
82,dunmore_ego,Marky Mark's Planet Of The Apes,3,2 September 2003,"Warning: Spoilers Galore!Tim Burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking Psycho - oh, that's right, some idiot already did that - I rest my case.Movie opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation, proving he's not that smart from the outset. Marky Mark appears in shot without his characteristic underpants showing, then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzees.The perfunctory establishing shot of the space station orbiting Saturn for no apparent reason, interior of ship a-bustle with genetic experiments on apes. Must we travel 1,300 million kilometers to Saturn to conduct these experiments? The special effects team decrees it.Marky's chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s sci-fi cinema - the Time Warp. Marky then demonstrates the space station's mind-boggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing, while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deep-space rescue mission into a worm-hole for an expendable test chimp, with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies.Before anyone can say `Pointless Remake' Marky has surfed the worm-hole, crashed on an alien planet, removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest, if it weren't for the kliegs backlighting the plastic trees.Surprise! It's APES doing the chasing - or at least, it *would* have been a surprise if no one saw Planet Of The Apes THIRTY-THREE YEARS AGO.Since Marky Mark did not get to show his pecs, take down his pants, or bust his lame whiteboy rap, he was characterless. Michael Clarke Duncan's gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing *his* lack of character. Helena Bonham-Carter (aka irritating chimp activist), at a loss without a Shakespearean script, did a fine job of outdoing both Marky and Clarke as Most Cardboard Cutout. Paul Giamatti, the orangutan slave trader, secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz. Though I have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie, one review headline captured the essence of this Planet Of The Apes `re-imagining': `The Apes Of Roth'. While everyone else minced about looking like extras from One Million Years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth, as Chimpanzee Thade, chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously. As entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic Thade was, his character lacked a behavioral arc: Thade is mad when we first meet him... and he's pretty much at the same level of mad at film's end. Nice twist.The original POTA (1968) featured a leading character, Charlton Heston's Taylor, who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets - yet as that film progressed, Taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankind's worth - as their sole champion! The original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation, not salvation: when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he is forced to realize that his species had NOT prevailed. Is there anything that cerebral or ironic to Marky Mark's Leo? Or Roth's Thade? No, but there's lots of running.The slogans cry: Take Back The Planet .but it's the APES' planet. In this movie, humans and apes crash-landed here together, the humans having degenerated to cavepeople, allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor; the apes DESERVED to inherit the planet! Along comes Marky Mark, in true anthropocentric arrogance, taking it for granted that humans HAVE to be the apex predators, simply because they're there.  `Taking it back' is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001, complaining, `A planet where men evolved from APES??!!' and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anuses.Heston was cast in the 1968 POTA because he had established his reputation as a maverick: he WAS Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! To cast him as the mute, dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audience's expectations: how crazed must a world be where Our Man Charlton cannot command respect? Marky Mark has currently only established that he has tight underpants.Though Heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council, he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting. When Marky Mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans, it's like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor, who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him. Burton tries to elevate Marky to humanity's icon, but he comes off as a chittering deviant. In the original film, the apes deem Taylor a deviant, yet he was, to audience and apes alike, an icon of humanity. That irony again.It was apt that a man who elevated scene-chewing to an acting technique - Heston - should play the father of this film's primo scene-chewer, Thaddeus Roth. As Roth's ape-dad, Charlton utters his own immortal lines, turned against the HUMANS this time, `Damn them! Damn them all to hell!'The movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end. While Thaddeus is giving Marky an ass-beating lesson, a pod descends from on high with Marky's chimpnaut in it. Apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature, while Marky proves his own hebetude by muttering, `Let's teach these monkeys about evolution.' Firstly, they're not monkeys, you ape! Secondly, it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point, not evolution. And what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy, not evolution.Giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that Estella Warren's half-nekkid role was actually integral to the plot (be still my pants.).No matter that he was humankind's last underpanted hope; in the end, cop apes take Marky away to Plot Point Prison where he was last heard ululating, `It's a madhouse! A MADHOUSE!!...'",Planet of the Apes

Leo finds himself on a new planet inhabited by various types of monkeys, all highly evolved and English speaking, which is a plus But they aren't alone on the planet. The jungles and remote areas around the monkey settlements are rife with humans, some more opinionated monkeys say 'infested'. Almost immediately upon landing on this new planet Leo is captured and bundled in with various other newly nabbed humans to be taken to Monktropolis (not really but it should've been) to be onsold to others.This is where Leo learns of the basic role reversal that this particular 'planet of the apes' experiences. The undisputed rulers of the land are all hairy and like bananas. Depending on their background or upbringing they all deem the humans as potential equals (best case scenario), slaves and house help (middling) or vermin to be exterminated (worst case).The obvious parallels between the current human / animal relationship is constantly and often clumsily highlighted, leading to 127 too many 'tee-hee, they're just like us' moments.After introducing the few main monkey characters including ruthless army leader Colonel Thade (Tim Roth), a slave trading orang-utan played by Paul Giamatti and his human friendly daughter Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), Davidson and a few humans escape from captivity and with Ari in tow head to the badlands, hoping to find answers to questions that needn't be asked.The last hour or so in this uneven two hour monkey-fest descends into a straight up actioner, and not necessarily a good one, the 'twist' ending straight up sucks and is likely the reason that a sequel wasn't even considered, and Burton shows that as a story-teller he does great visuals. Speaking of visuals, the sets are all immaculate and lush, the monkey makeup is for the most part excellent – especially Tim Roth – and the costumes are all well made, the CGI was wisely limited given the limitations of the time and doesn't stand out too much for the wrong reasons.But all the above merely makes Planet of the Apes an immaculately presented, well acted confusing and frustrating effort. After taking so long to ensure that Thade is the bad guy he is never called upon to do much with all his pent up rage and evil, and just why a monkey driven civilisation is such a bad thing is never addressed.After all, lying around scratching yourself and eating is hardly the worst way to go is it? Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. A couple of decent scenes and some creative visuals can't overcome a bland and often lost plot.

When one chimp is lost in a spacepod during an exploration of a magnetic space field, Wahlberg takes off (unauthorized) to find it. When the pod enters the field, Wahlberg loses control as well, soon he crash lands in a jungle. And he is VERY quickly introduced to the dominant species on the planet ;) The story which follows is very tightly directed by Burton, and is very well acted by Wahlberg. Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth are (as usual) excellent and don't let the make up (which is designed by the always outstanding Rick Baker) get in the way of the performances. Finally, as usual, a GREAT score by Danny Elfman.",Planet of the Apes
85,TheUnknown837-1,Every director has his weakest movies....,5,8 July 2006,"and Tim Burton is no exception. Even the greatest of the filmmakers in the world occasionally will make a movie which is just way too flawed to be classified as a good movie. And that's how I feel about Tim Burton's remake of the classic ""Planet of the Apes"". Maybe it's just one of those movies that shouldn't be remade, or maybe Burton just didn't want to make the movie, or something like that. But whatever the case, it wasn't a very pleasing movie.First off, it's just plain boring. The storyline is worked pretty weakly and much of the acting is terrible. True, the apes were portrayed pretty good and the film did have its moments. But still, about sixty or seventy percent of this movie was just dull and full of unnecessary parts and characters.At first, I refused to believe this was a Tim Burton movie, but then again, like I stated earlier, even the greatest of the great in any business make their mistakes here and there.",Planet of the Apes
86,baumer,"Like Instinct, this should be studied for years to come",8,8 August 2001,"Warning! May contain spoilers.What I have always found incredibly funny and yet at the same time downright scary about us as human beings is our ability to be so stupid and so cruel at the same time.  We are the best at cruelty.  As far as I know, we are the only species that hunts for sport and kills for pleasure.  Everything else in the animal kingdom does so for it's very survival.  When lions hunt gazelle, it is to feed their young or to feed themselves.  Even the fearsome and loathed Great White Shark hunts and kills for it's very survival.  But human beings are nothing but charlatan when it comes to our apparent benevolence.  Not all of us of course, but a good majority of us.  Even myself, who I consider to be somewhat of an animal lover, will go out and eat the latest slaughtered cow from the supermarket and I can justify that because in mind, that cow has been killed more humanely than a pig ( which I will not eat, have you ever seen the way a pig is killed at a Portuguese barbecue, well it is even worse when it is killed for mass consumption ). Human beings are not magnanimous in the least.  We take what we desire, not what is necessary.  That makes us gluttonous and that is unacceptable.  But no one does anything about it because we are used to living the way that we do and for some reason, we have laws and human rights for criminals ( including rapists, murderers, child molesters and arsonists).  But we have very little regard for our next meal and how it dies.  Doesn't anyone else out there think it is inhumane to boil a live animal before you eat it? Well?I begin this review of Planet of the Apes with this sanctimonious ""holier than thou"" sermon because I think this film and the writers do think about these things.  Planet of the Apes is a great action film and has some outstanding special effects but the core of the film is one that is perhaps overlooked.  This is a film about man's comeuppance and what would happen if another species could do to us what do to them.  Battlefield Earth, as awful as it was, touched briefly on this subject matter.  Instinct, the under-rated film starring Anthony Hopkins was also critical of man and our abuse of not only this planet but the inhabitants of it.  See also the Matrix and even Free Willy.  Sometimes movies come out and have outlandish theories and sometimes they thrive at the box office.  This is going to be one of those films.  But people do not often advocate change after they see these films.  They makes hundreds of millions of dollars but that is all they do.  They entertain.  But maybe films like this are about more than entertainment.  Maybe there is a message that Burton and company want us to hear.  Maybe what we are watching is not just about entertainment.
Spoilers ahead!!!What was fascinating about this film is that the theory that it subscribes to is that this ape world would not have gotten as bad as it did if it wasn't for human beings.  When captain Leo Davidson ( Mark Wahlberg ) lands on this distant planet, he travels through time hundreds of years.  He is immediately thrust into a chase involving humans and super intelligent and herculian apes.  He is captured and brought to their camp and here he learns that the world has been ruled by the apes for years now.  He can't understand this because not an hour earlier he was on a his ship that used animals to try and figure out complex problems and to basically use them as guinea pigs.  When there is a dangerous mission to embark on, they would send out the monkeys first to see what the danger was.  If the monkey did not survive the ordeal, then their human soldiers would not go.  So this is a great shock to Davidson.  When he asks the humans how the monkeys got like this, they don't understand what he means.  To them, it has always been like this.The apes, lead by Thade and his right hand ape, Colonel Attar, rule with an iron fist and want to rid the planet of the humans.  They enslave them and put them to work.  But there are human rights activists that think the ethical treatment of humans should be advocated by all so for now the humans are allowed to live.  But most of them live on the outskirts of the world, cowered in little huts or caves and living like rats.  There is great detail that goes into reversing the fortunes of man as we are used as pets.  We are chained up at night and kept in cages and it is even a far fetched theory for the apes to believe that we have souls.  Humans are also branded like horses and are forced to wear the mark.  This is a little like Naziism but more like humanism.Aside from all of the politics of the film, it has to be said that it is a treat to watch strictly from an entertainment form.  Burton never lets us down with the action sequences and the team of art directors, costume designers and make-up artists should be nominated for Oscars this year. Rick Baker leads the team of make-up artists and his work here is absolutely incredible.  Actors, and that is plural, meaning hundreds of actors, spent six hours in the make-up chair ever day.  But it pays off as the apes look fantastic.  Michael Clarke Duncan was the most impressive to me.  He transformed wonderously into Attar and even though it is not the kind of performance that you would say is Oscar material, it certainly is fun to watch.  Others that should get mentioned for their work is costume designer Colleen Atwood.  She too should be remembered at Oscar time.  The set decorators, Rosemary Brandenburg and Peter Young, created a wonderfully dark and sinister home for the apes from the ground up.  It is truly remarkable to see the village and realize that it was once nothing but a vision on some scrap piece of paper.Planet of the Apes is an excellent film in all areas.  It is entertaining, action packed, littered with humour and it is a great summer film.  It is actually the perfect pastiche of a summer film.  It has all the ingredients. But to me it is much more.  This is a smart film and it has a little more on it's mind that just talking monkeys.  It would be interesting to see a film like this produce more than just hundreds of millions of dollars for 20th Century Fox.  It would be nice to see someone out there take a film like this and truly re-examine how we are to the species that we depend upon and for our very survival and abuse in the process.  It would be interesting, but impossible.  After all, we are human.8.5 out of 10",Planet of the Apes

We even got twists and turns and when it was over, we felt we got our moneys worth. In this movie of the same subject, they broke the cardinal rule. They made or make the audience have to work out the movie instead of the movie entertaining them. Now there are some movies that risk this and leave you in an okay state from their efforts. However, if the work to be done is too complex, far out, too detailed and involves much explanation, then it wasn't a movie at all but instead a homework assignment. We become the movie and finish the tale to keep ourselves content and to have a sense of closure. There are some good scenes, acting, and high hopes here and there. But when you expect the paying audience to have to explain a movie so they can understand what they just saw? This is not the best approach and you can forget about a comeback experience. In other words, once is enough. If one likes the Planet of the Apes world, the novel it is based on and the stars like Wahlberg, by all means see the movie.

91,mattymatt4ever,"Haven't seen the original, but this is one cool movie",7,14 August 2001,"Not haven't seen the original ""Planet of the Apes,"" I've never been part of the fan club.  I wasn't heavily anticipating this remake, like about ninety-percent of the viewing public.  In fact, I predicted it would suck. For some reason, I'm not a sucker for all these big-budget Hollywood summer blockbusters.  I thought I'd feel the same way about this movie as I did with that borefest ""The Mummy Returns.""  Even action movies can put me to sleep, if flashy special f/x is the only fuel to keep them going.  But as it turns out fifty-percent of the time, the movies I least anticipate are the ones I end up liking quite a bit.  First of all, it's directed by Tim Burton.  I've always been fond of his work (minus ""Mars Attacks"").  Just like most of his movies, he creates a creepy atmosphere that deeply engages you--sometimes on a conscious level, sometimes on a subconscious level.  And also like most of his movies, he adds a nice touch of humor.  Some of the humor's pretty silly and obvious and some it's pretty subtle.  Whatever route he took, it often worked.  The ape costumes are amazingly realistic and the set designs are very impressive.  Also we have the great Danny Elfman who composed a great score to help intensify the creepy atmosphere.The premise is quite nifty.  A planet run by apes, where the apes rule and the humans are enslaved and put to work and even treated as pets.  That I found very interesting.  The premise is handled nicely, and it was amusing--sometimes hilarious--to see apes take on a human persona.  Playing card games, running shops, etc.In the comic relief department, we have Paul Giamatti who takes on the bumbling henchman role.  Just like his enormously impressive debut as Pig Vomit in Howard Stern's ""Private Parts"" he is absolutely hilarious.  Now, my mother saw this movie before me, so she pointed out that Charlton Heston had a cameo appearance.  Watching the film and seeing his name absent in the closing credits, I wasn't sure who he played.  I had a hunch he played Thade's father, and I was right.  The hint that sorta gave it away was when he quotes his famous ""Damn you all to hell"" speech on his deathbed.  I wonder if others caught on that it was Heston in that cameo, because I don't hear much buzz about it.  The story's not topnotch.  This is overall shallow, predictable entertainment, but it works.  I enjoyed it a lot more than expected, though it dragged at points (especially in the third act) and went on a little long.  Tim Roth is great as the villain.  If I didn't check the credits, I wouldn't have known it was him.  He didn't even use his British accent (something he's amazingly good at covering up).  And behind all that makeup, he's almost completely unrecognizable.  Though I haven't seen the original, I'm pretty sure Heston played a much better hero than Mark Wahlberg.  I don't think Wahlberg's a bad actor.  It's just, he's one of those actors who doesn't seem to go the whole nine yards for his craft.  He speaks in a moderately monotone voice, and never seems to have much substance behind his performances (even in his acclaimed role as Dirk Diggler in ""Boogie Nights"").  He's good in this movie, but they could've cast a better lead. Someone with a more commanding presence.  Please keep in mind I didn't see the 1968 version, so I might be a little sweet on this remake.  After seeing this version, I'm more anxious to check out the old version.  I heard a lot of buzz about this movie's ending. Though I didn't think it was a bad way to end things, it was...weird.  A little enigmatic.  Something you might have to ponder for a while.  Though it's nothing as subtle as M. Night Shamalyan's ending for ""The Sixth Sense."" Tim Burton really did an impressive job, this is another score for him. It's good, fun entertainment that doesn't take itself too seriously and leaves sufficient room for comic relief.  So I will recommend this movie, but if you're a die-hard fan of the original--please don't get on my case!My score:  7 (out of 10)",Planet of the Apes
92,hnt_dnl,Tim Burton starts a bad trend!,2,7 February 2012,"When I first saw Tim Burton's 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes, my first thought was of how it was totally different from the classic 1968 original. Other than a smattering of obvious character similarities, the ONLY similarity to that film that this remake has is that apes rule and humans are enslaved. Yet, while the original film's social commentary was enlightening and provocative, this remake's social commentary is done on a much more superficial, generic, flimsy level. It is nothing more than a ""summer action movie"", with no substance to speak of.Burton's basic premise is completely different from the original. Mark Wahlberg stars as astronaut Leo Davidson, who in the year 2029 defies orders and leaves his space station to save his test pilot chimpanzee, whose space pod gets lost in a cosmic storm. Davidson himself gets lost in the storm and ends up on a planet ruled by apes, gets captured, is enslaved, and embarks on a rescue attempt with several humans in order to find a way to get back home. The usually reliable Tim Roth plays General Thade, military leader of the apes and the great Helena Bonham Carter plays Ari, a scientist and ""humanitarian"", who hates the enslavement of humans. Ari joins Davidson in the rescue, which includes humans Karubi (played by the iconic Kris Kristofferson) and Daena (Estella Warren in an extremely bland and annoying performance).I find this remake to overall be very cheesy and one-dimensional. The only character that has any depth is the ape Ari (superbly played by Bonham Carter), faithfully playing homage to Kim Hunter's memorable Zira character from the 1968 movie, while sporting a unique portrayal of her own. Carter is such a great actress that she manages to overcome the flimsy material, but unfortunately, the other lead actors Wahlberg and Roth are failed by a by-the-numbers script. Wahlberg's Davidson isn't remotely compelling and doesn't have the stature of Charlton Heston's iconic astronaut Taylor from the 1968 film, who spoke for ALL humans! Davidson is rather uninspiring and selfish throughout the movie. And Roth's Thade is simply evil without any complexity.The worst character is Warren's Daena. It really doesn't help the film that Davidson is stuck with such a bland, blonde bimbo for the bulk of the it! Daena is obviously SUPPOSED TO BE like Linda Harrison's enchanting, beautiful Nova character from the 1968 movie, but I don't even think Warren is very attractive, much less enchanting. Harrison evoked more feeling and spoke to the viewer through pure emotion and expression than Warren did with TONS of dialog! But the biggest culprit as to why Burton's remake is a failure is that the premise and plot is utterly absurd. I know it's science fiction, but too many things in this movie just don't make any sense, especially the ending, which is ludicrous. Also, the movie has an obligatory, ""summer blockbuster movie"" comedy element that is rather unsettling, as if Burton isn't even taking the film seriously. The dialog is generally silly, including borrowing a famous, powerful line from the 1968 film and turning it into a joke. The ape planet settings looks very cheesy and fake, like a costume drama. The climax is the typical summer action fare.Unfortunately for Burton, this remake was really the beginning of his downfall as a director (discounting Mars Attacks, as he rebounded successfully after that one and I honestly only ever saw that movie once, recalling it so bad that I vowed never to watch it again!), as virtually every film he did after and including ""Planet of the Apes"" was a remake of a prior classic film, and so far, NONE of them have been well-received or successful. And it all started with this turd!",Planet of the Apes
93,vip_ebriega,It's just not Burton!,5,12 May 2007,"My Take: A few good moments and some fine make-up work, but not Burton's very best movies. Director Tim Burton, so far, has started and continued a promising career as a Hollywood filmmaker. So far, his first films I saw was ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Batman"", both are well-done. Burton continued such masterpieces like the sequel ""Batman Returns"", ""Edward Scissorhands"" and the highly acclaimed ""Ed Wood"". Even his dark comedy ""Mars Attacks"", which proved a little different from his other films, is still a great funny entertainment, which was a little better than the too-serious ""Independence Day"". Besides, when it comes to Burton's different film, it can only be this, a remake of the classic adaptation of Pierre Boulle's classic ""Planet of the Apes"".Just by looking at the results of this film, I'm sure that Burton was out of place here. No matter how brilliant he is as a director, the epic genre is something he's not in to. His films are usually the bizarre, or fairy tale-like films, combined with some dark comedy and satire. ""Planet of the Apes"" has none of those. It's a full-blood epic that revolves around man battling a more intelligent species that they weren't aware that will out-evolve them. In other words, the plot for ""Planet of the Apes"" is darn serious. Burton, most usually don't take everything seriously, and likes to look at the weird side. Since this film has no room for any of those, it's easy to see a failure. The make-up effects by Rick Baker are truly superb, giving each Ape character its own different look and personality. I guess that more than makes up for the films blander human characters, say Mark Wahlberg as a bland, often unconvincing action hero. Certainly, Tim Roth as the overreacting human-hating ape Thade, Helen Bonham Carter's human-loving ape Ari and many of the other simian co-stars steal the show, providing some terrific performances while under that heavy does of make-up. It ain't Burton at his definitive best, and PLANET OF THE APES certainly doesn't end being the summer's biggest blockbuster (even JURASSIC PARK III has more to offer than this). An intriguing yet misguided disappointment. Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",Planet of the Apes
94,jhclues,Tim Burton and the Apes,6,4 August 2001,"After the original film of the same title and it's numerous sequels, you have to ask the question, did the world really need another version?  Even with the advancements in technology and special effects since Charlton Heston first landed on the planet, it's kind of like an aging actor getting yet another face-lift; it looks good but it just can't recapture that original beauty, no matter how good the surgeon is.  And `Planet of the Apes' couldn't have had a better man to hold the scalpel, but even director Tim Burton couldn't make this one any more than what it is, an imaginative adventure story that basically just puts a new face on something tried and true.  It looks great, and the atmosphere Burton created fairly crackles; but as a story, we've been there, done that, and even with a slightly different twist at the end, this one simply does not have much to add, with the exception that the apes really look good.  But does being able to showcase make-up and F/X wizards justify resurrecting this one?  I guess the bottom line is, this movie's going to make a killing at the box office. 
	It all begins on a space station where some highly advanced chimps are being trained to go into space and do amazing things.  One of those in charge of these wannabe astronauts is Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), and when his special ward, Pericles, is launched and lost in a huge electrical storm, Leo jumps into a space capsule and takes it upon himself to go where no man has gone before.  He quickly gets swallowed up by the storm himself, and after some exceptionally good visual effects, he not only gets spewed out onto an unknown planet, but he's some four to five hundred years into the future.  He emerges from his landing with nary a scratch, but after barely having enough time to catch his breath or get his bearings, he finds himself caught up in the middle of some kind of hunt, and the prey happens to be humans.  And it's then, of course, that he discovers that something is terribly wrong here.  Apes are the hunters, and they seem to be in charge of everything.  He readily discerns that there doesn't seem to be much percentage in attempting a parley at this juncture, intelligent as the marauding primates appear to be, so he opts for that which is often the better part of valor:  He runs.  And the adventure begins in earnest.	If this movie had to be made (which obviously, it did) at least the right man ended up in the director's chair, because Burton has a way creating a look and a mood that suits this kind of material perfectly, just as he did with `Batman,' `Sleepy Hollow' and `Edward Scissorhands' (just to name a few).  But there just isn't that much story here.  It's an incredible journey, to be sure, but it's just not fresh enough to maintain interest for very long, even as good as it looks and exciting as it gets.  And, whereas the original had something of a message about the miasmatic direction society was headed, about the only message here is the one that can be found in the `Cha-ching!' of the cash register.	As the hero of the tale, Wahlberg comports himself well enough, but in all fairness, this wasn't a role that required much emoting.  Basically, if he could run well and look alternately confused and determined, the part was his.  He did and it was.  And to his credit, he did it very well.  Character development was unnecessary for the purposes of this film, so with Leo, what you see is what you get.  No surprises, and you never really get to know much about who this guy is or what makes him tick-- but it doesn't make any difference.  He's the hero, he cares about his chimp, and that's all you have to know.	Helena Bonham Carter does a terrific job as Ari, the Ape who champions the cause of the humans, in whom she sees a value beyond the level of degradation to which her peers have consigned them.  Of all of those in the cast, she actually manages to do some acting, and she does it exceptionally well, expressing herself much better than what anyone would have the right to expect here, especially taking the cumbersome make-up into consideration. You cannot help, however, getting a sense that this is what it would have been like had Merchant/Ivory made `Gorillas In the Mist.'	As General Thade, the ruthless military leader of the apes, Tim Roth adds a villain to his resume that is quite unlike any he's played before and, like Bonham Carter, actually gives a remarkable and agile performance, all things considered.	The supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Attar), Kris Kristofferson (Karubi), Estella Warren (Daena), Paul Giamatti (providing some comic relief as Limbo, the slave trader),Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Krull) and features a clever cameo by Charlton Heston.  Taken at face value for the action/adventure film it is, `Planet of the Apes' is entertaining, but lacks the substance of the original and may be disappointing to anyone hoping for anything more than a visually engaging foray into a kind of twilight zone of the new millennium.  For what it is, it's well made and delivered; it just seems that the talent involved with this project could have been better served elsewhere.  I rate this one 6/10.",Planet of the Apes
95,phubbs,Planet of the Apes,7,16 November 2014,"Now I will admit I love Tim Burton and most of his work but I too was shocked and fearful of his agreement to take the helm of this sci-fi action flick revamp/re-imagining. Many directors were considered and to be honest I think many of them would have been perfect for the film but Burton does add his usual unique artistic style which can be glimpsed throughout the film in armour design, landscapes sets etc..So straight to the point I actually liked this Burton version of 'Apes' mainly because its a fun romp which is both silly entertaining cheese and has that classic semi serious sci-fi element to it. First up the visuals in the film are tremendously good and really make the film stand out, total kudos to Rick Baker and his team, the man totally nails the ape look for all the characters to a tee. The best clearly being Roth as Thade with a fantastic makeup job, next up must be Duncan in his gorilla makeup but how about Shadix and Giamatti in their orangutan (I think) makeup...amazing!The film wins with the look for sure, not only is the makeup excellent but the sets are nicely worked, location is well suited, the apes costumes and battle gear is well designed and the space sequences also look and work well. All in all its pretty much like a top class Star Trek film...I mean a good Star Trek film by the way.Casting choices were good accept for Wahlberg who wasn't quite right for me. Thankfully we had no Depp to endure here but the use of many solid character actors such as Warner and the imaginative use Tagawa really help lift the film, who could imagine Tagawa as a gorilla.I really enjoyed the film on my second viewing, my first was on release at the cinema, and I believe its because the 'Apes' classic plot can be made many ways and is open to interpretation from different angles, its not a case of it only works one way like a lot of classic films, 'Apes' is a franchise that you can seem to mould and recreate without upsetting the originals. This Burton vision is simple yet highly enjoyable as a fun sci-fi romp, not too heavy, not just copying the original, touch of artistic license and the attempt at a twist ending which was brave but rather illogical, trying to equal the original but failing there I'm afraid. Still the little use of CGI for much of the film is always nice in my book.7/10",Planet of the Apes

Tim Burton assembled most of the key elements for science fiction success; outstanding makeup, good actors, excellent score, himself directing.

I salute the filmmakers for not wanting a total remake of the original (and better) ""Planet of the Apes"", and that they wanted to put a different spin on the story. And they did, changing many key plot points including the ending. But there are serious problems with the script, among them: (1) Humans speak English, but don't have much to say. There's not even a hint as to why they think they're in the position they're in. (2) The movie has a blatant political/social message that is forced-fit in to key dialogues.

A dear friend pointed out for me the low point in writing occurs when Leo (Mark Wahlberg) in an attempt to inspire the humans to battle the attacking apes he says ""Come on guys! We can take them..."" Whoa! Much of ""Planet of the Apes"" is like that. It has the trademark Burton brooding, dark settings-- great attention to detail. Though the story is in-cohesive and uneven. And there is some killer over-acting, particularly by Tim Roth as General Thade. Mark Wahlberg is okay as stranded astronaut, Leo, who wants to go home. Human activist, Helena Bonham Carter as ape Ari, is convincing in a strange ""romantic"" role. Liked Cary-Hiroyki Tagawa as Ari's protector, Krull-- the one really heroic character. All the other characters are forgettable. Even with these weaknesses in writing and acting, ""Planet of the Apes"" is definitely entertaining.

Leo escapes captivity and leads mankind against evil chimpanzee general Thade (Tim Roth) and his army.The moment local humans opened their mouths to speak, I knew this was doomed. Not that a remake should fanatically mimic everything about the original (for example, Van Sant made a carbon copy of Psycho and the result was absurd): I'd argue some departures are necessary, otherwise why bother? But there are changes and changes. Humans being mute and beast-like was the WHOLE POINT OF THE STORY. In this remake they behave like normal human beings - it's as if a kid saw the original and grasped just the basic premise of ""a planet with talking apes"", with the meditation on humanity and religious fanaticism whooshing over his head.Roth, an actor who can play effectively both nice and despicable individuals, is in full villain mode and chews scenery with glee. Helena Bonham-Carter also has fun as Ari. Wahlberg is bland as the insipid Leo; much like Brad Pitt, Wahlberg is a fine character actor whose talent appears to melt whenever he plays a conventional lead. Other cast members don't have much to do, their performances overshadowed by their costumes (and, in case of statuesque former swimmer Estella Warren, by her lack thereof). Make-up by Rick Backer is exceptional, the only real achievement of the movie.The ending is terrible. First, a simian deus-ex-machina (now that's a satisfying climax!). And then, a final twist which does not and will never make *any* sense. What a sad, desperate attempt to find something as shocking as the original's brilliant twist.4/10",Planet of the Apes
101,The_Movie_Cat,Marky Mark and the Monkey Bunch,4,28 February 2002,"I find a lot of movies require a second glance to see exactly what you make of them. Summer blockbusters in particular, with their expansive special effects and distracting explosions; often have to be watched at least twice in order to get a clear view.When I first saw Tim Burton's ""reimagining"" of Planet of the Apes (""Reimagining""? Reimagining it as what? A pile of cack?) I was reasonably dumbstruck by the scale and spectacle as to be uncertain exactly what I thought. I had it pegged down as sort-of average, with the possibility of it either being very good in its own right or a soulless, braindead money-maker. Sadly, seen again, it's the latter. By far.Watching it again on video doesn't help either. When a film is so heavily reliant on the big screen then this says a lot about its content. Without the panoramic views, we're forced to concentrate on plot, dialogue and characterisation. Which is unfortunate as there isn't one, it's rubbish, and there isn't any.There are good points: the opening space scenes are beautifully realised, shot with a cinematic grace, and not just computer generated FX thrown in your face. Also, credit must actually be given to the twist ending, which, while it may seem contrived, does credit the audience with some intelligence (the only part of the movie to do so) and is far more faithful to the source novel than any of the 60s/70s Apes movies. And there's also the scary bit that they ripped off from Jaws.Screenwriter Mark Rosenthal pointed out the redundant subtext of the original by noting ""Today, I think we're living in the famous saying, 'The world will end not with a bang, but with a whimper.'"" However, it's unpleasantly ironic to note that since the release of this movie the prospect of nuclear destruction is again a possibility, and the 1968 picture has once again become as relevant as it ever was. Even without this it took pot shots at racism and famine. Burton's view sees it take on only the novel's Gulliver's Travels-style ape/human reversal, with the odd religious musing and little else. So because it has less to say, it's forced to expand those issues, and basically beat you over the head with them for two hours. Every single line Helena Bonham Carter has is a corny platitude, while I almost heaved my guts at the moment where Wahlberg claims ""sometimes even a few can make a difference"", to the tune of a full-blown orchestra. Yes, the dialogue is the weakest element all right, and while the originals could be a little hammy, this one makes them look like Shakespeare. There's not one exchange approaching a genuine conversation throughout, and the trademark warmth and charm of the original is blown wide apart by a breakneck pace and one-dimensional caricatures. There's no time to react to anything, yet despite the pace, I also found myself looking at my watch several times in boredom.One bit of merchandise I got my hands on was ""Leo's Logbook"", a child-orientated intro to the series with lots of glossy photos. A short affair with just a few words here and there, it lasted less than 30 pages, though told me more about the characters and their backgrounds than the film itself did. Surely that's wrong somehow? In the 1968 film we learn that Charlton Heston's Taylor has both liberal values and is embittered, both within the first five minutes. These contrasting character traits forge three-dimensionality, yet we never get to know or care about Wahlberg's desperately underwritten Leo. Little is known about him from the movie, he's just a bland nobody with a bizarre chimp fetish and nothing else. Maybe it's that he's too young, too ""pop"" to really work in the expected way. Yet look at how we're supposed to believe that Carter's chimp wants a romantic involvement with Wahlberg, and that the Nova replacement is jealous... yet neither of them have exchanged more than a few words with him the whole time. Bonham-Carter (is it just me or does she remind you of Lisa Minelli?) seems ten times more irritating than I remembered, and the sexy but dull Estella Warren fails to make an impact also. I won't even mention the comedy Orang-U-Tang (the ""comedy"" tag a misnomer, of course) or the obligatory irritating brat.What's worse, rather than condemning humanity as the original franchise did, this movie seems to exonerate it. No longer are they the mute ancestors of their own destruction, but  in a very Hollywood decision  the all-speaking, innocent victims of fate. That the apes are reworked as mediaeval, right-wing sadists is also a character-lessening development, and makes Bonham-Carter's role as the sole liberal even more unlikely. Warren heads the batch of human slaves, proving that even in the wild there's still room for lipstick and mascara, if not Imac.And what of Tim Roth? Roth's a good actor, and his performance cannot be faulted. But, sadly, the character is one note throughout. Whether he's holding his dying father's hand or just having dinner, he spends the entire time angry. That's right... he keeps going ape-sh*t! Even when he meets the chimp prophet, he smacks it across some caves. Maybe that's why he's so tense all the time... he needed to spank his monkey! Tee-hee! It's violent, too. I'm not against violence, but this is just ugly, repetitive violence. Violence that only exists because there's nothing else to fill the film. I didn't remember it being so brash before, either: it seems less a coherent story, more one never-ending cacophony of noise.Two quotes from screenwriter Rosenthal, talking to magazine SFX: ""the thing was given its start date and its release date before the director thought he was conceptually there; before the script was ready."" ""the post production on this is probably three times faster than it should have been. I think that making a film at this speeds mean that there is no time for reflection."" Doesn't that say it all? Tim Burton is said to be a huge fan of the Apes movies. Maybe that's why he made this: so that Battle no longer carries the title of worst Planet of the Apes movie. If that's the case then it's a job well done. 4/10.",Planet of the Apes
102,fernandoschiavi,"This version don't offer social, theological and political criticisms but presents interesting differences and fictional alternatives",7,21 November 2020,"This remake is headed by the renowned Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands (1990) Batman (1989), Big Fish (2003), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2004), Alice in Wonderland (2010)) and tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson, that in the near future, participate in space exploration. For farms, monkeys were trained to fly small space capsules recognition not to expose humans in danger and the unknown chimpanzee Pericles ends up being swallowed by a temporal rift in space. To investigate an electromagnetic storm and recover your trained monkey who had not returned to the ship, Leo, opposing his fellow ship enters a small ship and goes to rescue him. But Leo has an accident and ends up landing on a primitive planet and dangerous primates where tyrants and intelligent speakers that form the local, enslave humans who are mistreated and treated like wild animals. Leo ends up being captured as you arrive on the planet along with a group trying to escape, and after the initial shock and disgusted with the way humans are treated, he plans a social revolution on the planet and becomes a threat to primates. Aided by Ari monkey, human rights advocate and a veteran former Army Military ape, deposed by dishonestly fearsome General Thade, a chimpanzee who hates humans and violently defends his extermination of the planet, Leo and a group of humans will try escaping the place.The criticisms made in Pierre Boulle's book and which are on a smaller scale or do not exist in the two adaptations for the cinema are many and well punctuated, such as, for example, the way man treats animals and acts as the owner of the planet Earth and everything in it is criticized with the reversal of roles. And because monkeys are the target of experiments and resemble humans, they explain their choice to stay in our place. The common laboratory tests are also applied by primates, who dissect their brains, observe their behavior in captivity, and do all kinds of tests. Some primates are disgusted by humans by treating them as simple animals. This could certainly be inserted in the films. It would certainly shock the audience in surreal and impressive scenes. Through these same surveys carried out by the apes, the same curiosity that we have to know about life on other planets through research is evident.The organization in society of monkeys is also very similar to that of humans. They are divided into three different varieties: that of the chimpanzees, that of the gorillas and that of the orangutans, where each group has its characteristics and purposes. Even though peace and equality have been decreed between them, the ""differences"" still exist.Another issue addressed is humanization, at least how we treat this issue in the sense of being civilized. The book is approached through some characters on the planet of the monkeys, where one of them resists instincts and struggles to be recognized as being logical and thinking and the other undergoes a curious process of dehumanization. This issue could also be better addressed in the films.In this version of Burton, there were also some adaptations in the script in relation to the book and the original film, starting with the change of names of the characters and the fact that Leo fell alone on the planet and not with his companions. Monkey society and buildings are better developed. Humans can speak, walk dressed and not naked as described in the book for obvious reasons, and are used as servants or pets of monkeys. Firearms were replaced by spears and swords. Not to mention the evolution in the physical part of the monkeys, now they are no longer people with ape heads and start convincing like real monkeys, being differentiated by races and characteristics, chimpanzees are faster, gorillas are heavier and slower etc. . All this thanks to the fantastic special effects and the makeup artist Rick Baker, an incredible professional who is also behind classics like An American Werewolf in London and The Grinch. Unfortunately, the film was wronged at the Oscars and other awards for makeup. Some actors took two to three hours on average to become monkeys. But the result is chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas with human faces.Another different factor in this version is that the monkeys of the 70s were more peaceful and similar to humans in their attitudes as well as in the book. Here, monkeys are extremely agile, violent and scary, that growl all the time and that jump and run in an incredible way, more like the reality of these animals. This caused the monkeys of the 70s to be far surpassed by the monkeys of Burton. Also impressive is the attitude of the new monkeys in the way of walking and expressing their characteristic attitudes. Furthermore, in the book, society seems more advanced and in this version of 2001 with more resources, this can be evidenced better.After problems with the delay in hiring a director for the film, fans of the ape series were reassured by knowing what hands the project would be in. Burton did seem to be an obvious choice after all, despite not being one of the first candidates for the job. He certainly better than anyone would be able to explore the conflict between humans and monkeys well, as well as, as expected, be able to use all his known visual competence in the composition of the work. Burton chose to show apes at a similar evolutionary stage, but a little higher than that of classic films. Of course, with the generous amount released by Fox, Burton and his excellent art direction team have achieved far more impressive results than before. To begin with, the makeup is detailed, organic and much more natural and, at the same time, much more complete than those simian masks that drowned out the voices and features of the actors, although for the end of the 60s and the mid 70, they were extraordinary.Undoubtedly, his vision in creating the planet that gives the work its title is in the best Burton style, having seen in his several fantastic works before and after this project. The settings are grand, with a primitive and rustic texture, a dry climate and above all dark, inviting and intriguing. Most of the scenes take place in the dry ""Zona Proibidia"" where the Oberon space station is found, and in indoor and night scenes, giving a more tense and sinister atmosphere many times. A caveat is that although Burton managed to print his authorial style especially in the graphic motto of the work, it is clear that he ends up being stuck in the not-so-deep script, which accelerated the pace many times in favor of the action scenes rather than in the ideologies and criticisms that were not so explicit.The cast is cohesive and does not at any time compromise the greater realism given to a fiction. Mark Wahlberg as the revolutionary, Tim Roth composing the cruel and ambitious General Thade, Helena Bonham Carter as the rebel Ari, Michael Clarke Duncan as the strong Attar, Paul Giamatti as the comic Limbo, in addition to the participation of Kris Kristofferson as Karubi. paper. Technically, I highlight the soundtrack of the always competent Danny Elfman, Burton's longtime partner, in addition to the impeccable photography by Philippe Rousselot, which deserves applause.Also noteworthy is the scene that pays tribute to Charlton Heston, playing General Thade's father at one point. He saying the last sentence said to General Thade before he died, ""Damn you! May they all be condemned to hell !, it was the same used in the original but when he referred to humanity, as a self-destructive and threatening race after unraveling the mystery of the last scenes. In fact, this scene was marked in the history of cinema, in which the astronaut George Taylor managed to escape from the tyranny of monkeys and fleeing by the shore of a beach in the ""Forbidden Zone"", he ended up finding the ruins of the American ""Statue of Liberty"", discovering he was in reality in the distant future of planet Earth itself, destroyed by the human race in a nuclear war, and which was now dominated by monkeys. In fact, the 68 film is one of the few films in history that deliver the ending already on its poster, although we only notice this at the end of the projection, but for the most attentive, it is a serious mistake of the distributor that seems not to have seen the film before releasing it.The big problem that made the film not become a success as it happened with the first ones, was that the essence of the Planet of the Apes written by Pierre Boulle, from which the film was adapted, was not present during the narrative. The Planet of the Apes of 1968, for example, is faithful to the book and shows itself to be full of intelligent dialogues, which carry social, theological and political criticisms. There is an intellectual dispute, while the 2001 remake bet only on the war between monkeys and men and departs from the true proposal of Boulle's dystopia. Plot Twist is maintained, but it happens in a different way than seen before and it can be interesting even for those who already knew the outcome of the plot, thanks to well-used elements of science fiction. In fact, the final plot twist, without a doubt, does not have the same impact as the 68 film.Overall, Burton delivers a more commercial film, one of the most commercial of his career, bringing more action than the original half-stopped movie. But that does not mean that this posture is all bad. Undoubtedly the franchise has been reinvigorated with new elements and does not deserve the most exalted criticism from some who even abhor this version of 2001. They are different versions and present their variations in language and technology. This can be considered an alternative version with the same argument, with interesting differences and fictional alternatives, leading the audience to reflect and travel on new horizons, all within the most dark and peculiar world of Tim Burton, making this film a great science fiction .",Planet of the Apes

Captain Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) works with chimpanzees teaching them space flight aboard a space station. When they come close to a space storm, they send out the chimp Pericles but he flies off course. Davidson flies out after it, disobeying orders, and is warped further out in space and time. He crash lands in a swamp and abandons his ship as it sinks beneath the water. He quickly encounters other humans who are fleeing an attack by apes. The humanoid chimps and gorillas have amazing jumping abilities and easily catch the humans, throwing them in carts. Leo is shocked to find out that the apes can speak. Using humans as cattle, Leo and the other captives a brought back into the ape city, full of all sorts of astonishing sights. The apes do not treat the humans with respect though Ari (Helen Bonham Carter) scolds the child apes that throw stones at them. The trader orangutan Limbo (Paul Giamatti) purchases the humans and stores them in prisons. The leader Thade (Tim Roth) inspects them with his right-hand man Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan), looking to purchase one for his daughter. As Limbo brands the humans like Daena (Estella Warren), Ari interferes on their behalf and purchase Leo, bringing him home. The apes debate possessing humans at dinner and Thade visits Ari after professing his love, though she spurns him. Leo escapes with Daena who makes him help her father Karubi (Kris Kristofferson) and family. The humans can all talk and Leo organizes an escape with them and Ari, though Karubi sacrifices himself.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Planet of the Apes

Well, when Tim Burton (the genius behind the secrets of the masterpiece THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS) signs on to do a project like PLANET OF THE APES, you just know it's going to be good. The actors are very well cast and everyone fit into their parts perfectally. But, for some very odd reason, most people found this wonderful version to PLANET OF THE APES to be a disappointment. I can't see why, because I enjoyed the film to no end. In my opinion, it couldn't have been made better. This really doesn't seem to me like a project that Tim Burton would sign on to direct, but hey, he did it. And did it well.
Mark Wahlberg is tremendous here, and so are remaining cast members: Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, Helena Bonham Carter, David Warner, Kris Krisstoferson, Chris Ellis and lots more. If you haven't figured it out already, I was entranced by this film.The usual action-adventure will place you in an environment with a highly intelligent creature that will then procede to roam around and kill you off one by one. But, here, Mr. Tim Burton has given us something better. He throws our typical cast of ""survivors"" into an environment where they are being hunted by a species just about as intelligent as they are. It actually almost resembles the apartheid of the 1930s in a way, only it is in reverse. Instead of the whites in control of the blacks, it is the apes (black people) in control of the whites (but in this case, it would be all humans).The story is well-told and is actually more of another sequel than it is a remake, but either way, Tim Burton's visual gem will be a fun to stun people for generations to come.PLANET OF THE APES: 5/5.",Planet of the Apes

I think that a lot of people did not enjoy this film because they tried to compare it to the original 1968 film. In truth, the stories and characters are different. Remaking the original film would not have been a good idea because most people know the ending; this film takes a different approach. The human lands on the planet, and he is taken hostage with some other humans, and together, they learn the history of the planet. In this film, however, the presence of a villain character is an important part of the film. No, this film is not as good as the 1968 one, even though they are different stories, but it is still enjoyable. The script was done well, but it was not as engaging and not as memorable.

111,vostf,Not even a transient craze: Saving Monkey Pericles,4,31 August 2001,"The least you could say about that remake is it's poorly scripted and it lacks of tempo. Did they need Tim Burton to shoot this? The story is flat with no real tension created in line with most of the characters. Mark Wahlberg is a dull paleface astronaut and Tim Roth is great, unfortunately his character is so foreseeable it adds little to an already poor suspense.The beginning is neither creative nor tense and the subsequent chase scene is hardly impressive. Two points that could have been easily improved from the original. Hence the film is never working so as to have you get into it. The novel was a good material to make something different if not better. I do think a human massacre as the one right after the chase described by Pierre Boule would have helped to write a good scene. And seal the audience right in! Unfortunately the lazy penbums focused on how to match the 1968 version's ending so they only read the very end of the book. And they adapted it to issue an ending halfway between the book and the Schaffner film.(spoiler ahead) Halfway is never the right way (sat half-buttocks between two chairs as we say in French) and the Burton ending looks more like a quick way for him to get to an end with such a painful script. Burton reportedly shot 5 different endings (to pack the DVD with some supposedly creative stuff). Eventually they decided to stuck that one. It's all the less clear and eludes the fact that to impress audiences in the end it should at least be easily understood. So it only aims to revive the image of general Thade (as for King Scorpion in the Mummy) for a possible sequel. With the Abe Thade Memorial the explanation lies somewhere in the imagination of some scriptwriting genius.Be right back next season and we'll let you know if Marky Mark is to mary Ari or to go damned with Daena.

There's nothing in this film, that gives out impression, that it has been made by one of the greatest and visual directors of today.

I always did find it very difficult to watch the movie because of that. This Tim Burton's version is far more easier for the ears and basically the plot tries to handle same issues with the original.

114,Movie-12,Tim Burton's worst film to date. His style is missing. ** (out of four).,5,4 August 2001,"PLANET OF THE APES / (2001) ** (out of four)By Blake French:	""Planet of the Apes"" is a $100 million remake that makes its points so many times that we eventually stop caring and begin to lose interest. The film is well made and has a lot of interesting material, but it's been done before, and we don't need five or six examples of grizzly apes abusing humans just to prove the fact that apes treat humans harshly. ""Planet of the Apes"" quickly becomes redundant and outstays its welcome. The production turns into a  tool to impress us with the amazing set pieces and dazzling make up effects. This movie is a waste of the talents of director Tim Burton.
	The year is 2029. An astronaut named Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) lives on a large United States Air Force space station that contains a large selection of apes used for space exploration. One of his beloved apes gets launched into spacebut something goes wrong. He decides to go against the captain's orders and take a ride on a small space pod to rescue the animal and explore the unknown territory himself. Again, something goes wrong.
	What kind of scientist would launch himself into some unknown abyss in space when an experiment just proved the area dangerous? Leo must be suicidal, stupid, or both. Anyway, he finds himself stuck in some kind of time warp that blasts him into the future on a mysterious planet where talking apes control the world and humans live in cages.
He meets several resident humans there, like Karubi (Kris Kristofferson), and his grown daughter Daena (Estella Warren). They are captured by military forces and delivered to a human slave trading ape named Limbo (Paul Giamatti). Leo has a difficult time understanding this world, but luckily, there is an ape who shows compassion towards humans. Her name is Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), and we are not surprised when she offers Leo and his fellow humans a chance to escape from the planet of the apes.
	 Although none of these characters are particularly memorable, one stands out in my mind as an absolute nuisance: General Thade (Tim Roth), the planet's head military leader. He isn't scary, shocking, or disturbing, just really, really unpleasant. Tim Roth, a good actor, goes way over the top with this simple-minded character-to the point where I hated him. Not because he's the villain, but because his screen presence is irksome. It's just an unpleasant performance for an unpleasantly stupid character.
	Something about the time frame doesn't seem right. Let's examine this: Leo jumps into the future, where apes rule the planet. Once on the planet, he discovers his old space crew came to rescue him and crashed. This is where the apes become out of control, and take over the planet. Good insight there. But the crew crash landed on the planet thousands of years earlier, according to a character in the movie. Leo has only been on the planet for days. Hmmmm. Something here just doesn't add up. I guess I am thinking too hard  for a movie that isn't supposed to make you think that much. If you can clear this up for me, please drop me a line. It'll be much appreciated and save many hours of sleep that would otherwise be spent wondering about this. There is something else that bothers me about ""Planet of the Apes."" The make up effects are stunning-so good that I could not tell who the actor was under the ape makeup and costume. So here's my question: why spend millions of dollars on big name actors like Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Helena Bonham Carter when you're going to smoother them in make up beyond recognition? The actor could have been my neighbor for all that I knew. The filmmakers might have liked the voices and energy of the actors, I guess.
I give the movie credit for making us care about the humans. By the end, during an involving and intense war sequence between human and ape-kind, I was definitely rooting for the humans. I also liked the way it reveals the plot. But ""Planet of the Apes"" could have been so much more. Tim Burton's style isn't obvious here, either. He does inject a convincing and masterfully crafted atmosphere, but it doesn't entrance us like ""Batman,"" ""Edward Scissorhands,"" or ""Sleepy Hollow."" It think that's because the movie concentrates so hard on the plot and special effects, it never relaxes and explores such themes as isolation, loneliness, or racism. ""Plant of the Apes""  is a wasted opportunity.",Planet of the Apes
115,Shopaholic35,A visually spectacular action movie.,8,22 February 2014,"Personally I love this movie and cannot understand why so many other people disliked it. I respect the original for what it was but this version directed by Tim Burton is visually spectacular and exceeds expectations.Nobody creates a fanciful world like Burton can and there is no better duo than Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter. The costumes for the apes are incredible with intricate details that look very realistic. The sheer enormity of the sets makes you realise how much energy and passion went into creating this film.I love all the action, and the special effects still seem remarkable even after more than 10 years has past. Sometimes people can't move past the original but if you have never seen the 1968 version then I think you will enjoy this movie. Also it is perfect to watch again now that the new planet of the apes movie series has started to be released.",Planet of the Apes
116,FlickJunkie-2,Apes for dummies,3,25 January 2002,"This film is another of director Tim Burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his `vision' to the screen.  He has done it with `Batman', `Sleepy Hollow' and now this.  This is not a remake.  The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak (and Charleton Heston makes a cameo).  Burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for today's mass viewership.The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time.  During the 1960's America was struggling to redefine its civilization.  It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms.  It was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal.  In that context, POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day.  POTA was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of American society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior.  The dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious.Burton's version is as much a product of today's times as POTA was of the sixties.  This is Apes for Dummies.  It is superficial and jejune, substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance.  The `surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel.  While the ending of the original POTA gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene, Burton's ending simply mocks the audience, taunting, `I know something you don't know, and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.'From a technical perspective, as is always the case with Burton's film, the film is excellent.  The makeup is fantastic and Burton's camerawork is outstanding (though I continue to dislike his dark look).  However, thirty-three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script.The story has been reduced to a monster movie.  The humans band together behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) to fight the monstrous Apes, aided and abetted by a few turncoats (notably Helena Bonham Carter as Ari).  The presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality.The acting is mixed.  Mark Wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role.  Walberg is excellent at playing dark, sullen characters that are tormented but strong.  This part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in Wahlberg's repertoire.  Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable.  She tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character, but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager.Then there is Tim Roth.  His is a virtuoso performance, single-handedly saving the film from total ruin.  Roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent General Thade.  He creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys I can remember in some time.  Additionally, his physical acting is superlative, rendering a chimp-man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists.This film is a great disappointment.  It is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door.  I rated it a 3/10.  From a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a 9/10.  However the story is an insult to the original franchise.  It is simply another attempt by Burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is.  Of course it's true, but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption.",Planet of the Apes
117,redkiwi,Not really worth the wait,6,2 March 2002,"As one of those remakes that has been much hyped, I was looking forward to seeing this.  So when I opened the DVD and started into it, there was anticipation bubbling up.Apart from the costumes, make up and sets, this really was a bit of a let down.Any Tim Burton film is going to be dark, and this is no exception for the first part of the film, but it does brighten up [literally!] towards the end.Interestingly, you have to wonder if he got a cheap deal on Gladiator stuff!There was a definite Roman theme throughout the apes' society, right down to what were basically legions of apes going to war, even carrying flags and insignia.Wahlberg is passable -- although no Heston, of course -- and Bonham Carter is excellent as the compassionate and caring ape.  The cast as a whole is reasonable without achieving a lot.One to catch when it's on the telly, but given the hype this is a bit disappointing.",Planet of the Apes
118,Bogmeister,A New Nightmarish World of Clever Apes,7,11 June 2006,"An energetic, adrenaline-charged and slightly surreal remake of the classic '68 original, still based on author Boulle's novel (oh, someone preferred the term 'reimagined' - as if 'remake' is a dirty word now - too late for such pomposity at this stage). But we can imagine what director Burton's penchant for nightmarish landscapes and dark fairy tales would look like if imposed on the well-known Planet of the Apes storyline. With such preconceptions, it's not at all a surprise what this film ended up becoming - in fact, it's fairly predictable, perhaps its biggest weakness. It's no surprise that many of those crowd shots of soldier apes here resemble the scary monkey-things from ""The Wizard of Oz."" Ironically, the first drawback for this version is its faithful adherence to the novel; the hero astronaut (Marky Mark) in this one really does travel to another planet, where the inhabitants (ruling apes & underdog humans) speak perfect English. The explanation for this bizarro planet and its presumed natives in the final third is not nearly as elegant as the logical one in the classic '68 film. We're asked to go along with the fanciful concepts and not think it out very much - this is fairy tale madness, after all, dressed up as science fiction for the masses. Burton seems to be in conflict with himself here - at once the eclectic stylist at odds with presenting a standard summer popcorn flic for the consumers.Where Burton and some of his actors do succeed is in presenting most of the new ape characters. Roth pretty much steals the movie from everyone as the central villain, Thade. Interestingly, this film was more accurate than the original in that it understood that chimpanzees are the most violence-prone and bad-tempered of the apes in our reality (gorillas are actually more benign). Thade, a super-chimp for lack of a better term, is possessed of power on several levels (physical, social, political) and uses it in displays of ferocious antipathy. Roth so loses himself in the role that, even as I viewed this a 2nd and 3rd time, knowing who it was under that ape make-up, I still could find no traces of him. It's a triumph of make-up FX and stellar method acting. All the actors who play apes in this picture, including Bonham Carter and Clarke Duncan, succeed in dazzling the audience to such a degree that, unfortunately, all the ones playing humans, including the main lead, come off as very bland. The climactic battle between the two armies is exciting and we tense up some more as Thade's villainy appears to near an end. Then everything becomes abruptly copacetic on this weird world and the final (secondary) climax back on Earth still doesn't make sense to me, not after the 3rd time, and probably not when I see it a 4th time. I think Burton's just messing with us.",Planet of the Apes
119,Antagonisten,Weak,3,17 March 2005,"Remakes are a hazardous business. Shown not least by all the completely wasted remakes floating around out there. And it seems remakes are all the rage today, considering how many movies are actually based on previous works. Right now the Asian industry is the one being plagued the worst by this trend.When it comes to unnecessary remakes i would have to rate this 2001 remake of the classic ""Planet of the apes"" as one of the foremost. This version of the movie is not without it's qualities, but in general it's a step down from the original in many ways. The social pathos is more or less completely removed, replaced instead with a focus on action and comedy. While the original movie commented on segregation in society and the arbitrary treatment of certain groups as lower standing, this movie doesn't deal with the themes at all. Of course there is a general discussion going on through the movie, and a tension between liberal and conservative powers, but it never feels like more than window dressing.The qualities here lie mostly in the sure-handed visual style that is director Tim Burtons hallmark. The effects as well as the set designs are top notch, as is the sound and music. The acting leaves a mixed impression. Tim Roth is quite astounding as the evil ape commander Thade, Mark Wahlberg is his usual pale self as the protagonist. The acting from the rest of the cast is decent enough.The qualities of this remake fall tragically short of making up for it's weaknesses. I feel that a remake should always have something new to offer if there is to be a point in remaking a movie in the first place. Not only does this movie have nothing new to offer, it even deducts many of the points of the original. And that makes this one of the most pointless, and even degrading, remakes ever. I rate it 3/10 for the entertainment it still provides despite it's obvious weaknesses as a remake.",Planet of the Apes
120,EmperorNortonII,Evolution of a Classic,7,3 September 2001,"Tim Burton was careful to call his take on ""Planet of the Apes"" a ""re-imagining"" rather than a ""remake.""

But I do expect it to make sense, be engaging, and have a moving plot. And I like car chases and when stuff blows up. And I like science fiction.But even with these factors in my favor, I was very disappointed by Planet of the Apes.The film is poorly acted -- especially the natives, and the world does not seem realistic, so instead of being spooky we don't really get drawn in. Most importantly, I don't like a sub-intellectual film that insults my intelligence. Some of the plot twists just didn't make any sense. The original version had something to say; that all gets lost here.What a disappointment, and the ending was brutally concocted and unsatisfying.Who should see this film:-- Sci-fi film buffs who didn't mind the stupidity inthe remake of ""Lost in Space"", or ""Independence Day""(which admittedly is a lot of people)-- I can't think of anyone elseI regret I can only give ""Planet of the Apes"" an uninspired 5 out of 10.",Planet of the Apes
122,Aylmer,completely uncalled for,2,30 July 2001,"I'm not sure, but I think it would take a million monkeys on a million typewriters a million years to come up with a dumber movie.   This film was an absolute mess and should never have been made in the first place being a remake of a movie that didn't need one!Mark Wahlberg essentially plays the same character he played in THE BIG HIT (a blandly ""nice"" guy in some sort of trance), except this time he's landed on an ape planet in a small spacecraft which can miraculously keep track of what year it is when he goes through wormholes.  Of course he stumbles onto an advanced tribe of apes slightly better made-up than in the original, but at a technology level further back (these ones don't even have guns).  It isn't long before he's walking in Charleton Heston's footsteps in befriending an ape woman and, (sort-of) falling in love with a human woman, and leading a small revolt against the although this time around there isn't even a legitimate reason for him to be doing so.  The entire premise is completely ruined by changing it so that all the humans on the planet can talk and think at pretty much a 20th century level. The original PLANET was based around Charleton Heston trying to prove to the apes that humans were just as smart as they are, but politics and religion alike suppressed the historical truth.  This film has none of this. It's just a dumb action sci-fi movie with little action (most of the violence is off-screen, a la BATTLEFIELD EARTH - an eerily similar sci-fi disaster) and no plot! What semblance of a plot there is is completely ruined by the multitudes of red herrings, plot holes, and a general lack of depth in any area.  Never is the ape society really explored or revealed, nor are any of the characters fleshed out.  We never learn who the other servants are or why they bother tagging along with Wahlberg in the first place.  We never learn how many apes there are or why they have superior technology to humans.  For some unknown reason there are several different species of apes (Gorillas, Orangutans, Chimpanzees) on the planet, yet the ship they all originated from carried ONLY CHIMPANZEES!!   More uncalled for changes: They made the monkey women way too ""pretty"" in this one, not looking any different from normal women except for their hairy hands and big noses (most of them could actually probably pass for humans) and the human women are all in full make-up with manicures and perfect teeth... when the humans are supposedly living in the stone age!  I know it's just a movie, but COME ON!  How dumb do they expect us audience-members to be.This all wouldn't be so bad if the film hadn't resorted to so much useless parody, such as an ape saying ""Get your paws off me you damn dirty HUMAN"" or later when Charleton Heston's ape character says about humans ""Damn them all to hell!""...  my jaw just about literally hit the theater floor for that one.  What were the scriptwriters thinking?  Do they imagine the few of us who remember those lines from the original will be amused at all by this mutilation of the franchise.  I think even BATTLE FOR... was better... at least the ending of that movie made sense!  I'm not going to ruin it for you but the ending really surprised my by how awful it really was... not that I couldn't see it coming miles away but I honestly never imagined the writers would be THAT tacky.I'm usually very forgiving watching bad sci-fi movies, but this one was WAAAY below lowest common denominator...insulting to my intelligence, confusing, AND boring.  It hasn't been since I watched BATTLEFIELD EARTH or STAR WARS EPISODE 1 that I have sat in the theater completely appalled at what I was watching.

Anyway, this reawakening of the ape universe something was left behind...like an amazing, coherent story that grabs every fiber of your being. Sure, it had the obligatory special effects that permeate todays theater world, but it also bears little resemblance to the original for which it was named. Yes, I am essentially a purist so for me if you find an equation that works don't mess with it! At least not much...this version simply did not have any of the magic, the wonder that was in every minute of the 1968 masterpiece. It felt like a pasted together puzzle of several story lines. Chimps are taught to fly souped up space pods for exploration, space storm captures pod with chimp inside, ""handler"" goes frantic and takes another pod to rescue chimp and gets sucked in to a space warp. OK, that's story one. Story two: chimp handler exits space warp and lands hard on ""Earth"", only to run into a Super chimp raiding party hunting humans as pets and workers...OK OK, so that is a sorta direct clone of the original. But the remaining 90% of the film is a third story of the handler being befriended by a ""cute"" female chimp who sympathizes, then she helps him free the oppressed humans. They fight a mini-war with thousands of war apes led by a deranged chimp general, and at the last second we have ""missing chimp"" arrive in his pod and all the warring apes bow down to ""missing chimp"" who just happens to resemble their God ape from antiquity...well, that takes you up to the last five minutes of the flick, which turns into a misguided attempt at irony.

In addition to that, the actors played the apes in realistic costumes. Prior to this movie the costumes were funny, to say the least, and the 2011 prequel used CGI.Personally, this movie was a huge improvement, because the only thing worth mentioning in the old movies has been the scene with Charlton Heston confronted with the Statue of Liberty protruding from the sand.

125,departed07,This is NOT Burton's best film!,5,25 March 2008,"Remakes come in all shapes and sizes. What's the reason for making remakes of the classic movies that fitted well? Some remakes get to show a different side of view like Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear in 1991 where rather than showing a happy family in peril (like in the original 1962 classic), Scorsese shows a dysfunctional family filled with anger and a disease where it made audience applaud for De Niro's character.Tim Burton is known for making movies in a goth emblem from Beetlejuice, Batman Returns (the best of his work), Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands and much more. Now he directs this 1960's classic about how a man from space gets stuck in an island filled with talking and vicious primates. Mark Whalberg is Capt. Leo Davidson who doesn't do much except try to wow women with his boyish good looks where one of his lab chimps goes inside a space rocket and leaves the space station where he goes into another planet. Leo tries to find his pet until he realizes that once he arrives everything is upside down with humans in cages and use for enslavement while primates (Gorillas, monkeys, orangutans, etc.) rule the planet. The leader is General Thade (Tim Roth, who stands out) who wants to abolish all humans from the face of the earth. His henchmen involves the volatile Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan), Limbo (Paul Giamatti) the fool, and sweet Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) who crushes on Captain Leo.If you seen the original movie about how the humans and some of the chimps fight off the bad primates, there's a twist in the ending.

Ive enjoyed many of Burton's other films: Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands were imaginative, beautiful and clever. Sleepy Hollow was gorgeous and had wonderfully creepy moments but the wrap-up of the story was clumsy and rushed. But, THIS, THIS thing he has stitched together is so god awful that I was shocked. First off, yes, he has shot it well, he always will, but the script (HA!) just stunk of guys pitching various ""let's think out of the box"" type ideas that just lay there like some well-intentioned pot-soaked student film. I'm a huge fan of Tim Roth and I felt he was terrible. All he did, over and over and over, was glare up at the camera from under his ""brow"" snarl and do a villianous voice out of a Scooby Doo cartoon. It was so one-note. Wahlberg just played it monotone and flat. I thought he accepted the idea of being in a cage being pulled by other humans while being beaten by talking apes - pretty well. All in a day's work as a chimp-studying space man. And (SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS***********this so called twist ending was like out of a SCTV sketch. I expected it to read Apraham Lincoln for goddsake!) And I know I'm really in the minority on this one - but I kept thinking the make-up wasn't that great. The gorillas were amazing, probably the best of the bunch, but the way they tried to make the chimps look a tad more human with that strange nostril configuration was just bizarre and hokey.

130,chrisbrown6453,"With all of the bungling, protracted, witless summer movie sequels invading theatres, you've gotta wonder when Hollywood's going to stop monkeying around.",9,21 June 2002,"Ah, Planet of the Apes. Sniff it all you want; it smells enough like a case of the remake to fall in line with this summer's sequel monotony, but upon closer inspection, it's clear that this is a chimp of a decidedly different breed.Director Tim Burton reinvents the aesthetic and tonal gestalt of the 1968 classic without ditching the original's thematic underpinnings, creating a world that is both visually fascinating and painstakingly complete.
When Air Force pilot Leo Davidson, (Mark Walberg), leaves his space station in search of a test chimp deployed to survey a magnetic storm, things go awry, leading to a crash-landing on a planet where humans are enslaved by a breed of apes that are uniquely advanced, cognizant and cultured. But their refinement is little more than a thin veneer hiding their aggressive animal drives, which can lead them to the brutal treatment of their captured humans. Leo, who isn't acclimated to the Apes' tyranny, revolts against them and becomes a heroic figure and leader to the enslaved humans who know little else than the servitude and submission they have faced since birth. Helena Bonham Carter (you know, from Fight Club) plays Ari, an ape with compassion towards humans, while Tim Roth brilliantly portrays Thade, a snarling, aggressive (really pretty damn scary) ape general, who wishes to see his planet cured of humans, and his fellow apes cured of their human-derivative tendencies.Under the façade of a fast-paced sci-fi/action blockbuster lays an entirely different animal. On the most primitive level, Apes is gargantuan, pounding its fists with energy and a capacity to amaze that makes this film monumentally entertaining. But like the skillfully crafted latex ape masks through which the actors' subtle, universal, seasoned human facial expressions are transmitted, Apes breathes life of its own beneath the glaze of action. Burton paints a textured portrayal of man's struggle against subjugation, with settings and characters that are unearthly, yet dually dark, gritty and present. The director ditched the early-proposed ideas of digitally animated apes or live apes with computer-generated mouths, enlisting A-list actors instead to give each ape a uniquely human core.Perhaps the real feat here is that Burton was able to make these apes so utterly creepy and animalistic (much more so than their original counterparts) yet still found a way to maintain their human characteristics. Roth and Bonham Carter learned an entire behavioral language for their roles, complete with loping, off-kilter strides and dexterous, long-armed gesticulations. It takes a while to get a grasp of the full complexity of their movements, but once the language is understood, you quickly see how the ape dispositions intensify the actors' capacity for human emotional expression.Other apes include Limbo, a pandering human-slave dealer played by Paul Giamatti, and Attar, Thade's loyal silverback, played by Michael Clarke Duncan (who incidentally, is perhaps the only Ape actor that sounds as though he's using his normal voice). Charleton Heston makes a cameo, donning full ape regalia to play Thade's dying father, and Lisa Marie Pressley appears briefly as a snooty socialite chimp.On the human side, two words: Estella Warren. She says close to nothing (perhaps a throwback to the mute humans in the original, perhaps not). With a character that grows envious of the affection formed between Walberg and Bonham Carter (yes, a man and a chimp) Warren is left to primarily convey her dissatisfaction through looks and body language. And looks plus body are a definite can-do on Warren's checklist. Things seems a little exploitative at times; her garb is close to non-existent, and the camera, perhaps a bit too kind, but Warren certainly helps heighten the degree to which this film is visually fascinating. Unfortunately, it isn't all bananas and cream pie. The Apes script incorporates a few narrative devices that are just too convenient, such as the illogically timed event that causes the wrap-up to the climatic battle scene. Although the majority of dialogue in the film runs smoothly, certain characters (take for instance, the shifty-eyed comic relief, Limbo) are developed in a stagnant and predictable way. Walberg's pre-battle scene speech, despite its relative brevity, is still a little laughable. The re-vamped surprise ending is creatively done, carrying certain light-heartedness to it, but the film leaves things too easily opened ended. However, with a sequel planned 'open-ended' is something that was planned.
Ultimately, Burton's overall design is so meticulous and aesthetically comprehensive and his ape characters, so believable and culturally complete that you can't help but be lured into his stunning visual world, which seems (if not only momentarily) to take precedence over other concerns. You haven't seen anything quite like this. The film may have aped the original, but it stands on its own two feet.",Planet of the Apes
131,blackmamba99971,Loved the movie Hated the actress,10,6 July 2009,"Well what can I say, I love planet of the apes, all except one actress who I could not get used to through the entire movie. And that would be Estella Warren, i cannot pinpoint it but I just thought her character really threw off the whole admiration thing to the main character played by Mark Wahlberg. It looked silly as she did the same thing he did, like jumping in the water when the question was asked, How long can a human hold his breath under water? It seemed to hokey to me. And even though her lines were not that long, even when she spoke it gave no passion, no heated conflict to be aware of. Her role just did not fit the story. Everything else was fabulous, Tim Roth as thade, Paul Giamatti that played the slave trader, which to me was a wonderful addition, for the humorous side to a mad world. And yet Micheal Duncan Clark also gave a great role as Thades general and subordinate. But one other that seemed to throw it off another notch was the irritating kid, who thought he could do everything in the face of danger, yet bungles it up just as badly as he rode the horse. This in itself did not make the stories strength, the strength came from the apes, and that to me is the story. Estella to me just wasn't the right one picked for her character, she was too flimsy... and too blank to be believed. And as for the runt, I couldn't see it he just did not look the type to play a would be hero. Yet besides these flaws i still thought the movie was a great adaptation to the novel, especially the features of the apes and mannerisms. Which to me seemed more real than the old seventies version. Fantastic time to watch this again. If only i could stomach the other two.",Planet of the Apes
132,PyrolyticCarbon,"Forget the original and watch with fresh eyes, this is more honest to the novel.",8,13 September 2002,"Not such a bad film as some people have reported, I actually liked it, and I'm also deeply worried about the talk of the many cuts made.Allegedly Tim Burton made it as close to the book as possible, and even included some scenes such as a human-ape love scene. However, this is also one of the main reasons why fans of the original Heston film were upset, `where is the Statue of Liberty scene?' Well, it's not in the book!However, all this aside, and it is a really enjoyable movie. I'm a growing fan of Mark Wahlberg, and he just proves why yet again with his talent shining through. There's a superbly crafted ending here too, and one that I so enjoyed. This was another sticking point for some critics.My advice would be, drop the ideas from the original, and go and see this movie with fresh eyes.",Planet of the Apes

This remake is an obamanation.There's nothing redeeming about this flick.It plainly was made by someone who is collecting a paycheck and doesn't care one bit about the original, near perfect flick.Bad story telling, bad story, bad directing, bad writing.Maybe it made money off the publicity machine but any fan of the original will hate Burton for pretending to be more than a hack director.Please Tim -- retire before you ruin another classic.",Planet of the Apes
134,michaelarmer,A Different Planet of The Apes,8,28 February 2020,"Of course you have to compare this with the original Charlton Heston film, and I think it stands up pretty well, the storyline is a bit different, with the Apes occupying a different planet and not a future Earth, the humans can speak and the end is very different, but apart from that, it more or less runs like the original, there are even a couple of famous quotes copied from the original film, but that was a good point. Near the end, the astronaut chimp that Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) lands on the planet, days after Davidson did, but he was behind the chimp in the shuttles when leaving the spacestation, which did not ring true with the story! and the twist ending was a bit odd, but possible, the odd thing about it was the apes as 70's style over-the-top cops, I assume made intentionally like that.Mark Wahlberg plays it Ok, however he did not look too surprised to discover the apes and the fact that humans populated this new planet in a different time, also his dialogue was a bit quick at times. But apart from that it was good, The others did ok, Helena Bonham Carter was quirky, but the best was Tim Roth as General Thade, you can see he put his all into the character. Charlton Heston and Linda Harrison from the original even had cameos in this.It was made well, the Ape costumes were much better than the originals, hardly surprising. the scenes were good, and photography excellent, as were the special effects.It does not have the style of the original, so that is why I only gave it an 8 rather than 10 for that, but apart from that it is very good, apparently Tim Burton wanted longer time and more control over it, but didn't get it, if he had I think it might have been a lot better.",Planet of the Apes
135,rgcustomer,One of the good remakes,7,29 November 2012,"Many remakes suck, and are worse than the original. This is not one of them.Whether it's the music, the effects, the sets, the costumes and makeup, the story, or even the cast, this film is superior to the original in almost every way. Indeed, there are only two problems I have with the film, and they're familiar problems other people have with it. I just don't think they sink the film. (1) Where did the horses come from? The film should have answered that. (2) The ending is both unnecessary and tough to explain. For me, the film ends when the craft launches back into space.Instead of being a laughable moralization about war, dependent on ridiculously fast human-controlled speeds to get there, this is a more stripped down story about what happens when the descendants of your pets evolve capabilities similar to your own, while you're tossed about by an unknown space phenomenon. It's more watchable, and more believable.That said, while I prefer this over the original, I don't prefer it so much as to give it a different rating. Both films deserve 7/10. They are good, but not great.With the original film, it does share the flaw of failing to understand how evolution works. There is not a single ""direction"" for evolution, and not all species, or offspring within a species, will follow the same path. I do not buy either film's claim that non-human apes all somehow gain the ability to speak English at the same time.",Planet of the Apes
136,dead47548,Underrated doesn't even begin to describe it.,9,26 March 2008,"I think I might be the only person in the world that loves this movie. I found it to be an immensely entertaining, compelling blockbuster with an interesting story. I love the tale of how the apes came into control and how everything is so shocking at first but then warps around on itself in the end; it all relates. The epic battle at the end was very well-done and just plain badass. The makeup for the apes and the art direction were just sensational (as these two aspects always are in Tim Burton's films). The style is pretty un-Burton (there's no Gothic elements or anything like that) but it still immerses the viewer and Danny Elfman's score does a great job of putting us into the world. In blockbusters you're never really looking for great performances, but Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth were both very good. Burton's decision on the ending creates one of the biggest stunners I've ever seen. It's chaotic, confusing and immensely terrifying. Unlike the rest of the world, I love it.",Planet of the Apes
137,charchuk,Visually outstanding but poorly scripted,5,29 June 2006,"While this film is visually far superior to the original from 1968, the plot and characters fall far short, due mostly to a poorly written script and some wooden acting. Burton's style is out in full force on this one, and it works very well for the film, but the plot dives into action when it should be focusing on plot & character development. The first third or so of the movie works very well, homaging the original while retaining its own style. Unfortunately, the story falters and the suspense, horror, and sci-fi thrills - which were built up very well - are sacrificed for the sake of big action scenes. The final battle is a complete mass, topped only by the unbelievable, albeit intriguing, ending. The twist defies logic in all its forms, but it's still cool to see. A disappointment, to be sure. Something tells me this would have worked much better as a sci-fi horror/thriller than an action/adventure.There are some intriguing concepts at play within the film, mostly dealing with the evolution of the apes and their culture. The fact that they all evolved from the monkeys that the humans took with them is quite an ingenious idea, made even more so by the fact that the apes all worship these simple monkeys. A nice jab at our own religious beliefs when Ari states that their story of creation is nothing more than a fairy tale. The ape culture is interesting because of its apparent similarity to, yet stark difference from, our own - seems to suggest that evolution turns out the same regardless of species. A thought, though - if the apes evolved from the monkeys who rebelled against the humans, then where did the humans on the planet come from? Definitely a plot hole. Still, the overall concept is quite good, marred unnecessarily by the poor storyline.Technically, the film is superb. The makeup, costumes, production design, music and special effects are all top-notch and very cool. The apes look, act, and move like real animals, not just humans in monkey suits. The score, especially during the opening credits, is excellent and quite appropriate for the film. The ape village is very Burtonesque, which suits it well. Some of the early scenes are startling in their dark beauty. Most of the cool shots in this movie are in the first half, save the final scene. The second half goes awry with silly battle scenes and lame attempts at character development. Once again, the script is to blame. The acting is all over the place, ranging from scenery-chewing (Roth) to mediocre (Wahlberg) to downright bad (the blond chick). In general, the apes seem to do a much better job than the humans - not sure why Burton felt the need to make the humans talk in this one; the muteness of humanity in the original is one of the contributing factors to its greatness. The only human that should matter in this film is the lead character - the rest of the humans are just animals to the apes, and if they can talk, it ruins the idea. Still, the film looks beautiful.All in all, this was a great disappointment. A director as visually skilled as Burton, a classic film just itching to be remade, and loads of money for effects? It's too bad the script fell far short - this would have been a modern classic. Still, the first half or so is great to just look at, if you ignore the inane plot and annoying characters. The twist, however cool, is nothing more than a sorry attempt to top the original's ending - but it's not happening. Burton should have just stuck to homaging the original ending, rather than trying to beat it. Maybe have Wahlberg encounter an ape Statue of Liberty - that would have been cool. Overall, a beautiful film marred by a poor script.",Planet of the Apes
138,Rammstein-2,Bow your heads!,8,31 July 2001,"(spoiler warning)No matter what can be said about the remaking of classic films, ""Planet of the Apes"" makes for the best of them. This can be attributed to not being very much like the original since only some basic premises and plot lines are the same. And being so lush with fantastic scenery, great makeup and effects, the 2001 edition is much more exciting to watch, despite being a little less concerned with afterthought. Tim Burton is a favorite of mine. His dreamscapes are sometimes a tad lacking in the meaning department, but they are always resplendent with true artistic ambitions. ""Planet of the Apes"" is no exception.One could argue about some of the differences from the first movie of 1968. A major one is making humans able to speak, which can be seen as a weak spot. Though helping Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) considerably, this ""new"" feature makes some of the philosophizing somewhat dimmer - the apes ask themselves whether humans have souls. But would one actually argue that a being that is able to form its own thougts and speak them would not have one? I wonder. On the other hand, since Davidson is responsible for the entire future scenario on this planet of apes, ancient grudges can make the apes selective in their thinking: humans tortured them for so long. Philosophic arguments might not go a long way with them.Humor is an important ingredient in the new ""Planet of the Apes"". While the original is sternly sober and not very witty at all (Heston's grim look is heavy to bear), this one flirts quite handsomely with human characteristics transferred to apes. Very funny and Burton-esque. I also appreciate the careful depiction of the apes movements and behavior. While clearly developed beyond their ancestors, the apes still retain a great deal of ""monkey"" characteristics - growling, aggressiveness and jumping around rather than walking. The original ""Planet of the Apes"" had the monkeys walking around much like ordinary humans, which flattened some of the impact.Still, it is unnecessary to compare them in other respects, since the new one is not really a remake and not really a sequel either. I for one welcome it. It doesn't contain the same degree of commentary on humanity that the 1968 movie did, but that one is not anywhere near as spectacular. A good job. I bow my head to Tim Burton and his crew.",Planet of the Apes
139,room102,Rule the planet,5,16 August 2001,"After all those reviews and comments, I feel that I have to add mine.I'll start with the things I liked:The make-up is fantastic. The always-amazing Rick Baker did an incredible job here and created some truly realistic apes - I'll risk in saying that it's probably the best ape make-up ever made, and - as some people have already mentioned - a lot better than the make-up used in the original series. I especially liked the make-up for Thade (Tim Roth). My least favorite is the make-up for Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), which looks quite different from the rest; I guess Rick wanted her to look ""half-human"" (a similar approach was used for the wolves animatronics in the 1994 ""Wolf""), but for me it was too distracting, as it looked too fake. Actually, she's the ONLY ape who looks fake.In addition to the make-up, costumes (Burton's regular Colleen Atwood) and sets, I realized that what makes the apes especially realistic is their movement and their use of space (jumping all the times, using trees and roots, etc.). This aspect is another credit point for Burton, who always put special attention to the behavior and movement of the characters (Lisa Marie as the Martian Girl in ""Mars Attacks!"" immediately comes to mind) and made the actors go to ""ape school"".Danny Elfman's score is always fantastic and this one is no exception. The use of primitive tools and jungle motives in the main titles is great. It starts quietly, as a simplified and primitive tune and builds up (as usual in Danny's themes) to a march piece of heavy metal instruments, ""like bars closing in"", as one review described it. While the theme reminded me past works such as ""Men in Black"" and ""Dead Presidents"", other cues reminded me of Danny's earlier works such as ""Mars Attacks!"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Batman Returns"" and the ""March of the Dead"" from ""Army of Darkness"". Now that I listen to the soundtrack, the final part of the track titled ""The Return"", which ends the movie, seems to be highly influenced by the work of Bernard Herrmann (Danny's mentor).One thing that I liked about the plot *SPOILER ALERT* is the added explanation for the apes being ""smart"" - the genetic treatment, which is unfortunately ruined totally later on (I think. Depends on how you understand the ending). *END OF SPOILER*Two bits that made the movie entertaining for me were the parts of Limbo, the slave trader (played by the hilarious Paul Giamatti), and the two guest appearances by Glenn Shadix and Lisa Marie (as Senator Nado and Nova) - I wish they had a bigger part in the movie.And now to the things I didn't like:First of all - Estella Warren. From the very first moment she appears on screen, early in the movie, I felt her casting is wrong. Except for putting her as an attraction for the male audience (me amongst them), I saw no reason for using an amazing blonde model, dressed in small rags, for this part. It simply distracts you from the movie and damages its realism. I wanted to see Lisa Marie in this role, just so she could have a bigger part, but this one wouldn't solve the real drawback -Aside for the casting of Estella Warren, the role of Daena (and her entire family, for that matter) seems absolutely redundant - She has almost no interaction with the hero, and seems to exist only to fill the role of the traditional ""blonde girl the hero kisses at the end"" - not to mention that this kiss seems completely out of place, since they had no interaction before that. The same, though on a smaller scale, goes for the rest of her family, which seems to be ""dragging"" along with the hero for no apparent reason.I think the biggest drawback of the movie has to be its script. There are lots of things to say about it, and I'm not sure where to start. Here are several points: The script (especially the last quarter) seems like a big mishmash of bits from the movies in the earlier series; The script has no ""social meaning"" at all - the writers seem to have taken an everyday-life cruel behavior towards animals (and a politically-correct objector) and reverse the roles, without debating any valuable issue; None of the characters seemed to have depth and we get no reason for Ari being so fond of the ugly humans; *MAJOR SPOILERS ALERT* The fact that the apes and humans, who live as primitives without any technology and don't know what a gun is, are not a bit surprised by digital gadgets, spaceships and ""a weapon that blow-up everyone"", in addition to the fact that is made by primitive humans who can't invent anything; The ending that didn't make much sense to me, other than trying to give a shock and a surprise that would be different from the one in the original movie - one which you simply can not top; This in addition to the disappointment in revealing (a minute earlier) that the ""planet of the apes"" is indeed a strange planet and not Earth (which, as I mentioned earlier, destroys the rather good logic that was built up to this point). For a moment I thought the writers were trying to play a trick on us: because we were expecting to hear that the humans destroyed Earth, we instead see that apes have overtaken Earth - so perhaps they are the ones to destroy it? But then, the earlier planet is not Earth; There also seem to be some plot-holes concerning the time traveling, both of the money and the spaceship itself; I also found it highly unbelievably, after the money came down from the skies, that all of the apes, who up until then considered humans to be filthy and primitive, decide in an instant that humans and apes are equal - the only reason for that seemed to be that the writers needed to get to the end of the movie. *END OF SPOILERS*",Planet of the Apes
140,Mort-31,It's hard not to like a Tim-Burton-film,7,13 October 2001,"ATTENTION, SPOILER!Many people told me that «Planet of the Apes» was Tim Burton's worst movie and apart from that much weaker than the original film. So I decided not to see it. Another friend of mine who hadn't seen the movie yet, advised me to watch it in spite of this because `a Tim-Burton-movie is still a Tim-Burton-movie'. I decided to do it, and I found that he was right.It's clear that a remake of such a famous film as `Planet of the Apes' is automatically influenced by commercial thinking. Still, Tim Burton managed his film to represent his weird playfulness just as well as `Beetlejuice' or `Batman'. If you are already fond of Burton-movies, it's hard not to like one of his films, even if it has some flaws: nerve-racking monkey squeals, over-dressed apes and a leading actor who could have been, without difficulties, replaced by anbody else.What the film gives us in the first place, is an answer to the question: What's the result when Tim Burton is instructed to create a remake? First of all, Burton wouldn't be Burton, if he wouldn't refuse to call it a remake from the start; it's a `re-imagining'. On the other hand, Burton knows that almost every viewer of his movie has seen the very first film version starring Charlton Heston (as human), and he knows that a remake doesn't exist without its model and that the two films will not stop being compared. So all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film, e. g. by referencing to quotes. Concerning the story-line, Burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions of the original first, and then driving the whole audience to despair by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with  AND HERE IS THE SPOILER  Leo coming back to earth and finding himself inside a world that seems to have been ruled by apes forever. Now, this is the burtonesque answer to people's expectations they hold because of the astonishing, shocking ending of the first `Planet of the Apes'. An ending, even more unexpected, more astonishing and: completely confusing, because  and here I'm disagreeing with various `Planet of the Apes'-homepages and -platforms  it does not make any sense. There cannot be a meaning to it, or just a so complicated one that it becomes ineffective. Tim Burton is playing his cruel games, he does it with a grin and he does it well. Burton fans will sure like it, others may feel betrayed and complain about some sort of manierism. Well, and I don't think producers will ever ask Burton to direct a remake again",Planet of the Apes

A great director, a cast full of Oscar winner and nominees and extremely well made visuals and make-up, so what when bananas and made this film so bad?For ones it is almost the same with the original, second dialogue that makes me wish to be deaf, third a stiff acting and finally one of the most idiotic ending in film history. I honestly am unable to say anything more .If something is to be said is that this film destroyed the reputation of Tim Burton as a great director and from this point on he is but a shadow of his former glory, many actors reputation was stained by that film and it took them years to come back in to the spotlight. However in all this disaster there is one good thing that came out: A guide of how not to make a remake ,which future directors and studios can uses in order to make good films and I believe that it has help ,if the new trilogy of the Planet of the Apes films is any indication.",Planet of the Apes

It is pretty much a straight forward remake of the 1968 sci-fi classic as opposed to the recent Andy Serkis fronted reboots which takes the premise in a different way. There are pretty good moments including the opening titles which are delightfully scored by Danny Elfman, making us feel we are certainly in Burton's take of this world. Tim Roth is very good as General Thade; a sadistic warrior ape who is frighteningly murderous and untrustworthy. Roth has a lot of fun with the role and does provide the films standout moment towards the end, delving into the scary energy that chimpanzees can have. The classic twist ending is effectively done and a good homage to the original. Paul Giamatti is also pretty good as the comic relief of the film and it's a helluva role! The production was documented as pretty troubled. As soon as Tim was recruited to direct, there was already a release date a year away as the studio were desperate to start the franchise up again. Script rewrites were being done while sets were being made just weeks before shooting began. Under immense studio pressure, the shoot sounded stressful and tight with editing having to take place in conjunction with the shooting. All the while undergoing personal issues, it's no wonder that the film unfortunately doesn't fully stand up on its own. It's no fault of any crew or cast member who do give it their all; it's just circumstance and bad timing culminating in a rushed and churned out Hollywood flick. There's a certain charm however to seeing Rick Baker's ape make-up work which is a nice homage to the original while also embellishing on their more animalistic mannerisms. It also marks the first collaboration with Helena Bonham Carter who has started a family with Burton since and went on to star in all of his films throughout the '00s",Planet of the Apes

Let's get that out of the way right now, so that we may focus on how uninteresting any of the story or characters were.  Mark Wahlberg coasts through this one, with no character to play, other than a very animalistic, primal human (ironic, no?) who only wants to get back home.  Helena Bonham-Carter and Tim Roth have some fun (and give fun performances) playing their parts, but any political commentary is lost as each scene is just an excuse to blow something up, smash set pieces, or set something on fire.As an action movie, it's so-so.  As a clever, thinking-person's film (which is what the original movie was and is), it fails completely.  In 5 years, no one will remember this ""re-do"" ever existed.6/10.

It's an action film, pure and simple. Whatever political comment Shaffner's film had is bleached out of the screenplay (by William Broyles, Jr. who penned `Cast Away', Lawrence Konner and Mark D. Rosenthal); about the only stance the film takes is on the humane treatment of animals and the topic isn't nearly provocative enough in this context. There's a large cast, including Mark Wahlberg (not yet enough of a presence to carry an action lead), Helena Bonham Carter (as stuffy as usual, even in full ape costume), Estella Warren, Paul Giamatti and, as the villain, Tim Roth. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves but their performances are definitely in a minor key. Burton himself seems to have a curious disinterest in the project and none of the passion that infuses `Sleepy Hollow', `Beetlejuice' and even the misbegotten `Mars Attacks!' is evident here.

Tim Burton once again proves just how great and Gothic that he can direct a movie, Burton has the darkest touch of anyone in Hollywood. Being a Bigfoot enthusiast a movie like Planet of the Apes is just a must see for me. This movie is more than just about a human who has to battle an ape for the rights to get along on the planet. Apes are shown and portrayed as being very smart and clever Burton must have done his homework as he well showed in this movie for example apes bury their dead and of course they can't swim, and Bigfoots are the same way!

149,ExpendableMan,"Okay, seriously now, why bother?",3,5 March 2006,"Remaking the original Planet of the Apes was always going to be a big challenge for any director. The 1968 classic was a fantastic sci-fi vision with a bubbling undercurrent packed with issues at the forefront of the era like race-relations and the ever-gnawing fear of nuclear devastation. On top of that, it had a gripping and involving storyline and quite rightly ensured its place in cinema history. However, with Tim Burton attached to this new version you could be easily forgiven for imagining it would be a taut, character-driven new film with much to commend it. After all, it's not like Paul W. Anderson was handed the reigns was it? So it comes as a massive disappointment to say that the 2001 Planet of the Apes is a disaster on every level. The normally reliable Mark Wahlberg is terrible but considering what he was given to work with it'd be unfair to place all the blame on his shoulders. As Captain Leo Davidson he takes on the equivalent to Charlton Heston's lead from the 1968 version but has none of the gritty determination that his predecessor had and spends most of the movie looking utterly bemused, possibly because he's found himself running around a world ruled by apes, possibly because he's been given such a terrible script to work with.The rest of the cast are no revelation either. Tim Roth is an unrestrained monster, but rather than being a credible villain is simply yet another cardboard cut-out Hollywood bad guy whose only separation from cinema's other dastardly Brits is the fact he's done up in a chimpanzee outfit. Burton's squeeze Helena Bonham Carter meanwhile turns in an especially cringe-worthy and highly irritating performance as the daughter of a lead ape senator who helps the humans escape. Funny how it's always family members of incredibly extreme politicians who believe in what's right isn't it? And as she spends most of the film running around talking about how unfair her kind treat the humans, fawning over Mark Wahlberg or screeching wildly, it's very hard to give her any kind of sympathy. Looks like the attempt at making an ape sexy back-fired spectacularly there fellas.It also suffers from Hollywood's tendency to move things along as quickly as possible in case the audience gets bored, for no sooner has Marky-Mark set off on his trek to find a human spacecraft than he's arrived at his destination and is ready to lead a resistance movement. The climax is a huge let down as the ruck between the apes and humans is over within minutes and before you know it, Wahlberg's jetting off into space and returning to Earth for the much talked about ending.Elsewhere, the clichés and general sense of corporate film making abound. Ape suppression of humans means they hit them with sticks and talk like the Uruk Hai from out of Lord of the Rings an awful lot and the script is packed with cringe-worthy tributes to the original (""Get your filthy paws off me you dirty stinking human,"" urrgh). The finished product is nowhere near the film you could imagine Burton making unless you'd seen it and the whole thing feels like an extended episode of a fourth rate science fiction show that takes itself too seriously.

The only reason I ""stuck with it"" through to the end was thinking there had to be some redeeming value. Rrmembering the shocking ending of the original I'd hoped something similar would happen here. But they mucked up even that. Why I expected more from people with so little creativity that they got paid for mimicking (like chimps?) the wardrobe design of '68, too, instead of doing something new.

153,basrutten,Planet of Shallowness,3,27 August 2002,"Thank you Hollywood. Yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap, shallow, effect-heavy and redundant remake. The original ""Planet of the Apes"" was an intelligent and thought-provoking movie with a very clear message. It was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting. This movie, on the other hand, seems to have done away with pretty much ALL the dialogues. Instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie. Dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum, character interaction and development are non-existent and most of the time it's extremely hard to figure out what's going on. Instead, we get a bunch of pointless action scenes, some marginally funny one-liners and some very hollow quasi-intelligent conversations. The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The make-up of the apes is magnificent, and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too. However, this does not distract from the fact that ""Planet of the Apes (2001)"" is a very shallow and simplistic movie, filled with paper-thin characters, stupid dialogue and a nearly non-existent plot. Please Hollywood, stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters.Oh yeah, the ending did not make ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER.

155,fjhuerta-2,Avoid the comparisons. Just enjoy it.,6,5 August 2001,"So many people are angered about this film... it's quite obvious something is going on here.Mainly, the fact that, being a remake, this movie had to stand up to the original one. A huge risk that Tim Burton took, and seemingly, with bad consequences.I was born 6 years after Charlton Heston went bananas on the original. I have *never* seen it. Once it was on TV, and I lost interest after five minutes. Not because it was a bad film, mind you, but because it looked too dated for me to watch, and I was in that terrible phase known as ""adolescence"". It would have been uncool to watch a '68 movie. I will correct this mistake later, when I buy the original ""Apes"".Anyway, I came into the movie theater with only one image of the original movie forever burned in my mind: the epic Statue of Liberty climax. I purposely avoided all reviews of this film, so as not to spoil the fun. And I found myself deeply immersed in another Burton fantasy, where reality is as dark and grim as the lush landscapes that are always depicted in his worlds of madness. He is an expert in depicting outcasts (as in Batman, Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands), and although Mark Wahlberg wasn't as strong as Johnny Depp, Jack Skellington (or even Michael Keaton) as a main character, he was credible enough. Helena Bonham Carter is still incredibly seductive, even under tons of makeup and (gasp!) a beard. The rest of the characters are convincingly depicted, and the makeup excels.Again, not knowing the plot of the original, the only thing I disliked about this movie was that during the first half hour it dragged a bit. I guess that was due to the number of characters that were introduced. Afterwards, the movie turns quite philosophical (at least, IMHO). Was it directed at racism (which, from what I've seen, is still alive in the U.S.)? At animal cruelty? Was it a veiled message that we, as a thinking race, are doomed to remain evil and cruel with each other for all time? Or was Burton only trying to entertain us? (I doubt the last assumption). Whatever it is, this is one of those rare movies that open up a world of possibilities due to the use of metaphors. In a way, very similar to fairy tales, where the main character has to have enough resources to thrive and survive in a hostile environment...*SPOILER AHEAD* *SPOILER AHEAD* *SPOILER AHEAD* ...that is, unless you realize this is a mythic story and not a fairy tale, and that the ending has an amazing twist. One that, if sequels are avoided, could be one of the best endings in *ages*.Mr. Tim Burton, please, DON'T make a sequel, and you will have done a homage to the original series. The ending is just *perfect* as it is.I hope watching the original movie doesn't change my mind about this one.",Planet of the Apes
156,HelloTexas11,no threat to the original,5,12 August 2008,"The latest version of 'Planet of the Apes' is an interesting misfire. It has a lot of ideas, good and bad, and seems unable to distinguish between the two, and ends up emphasizing the bad ones more than the good. In a very broad sense, it follows the general idea of the 1968 film, that of a world where apes rule and mankind is considered inferior, and of a time-travelling astronaut who becomes stranded there. The apes behave quite differently in this film though. They are apparently meant to behave like real apes, aside from the fact that they are more intelligent and can speak. So they growl, screech, roar and leap all over the place when excited. An ape army leader, General Thade (Tim Roth), is particularly savage in his manner; the other ape characters seem generally less so. Mark Wahlberg plays the astronaut, Captain Leo Davidson, who is stranded on the planet. He has one of two reactions to any situation- annoyance or confusion. Or both. His one-note, furrow-browed performance doesn't allow the audience much emotional involvement in his plight. As the female ape who cares, Helena Bonham Carter's character Ari very much recalls Dr. Zira from the earlier movie. Here though her interest in Leo seems much more than a professional or humanitarian one; she obviously has the hots for him but don't worry, nothing along those lines ever happens. Carter gives far and away the most credible and nuanced performance, however her ape make-up is far too 'cute,' and provides a constant distraction. Perhaps the main thing missing from this 'Planet of the Apes' is a hero. Wahlberg is definitely no Charlton Heston and it's apparent the script never intended him to be. In fact, despite a few back-and-forth gags vis-a-vis human/ape behavior and stereotypes, it's hard to know exactly how this film wants us to feel about the planet's society and its treatment of humans. (Probably the funniest line in the movie has to do with getting rid of human 'pets' before they reach puberty- ""Believe me, you don't want a human teenager in your house!"") The huge battle between apes and humans at the end is pointless and unsatisfying, and the tacked-on epilogue is just downright stupid and reeks of desperation to find some kind of clever ending. Rod Serling would not be pleased.",Planet of the Apes
157,rhinocerosfive-1,really stunningly bad,1,4 November 2007,"Unbelievable as it may sound, the actors sound like they're speaking... from behind masks. I mean, some of them were paid millions of dollars to do nothing but talk - you can't recognize them and their faces don't move - yet their voices are muffled and their pronunciation is inhibited. It gets worse - they each move in a different style, as if none of them went to the same monkey school. Thirty years after the first realistic monkeyman prosthetics were developed for A SPACE ODYSSEY comes this incredible failure, featuring makeup as bad as that in the original PLANET and its weak TV-budget sequels, and movement training that so far from helped the actors, they seem neither monkey nor man, but simply fake.And that's just the monkeys. Every set looks like a set. Every costume looks like a costume. Every line of dialog screams, ""Written for a summer picture!"" The lapses in logic, and the errors of taste and judgment, are among the most egregious in film history. And yet this is about as much money as you can spend on a movie. I mean, they really tried.

Tim Roth was terrific (villain of the year?), great special effects, great action, great humour, even some satire.  What else would you want from a summer movie?  Not the best or most logical script in the world, and not a patch on the original movie, but this is not unknown in a remake.  If you believe what you read Hollywood has been trying to make a new ""Planet Of The Apes"" movie for years, and Tim Burton was the man who actually managed it.  For that at least he should be applauded.The ending didn't really make any sense.  Many people have already commented on the ending, and I will not add to the comments here.  What I would say is that I wonder if Tim Burton, who has said that he will not be involved in a sequel, chose this ending as a challenge to whoever will be doing the sequel - and surely there will be a sequel.

One is inclined to be a little more forgiving given that the movie predates the first moon landing of 1969.As for the 2001 effort, it is very poorly constructed.

Ed Wood was his lowest budgeted film and was by far his greatest work. ""Mars Attacks"" and this ""Ape"" movie both had big budgets and were really horrible. Someone needs to tell Hollywood, that when you revisit a classic story, bring something new to the story. Special effects alone is not enough. I believe that Hollywood thought that by just having more elaborate costumes and apes, they would have a better movie, wrong! The story was just paper thin and the script was one of the worst ever. The first hour of this film was just a bunch of campy jokes. I have never seen more uninspired performances. However, to be fair, the actors had nothing to work with. The story is just patched together. Few characters are developed or have any importance. Man, this was a bad film. However, people will consider it a smash hit, because of the box office totals. However, most of the money taken in by this film was in the first week, so the negative word of mouth had not gotten out yet. This film has dropped like a rock since week one. Let's hope that Burton can return to actually telling a story and a weird story at that. That was one thing this film was missing, there was no ""Burton Weirdness"" anywhere.

His right-hand man Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) follows and executes all of Thades orders. Leo escapes with the help of a compassionate ape named Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) and is now a fugitive on the run from the apes. This movie I liked but I don't think was 100% perfect. I thought the make-up was not as good as the originals. The acting was pretty good by my standards. Like all Apes movies, the endings have to twist which this one did.

Of course, it was never going to be as good as the original, the ending to the Charlton Heston classic has to be one of the best endings to a film in movie history. I was satisfied that things were well enough explained throughout this film, for example, the talking humans, and how the apes got to inhabit the planet in the first place. What I couldn't work out was the ending, I wont go into details for those who haven't seen it, but I do feel that because the 1968 classic had such a shocking and thought provoking ending, the writers of this version almost `felt obliged' to try and live up to that and as a result it doesn't really make any sense and tie in with the story you have just followed for the past 2 hours  or maybe it does and I just missed the point!, either way  FAR too confusing! (Although it screams ""sequel!"" - how convenient!!). Wahlberg is okay as astronaut Leo Davidson, while Tim Roth is wickedly good fun as cruel military ape `General Thade'.

167,LuboLarsson,I liked it,4,13 January 2004,"I think there are more than enough plus points in POTA to make it well worth watching. Firstly I think the make-up of the apes and the way they move is outstanding, the whole look of the film is excellent. The music by Danny Elfman is great. Tim Burton does a great job directing the action. I thought all the actors were great, apart from Wahlberg who I find a little wooden, I thought the same about him in The Italian Job but he's not that bad. Tim Roth is the best and makes a great villain, one of his best performances since Rob Roy I feel. I'm actually surprised how many of the IMDB users seem to hate this film, probably because the ending doesn't seem to make sense. I too found the ending baffling but I enjoyed the ride in getting there. I must say It took me a long time to get round to seeing this movie, I eventually picked it up very cheaply in a supermarket and I'm glad I bought it. Sadly I think the overall reaction to this film has killed any chances there were of there being a Planet of the Apes II. Pity because I would have loved to have to seen how they would have tried to explain the ending. Also I must say I enjoyed this Tim Burton film a lot more than some of his others namely Batman Returns and Mars Attacks, I think he delivered a great movie here.

168,troy-manatunga,Worth watching for those who missed out on it,7,9 June 2011,"Despite some unbelievable pod landings, ""Planet of the Apes"" a movie that attracted negative reviews at the time was one that is my personal favorites. A decade later I decided to pop the movie in and give it another go. Yep, I still feel the same! Love the movie, love the makeup and costuming, love the themes discussed and by all means, love the cliff hanger Tim Burton uses in the end. I have all kinds of love for this movie. Seems like Tim Burton had a vision of more movies in the Ape regime; sadly for some of us it just did not see its way through due to the entire mixed acceptance back in 2001. Tim Burton as all you readers are aware is quite unorthodox and eccentric in his directorial choices. For those of you who are not as familiar as some of us, he gave us ""Alice In Wonderland"" , ""Sweeney Todd"", ""Corpse Bride"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" ""Sleepy Hallow"" & ""Edward Scissor Hands"" to name a few. If you are a reader who follows movies not by trailer but by director, 8 out of 10 have watched all of the above. ""Planet of the Apes"" with comparison to Burton's style is quite different. It's a Sci Fi that discuss themes of Animal Cruelty, Humans vs Nature and also if you want to be scoffer who hates this movie, a remake of classic Sci Fi from 1968. I respect classics, however what if I can watch it done slightly better. The costuming and make up is brilliant in comparison to the classic. However my intention is not to compare this with the reputed classic. 5 Stars and a round of applause for the magnificent work put in by the team with the makeup and costuming. For a movie made a decade ago this is brilliant, I have watched movies done in the past 2 years that can't even hold a candle to this effort. There is a lot of emotion that is required to be conveyed, which was a vital element to carry out the emotional wave. Giving the extra advantage of excellent facial movement makes it so realistic, never would I have for a moment felt, it is false and it is just a movie. I was right there in the middle of it all. Thumbs up yet again! As much as I respect Mark Wahlbergs performance, I have to side with Tim Roth on this one. Bold performance! The ferocity, the valor, the true determination to make every human suffer he nailed it all. Tim Roth although under so much of makeup, has his presence; he is just scared to look at. He is the meanest Ape I have seen so far. Helena Bonham Carter, who later marries director Burton in real life, was convincing and also was the vital link that ties human affection and animal cruelty on a broader perspective. Personally though I felt that Carter has so much more potential is capable of contributing more. (But wait! Am I comparing her to who she has become before she became?)We do not realize what it is like to be caged, or to be treated as pets or even as beasts, but seems like there is much to fathom from this, animals feel as much as we do. These are lessons for some of us who beat our pets up, or for those who don't leave a clean bowl of water for your dog every day. Doesn't look too great when the tables are turned does it? Also we humans don't realize that once done, certain things can never be undone (You have to watch the movie till the end to understand this). Wahlberg clearly states in the movie that we humans hurt each other way more than we hurt animals on his home planet? Have you ever stopped to think how true that it is? With such beautiful themes that are very well deeply hidden it disheartens me that this movie never got the place it rightfully still deserves. A decade is a long time, but the copies are still out there. I am pretty certain that most of the younger generations never have seen this one; just like back in 2001 I had never seen the 1968 classic!",Planet of the Apes
169,atzimo,Needed editing,1,13 June 2002,"I am a Tim Burton fan. I respect his work because he dares to leave his imagination free, in an arty yet commercial way. I always enjoyed his movies, but after continuously watching them for many years now (especially since they were released on DVD), I can finally spot their weakness.You see, some annoying feelings come to surface when you watch 'Batman' or 'Sleepy Hollow' for a tenth time. They are boring movies! Or to be fair, the are movies with long, boring scenes. Evidently Tim Burton seems to fear and respect every frame he shoots while editing and this behaviour creates very long dialog scenes, that work against the pacing of the movie.Long dialog scenes that don't provide exposition should be cut in a non-drama movie. Let's face it, Tim Burton has never worked with a 'Taxi Driver' script, so most of the long dialog scenes should be divided among action scenes.Also, the suspense doesn't change much in his movies. 'Sleepy Hollow' runs in the same way from start to finish, so does 'Batman'. I must say that his best work, is his comedies and maybe he should try to transfer the mood of those films to his other work too.'Planet of the Apes' is bad and I'm not talking about the ENDING, which is the best part of the movie. Only a moron would try to analyse what really happened there. Have you noticed that stupid people, always need to lower every situation to their own standards, in order to understand it? Of course this creates even more confusion (to them) and they won't get this ending no matter what, so let's proceed. By the way, true cinema is about expressing emotions and not opinions. If you need to state an opinion, the printed word is the perfect medium for it.The biggest mistake of the movie is this Burton element. 'Planet' needed aggressive editing, in order to become fun and not boring, which is what it is now. Specifically the dinner scene and the escape scene in the village. Burton treated this script like it was 'Godfather', so we watch the apes discuss over dinner about every day and social matters for ten minutes, like we care. They're talking apes! On with the story please! Obviously they wanted to balance the action with some drama scenes, but the writing is very bad. A lot of other scenes are boring too and should be deleted, since they destroy everything. Burton seems to have lost his humor in this movie too, since these long scenes could work if they were funny, but they are merely irritating.Unfortunately the script is quite weak, so even if that editing took place, it wouldn't make a masterpiece out of the story. Mark Wahlberg looks like a little kid in the whole movie, possibly because of Burton. He wanted him to become this anti Charlot Heston, an action hero who's in the movie only for the fun ride. It just doesn't work.On the positive side, Burton shows off his craftsmanship for one more time, providing us with some fairy tale images and an introduction in a space station, which is the most spectacular cinematic work since 'Superman'.'Planet of the Apes' shouldn't be made at all. How can you recreate perfection? What's next, a remake of 'Lawrence of Arabia'? Anyway, for once more Burton made an action movie that doesn't stand the test of repetitive viewings and this is because of his fear for aggressive editing.4/10",Planet of the Apes

Luckily for Wahlberg, a female ape (played by Helena Bonham Carter) has the hots for him (!) and sets him free. With the help of a couple of apes and a band of humans Wahlberg has set loose, they search for his ship that contains a device that can send an S.O.S. to Wahlberg's mother ship. Closing in behind Wahlberg's group is a large, ape army all stirred up to kill Wahlberg and any human who dares defy the dominance of apes.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Planet Of The Apes"" is the final scene, which is a surprise, twist ending. Unfortunately, it doesn't make sense. I suspect idiot, studio executives were to blame, probably counting their chickens before they hatched (or should I say counting their monkeys before they were born), looking for a way to introduce a possible sequel and didn't care that it made no sense.

It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash-landing on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes. The apes treat humans as slaves, but with the help of an ape named Ari, Leo starts a rebellion.The film also stars Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, and Estella Warren Development for a Planet of the Apes remake started as far back as 1988 with Adam Rifkin. His project nearly reached the pre-production stage before being canceled. Terry Hayes's script, titled Return of the Apes, would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, under the direction of Phillip Noyce. Oliver Stone, Don Murphy, and Jane Hamsher were set to produce. Creative differences ensued between Hayes and financier/distributor 20th Century Fox. Chris Columbus, Sam Hamm, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, and the Hughes brothers later became involved.With William Broyles, Jr.'s script, Tim Burton was hired as director, and the film was put into active development. Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal rewrote the script, and filming took place from November 2000 to April 2001. Planet of the Apes was released to mixed reviews, but was a financial success. Much criticism focused on the confusing plot and ending, although Rick Baker's prosthetic makeup designs were praised.The story is a little confusing, but it is easy to look at for me, but for everyone else, a lot of people and critics and also fans of the franchise hates this story and the ending. The ending is just confusing also, but it's easy to overlook these two major flaws.The music by Danny Elfman is just awesome and the song that plays during the end credits titled, ""Rule the Planet Remix"" is awesome, mixed by Paul Oakenfold and composed by Danny Elfman. The rest of the music including the opening theme music is just spectacular and the film does wonders with the music.The visual effects and makeup is just spectacular also, but Rick Baker did the prosthetic make-up effects for the apes and it is a blessing of him. The visuals are a little cheesy, but works for this type of movie.The acting, is just good and bad. The only credit that will be given to is Mark Wahlberg, his performance as the lead was amazing. Helena Bonham Carter, Estella Warren and Michael Clarke Duncan puts on really good performances as well, but they can get way too over-the- top in some of the scenes. Paul Giamatti is hilarious and he does an amazing job. Luke Eberl and Erick Avari is in the film, too, but they're performances were a little confusing. Charlton Heston has a cameo as Thade's dad.

It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash-landing on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes. The apes treat humans as slaves, but with the help of an ape named Ari, Leo starts a rebellion. The film also stars Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, and Estella WarrenDevelopment for a Planet of the Apes remake started as far back as 1988 with Adam Rifkin. His project nearly reached the pre-production stage before being canceled. Terry Hayes's script, titled Return of the Apes, would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, under the direction of Phillip Noyce. Oliver Stone, Don Murphy, and Jane Hamsher were set to produce. Creative differences ensued between Hayes and financier/distributor 20th Century Fox. Chris Columbus, Sam Hamm, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, and the Hughes brothers later became involved.With William Broyles, Jr.'s script, Tim Burton was hired as director, and the film was put into active development. Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal rewrote the script, and filming took place from November 2000 to April 2001. Planet of the Apes was released to mixed reviews, but was a financial success. Much criticism focused on the confusing plot and ending, although Rick Baker's prosthetic makeup designs were praised.The story is a little confusing, but it is easy to look at for me, but for everyone else, a lot of people and critics and also fans of the franchise hates this story and the ending. The ending is just confusing also, but it's easy to overlook these two major flaws.The music by Danny Elfman is just awesome and the song that plays during the end credits titled, ""Rule the Planet Remix"" is awesome, mixed by Paul Oakenfold and composed by Danny Elfman. The rest of the music including the opening theme music is just spectacular and the film does wonders with the music.The visual effects and makeup is just spectacular also, but Rick Baker did the prosthetic make-up effects for the apes and it is a blessing of him. The visuals are a little cheesy, but works for this type of movie.The acting, is just good and bad. The only credit that will be given to is Mark Wahlberg, his performance as the lead was amazing. Helena Bonham Carter, Estella Warren and Michael Clarke Duncan puts on really good performances as well, but they can get way too over-the- top in some of the scenes. Paul Giamatti is hilarious and he does an amazing job. Luke Eberl and Erick Avari is in the film, too, but they're performances were a little confusing. Charlton Heston has a cameo as Thade's dad. Tim Roth plays the villain, Thade and he is okay, but even then, he is over-the-top as well.Overall, with the 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes, it's not a bad re-imagining, but it could have done much better than this.

176,Dodger-9,Planet Horrorwood,5,12 September 2001,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSAs with many of you reading this, I love both Planet of the Apes (1968) and the films of Tim Burton.However, like oil and water, the two are not a great mix.I like the fact he had a brave stab at one of Hollywood's best sci-fi movies and Rick Baker is bound to get an Oscar for his work on the make-up.However, that script and plot left a lot to be desired.There are little things that bug me, not the huge sweeping visions of apes thundering across the planet in Braveheart mode.When astronaut Mark Wahlberg puts his hand on a thousand year old door lock, it opens with barely a problem. If I leave my car door closed for a month it seizes up.
And when Mark crashes his space pod at the end, he strolls from the wreckage like he's just got up from his chair to make a cup of tea. Where is the logic in simple inertia and seized up mechanics. It doesn't take a genius to apply these little things that make all good sci-fi films work. Okay, it doesn't have to be Nasa approved but it does have to have a modicom of reality we can all relate to.2001 has been one of the bleakest years in living memory for movies and the news. Planet of the Apes will not be remembered for turning things around but merely burying them in a deeper pile of misery.If you only watch one film this year, make it Moulin Rouge and leave Tim Burton's flawed offering well alone.",Planet of the Apes
177,Carrigon,A New Masterpiece!,10,3 January 2002,"I loved this movie.  When I first heard that Planet of the Apes was being remade, I was so incredibly disgusted.  I loved the original series of movies, and I felt there was absolutely no way they could even come close to making a decent film.  And I was pleasantly shocked.  Right from the beginning of the film, you could tell it was directed very well.  And the movie kept a very good pace, I was never bored.  I loved the costumes, the music, and the attention to detail.  I also thought the film was very well acted by all.  In a weird sense, I was reminded of Star Wars, maybe it was the scenes of the ape city.  The ending, I'm not sure it sat well with me, but I understood why it was done that way.  I really enjoyed this film, which is a very rare occurrence these days.  I'm a movie snob and tend to only like the older films.  But this new film was very good and I highly recommend it.  The story stands out on it's own and doesn't need the original films at all.  Even Charlton Heston's cameo was great!",Planet of the Apes
178,claudonio,"Cool Movie, dumb ending",7,23 August 2001,"I enjoyed"" Planet of the Apes"" very much but the ending brings the rest of the film down. Tim Burton has a great eye for gothic visuals and he doesn't dissapoint here. Most of the movie is very dark and moody. The performances are good also, Mark Wahlberg does a good job playing an air force Pilot who crash lands on a different planet in time, Michael Clarke Duncan, Helena Bonham Carter, and Tim Roth also are convincing as apes from another world, the majority of this film is good, but like I said the ending brings it down, it's not totally bad but you're left saying, ""oh, sure, Whatever"".

Let's see if it's really as bad as people rate it!11 minutes - here we go... and I thought it was so nice... I mean it still is but the logic is out of its place...

Kris Kristofferson! so what that I thought this is Jeff Bridges at first lol, it's always a pleasure to see a familiar face, especially on another planet!23 minutes - so far it's really interesting, kind of disappointed though... I thought they are going to be high tech apes, but they are totally opposite... It's still interesting to see an alternative life.27 minutes - the typical Tim Burton's background music starts being annoying... It's too distinctive, loud and it eclipses the movie...40 minutes - I am not racist or anything but... damn those apes looks fugly as hell! + Mark Wahlberg's facial expressions look like he really need to take a massive dump but he holds it instead...52 minutes - the movie is certainly not as bad as people rate it... and I have to honestly admit that the actors playing apes are doing a hell of a good job.1h - so much hard work has been put in all these nice make-ups, environments etc. but still, it doesn't make up for the movie which is a bit dull...1h 37 minutes - the apes can kill every human in half of a second but apparently Mark Wahlberg is special...

Also You'll understand this movie a bit better.Visually this movie is wonderful, and the new ape suits are incredible. Unlike the original movie, the apes have a more realistic appearance, they act more, and sounds a bit more like apes. But the apes are still the dominat and intelligent species on the planet. This movie is more based on the original novel by the French author Pierre Boulle. And I'm sure he would be pleased with the story arc in this movie, even though all the french factors have been Americanized.Mark Walberg show us a strong performance, and the movies ""villain"" general Thade, portrayed by Tim Roth, is just terrifying. To be candid the two adversarial roles really saved this movie.It may not be as mind-boggling as the original movies, but it's still well worth watching. It's great for remake standards and shouldn't be compared to much to the original.",Planet of the Apes

Decent sets, costume designs were pretty inspired as well
A lot of the apes move like apes
Can be a bit funny, even some clever writingCons:
Pretty bad acting, even from people who didnt have 3 inches of makeup
Terrible action due to over reliance on wires
Boring plotline, didnt really care about our heroes or what they were doingBest part: ape politics at the dinner table, purest look at an ape civilization and how it works
Worst part: big final battle, wire stunts and bad sound design, a lot of weak looking hits, generally uninteresting and bad",Planet of the Apes

This is a really bad movie and, even though I can't compare it to the original which i haven't seen, I'm sure the original made a lot more sense at the end. Even though I thought Estella Warren was dead sexy, the movie stunk like crap.I did eventually see JP3, which was better than this movie but still the worst of the JP trilogy.

184,blackburnj-1,"Entertaining, but doesn't live up to its potential",7,23 September 2008,"Tim Burton's remake of ""Planet of the Apes"" may well be a disappointment to fans of the original and perhaps even an abomination. However, it is an entertaining film which is not one of Burton's finest, but is decent blockbuster fare.The plot clicks along at a cracking rate, so it is never dull, although a bit more time dwelling on the central character and the world of the film would not have gone amiss and would have injected a bit more interest into the film. Burton cannot make up for this lack of development, but he does provide the film with his excellent breed of design which does make this, at times, an interesting visual spectacle.The characters are also fairly thinly sketched, although there are some good lines in this film, particularly those that reference the original. However, some of the performances, most of which are done through extraordinary make-up, are very good. Tim Roth chews the scenery and most of his prosthetics as he delights in the part of the villain, Thade. Helena Bonham Carter is pretty good, and Mark Wahlberg is fine, although this performance gave no hint of what he would achieve later in his career.However, the wayward climax and somewhat bewildering conclusion let the film's solid base slip and this reviewer was left satisfied, but felt that this could have been so much more. This is a bit of a blip by Burton's standards, but, as blockbusters go, this is pretty good entertainment.3 stars out of 5",Planet of the Apes
185,Asteri-Atypical,"Watch it for the effects, not the story",3,8 September 2001,"I had mixed feelings about this film.Let me start by saying my enjoyment would have been greatly increased had this been a pseudo-sci-fi, action, ape-based flick that stood on its own merits instead of being associated with ""The Planet of the Apes"".  There were certainly things in this film which made it worth seeing.Despite what is said, the visuals and effects were interesting.  There was enough story to at least hold the interest of most.Sadly, what it lacked are those elements which made the original PotA good. The original had weak effects to be sure and the plot even had its problems. Nonetheless the depth of the plot, the debate about the content of man, the thoughts and concepts that were classic, are all missing.  I would have hoped that in a ""re-imagining"" the philosophy and concepts would have CHANGED; but not that they would have been omitted.I still use illustrations from the original to elucidate points.  I didn't walk away with such a feeling from this movie.  The debate between superiority of human vs. ape has been reduced to scant allusion to racial tension.  There is enough illogic to not deserve itemization (the horses have already been discussed quite throughly).  Worst of all was the ending. My friend and I are quite familiar with sci-fi, fantasy, irony and great literature.  We ""get"" most every reference.  However, BOTH of us looked at each other and said ""huh""?  While there may be some explanations for this they didn't even establish enough clues for some healthy hypothesizing.  It seemed just ""thrown in"" and out of context with the rest of the movie.To close out the critique I will just state that there is a positively tragic movement in Hollywood to ""dumb down"" every creation.  It's like Hollywood has the touch of mental mediocrity.  You'd think for scores of millions of dollars they could somehow come up with a story and content worth the millions of dollars of effects.  Give us something that can stimulate our minds, not just our senses.  I fear this ""re-imagining"" fell prey to this phenomenon.That being said, I return full circle to the fact that this movie enough going for it to have been enjoyable were it to stand on its own (and taking into account the current brain-dead state of today's Hollywood scripts). There were a couple homages to the original movie which gave us a laugh or two.  As I said, the effects and even visual composition were worth seeing. If you wish to see a movie to go ""ooooh"" and ""aaahhhh"" over the effects as opposed to the ""invisible effect"" approach (where you are engrossed in the story, not aware of the visuals being ""effects""), then you will enjoy this.I would recommend watching this.  Just enjoy it for what it is and don't expect a level of content comparable to the original.  At the very least, this movie is FAR beyond the level of any ""Apes"" SEQUELS, which had thoroughly useless plots without the concession of good effects.",Planet of the Apes
186,stumpmee77,Am I the only one who's glad,1,17 January 2008,"Roddy Mcdowell didn't live to see this movie? Unfortunately Kim Hunter probably heard about it & got sick to her stomach.What in the name of God??????? All the Ape faces brings to mind Halloween masks with the backs out. Shoulda recycle ""Nightmare before Christmas"" & ""Corpse Bride"" puppets or told it in CGI/animation. & again the low-lighted sets? Memo 2 all involved in film financing & distribution movie: keep his man away from remakes of any type especially musicals &, except for ""Mars Attacks"", this genre. & and talk of too many humans. The original two Apes films kept the human numbers to less than 20 to my recollection.I thought I'd never say this--The role of Captain Leo Davidson SHOULD HAVE WENT TO JOHNNY DEPP! He's got more versatility; will at least try to stretch his acting (Although for my taste he's being more and more horribly miscast in Timmy films). He was excellent in ""Astronaunt's Wife""--Pretty Boy Wooden on Kazoo Wahlberg? Oh please! Or how about this casting Michael Keaton if not Depp??? Timmy B don't know how to cast a male lead to save his life! In terms of female leads he does better with HB-C but her in this???? IMO she should have been skipped over for casting in this flick at any & all levels. Elegant &/or down the down to every woman, whatever the character type or past & present, is her forte. As much as I hate her squat screen time role in ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory"", it wasn't a SCI-FI Film! Get Veronica Cartwright, Robin Curtis, Terry Ferrell any experienced sci-fi actress who could rise above the level of unbelievable.The reasons I believe Timmy B had Chalty Heston doing his little bit here are 2 fold: 1) thought it would wow fans of the 1st movie ergo they'll come in droves trying to find what scene he's in; & 2) promised he'd pad Heston's bankroll. In case of reason #1, next time he wants to draw in fans of a media icon to a cinema adaptions, especially in the area of sci-fi, talk to Michael Bay regarding his casting of a main robot character 2007 movie adaption, for crying out loud!Oh wait a sec, just remembered--""The Astronaunt's Wife"" wasn't directed by Timmy.",Planet of the Apes

The film is always visually interesting. The CGI work is top notch. The battle action is suspenseful, and the apes running along side the horses is unworldly.  Most actors did very well, under what must have been very heavy makeup. A successful re imagining of the original. The hero came off a little like ""Gladiator"" meets the planet of the Apes.

Unlike the 1968 film version with Charlton Heston, this film retains (an Americanized version of) the original ending, which actually works pretty well. There are good scenes along the way too, but somehow, the story just doesn't quite make it. Excellent performances by Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth shore it up a bit, as does the superb make-up. In the end, though, poorish special effects, unmemorable music, and a seeming indecision on the part of the filmmakers as to whether to stick with the original story or write one of their own mean this movie just doesn't work as it should.

I mean in the original story it turned out the ""planet of the Apes"" was Earth all along, so Burton had to avoid that, and he did, nicely, but he then felt obliged to do his own twist ending and that is where the movie falls apart. This movie was an interesting visual journey with a nice background mystery (how did the apes get this way?) although when all is said and done I am left wondering two things: 1- Where did they get all the horses? And 2- Where is Rod Serling in the end shot? I can almost hear him saying ""Picture a man far from home...""",Planet of the Apes

There's a weird kinda beastiality romance between Mark Wahlberg and Helen Labottum-Carter, the humans seem savage, but they speak and have developed tribal cultures of their own. The Ape society makes no sense, they see humans both as savages and a slaves.... it's a mess.The ending sucks, Tim Roth sucks, Markie Mark sucks, everything sucks....

191,cutter-12,Planet of mockery!,3,12 December 2001,"About 5 minutes in after the opening titles I knew this was going to be a criminal miscarriage of what could have been. Character exposition in the opening sequence was axed in order to bustle the hero (or lack of one) into the so-called action as soon as possible. What results is a woefully underdeveloped series of events thrusting us along on an adventure that is laughable and miserably cheap. Tim Burton's influences lay in many obscure and cheesy drive-in sci/fi movies and TV shows of the past (which he actually tries to pay homage to rather than satirize) and it's not surprising that this film plays like Lost in Space meets One Million Years BC meets Claude Rains' version of The Lost World meets Planet of the Apes. If Burton felt that people would be excited at the prospect of seeing his own self-indulgent vision of the Book and Heston's classic, full of gawdy touches typical of his style, he was badly mistaken. His realization of Batman was far more successful.When I first saw the commercials for this movie I was immediately taken. Images of marching Ape armies and the atmospheric visuals inspired hopes of a science Fiction action epic like no other. Spartacus conquers the Apes as it were. Sadly it was all window dressing and the truly best parts of this movie are ALL in the commercial spots. What we are subjected to is an unspeakably badly written visual feast which belies a very limited budget lurking just below the surface. The only reason to see this abomination is for the costumes and make-up design, as well as the production design (aside from the space station and space suits which look to have been stolen from the 2001 prop vault).The original planet of the apes is not one of my top ten favorite films but it is an honest and intelligent piece of science fiction. Though a bit of a talk fest, it does bring up some very thought provoking issues (thanks to the great Rod Serling) and ends on one of the most powerful and stunning climaxes in movie history. It's a film deserving of its classic status and rated a better remake than what Richard Zanuck and Tim Burton have foisted on us here. In fact, Zanuck should be fined and his producer's license suspended as he was also in involved in making the original.Any and all intellectual content is missing leaving us with good actors buried under mounds of make-up. Except for Wahlberg, who should have just been buried. This guy is the most vacant action hero since Keanu Reeves in Speed. Aside from disobeying commands in order to rescue his chimp, his motivations are unwritten, leaving him to loaf from one scene to the next muttering little more than ""hey"" or ""what"" or ""whatever"", while glancing more than periodically at his Tandy hand-held. The guy has the intelligence and personality of a soapsud. An actor with a grasp of dead-pan humor might have made this character zing. Wahlberg just sits there, looking constipated as another IMDb reviewer mentioned.As far as the other cast members are concerned, what is the deal with Kris Kristoffersen. He has two lines then gets run through with a spear. Estella Warren is atrocious as the obligatory female human. She's no Raquel Welch in the looks department and is an even worse actress. Helena Bonham-Carter is wasted, as is Tim Roth as Thade and Michael Clark Duncan as his Right-Hand Gorilla. One wonders why they hired big-name actors to be unrecognizable under all that latex when they could have hired medium priced actors and saved some money on the budget. Marquee power I guess. As good as he is, Michael Clark Duncan just sounds like the guy who played Worf in Star Trek.As far as Charlton Heston's uncredited cameo as Thade's father, spouting familiar lines he used to condemn the Apes in the original, though here in reversed context: maybe in another script, with a better director for the material, it would have been sly and humorous. Not here. The same goes for other memorable lines quoted from the original.Much has been debated about the ending, which is about the only pure Burtonian stamp on the movie. It has no relevance other than to set-up a sequel (would anyone care to see it?). It pays homage to Serling and is a twist on the original's shattering ending, but really it comes off more of a tribute to Marty's nightmare sequence in Back to the Future Part II than anything else.What we're left with here, in the wake of other deficient hack jobs such as U-571, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, is a clear message that a great deal of Hollywood no longer cares about providing their audience with a well written and performed production once their marketing machine has lured us into the theatres. If people keep falling for it it's going to end up sealing the end of quality entertainment for good.Here's hoping that The Lord of the Rings doesn't turn out to be a mishandled treatment of Tolkien with GREAT commercials.",Planet of the Apes

That's the strangest thing.  I actually saw this movie in theaters because a friend asked to see it (I only wanted to see Jurassic Park III).  Turns out it could almost be called one of my favorites!I have never seen the original.  I'm sorry to say this, but I don't know if I ever will since this remake was so good.  I am satisfied with the way this one was done.  I am afraid of disappointment if I watch the original.The plot is excellent, first of all.  There's a nice plot twist at the end involving the origins of all apes that puts everything together and just feels right.  There is plenty of action and, in a way, romance, too.  It's a great sci-fi flick with plenty of action.The storyline isn't too original--escape, then get reinforcements to fight off the antagonists.  But it still does its job.  It keeps you watching.The music is composed by Danny Elfman.  He has a certain militaristic flare in this movie which really sounds good.  The music is excellent, taking on tribal drums at some points and bombastic themes that whirl together perfectly.The costumes are great.  The apes look just like they should.  The graphics are decent, but not overall groundbreaking.I was and am still really impressed with this movie.  It has a lot of things that kept me going and makes me want to watch it again and again.

193,mrskywalker,"Monkey See, Money Do",7,21 August 2001,"This version of Planet of the Apes was obviously not supposed to be like the mature Heston version.  The original version had more dialogue in which acting ability was so important.  But the old version also moved along at a rapid pace.  This version played more like an action version but was also very good.  Tim Burton for the first time seems to draw the audience in to the movie unlike his previous films which seemed more rock video.  Burton is sure to make many more films and has greatly improved from Sleepy Hollow. 
I saw this film twice and with the second viewing certain details become more understandable.  It is interesting to see how the apes seemed to have imitated human culture.  Burton has the apes doing all the things humans do even saying grace.  But the ape's have no deeper understanding of anything. If you see the film you will understand. I believe Burton has the apes more as a creation from humans and not an evolved species.  The first film has the apes emerge out of a human created disaster of nuclear war.  This film treats the creation of apes in a unique way.I have heard more long debates about this film than any other film of the Summer.  As far as all the criticism of the ending, it seemed much more clear the second time.  SPOILER:  I think it was more of a beginning than an ending.  And if you look on the plaque you will see the name Thade.  Perhaps in the next one we will see a battle by humans to retake a new technologically advanced ape world.  SPOILER: Whatever, it may be that the ending may be another example of apes having imitated the human world by finding books.  Bring on Apes 2 especially with pretty pouty Bonham in it.

I must confess something: I never liked very much Tim Burton's cinema, and this time it wasn't an exception. The worst thing I find in this film is the whole plot. It's so strange that I'm sure that even Tim can't give a proper explanation.From now on: WARNING, SPOILERS AHEAD.I always heard that time travels are mathematically possible if we follow Einstein's theory. I also saw films like Back to the Future where a change in the past affected the future. But I never saw a film where a change in the present could affect the past. What happens in this film is so weird that it needs a powerful explanation to make it acceptable. As powerful as a second movie, and maybe that's just what Tim was thinking.Here: END OF SPOILERS.Behind the makeup, Helena Bonham Carter looks more like Michael Jackson than like an ape girl, Mark Wahlberg's character is plain and insipid, and the film as a whole is quite boring.

195,GuyCC,There's Something About Monkey....,8,28 July 2001,"And with that comment goes the first, last, and only bad primate pun in this review.Leave it to Tim Burton to take a familiar franchise or story, keep enough of the source material to make it familiar, then add his own unique twist. ""Planet of the Apes"" is much like ""Batman"" or ""Sleepy Hollow"" in that respect.  You know what you're getting, but not sure of how it's going to be told, or what surprises lie along the way.This is ""B movie"" fun at its finest.  Of course, you're dealing with a film about talking monkeys, so if you're going into this film expecting something overtly serious, you're not going to find it.  It's a very surreal film, both in its ideas and in watching the human-like apes, swing, beat their chests, ride horses, and carry on conversations.  It's fascinating and a little scary at the same time.  Burton's quirky sense of humor is definitely apparent in the ape cities.  The make-up in this film is great, especially the gorilla soldiers.  The actor cameos are fun to spot (Watch for Heston - Burton does a good job in paying homage to the original series), and the twist in meaning of the original film's dialogue is definitely worth a laugh or two.The story was an interesting take on the original series.  At times it was silly (and seems aware of this), but not necessarily in an unpleasant way. The biggest problem that I had with the story was in the resolution (I thought a lot of the conflict issues were too neatly and conveniently tied up).    Burton also did a nice job providing a new spin on the classic film's infamous ""Statue of Liberty"" scene.  There definitely seems to be plans in the works for a sequel by the way it ended.I think this film will get some criticism for what it is, but you know, this isn't the type of film that is going to teach you something about yourself, nor will it provide the solution to all the world's problems by the time the end credits roll.  I had fun with this.  It was wild, it was campy, the acting performances were good for this type of film, and the special effects were entertaining.  I enjoyed this film for what it set out to do, and I'm glad it's not simply a rehash of the original film.Burton has still been unable to let me down, and still remains one of my favorite directors.  I'll definitely add this to my ""Burton DVD"" collection.",Planet of the Apes
196,shaid,Half baked cake,6,17 September 2001,"*SPOILERS  *SPOILERS*  *SPOILERS*The original is already a classic and here the makers got the chance to introduce the story to a younger generation taking advantage of the technical advantages of today while using one of the original director of today's Hollywood, Tim Burton, whose unique style is something that can give the edge the film needed. However the result is less than you expected from a technical or story and characters development point of view.As usual there are a list of good and bad things and I'll start with the good ones:Make up - Almost perfect. The actors look like apes and you would not guess that there are real actors under the masks(I won't be surprise if the make-up will win an Oscar). That saying there are some reservation. While the man apes are perfect the female apes are less good. They look like actors and not like real apes. The decision to let the apes walk and jump like apes do is used to a great effect and is the big advantage of the film.The dark tone of the story is been reflected in the dark cinemtography. Even when there is light it is not a strong one but it is moody and dark.Music- As usual the music from Danny Elfman is effective and serve the film.Tim Roth as General Thade is excellent and his performance convey the menace and the hunger for power that exist in his character.That all I can say that was good in the movie. The list of bad things will be longer:Mark Wahlberg as Capt. Leo Davidson is weak. He doesn't carry the film on his shoulders and moreover he is not as strong as Tim Roth's Thade. How can anyone see him as a messiah is beyond my understanding.In the original film the main female character, Dr. Zira(Kim Hunter), was a scientist. She fought for the humans to have equal rights because she think they are intelligent but she could not prove it because all the humans in that film couldn't speak. The arrival of Col. Taylor(Charlton Heston) gave her the tool to prove her theory because he could speak. Beside that she was a strong and believable character. Here the main female character, Ari(Helena Bonham Carter,) is been portrayed as ""human lovers"". There is no reason why shy thinks like that or what made her change her mind in such an hostile environment towards humans. It doesn't help that her performance is so weak and her contribution to the film is less than zero. In general the female apes are less convinced than the men apes.Towards the end of the film,the chimpanzee that was sent in the beginning of the film and that we thought has already died, re-appear,out of nowhere. This development in the story is very contrive and served only as mean to end the battle between the apes and the human. How the chimpanzee has survive the magnetic storm. Your guess is as good as mine. Another development that strike me as contrive is the decision of General Thade's aide to simply turn to the other side just because he doesn't believe The General anymore. Why has this happened? Through the whole film that aide is a loyal servant. He has no reason to doubt The General so what happened now? Was it enough for him to hear Cat.Davidson's words in order to change his heart? In short no logic in both events.The ending doesn't help making the film coherent. The only explanation i can think of is that the storm was not only a jump through time but also a jump through dimension. Otherwise the whole film stand on very weak basis and the ending make the whole film illogical.I like Tim Burton. I have seen every film his has done(not all perffect) and I would continue to see his films. However something is missing from this film. He is in his best when he direct projects that he initiate or are close to his heart. His best films were the ones that have an outsider as a hero that Burton, as an outsider himself, can identify with. I didn't have the feeling that he was fully committed to this project, probably because he was hired to direct this film and didn't initiated it.At the end I was very disappointed. Something that looked good and promise to taste good turned out to be not as good as it should and could have been. Just like an half baked cake. It looks good from the outside but it taste bad because someone forgot to put some of the ingredients that would have make the best in the world.",Planet of the Apes
197,paulo20,"Typical Burton cheese (spoilers, maybe)",5,3 August 2001,"Not much I can add that others already haven't.  This is a typical Burton movie where story is sacrificed to visuals.  There is barely enough story to provide an excuse for all the lush visuals to exist.The movie is entertaining enough, but why does nobody give a crap about script anymore? This movie could have been so much more but its only real contribution is to advance ape make-up technology.  It's not a movie I'm anxious to see again; very few films made these days seem to have that quality.All the various flaws in the film have been pointed out already, but there is one thing I'd like to address and that's the question of female chimpanzees being the sexually dominant one.  First off, why introduce this ""fact"" if it's not going to be explored?  Second, it's not correct.  There is an offshoot of the chimpanzee, the bonobo, (which tends to walk upright as often as not) where the female is more dominant, but in the main species (the one which scoots around on all fours), the male chimp rules the roost and I don't think this film was cognizant of bonobos or much of anything else, for that matter.",Planet of the Apes
198,miken-3,Pleasant Surprise,7,9 August 2001,"This movie was entertaining and very different from either the original movie or the book (actually it was closer to the book).  The special effects were excellent as well as the make-up and the body movements of the actors.Charlton Heston makes as an ape and quotes verbatim one of his most famous lines from the original movie but it seems out of context.Possible Spoiler ahead:
Not to give away the ending, but it seemed the writer tried to have it parallel Pierre Boulle's ending but it causes great confusion.  You are never quite sure whether they are traveling to the future, past or to a parallel world existing in the same time continuum.",Planet of the Apes

There were some element of this film that were great. the special effects were of masterpiece quality.this movie has lots of action. The story moves at a decent pace. the plot(although predictible)is good. The actors did a good job. The real let down to this movie was the disapointing resolution to the climax, and the bazaar twist on the ending that left me wondering what just happened. this film would've been one of the all time great sci-fi flicks ever had the last 10 minutes of this film hadn't have ruined it.

201,clay-8,*** out of ****,7,26 July 2001,"I just got back from screening Planet of the Apes at the theater I work at. What I was most afraid of was whether or not the movie had SDDS sound.  It does, thank god. I am a fan of Tim Burton's.  He makes great movies.  When I heard about this movie, I thought, although a bad idea, that it might be an interesting movie.  I'm not too familiar with the original ""Apes"" movies, so I can't compare, but this movie does have a surprise ending similar to the original's, minus the surprise.I noticed the movie was written by William Broyle's Jr., as well a two other guys.  I got worried after that considering he wrote the horrible ""Castaway"".  I can't really give him credit for making this movie bearable, though.  Burton and his crew pretty much deserves the credit for that. This movie's plot is riddled with cliches from a General who was outcasted getting revenge only to die to an old Ape guy dying RIGHT AFTER telling Thade (Roth) what WE need to know.  It's as if the writers were afraid their slightly unique version was too unique and was becoming unrecognizable.SPOILER WARNING:I thought some of the ideas in the movie were intriguing and scary.  Not so much the idea that apes COULD become the leaders of a planet due to time travel and evolution from experimental monkeys, but that they DID.  I felt the whole play on equality was too preachy and phony, however.  Planet of the Apes is far from being the best movie of the summer - that title still belongs to The Mummy Returns - but it's a decent movie, although it lacked any humor whatsoever.",Planet of the Apes
202,A-Ron-2,Reasonable re-imagining of a classic tale,6,2 August 2001,"I liked this film... it was not a great film, but it was a good film.  I felt that it entertained me for the 2 hours or so that it was on and I didnot feel screwed out of 6 bucks... however, this film did not MOVEme the way the original film did... it danced with certain issueswithout ever really delving into them... it used the image of slaverwithout addressing the substance (and so had to rely on deus exmachina resolution rather than the more cerebral ending of theoriginal...)Overall, I think that the ending of this film would have been better atthe end of the original movie, reminding us that WE were the apesand bringing home the point of the film a clear way.  However,since this film only used racism a slavery as a plot device theending simply seemed to say 'boo' rather than to make one thinkor reflect.This is not to say that I disliked Tim Burton's version in any way,but simply to point out that it does not have the same resonanceas the original... worth seeing, but make sure you give the 1968one a read as well.",Planet of the Apes
203,zimbo_the_donkey_boy,racist?,4,19 February 2004,"I just watched this on tv.  I agree with the earlier comments rating this as mediocre and illogical at every turn (within the bounds of the fantastic premise of course.)  I haven't read most of the 1238! comments but don't see any bringing up an aspect which jumped out at me.  __  To digress, I was stunned to see that, when the film Ghost Busters was turned into a tv cartoon series, Aykroyd's & Murray's characters were transferred not unlike the originals but Ernie Hudson, the one black ghost buster, was replaced by an ape!  Planet of the Apes strikes me the same way.  __  I'm white and do not presume to speak for blacks but I cannot see how this movie, with only one token black human surrounded by otherwise entirely white humanity, can avoid coming off as comparing blacks to simians.  Yes, I realize that this flick is presenting a lame, elementary-school-level case for liberalism.  I do not however see that as negating the fact that, while the film repeatedly instructs us that slavery is bad and that intolerance is bad, the humans are basically purely white, which means that the other set of characters (the apes) must represent blacks.  __  A weak claim is made that humans enslaved apes and now, after turnabout, apes have enslaved humans.  The problem with that is that humans do not use apes as slaves.  Hmm, who did whites used to enslave if not apes?  Blacks.  So then, if this society represents a reversal of our own, who must the apes represent?  Blacks.  __  Other fantasy films successfully make the desired point by either having characters of different colors or races on both sides, thus pointing out that intolerance is not inherently caused by racial difference, or by having characters with cultural differences which in no way resemble actual ethnic or racial groups.  I am in no way saying that the apes in this film resemble actual blacks but I am saying that some of the characteristics (besides their ability to ignore the laws of physics) they exhibit are exactly how bigots used to make fun of blacks.  __  Am I the only one here who was alive before the civil rights movement and thus what I'm talking about is totally foreign to the rest of your experiences?

204,darkjosh,Burton's Monkey Mishmash,6,7 August 2001,"Tim Burton is one of Hollywood's darkest, most imaginative filmmakers, so one must wonder what went wrong with his latest venture, a reworking of the 1968 sci-fi classic, Planet of the Apes.  This is Tim Burton-lite, and as easily distinguishable as his prior films are, it's disheartening to see that he clearly gave in to Hollywood blockbuster mentality, as Planet bears no sign of his signature dark style.Planet of  The Apes is loosely based on its predecessor.  Mark Whalberg (here a cardboard cut-out action hero) stars as an astronaut who gets sucked into a time warp (?) and finds himself crash landing on a planet and captured by talking apes who have created a society where humans are their servants.  He finds a friend in female ape Helen Bonham Carter. The rest of the movie follows our hero Whalberg as he attempts to escape from his captors, in particular a nasty General played by an unrecognizable Tim Roth.The story is hardly noteworthy.  It's merely a clothesline on which to hang a few charged action sequences, grandiose sets, and the human actors eluding their captors.  What made the classic so striking was its scenes of the apes treating the humans as livestock.  Here, director Tim Burton has instead chosen to eschew characters and rely on the quality of the first film to garner any sort of sympathy for his characters.  The only likeable characters are, again, Helen Bonham Carter as an ape who sympathizes with and wants to help the humans, and Paul Giamatti, as a wise-cracking ape who by the end becomes very grating with his one-liners.The only true innovation in this updated version is the makeup; it's light years ahead of the 1968 version, and the actors disappear behind it, as well as the militarized costumes.  The apes look more ferocious, but this is a very poor substitute for an actual story.  Even the action sequences are dumbed down, with bullets and spears flying, there is no blood onscreen whatsoever.  Was it the studios who persisted in Burton to not show blood? Sleepy Hollow was a gorefest, but I imagine since this is a huge studio summer blockbuster, all controversial images and language were censored in order to have a more family oriented (money-making) movie.With all its flaws, Planet of the Apes is made watchable thanks to the amazing makeup and the performances from Roth and Bonham-Carter.  Perhaps Tim Burton will push the envelope with his next film, as here his influence seems nonexistent, except for the dark ending bound to leave audiences looking for a total mindless summer film confused.6 out of 10",Planet of the Apes

Well, for that, its pretty cool !On the other hand, there is nothing in it to get in any way excited about it. Just a very average science fiction story. Well the surrounding are made very nice. The apes really look and behave like intelligent apes. But the story itself lacked any noticeable inspiration, except maybe some nice jokes - such as apes fearing water. On the other hand, there where story holes, and unexplained parts. Especially the end was really bad.For men, there is Estella Warren with her supersweet kissme-mouth. But she appeared quite seldom in the scenes, and had not really much more personality and charisma than the boring Marky Mark, the main actor. Helena Bonham Carter was however very good, as was Tim Roth.I can't really recommend this one.",Planet of the Apes

(I can't believe that I'm using the words, boring, conventional and leaden in association with your name.) In fact this movie was so bad that my friend and I walked out of it BEFORE it ended.

Hello Mr. Broyles and your co-screenwriter did you ever see ""X-Men""? It had similar themes about racism and segregation but it kept it speeches to a minimum preferring to show rather than tell us. I got tired of talking apes early on in this movie (or was it a stillvie because it didn't move much). Barry Sonnefeld once said that when he was done making a movie it was as bad as possibly could be. Well guess what Mr. Burton you proved his point with ""Apes"".

I was very excited to go see it, and I hoped that this would be the one good movie this year, after a long, long list of absolutely TERRIBLE movies for 2000.  Of course, it did not break the trend. This movie was just as terrible as all the other over-hyped crap that came out this year.  SPOILER ALERTA little warning here:  I am going to reveal the ending.  But it is of no consequence because the movie is total garbage and the ending makes no sense, so when you see the movie for yourself you wont even care how it ends, you will just be hoping that it DOES end!A laundry list of complaints: The script has too many holes in it to be forgiven.  There is WAY too much dialogue.  So much so, this movie cannot be considered an action movie. I almost fell asleep!  The make up for the apes was not as great as everybody makes it out to be, and the actors have a really hard time spitting out their boring lines with those big, prosthetic teeth in their mouths.  Its very distracting.  The acting is poor and the sets are TOTALLY CHEAP!  The Monkey City looks like something out of the Pirate Tour at Disney Land.  I mean REALLY CHEAP!  There is no edge to the movie.  The viewer should keep in mind that this movie was rated PG-13.  There is very little violence, and when a character does die, the camera conveniently cuts away to something less disturbing, giving the movie a very ""MADE FOR TV"" feel.  I mean it looks like something slopped together by the Sci-Fi Channel.  Humans should have been getting ripped in half like so many phone books at a strong man contest.  But they weren't.  Also, Tim Roth's character of General Thade was acted well, but he had nothing to work with!  He was supposed to be the big, evil protagonist.  But in the movie, we never see him do anything all that evil. Instead, he just grimaces in an evil way and hops around a lot when he gets mad.  By the way, there is a lot of unbelievable jumping in the movie.  It looks terrible, you can almost see the wires and the harnesses on the actors.  It does not look like they are jumping at all, but SWINGING through the air. 
At the end we discover that all these stupid apes evolved from the experiment apes on board the crashed space station.  But there are MANY species of apes inhabiting the world, and there were ONLY chimpanzees on the space station!  This is ONE of many, many plot holes in the movie that are just unforgivable. Then, at the end, the little chimp flies his space pod down to the planet and makes a PERFECT three point landing and then hops out like a little pro. Marky Mark INSTANTLY jumps in to the SAME exact pod and flies off to space and then tries to land it, but totally crashes it for NO explained reason. Is the chimp a better pilot than Marky Mark?  HOW STUPID!After CRASHING his perfectly good space pod, Marky Mark discovers that he is on a planet just like Earth, but again, totally ruled by Apes.  And he sees the ""Lincoln"" memorial, and there is a statue of General Thade with a STUPID Lincoln like hair do.  The ending makes ABSOLUTELY no sense at all and it was the final down point to an already over-long, boring, and under-achieving film.  These are just a few of the glaring plot holes in the script.

211,arturmachado-29588,Do not expect a social message: this is an action flick,6,19 April 2016,"In this remake by Tim Burton (who had not the desired creative liberty), the focus is not so much on the story but more on the visuals, what makes this, basically, an action movie.Plot: the beginning resembles the 1968 movie with some added prelude scenes. A test-monkey in a shuttle from a space-lab enters a space- time rift and the scientist in charge follows him, crashing on a planet where the dominant species are intelligent apes that enslave humans; the scientist is captured but manages to free himself and from here on out the movie is escape-pursuit action until the climatic final confrontation, with some stops here and there to add short dialogues that add nothing to the story. The final sequence divides opinions, being ambiguous and leaving questions unanswered, promising a sequel that never happened.As incredible as it may seem, the 'apes' act way better then the humans.

212,qball_82,...oozes with style.,8,10 August 2001,"This is definitely one of the better films I have seen this year, perhaps even the best.  Tim Burton once again delivers a movie that oozes with style, class and sophistication, with a world so detailed and believable it's almost mind-blowing.  Not being familiar with the original movie/tv series myself, I didn't quite know what to expect.  I knew from the few articles I had read that Mark Wahlberg plays a pilot who crash lands on a planet ruled by apes, and in an interesting twist, finds himself as the ""alien"".  The story is a great concept and really brings up some interesting issues to think about.  This is one of the things I appreciated about it.  It is one big role-reversal but in two different ways.  Firstly we're no longer the master species in control, we're the animals without the souls to be used and abused. Secondly, instead of being discriminated against because we might be black, white or purple, we're now discriminated against because we're simply human. It says a lot about how we as humans treat others, whether it be animals or people...  I really liked this movie.  The actors were great, especially Tim Roth as Thade.  I've never encountered such a menacing, intimidating character as Roth's Thade on screen before.  Helena Bonham Carter's Ari was curious, naive and likeable and Mark Wahlberg didn't disappoint.  In general, all the ape actors did a fantastic job and combined with the stunningly detailed make-up, pulled it all off in a very convincing fashion.Danny Elfman is the man responsible for the film's score and I remember thinking during the credits, ""Hmm, that name is familiar...""  I will definitely remember his name from now on.  The score is excellent, and at times spine-chilling, particularly during the opening credits.I'm an every-movie person and I really couldn't find much to fault Planet of the Apes on.  My only gripe is that like so many movies these days, it leaves you feeling just a little unsatisfied somehow..  Maybe it's how film-making has changed these days, or the new techniques they use, I really can't put my finger on it.  But with this film it's only a minor thing.  See it.

The movie's quality allows me to poke fun at its weak spots, the make-up is pretty good, and the ideas not so bad.

214,parhat,B Movie Story Unconvicing Story,4,14 March 2009,"To be fair I watched this movie before I watched the original story. This movie is convincing mostly because of the story line. It sounds like tall tales. In other words, not convincing as the original Planet of the Apes which do deserve an 8. This one is one of those movie I won't recommend my friends to watch except for the beginning ape chase scenes. The story falls on a couple of things that makes it difficult to accept. Time traveling through the future in an electrical storm in space seems too far fetched compared to the original movie, which traveled near light speed. The fact that the space station had a couple of ""space pod"" and Standard Operating Procedures, it's unlikely that any space station would be traveling around chasing space pods lost in electrical storms. Space stations' aren't built for chasing or rescue missions. They could have sent a couple of space pods, with a chimp is more plausible. The fact that humans became a slave, and yet they can speak English and talk, makes it unconvincing compared to the original movie which they aren't able to talk as the Apes are convinced that humans are unintelligent. The original movie the Apes assume humans to be stupid since they can't communicate is a more convincing story. The ending of the movie, I believe spoiled the movie completely and this is where the scoring is bad. In any good movie there are three things that's is key to scoring. The plausibility of the story, the beginning movie to pull us into the story, the ending that wraps up the entire move is the most important. The story fails on plausibility as mentioned here. Why are humans too passive is unconvincing. The fact that humans in this movie has no capacity to use weapons and being unorganized is very unconvincing. Humans are well known to be organized in times like these. The ending is really hard to rationalized into the story and no plausibility at all. It creates a Pandora's box. So if I were a movie producer and I was to do something different, time traveling through a wormhole, a black hole is more convincing, if we want to add to the old original story. The fact that a small space pod to travel long distance is unconvincing also even with all the technology in this movie. A human slavery is only possible through greater limitations of freedom as in concentration camps conditions is more convincing I believe, or the fact that the humans brains were ""neutered"" into stupidity, as in the removal of frontal lobe is another possibility. The fact that human slave they became a butler and a maid is an unintentional comedy and too unbelievable. The fact that they put humans in wood cage and to assume humans are too stupid to find a way to break those bamboo wood sounds unrealistic. Humans intelligence couldn't be that stupid given a slight 2000 years or more of evolution. I can continue to criticized this movie because of it's many mistake. In my opinion the movie compares slightly better than Snakes on the Plane movie. You can make another Planet of the Apes...if the story line is a plausible one, I believe and make some of the fixes mentioned here. As you noticed directors in general ignore good story writing but in animations where changes are very difficult and costly, a good story is much more possible. This is why Pixar Studios and Disney have such an impressive list of classic movies in spite of the fat that its a cartoon. While story writing can be written on the fly, it is this reason why Xanadu flopped, or in more recent one Disaster Movie was a complete flopped. The movie was made before the story and they had no idea as to the title of the movie.",Planet of the Apes
215,ElliesWonder,old memory,10,31 May 2017,"I am very surprised IMDb rated this movie lower than 6. I watched this movie when I was in elementary school, it was a groundbreaking setting to me back in that age. The spaceship, the monkey spaceman, and the time-traveling, and the complete developd apes society, all these settings were awesome packed. I watched it again many years later, and I had some different thoughts about the ape girl.In the movie, human girl and the human guy didn't have a happy ending, and I felt pity to the girl when I was little. However after the second watch, I felt much more touch with the Ape girl. She is a noble birth in apes planet, yet she is smart, curious and full of sympathy to human unlike other ruthless apes, they treat human as pet or slave. When she was attracted to a human, she was so brave to fight the society. I couldn't figure out this conflict when I was little, because kid only knows hero and heroine should be together. Simple left me after I grow up. Last mind of the rewatching, I would want to say, it is OK to be different because your inappropriate might be right in future. Even your love is across species. Lol.",Planet of the Apes
216,Mitch-25,Not bad taken by itself,6,30 June 2003,"If this had been the FIRST Planet of the Apes, I think reviews would be quite different of this movie.  But, unfortunatly, because of the cult following that the original series has (me included), it is compared with the classic.  I myself can see why it doesn't compare with the original, and I agree, it is NOT as good as the first Planet of the Apes.All that being said, I must say that taken by itself, this version of Planet of the Apes is actually quite good.  The make-up effects were GREAT as were the other special effects.  As for the story, I didn't it was bad.  The dialogue could have been better, but what do you really want from Burton? As for the acting, so Wahlberg needs some acting lessons?  Tim Roth was very good, as was Michael Clarke Duncan.  And even though she had all that make-up on, Helena Bonham Carter was STILL sexy as hell. 
Although not exactly up to the original classic, this version is a fun movie.  I also, hope that there is a second one.  This time maybe get somebody other than Burton to direct it.",Planet of the Apes
217,RolloTomasi,animal planet,4,1 August 2001,"Having never seen the 1968 version, I went into this not knowing quite what to expect. It occurs to me that this film wouldn't exist without the Charlton Heston version and its sequels. Imagine if Franklin Schaffner had never adapted Pierre Boule's novel. Do you suppose that now someone would still come along and say, hey, that would make a good movie? Actually let me re-phrase that: would that make a movie ANYONE would be interested in seeing? Not likely. So having seen Tim Burton's newly 're-imagined' ""Planet of the Apes,"" am I glad there was an original whos coat-tails it could ride? Well, it's not terrible. At times it's downright interesting. Ultimately, though, it's just unnecessary. But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it as long as it's around. Like any Burton film, this one is about escape. It transports you to another place and time. The sets, the makeup, the effects all work hard to create this temporary reality. It's convincing but, visually, I was hoping for something more like ""Sleepy Hollow."" I was never amazed by anything in ""Apes"" but was stunned by some of the things Burton and his crew accomplished on such previous films as ""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Batman."" ""Apes"" seemed like fertile ground for the same visual opportunities, but Burton doesn't make good. At best, he's made the kind of cheesy sci-fi he poked fun at in ""Mars Attacks."" The irony! This didn't look or feel like a Tim Burton film at all. Where is the weird coolness that creeps into every single shot? Think of ""Batman,"" how it more than overcame that horrid script with Palance and Nicholson, along with Burton's twisted vision of Gotham City. And where did the humor go? Burton picks NOW to get serious? THIS film? I mean, if this was the best he was going to do with ""Planet of the Apes,"" he should have just stuck his name on it as producer and let some up-and-comer direct (actually, that will happen with the inevitable sequel, er, sequels). Not even Tim Burton can save us from Summer 2001, a film lover's nightmare.

218,starlit-sky,Apes Rule Once Again,7,19 August 2001,"What took so long to re-make this 68 sci-fi classic? I had been expecting it since the early 90's! From reading the reviews, however, I get the feeling that it was probably only me who made that prediction. Why did I predict or even insisted that there would be a re-make of Planet Of The Apes?  Well, for one thing, I believed that the advanced cinema techniques could add so much flavour to the original screenplay, which was superbly revolutionary (please read my review for the original Planet Of The Apes 68' to see why I consider the original screenplay to be ""revolutionary""). I have always thought that the original Planet Of The Apes was full of imaginative thoughts but it lacked juicy action scenes that could have made it even more fun to watch (however even this drawback didn't stop it from becoming a classic sci-fi, probably the best of its genre). The other reason why I expected a re-make was because I wanted to see my most favourite sci-fi saga being re-imagined, as director Tim Burton put it. My Vote: 7/10Things I liked about the movie: In contrast to other people, I liked the screenplay. In fact, I thought that it was brilliant. It was probably the best screenplay that could have been written for this movie without the ""it-was-earth-all-along"" concept that shocks the audience in the 68' version. I was as much amused by the twists in the end, as I was amused when I watched the original 68' version. Even the last 4-5 minutes were such a great enjoyment. I honestly think the screenplay works. But as much as it works, screenplay was not the best thing about the movie. I personally think that there are mainly two things about this movie that left me in complete amazement, 1) Tim Roth's performance and 2) The original score of the movie, both of which well deserve Oscar Nomination. Tim Roth was the only REAL APE in the movie; the rest were just humans under ape costumes. Tim Roth was the only one who really gave his character an identity. He was not just an ape; he was an ape with a personality. The rest of the cast couldn't even manage to act or even look like apes, except for their costumes, of course. The original score was totally mind-blowing. It is a musical expression of what's going on in the movie. Marvellous achievement!Things I didn't like about the movie: In contrast what other people think, I thought that the apes were too human. They were humans under ape costumes. Most of them didn't even try to act or move like an ape (except for Tim Roth). Obviously, they thought that wearing an ape costume was enough. I could puke at the dinner scene when the elderly ape character was speaking: he was just TOO HUMAN. And again, in contrast what other people think, I wasn't satisfied with the make up. Well, for one thing, the cast put too much trust in their make-ups; they didn't make the slightest effort to give themselves an ape-like personality (a couple of scenes showing them hanging upside down from the ceilings or trees don't redeem that - if they are ape enough to do that then how come they are so much human when talking?). Secondly, the make up in the original version was as good as it could get; it was revolutionary in its time. That's why, there was nothing revolutionary about the make ups in this one. Briefly, it was not better than the make ups in the original 68' version. Lastly, I saw a couple of flaws in the make up. For one thing, the one ape character -the one who sells humans as gifts- hadn't had his eyelids painted; every time he closed his eyes, his eyelids would look white (am I the only one who saw that?). Some of the actors' upper teeth had ape-like appearance, whereas their lower level teeth were obviously human-like. What about the hair of Ari (Helena Bonham Carter)? It looked like she had hair done in a beauty salon; it was too human. And her make up was terribly cheap, as if she was a little girl who didn't know how to put a make up. Maybe, Tim Burton wanted to give story a different respective with these ideas on purpose. But honestly, I don't think they work. My last criticism is the inappropriate sense of humour, which has become the disease of Hollywood in recent years. Directors must be very careful about the timing and the nature of the humour otherwise they spoil the whole movie. There are some silly jokes that work perfectly fine in the genre of comedy (Rush Hour, American Pie, Jim Carrey / Eddie Murphy kind of comedies and the like). But when you use jokes out of these movies in a movie that has a totally different personality, it spoils it. Within that respect, I have found the scene where the elderly ape character is taking his fake teeth out and putting into a jar absolutely inappropriate. Other then these flaws, the movie was a perfect re-make of an old sci-fi classic.

219,Mario64,One of the more solid movies in this disapointing summer,6,16 August 2001,"Planet of the Apes is far from perfect and definetly not as good as the original. I still found it to be enough of an entertaining ride to enjoy as a summer popcorn movies. Perhapse I would be more strict on this movie if there was actually better movies out right now. Pearl Harbor, The Mummy Returns, Tomb Raider and The Fast and the Furious were all disapointments for me and I mildly enjoyed Jurassic Park 3. This movie has entertaining battle scenes and has a good look like Burton films generally have. The ending left me somewhat unsatisfied and it didn't seem proper. Still it's better than most big movies out there. I give it a 7 out of 10.",Planet of the Apes
220,ericjg623,Style over substance,5,17 December 2001,"This movie has great looks, the apes (with a few exceptions) really look apelike, you've got lush jungles, deserts, big, action packed fight scenes, and a whole ape city that looks totally realistic. Director Tim Burton wasted no expense or effort to make this a visual feast. Too bad he didn't put the same effort into creating a terrific story, especially since there was so much potential to work with. The 1968 original is considered a Sci-Fi classic, not just because of the story, but also the issues it dealt with. It used a society where apes are the top species to comment on and satirize our own society. There are moments of this in ""Apes 2001"", but mostly it's another big budget action film, only with actors in monkey costumes. As proof of this, the lead character, played by Mark Wahlberg (aka Marky Mark) is just another hotshot fighter jock, meaning there's no problem he thinks he can't solve by simply blasting the bad guy to bits. Which is a shame, since it would be much more interesting to see him outwit his enemies, thus showing who really was the superior species. Also, it doesn't help that the female lead, played by Helena Bonham Carter, doesn't even remotely look like a real chimp. I guess Burton & Co. couldn't resist making her look sexy, complete with a fashionable hairstyle. So, ultimately what you have is lots of good looks, but not much in the way of brains. I'm looking forward to viewing the 1968 original, just to see how this film falls short by comparison. 5/10",Planet of the Apes
221,eye3,A waste!!!!,5,1 August 2001,"WARNING:  SPOILERS BELOWIf anyone else in the world wasted its resources the way this movie does the global media would howl.Tim Burton has been quoted as saying he never went to film school, or that he never finished it.  Sad to say, his movies show it.  He's consistently come up with interesting outsider characters but at least the story revolved around them.  Here, there are several out-of-place characters around whom no story is told.On top of that, like in Burton's other movies he substitutes here a weak ending for a hard-hitting one that could have paid off all that gone into the movie.  We get a miasma of red herrings and actions that drag on for no reason because neither Burton nor the writers had the neither the maturity nor the nerve to end their movie with any one thing.  Murdered characters whose discovery leads to no further development.  The fight with Thade ends not with a dramatic kill-or-be-killed but with him holing up undercover - but then we never see the consequences of his cowardice.  One gorilla changes his alliegiance after the battle but we're never given a foreshadowing of this.  The apes survive a rocket engine blast but we're never given an earlier clue that they can.  What we're shown as a space station turns out to be a space ship as well but we don't see that until we see the wreckage on the Planet of the Apes, nor are we given a clue as to how it got there - did it come through the same vortex as our hero?Then they had to end their movie with an post-ironic, self-referential, wise-acre college-student twist that said absolutely nothing about all that had gone before.  Rod Serling these guys are not.If this wins any awards it should be the 2001 Golden Rasberry.  It certainly won't wins Oscars for writing or direction.  I can only hope the Sci-Fi Conventions refuse to award it any prizes",Planet of the Apes
222,Uthman,"Slow-moving, dull, and without logical plot",3,13 January 2002,"I don't think this inept script could have ever been produced withoutthe name of Tim Burton behind it. Science fiction aficionadosshould take note that, unlike the original PLANET OF THE APES,this non-remake makes no effort to lay any kind of logicalconnection between the different time frames alluded to in the plot.If you have ever seen any time travel films before, even mediocreones, you will have come to expect some logical inconsistencies(reflecting that time travel is theoretically impossible in the firstplace), but Burton seems intent on simply giving the finger to anysemblance of logic here. If you haven't seen the film yet, you haveprobably been told to expect a surprise ending; I would tell you toexpect a surprisingly stupid ending that is surprisingly insulting tothe audience's intelligence.Burton's fondness for dark sets is apparent here,  but instead ofthe decadent, wildly overgrown urban landscape of his GothamCity,  all you get here is sensory deprivation and an urge to nod offduring one of the film's frequent and lengthy periods of inactivity.The ape makeup, which was groundbreaking at the time of theoriginal film, has not really improved much. Some of it is quitegood (Tim Roth as Thade), but it is otherwise uneven, as is theacting.Burton makes much of the difference in strength and agilitybetween apes and humans, but the way he shows this is not byendowing the apes with natural animal-like grace, but by loadingthem onto hidden catapults and launching them into the scene. It'slaughable.The DVD has a few extras, including commentary by Tim Burtonand Danny Elfman, but I got the best laugh from the cast biosection, which gives page after page of gushing plaudits forBurton's untalented girlfriend, Lisa Marie, who is alleged to haveappeared in the film.

223,BibChr,Did not work for me for ONE MAIN REASON,6,20 April 2002,"Now that I've finally seen the big Planet of the Apes remake, and before I look again at the reviews. I am asking myself why the movie just didn't work.  And I think I know.It wasn't awful, not to me anyway.  I enjoyed the effects, I enjoyed Elfman's score, the makeup was wonderful, the acting of all the ape characters was pretty terrific, the plot was at least interesting.  Those are all good things, and made it an endurable experience, not like, say, Nightfall.So what was wrong?  One factor.  MARK WAHLBERG.He's just *nothing.*  He's this bland, flavorless, rice-cake/styrofoam object filling up air and reflecting light rays.  Not Rufus Sewell obnoxious/bad, not David Birney talentless/bad, just... this-was-supposed-to-be-a-steak-and-it-turns-out-to-be-tofu bad.I will never see Boogie Nights, so I will never have a comment on his ""work"" in that, I don't remember him from Perfect Storm, so I don't know if Wahlberg is capable of being interesting.  The part wasn't written terribly interesting (but think Sean Connery, John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart - a talented actor can *make* a part interesting).  Doing a lot of standing around and staring, occasionally broken up by some moving around and staring, won't breathe life into a part.And when he did do something or speak, I found his character unsympathetic and centerless.Now, I didn't think much about the original while watching, because I think such comparisons are unfair and usually irrelevant.  But I feel I need to say one more thing: Charlton Heston.  Not one of my favorite actors, but compare the life and scope of that character to this listless... thing.Too bad.  The movie could have been a lot of fun.",Planet of the Apes
224,sampleman411-1,"Monkey See, Monkey Do",6,5 May 2002,"Almost everyone involved in the making of this movie is to be lauded for their individual creative efforts; this much is certain... great costumes, props, makeup, etc.My only problem with the end result of POTA is its emphasis on action, and very little attention to the human vs. ape and mankind philosophies so aptly and dramatically demonstrated in the original 1968 film on which the ""reimagined"" 2001 Tim Burton movie was partly based (The screenwriters who worked on this one also pulled information from Pierre Boulle's short sci-fi novel ""Monkey Planet."").True, everything made nowadays must have one sense-throttling, action packed sequence strung almost imperceptibly to the next, never stopping to look at the wondrous 'flower' that made the 1968 film so unique.  The original film was nature vs man, evolution alongside devolution, and an overall downward spiral towards mankind's oblivion (or pretty much the next worst thing, anyway, since people aren't totally extinct by the time the main character crash lands on either eponymous planet).The best things in the 2001 remake are the handful of pop references made first in the original movie, the references to modern (some 21st Century) attitudes (""I'm having a bad hair day,"" says one female chimp in Burton's version), and the overall upgraded feel and tone of the movie now that more than thirty-three years have elapsed in the world of cinema.Its a given to say that special-effects are a boon to this new, improved version.  Yet, I miss hearing all that (somewhat) great dialog heard in POTA 1968.Everyone I know who's seen the Burton version has mentioned something about its ending, and the questions it poses.  Let us all hope Simos (the name of the simian deity in this film) answers our inquisitive, and slightly confused, prayers in a rational manner... ...and will there be an even more confusing sequel to this reimagination?",Planet of the Apes
225,Denver53,First hour - wow! Second hour - ugh!,7,30 July 2001,"I loved the first half or so of Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes. Other than a few lame visual gags that were played as an attempt at humor (i.e. apes smoking hash like humans in the Middle east), the set up of POTA was impressive, a little scary and, for a sci-fi fantasy movie, ""believeable.""But the logic holes kept building and compouding, so that in the second half of the movie, when even bigger holes appear, the thread is lost and the movie practically shouts, ""Hey! This is a summer movie! Don't think too hard!""I don't want to give away spoilers, so I'll avoid several thoughts about the ending. I will simply say that for the end to have occurred as it did requires multiple inconsistent assumptions about that kind of travel travel.Anyhow, one of my larger problems with POTA was the fact that the humans speak English, and in fact they speak the same language as the apes. Yet the apes still treat humans as animals. Now, I don't know about you, but if apes (or any other animal) on our earth started speaking English, I think my first reaction would be to INCREASE my respect and treatment of them, not LOWER it. The fact that apes treat humans appallingly, even though they KNOW they are as intelligent, is silly.This negates most of any kind of message about humans today treating other species badly. Hey, if my dog talked, I would feed him better food and give him his own room. I wouldn't do what these apes do.But then, the movie handles this inconsistently. In one scene, Thade seems shocked that one human look at him. Well, why wouldn't he? The humans can talk and walk and obviously are intelligent. Why wouldn't one look at the ape leader? It's not like they are the mute, cowed humans from the original POTA movie.Speaking of, Tim Roth does an OUTSTANDING job bringing Thade to life. He not only walks and moves as an ape, he moves with a sense of menace. Great job.The other apes, well, they are kind of ape-like. But unlike many reviewers, I didn't think they moved all that realistically. They looked like humans trying to move like apes.And there are lots and lots of convenient coicidences, like in one scene a spaceship showing up at just the right time to play a key role in an ongoing struggle. And a ship thousands of years old that has not only a power source (OK, I'll buy that), but devices that still work (like the wires and other more sensitive components would have lasted that long?).Still, I gave POTA a 7 because, huge holes aside, I just enjoyed it.

Instead it tries to be an incredibly entertaining summer movie, while still being intelligent and retaining Burton's gorgeous visual style. And with that in mind, it fully accomplishes its goals. First of all, the soundtrack, made by long-time Burton collaborator Danny Elfman is up to the composer's high standards. The brutal percussion-based sounds of his score fit the movie perfectly. The story is very satisfying and the ending is excellent. Touches of clever humor add to the script. But, of course, what steals the show is Burton's gift for creating memorable images and his army of apes, led by General Thade, a memorable character played to perfection by Tim Roth. For this movie, Burton often leaves his trademark dark and blue colors, but the movie still has his wonderful touch. As for the apes, they are very impressive. The cast is good, without having very hard jobs to do, but as I said earlier, Roth shines. So, this may not be Tim Burton's best movie, but it is the perfect summer entertainment, offered to you by one of history's greatest directors.85%",Planet of the Apes
228,kismit,Score one for Marky Mark,9,29 July 2001,When I first read that they were going to do this remake I thought it was a ridiculous idea. The original premise was so silly that I thought if there is one movie that did NOT cry out to be remade it was this one. I was incorrect in assuming this. The prosthetic makeup is so much better than the original(you can see the actor's real faces beneath the ape facade)that the biggest hurdle is immediately overcome. Tim Burton excels in working unusual concepts in his film and this is more of the same. Mark Wahlberg fits as the protagonist and while he is not Laurence Olivier the material isn't Shakespeare either. I went expecting little and was pleasantly surprised. With people staying away from the theatre in droves this summer I don't think the film will do that well in the box office but I will recommend it.,Planet of the Apes

There is one mildly entertaining action sequence, and there is the odd in-joke that works (most notably Charleton Heston's cameo), but that's about it as a MOVIE.As a technical exercise, this film displays little of Burton's usual brilliance, but Rick Baker's makeup definitely deserves special mention.

Tim Burton's dreadful spin on a four-star classic renders off a slickly produced, but lethal aroma of a movie, that, when looked at closely, would have even the gorillas at the Bronx Zoo scratching their heads in disbelief. Burton's big mistake (I think) was creating a different, unfamiliar ape universe from the previous series. Strangely, I believe the film he achieved in remaking here was the Wizard of the Oz. Mark Walberg, the lead, is no Charlton Heston. He's too short and grim. Someone needed to tell him to lighten up. He spends the entire film behaving like ""Dorothy."" I know. I know. He wishes to go home despite meeting two potential love connections--one human, one ape. AND he starts a global civil war for good measure. Nice fellow. He mopes around the planet like some kind of self-centered jerk. Tim Roth's character is the worst kind of evil: boring. He jumps around the cheap sets as if he was suffering from a terminal case of ants-in-his-pants. I did, however, enjoy Danny Elfman's pulsating score. And Rick Baker's make-up for the apes deserved more recognition and some awards. Also, I felt the Christo-like red tents, that the ape army used on their march across the wasteland, were beautiful and abstract. There are occasional stabs at social commentary--but they fall flat.

Tim Roth plays 'psycho' for the whole film. In fact, except for Bonham-Carter and Tagawa (Krull, the disgraced soldier gorilla), the acting is horrendous for a movie this expensive.

Rick Baker's makeup is a marvel, and more than makes up for his King Kong debacle of 25 years ago -- even though they still can't seem to create an ape mask that doesn't make the actors lisp. The action sequences are fast-paced and brutal, and the actors do such a marvelous job ... er ... apeing the moves of primates you're forgiven if you think Burton tossed a silverback or two into the melee just to liven things up.Mark Wahlberg is a disappointment as Leo, coming off as a one-dimensional jerk. The only times he shows any real humanity is when he interacts with a favorite (real) chimp, though he's certainly capable in the action sequences.Helena Botham Carter as the cute, human-loving Ari is the best thing in the movie, presenting a very well-rounded character when she isn't making lovey dovey eyes at Leo (best not to think about it too much). Estella Warren as a sexy slavegirl gets to show off the best lips in Hollywood, engage in an aborted catfight with Ari, wear very little, and go off in a huff of jealousy when Leo seems to want to spend more time with Ari. I get the strong feeling her best moments were left on the cutting room floor. It's always good to see David Warner and Kris Kristofferson, though their time on screen is brief.Tim Roth is fun and scary to watch as the villain, Gen. Thade, while Michael Clarke Duncan makes a menacing figure as Thade's right hand ape.Look fast for Linda Harrison -- the original slave girl in the original movie. Rick Baker himself also appears as an ape. And Burton's longtime love Lisa Marie makes her obligatory appearance, with a funny bit as a snotty, horny ape.The biggest laugh in the file comes from an otherwise dramatic cameo by original film star Charlton Heston. I won't spoil the reasons why it's funny -- only clue: it's not just in the dialogue.Nor will I spoil the ending. I was confused by it at first until I realized... it was CLASSIC Rod Serling. Once I realized Burton was paying homage to the Twilight Zone -- and let's not forget Serling co-wrote the original film -- everything fell into place.My only advice to Burton is to let sleeping apes lie and not attempt to reimagine the other films in the original Apes series. This is a good one-off, but best to move on to the next idea.",Planet of the Apes
236,EdYerkeRobins,Definitely Something to Go Ape Over!,10,30 July 2001,"Sorry, I couldn't resist the bad pun.  Ah... finally, this summer there is a true summer movie, featuring not only the big budget, cool special effects and the action, but also a seasonable plot and acting to rake in tons of teenagers' (as well as their parents') summer-job money.While I don't know/care to discuss the budget, it certainly went to good use.  The make-up effects are amazing (the make-up in the original was just as amazing when it was released, but look how far make-up artistry has come!); the big action scenes near the end featuring flank after flank of the ape army are truly a sight to behold.  Unlike in the original series, there are multiple species of ape on this planet, including chimpanzees, gorillas, and even a few orangutans.  All look amazingly realistic, physically way more intimidating than any ""human"" character could ever hope to be.  It must have been a nightmare for the actors under the makeup though.Besides, looking fantastic, the apes actually act like apes!  It's just so interesting and exciting to see an ape character such as General Thade yelling at someone in English, then jumping and climbing around, screeching in anger.  Next to that, it's really not possible for the human actors to contend at all... I mean they're not bad, but they are easily overshadowed by the apes, especially the soldiers, who not only look menacing, but through their harsh tones of voice and shrill screeches, are menacing.  It's too easy to forget that there were originally people underneath all those apes. Along with their appearance and manner, the apes' society is also interesting.  There is an ape religion, with the belief in a soul (and subsequent belief that the human ""animals"" don't have souls).  Other aspects of their society mentioned in the film include inter-special marriage (e.g. a chimp and an orangutan), a senatorial government, and humans, depending on age, sold as pets or slaves; there are even ""human rights"" activists.  While it may not offer as much social commentary as the original series, it's still enthralling enough, and it's great that the writers decided to offer details on the ape's religion, which is also a vital part of the plot near the end.  The only complaint I could offer about the society portrayed is that, like the original film series and unlike the book, the apes don't use vehicles.The unfortunate thing about summer films is that they usually end up sucking a few years later, as they are based solely on the special effects.  Tim Burton and crew have broken that mold with Planet of the Apes, which holds through all the way to the twist/ending (which is different from the original, and, though definitely an unexpected surprise, just a little bit of a let down).  See it for the special effects, and see it again for the intricacies of the ape society, religion and plot.",Planet of the Apes
237,MadReviewer,"Not As Good As The Original, But Still Reasonably Entertaining",7,6 August 2001,"Tim Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"" is not a remake of the original version of the film, but rather a ""re-imagining"" or different take of that original material.  Wise move.  The original ""Apes"" is a film that still holds its own as an all-time sci-fi classic; pretty much any attempt to remake it faithfully would wind up like Gus Van Sant's remake of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". . . a pale imitation of greatness.  By ""reimagining"" the original film, Burton gives himself the opportunity to start with the established mythology of the ""Apes"" series, as well as the ability to travel in a new direction with that mythology.  The end result?  The new ""Planet of the Apes"" is nothing Earth-shattering (pardon the pun) -- in ten or twenty years, it won't be looked at with the same reverence or respect as the original ""Apes"" -- but it's still good, and brings enough new ideas to the table to make a reasonably entertaining film.The story, which ranges in spots from good to barely mediocre, possesses some serious gaps of logic and suffers from an awkward opening.  The first fifteen minutes of the film makes little sense, and lurches along aimlessly for awhile until it stumbles into the heart of its story.  (Examples of some nonsense: Couldn't chimp-piloted ships simply be controlled by computers? Would highly experimental exploration pods be able to launch from a space station just by one rogue pilot punching in a two-second launch sequence?) The opening of the film admittedly does make more sense by the end of the film, but it's still not very good.  It appears as though the writers thought of a solid middle and ending for their version of ""Planet of the Apes"" . . . but had no idea how to get the story past the opening credits to that middle and ending.  The weak beginning seems like their best attempt to get the story moving to those points.  As for the rest of the story, it contains a lot of good, even original elements, but some points are glossed over in a rather hurried fashion -- there's little effort made to explore some plot threads, and some of the explanations as to how and why things happen in the film are either weak or come completely out of left field. The story's excellent  . . . for a second draft.  I've read that Twentieth Century Fox rushed this new version of ""Planet of the Apes"" into production. Too bad.  The story and script could've been excellent -- and more important, solid throughout  -- with some more work.Despite the uneven story, though, director Tim Burton does a nice job, given the script he has to work with.  If nothing else, Burton has a knack for giving films an eccentric look, and his version of ""Planet of the Apes"" benefits greatly from his eccentric touch.  He evokes a lot of the weird imagery of the original films (the weird scarecrows, the desolate landscapes) without ever blatantly stealing from them.  He also does a great job when it comes to focusing on the smaller, quieter moments in the movie -- for example, there's a macabre scene where a child ape puts her pet human in its cage for the night that manages to be disturbing and funny at the same time.  Burton, though, doesn't appear to have a clear idea of the overall tone of the movie.  In ""Planet of the Apes"", he goes for a blend of action, comedy, and seriousness . . . but the blend doesn't always work. Some of the humor seems out of place, and the action often seems stilted, as if Burton didn't know what to do with the apes apart from having them leap around menacingly.  The film is one of Burton's better efforts, but much like the script, the direction contains a few distinct weak spots.
As for the actors . . . again, it's a mixed bag.  The apes comprise the stronger half of the cast, which makes sense, since the apes are the weirder of the two groups - and Tim Burton specializes in weird.  In regards to the human characters, Burton would've been better off making the humans in his version of ""Planet of the Apes"" more like the humans in the original film - mute.  Apart from the protagonist Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), none of them add anything of import to the film anyway. The highlights of the individual actors come from mostly from the main characters.  Tim Roth nails the part of villainous General Thade perfectly - he's one of the best sci-fi screen villains to appear on screen in quite awhile. Wahlberg plays Captain Leo Davidson in a manner similar to Heston in the original film; he's a man who's not terribly interested in contemplating how he arrived at a planet ruled by intelligent apes . . . he just knows he wants to leave.  Fast. He's a pragmatic hero, one who reluctantly tries to help others in distress, but doesn't want to die in the process.  Also worth mentioning is Paul Giamatti, who provides some much-needed comic relief as the peculiar orangutan slaver Limbo.  On the other side of the acting coin, the biggest disappointment came from Helena Bonham Carter as Ari.  Given the poor quality of her character in the screenplay, she does what she can for her character, but all she really does for the whole film is to go around being nice to humans.  Period.  Some reasons as to WHY Ari feels so passionately about helping humans would've been nice.Tim Burton's `Planet of the Apes' is an action movie that manages to take some of the influences of the original `Apes' films, and then creates something eccentric and new.  Does it always work?  No, although in general, the good outweighs the bad.  Is it better than the original?  Absolutely not.  In a summer filled with blockbuster duds, though, there's something to be said for a film that provides some thrills and some fun, and the new `Planet of Apes' does exactly that.  Overall, it's an enjoyable film; it's just not a spectacular one.  Grade: B",Planet of the Apes
238,tampaaries,F#ck the Critics,10,30 October 2021,"This was an awesome movie and I don't care what anybody say, it wasn't a perfect movie but it was very entertaining and kept your attention the whole way and this was the movie that showed me how good of an Actor Mark Wahlberg is, he was great in this movie.",Planet of the Apes
239,markymark70,One word - Rubbish.,3,14 April 2008,"Where do I even start with this one? I saw the original Planet of the Apes a long time ago on TV but I do not remember much about it to be honest. I saw this DVD on sale in the local DVD store for 2.50 - so I bought it. First mistake. Let me start with the director / plot. Tim Burton is a hot and cold director for me - I loved Scissorhands but not Batman. He's a gifted individual for sure but not everyone's cup of tea. Certainly not mine. However, he must have been on some sort of sedative when he decided to do this movie. The script was poor to say the least - which could have been written by a team of monkeys - such are the glaring inconsistencies and holes in it. I read somewhere that Wahlberg agreed to do this within 5 minutes of meeting Burton. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that he never read the script because if he had - then I don't think he'd be so ready to sign on. The sets on this film looked just like they are - i.e. sets. Never was I ever convinced I was on a space station or in a spaceship or in an Ape city. Everything looked like it was made of cardboard and plastic and inside a huge hangar. I was extremely disappointed with Burton here as he has gone out of his way in the past for visually fantastic creations - here it is just lazy. Some of the cuts in the ""action"" scenes were laughable. Wahlberg supposedly gets thrown a distance of 30 to 40 feet in one scene and lands on the ground with a thud. The cut to him landing looks like he just jumped two feet onto the sand. Poor editing and no excuse for a director this experienced. Now the cast. Wahlberg - I must admit that he is a likable guy in movies normally and gets by. He always seems like a guy out of his depth though and someone punching above his weight. His brother Donnie is the more talented actor of the two - but because of Marky Mark's physique and modelling background, he gets the better gigs. Here though, he carries about as much dramatic weight as a wet rag. He whispers his lines without any tension or pathos - so much so that we as an audience do not care what happens to him. As I was watching, his character made no connection with me at all. He goes out in a pod in space, he crashes, he gets captured - and all the while I don't really care. Some of this is obviously script-related, but Marky has to take some of the blame too. Personally, I don't think he was ready to lead a movie at this stage of his career. He doesn't have an ounce of charisma. Roth - A talented actor normally - reduced to looking like ""Teen Wolf"" here and snarling in almost every scene to an off-screen object whilst close to the camera. He chews the scenery but underneath all that make-up he must have been so embarrassed. I was embarrassed watching him for God's sake so I cannot imagine how he felt. Bonham-Carter - The best of a bad lot to be fair. But she looked scarily like Michael Jackson that it put me off each time I laid eyes on her. But I thought she did the best she could with what she had. Warren - her part was just pure eye candy. Her character had no relevance to anything. Kristofferson - barely spoke and killed off early. Lucky him. Giamatti - unrecognisable under the make-up. Comic relief part only that wasn't even very funny.What's left to criticise here? It is not the worst film in the world - but it is not far off it. The ending just beggars belief. You will find yourself shouting the word ""What???"" at the screen on at least 5 occasions in the last 10 minutes - at plot contrivances that are so absurd, you'd wonder did ANYONE read the script before shooting began.A dead-in-the-water movie that in all honesty I would recommend only to my sworn enemy.3/10 - and the 3 is just for Estella Warren's lips alone.",Planet of the Apes
240,Rhino Rover,Consistency please...and a different ending.,6,14 August 2001,"Where should I start? The hype for this movie came out months before its release and generated a lot of interest, including mine. Mind you I've never really seen the original movie, at least not all of it. But from the promos and interviews, this was Tim Burton's version of the movie, which was basically a bit more up-to-date, realistic, and cutting edge. But I couldn't help but wonder what or who would allow the ending they chose to be shown. Let me warn you that there may be spoilers in this review.The basic premise to this movie revolves around a scientist (Mark Wahlberg) getting stranded on a planet years into the future. The situation arises because of a strange anomaly they encounter in space and at the time, humans were using chimps as test pilots to send into unknown or high-risk situations. Their test pilot was sent in to examine the anomaly (which was to do nothing more than to do a fly-by) and suddenly vanished. Wahlberg's character, being the softhearted scientist, against wishes flew in to rescue the test pilot and himself disappears only to reappear hundreds of years into the future to crash land on a strange planet. He discovers very quickly that humans are not the dominant species on this planet but apes are and he is quickly rounded up to be a slave. His only driving goal from that moment on is to escape and somehow get back to his crewmates.
To be honest, the storyline isn't very strong, nor is it overly intelligent. The audience is given a very basic premise and is told to go along with it. However, if it weren't for the ending, I think a lot of people wouldn't have minded. There are little things throughout the movie that make you wonder how it's possible that something could happen. One of the major ones is that in the future on this strange planet, apes have evolved into intelligent speech cable creatures. But they allegedly came from the science station that Wahlberg's character came from as a result of them coming to search for him and crash landing on this planet. However, the science station was using chimps as their test pilots so where did all these apes come from?? As well, there are humans on this planet, which the movie at one point indicates that the entire crew of the science station was killed by the chimps when they turned on them. Where did all these humans come fromand the horses?? Yes there are horses! It seems for the sake of making this movie they made a lot of assumptions and conveniences but the audience is not that dumb. They will pick it out and they will remember when the sequel comes out. There's no doubt about the sequel. The ending was left in such a way that a sequel would be created. Was there anything I liked about this movie? Well they did remain accurate on ape movements and that element created a sense of fear and menace that the apes in the original movie didn't quite have. The make-up and special effects were pretty good but then Tim Burton has always been good at those areas. Overall I wasn't overly impressed. The movie was acceptable up until the ending and after what I saw for an ending, it kind of ruined everything prior to that. It sounds like I'm being harsh but if you don't believe me, go ahead and see this movie. Just don't write back to me complaining about it because I warned you. On a scale of 1  10, I give it a 5. I thought it could have been much better. Not enough time spent on developing a reasonable and logical plot line.",Planet of the Apes
241,jtpaladin,Burton disappoints again,1,10 February 2003,"This film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was sort of a remake but then again, not really. I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal. He had great make up and CGI available and lots of money ($100 million) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than $6 million? Heck no. So in that regard, the film fails.At least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming. And, by the way, if you give it some thought, and I did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. I just wish I had back the time that I wasted thinking about it.This film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"". Here's how I would have written it:An astronaut (it really should have been more than Marky Mark because he's not good enough to care a film all by himself so I would have put in three guys) that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they're on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it.But my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. Sadly, Tim Burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He's a rotten director inspite what of people think. He's trendy so he must be good goes the thinking. Sorry, but no. If anyone else had done this film, it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying.",Planet of the Apes
242,SwingBatta,Burton provides an entertaining yet flawed ape escape,8,3 September 2001,"Tim Burton has a unique, dark style that sets him far apart from other filmmakers of his generation, and he has a knack for getting the best efforts from his crews and actors.His ""reimagining"" of ""Planet of the Apes"" is a rare instance in which those qualities never come to the fore. I won't bother with prattle comparing this to the 1968 original, simply because I haven't seen it and don't plan to anytime soon.He brings back nearly the entire crew he worked with on the superior ""Sleepy Hollow""  costume designer Colleen Atwood, production designer Rick Heinrichs, editor Chris Lebenzon, and composer Danny Elfman, but this formidable unit fails to fully click this time around.Makeup guru Rick Baker (the ""Nutty Professor"" series) is responsible for the impressive simian facades, but most of the time they look instead like very expensive Halloween masks that muddle the actors' voices. The diction left much to be desired; some characters speak too low and fast (I sat in the fourth row and the theater had THX sound), and some baritone-voiced males sound as if they're talking with their mouths full.The acting is adequate but sometimes as stiff as the monkey mugs, starting with a wooden Mark Wahlberg as the centerpiece of the film, Leo Davidson. He is an Air Force captain, yet he works way up in space. The setup for his eventual crash landing onto the Planet of the Apes is flimsy and rushed. When that time comes, he doesn't look too concerned about being alone and stranded, and eventually imprisoned, in a strange new world, and he goes through the film as if this is all small potatoes to him.Thanks to bad dialogue, he inadvertently forges what may turn out to be the new pickup line of the 21st century: ""I can show you something that will change your world forever.""Needless to say, the simians are the best thespians, and that's not saying much. Tim Roth hams it up to the hilt as the villain Thade, but he can only do so much in a movie of this style. His chief henchman, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, verbally berates and knocks a few humans around here and there, and snarls lines such as, ""Get your stinkin' hands off me, you filthy human!"" and ""Bow your heads!""  And, that's it.Helena Bonham Carter is solid as Brit-accented human sympathizer Ari. Coincidentally, out of all the Apes, she looks the most human as well (and is nearly a dead ringer for Michael Jackson). Paul Giamatti, on the other hand, is annoying as Limbo the orangutan, the film's thin attempt at comic relief.The weakest link, as if it isn't too obvious, is Leo's gang of human fugitives, especially an annoying teenage boy and the token Black man whom we all know will get knocked off at some point in the film. They have no personality and serve no purpose in the plot whatsoever except to chip in with a cheesy line here and there. Supermodel Estella Warren, playing a slave girl whose father (Kris Kristofferson) is killed by the Apes, is as pointless as a broken pencil. Her skimpy outfit contained more depth than her screen presence. Most of her activity consists of staring into space with her mouth agape.By the way, I didn't realize the Planet of the Apes contained any beauty salons, because she manages to look like she just stepped out of one whenever she appears on screen.Oh, and Burton brings aboard his squeeze Lisa Marie once again for no apparent reason. This time around, she's buried under an Ape mask. As usual, she has nothing to do here except display her one-dimensional feminine wiles.The cinematography, courtesy of Phillippe Rousselot, does a nice job of stressing the foreboding, moonlit jungle environment. It's the only saving grace of the lackluster action sequences, especially in the beginning just after Leo crash-lands and finds himself in the middle of a wild huntdown of humans by Ape soldiers. Elfman comes through on the music front; because of his powerful score, I loved the opening credits sequence.Unfortunately, while Heinrichs' sets are always a visual treat, they aren't as gripping as his Oscar-winning work from SH. They are small and constricted due to the fact that there are sometimes too many characters cavorting on the screen. Upon seeing the Apes' village for the first time, I couldn't help but think of the planet Endor from ""Return of the Jedi."" The wreckage of Leo's USAF space station, however, is fantastic. It's also the location of a surprising twist in the story.Now to the plot. The reason why it falters for the most part is what ultimately crippled ""Shrek"": it has an unpleasant air of preachiness to it. By itself, the plot is as thin as Wahlberg's music career, but in a twist that seems rather uncharacteristic of Burton, ""Apes"" plays the race card. This I didn't care for. I'm aware that this angle is in the original, but it's a white elephant in Burton's version.And yes, an Ape actually utters those infamous six words...I'm sure you know what they are.The suspense factor is all but nil, and the plot twists leave behind numerous holes, such as, for example, the controls on the destroyed space station being able to work despite the wreck apparently being thousands of years old. (Plus, where did all those horses, the Apes' sole means of transportation, come from?)Then there is the well-publicized ""love triangle"" between Wahlberg, Carter and Warren that Burton hinted at in interviews. To make a long story short, if you plan to watch this solely on the basis of seeing this angle, you're in for a disappointment.Sorry, but I won't waste my breath on Charlton Heston's forgettable pot-and-kettle cameo.Save for the aforementioned chase sequence after Leo's crash landing, the action and fight scenes are pathetic. Simple punches send both humans and Apes flying a few dozen feet into the air. And don't ask the Apes to hit targets in the water that are two feet from the shore. The huge Apes-humans showdown near the end is a yawner.The much-ballyhooed ending is both surprising and ambiguous. Though Burton has vehemently denied any rumors of his helming a sequel, the conclusion is like that of a comic book and does leave the door wide open for a second installment.The film's most comical moments occurred offscreen. Before shooting began, the actors had to undergo ""ape training"" to learn primate mannerisms, and spent hours in makeup before stepping in front of the cameras. On ""failing"" ape school, Bonham Carter quipped, ""I was told I had AADD  Ape Attention Deficit Disorder."" On becoming an Ape: ""It's flattering to be cast as a chimp, because you know they haven't cast you for what you look like."" Duncan hurt his ankle while filming a pivotal scene with Kristofferson, who slipped, fell, crashed into Duncan and wound up having to get stitches. Duncan was rushed to the hospital (yes, rushed for a turned ankle  that's Hollywood for ya), in full makeup, no less. When he announced himself to a room full of patients, they burst into applause.While ""Planet of the Apes"" has some major flaws, it doesn't mean it's not entertaining, which it indeed is, but it just doesn't have that signature Tim Burton look and feel to it. It's ultimately just another Hollywood action flick.After all is said and done, his best effort to date still remains ""Sleepy Hollow.""  7.5/10",Planet of the Apes
243,CatTales,Great effects but misses the point of the story,5,27 July 2001,"This slick version fleshes out the brutal details of the original but lacks its memorable storyline, social commentary, vision and beautiful original soundtrack. The metaphoric value of the book/original film are lost by the fact that humans here can already speak - english as usual -so the only superiority the apes have is physical. In fact, since all the humans were killed on the space station, who were all those long-haired Harley Biker dudes (the ""humans"") descended from?  Without the constant philosophical criticism of man's evil nature(throw in guilt and original sin too, what the heck), it turns into Humans versus hairy Roman empire-Mafiosa-Nazi-etc.-type aliens (Tim Roth is a composite of many movie evil archetypes). It looks like they borrowed the plot twists and F/X from the new ""Lost in Space"" movie, but that movie didn't really have to compete with the original series. The ending is reminiscent of the book BUT doesn't make sense in terms of time travel in our universe, so if he went back in time in an alternate universe, all quantum universes being equal, then it's just a coincidence he returns to an ape-ruled earth (rather than an INEVITABILITY which was THE POINT in the book/original film). To put it another way, if Burton's movie came first, noone would be inspired to remake it 30 years. Great effects, costumes and menacing apes but very uninspiring.",Planet of the Apes

245,Nigel St. Buggering,"Burton slips slightly, but still very entertaining",7,29 July 2001,"This new version (I can't quite call it a remake) of a sci fi classic doesn't seem determined to light up brain cells, question our place in nature, or examine our society and our attitude toward ""lesser beasts"". It's just a good, exciting science fiction adventure film, and on that level, it succeeds quite well with only a few small stumbles.Tim Burton remains the only director I can name who has never made a film I don't like.  You might call me biased, but I do go into every new Burton film afraid that this will be the one.  Fortunately, I'm still waiting.So why is this not a remake?  Well, there are no characters from the original story (either the novel OR the film), and the situation is significantly altered.  While still being the story of an astronaut who lands in a strange new ape-dominated world, very little else is the same. Only a few lines of dialogue intended to evoke the 1968 film remind us.What's good?  First, of course, is Rick Baker's absolutely astounding makeup.  The original appliances still stand up quite well, so this was a nightmare assignment for any makeup artist.  Baker is one of the very few who could handle it, and handle it he does.  There has never been such amazingly detailed, expressive work in the history of film; the actors are able to come right through the latex and hair.  Too much praise cannot be heaped upon his work.  Then there's the patented Tim Burton visual approach; this is easily his best-looking film since ""Edward Scissorhands"", and really helps to lend the proceedings an otherworldly appearance.  The acting from the performers in the roles of apes is uniformly excellent, particularly Tim Roth in one of the most frightening villain roles I've seen in years.  He truly gives the impression of being dangerously unpredictable; a genuinely great movie psycho.  Mention must also be made of Danny Elfman's score, his most dynamic and interesting in years.  It recalls Goldsmith's work just enough to remind us of what we're watching, while also moving into new territory.What doesn't work?  Well, the humans.  They talk, but have nothing of consequence to say.  Why is Estella Warren so much cleaner than everyone else, and where did she get that lipstick?  And if she's intended to be a love interest for Wahlberg, shouldn't they have a conversation or two?  And sadly, we're given only the barest peek at the ape society before our heroes escape and return to the wilderness.  I really would like to have seen more of their culture.Now, the ending has already become much-debated and argued over across the Internet and elsewhere.  First off, I like the ending.  While it may not have quite the punch of the original's, I think it's a good twist for those going in expecting a twist (and weren't we all?).  Without revealing too much, let's just say that the screenwriters have obviously read the novel.In conclusion, this is an entertaining and exciting sci-fi adventure.  It won't open up your mind much, and it may not be among Burton's best works, but it's a lot of fun, and has a great deal to admire.  7 out of 10.",Planet of the Apes

When I want an okay film, it sucks; when I think it'll be bad, it is; and whenever I think it'll be good, it's okay, and that isn't good enough. Here, I thought it would be bad. Tim Burton's remake (I'm not calling it a reimagining, it doesn't deserve such a title) was such a bad film, that whereas I thought in the theater, it was closer to the ""okay"" line, now I think it was closer to the evil of Tomb Raider.

The final scenes where he gets back to Earth were cool-replacing the Abraham Lincoln statue with an ape-but it leaves a plot hole bigger than my lust for death after the film. If Earth's humans get turned into apes like that, how the f*** did Leo stay human? (I'll leave out the words next in my mind, because the IMDb would reject this thing.)

249,Clive-Silas,Burton is no good as a gun-for-hire director,3,13 March 2003,"If there's one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film, it's seeing it done by experienced film-makers who ought to know better. This ""re-imagining"" of Planet of the Apes could have used some imagination, to say nothing of essential elements of character development. Nova, the girl in the original Planet of the Apes, was a better developed character than Daena in this version, for all that she does not say a single word. One certainly expected a lot better from Tim Burton, a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence, wit and humour, all of which were notably absent from this production.There were problems in basic plot development. The first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk. This was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made *all* the difference in the original film. Even while he was mute, his ability to communicate was what marked out Heston's Taylor as being different from the other humans. In the current film, Mark Wahlberg encourages the (talking) human slaves to revolt, but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already. They are dexterous tool-users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans, something mute humans can't do. It needs no man to fall from the stars to save them. Indeed, since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pre-technology era without (at first) any gadgets to help him, it is Wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage, not the humans who are used to living there.It was sad to see Helena Bonham Carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall Mark Wahlberg. Her best scenes were with the villainous Tim Roth.The humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act, at which point Daena started showing some actual interest in Davidson (Wahlberg), and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gung-ho freedom-fighter. This was poor character development. (Estella Warren, in particular, looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script). Wahlberg's puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me, as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout.Creating the apes: half a plus point and two minuses: Ape make-up was excellent on the males, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes (which was why he was so good in The Green Mile), and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully. But the ape females looked like nothing on earth, neither ape nor human. The minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as Flash Gordon's rocket: jumping apes looked as if they'd just been fired from a catapult, they had none of the long-limbed grace of genuine apes. Secondly, the poor sound mixing - when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal, probably feline, making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic.In the original film, the various ""human"" things the apes do and say are handled as light relief (""I never knew an ape I didn't like."" ""Human see, human do!""). Here, the apes just talk matter-of-factly exactly as 21st Century humans do, and there is no humour in it at all. The only genuinely original idea was Ari writing with her feet.Nothing made me cringe more than the ""V-Ger from Star Trek"" moment near the end of the film. First of all, the apes had apparently been able to read Roman lettering in the distant past, for them to know the name of the Forbidden Zone in its partly concealed form. Secondly, the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which Wahlberg just brushes away, something any ape could have done centuries ago. This moment was, for me, far worse than the much-maligned ending of the movie.Things of that nature, however, are typical of most science fiction movies of today. Back in the '60s and '70s, they generally didn't have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets, but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional. I'm thinking of 2001: A Space Odyssey, the 1967 Planet of the Apes, THX1138, Soylent Green, Silent Running and the 1972 Solaris. The first Planet of the Apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time. However, this film includes just about every bad science fiction cliché going: space storms, anomalies and worm holes straight out of Star Trek; the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes (in reality from any one planet, all other bodies, even their own moons, are just points of light); a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from Saturn to Earth in a matter of minutes instead of years; two-thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button. To say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door. In a contemporary setting, you'd have to explain *why* it was bullet proof, but because it's ""science fiction"" you don't have to!Overall, Burton's most disappointing film.",Planet of the Apes
250,videofreak2002,Remake + Tim Burton = Excellent Movie,10,29 July 2001,"This movie was by far another wonderful movie from one of my favorite directors, Tim Burton.  I loved all his other movies  (""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Beetlejuice,"" ""Batman,"" etc.)  but it had everything I wanted from a Tim Burton movie- special effects, great cast, wonderful score (composed by the great Danny Elfman),  and a surprise ending.  It's just like the 1968 original ""Planet of the Apes,"" but, the new one's different.  I recommend this movie to anybody who's looking for a good movie this summer or who's a Tim Burton fan.

251,watto124,I loved it!,9,29 July 2001,"The new Planet of the Apes flick is sheer entertainment from the very beginning, right down to the insanely amusing finish. Tim Burton directed it, but it doesn't seem like a Tim Burton film. He seemed to want to pay more of an homage to the original than change it with the distinguished macabre feel of his other films. The story is great. It has been modified a bit, but nothing has really changed. Everyone in the film is superb especially Paul Giamatti as the wise-cracking comic relief. Though some of the plot twists and situations don't really make much practical sense, they are all interesting and brilliant. A+!!

I'll give the make-up artists (e.g., Rick Baker) credit. Bravo. And Danny Elfman's opening score was interesting. But otherwise, this movie was utter crap. (small spoilers follow) First we get this DS9-like space station shot with the wonderful title card that informs us that it's the year 2029!!! Hello! I knew right then that this was going to suck. Science fiction needs to be smart. Then he finds himself on the Ape Planet and the next 90% of the movie is just simple ""escape and chase"". Yawn... But to try and make it interesting they throw in some cliché and ever-not-so-subtle comments on racism and religion. The script was lousy, let's face it. Then the end of the movie improves slightly (this doesn't say much) until we get the ""surprise"" ending. Whatever. Tim Burton has the imagery skills but except from Edward Scissorhands and Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, I'd say he's a failure as far as making good stories. The similarities between Planet of the Apes and Battlefield Earth are remarkable. And considering how lousy that movie was, why would anybody allow this script to pass? Certainly a better movie could have been made from the same idea. Oh well, it already has.",Planet of the Apes

His films are usually dark but beautiful spectacles in my opinion.Sometimes I wonder why people take movie plots so seriously.In the original, a lot of political statements were made (not unusual for Sci Fi films of that area).  It was safe in that genre to make political statements that would be blasted in other genres.The original Planet of the Apes series adequately addressed the issues of the time.  What would be the purpose of reiterating it in 2001?I actually liked the plot.  It was an interesting take or twist of the original.  There was some tongue and cheek dialogue as well.  The ending was the kind the either you liked or thought was really corny.  I liked the ending though, even if it did catch me off guard.I really liked the movie and would buy the video when it becomes available. I am really happy though, I saw it on the big screen.The choice of actors was excellent, I think Tim Roth stole the show, he was so convincing and seemed to enjoy every minute.  I was impressed with the good job that all the actors did.  It did not look easy.I wonder what Tim Burton will do next.  He is truly an artist.",Planet of the Apes

To be honest, today's youngsters aren't likely to watch a film from the 60's anyway, so it was quite acceptable, and logical, to update it. And what an update!

Like I did....... I thought that the special F/X were great, the costumes were pretty well designed, and the scenery was very enticing to the eye and mind.  Granted, the dialog was mostly silly at best, but again, for an entertaining film with interesting effects and a nice twist on the Ape saga, Go see this movie.  It may be good on DVD with surround sound speakers on a big TV, but if you don't have that, go see this while still at the theaters.  I think that the graphics and visuals will be lost on small screen.  I gave it 7 out of 10 - just for shear entertainment of the flick, not anything more than that.....

This movie came on TV, non letterbox, not that it would matter for the piece of junk it is. Bland story, uninteresting characters....oh what a waste of time. I got about 50% of the way through, then realized I had much better things to do and wasn't going to waste my time. So I did jump to the last 10-15 minutes to catch the infamous ending.

Well that's what has to do with the movie ""Planet of the Apes.""And as we are aware when making a pact with ""the devil"", it must bear the consequences.This ""Remake"" is a bunch of bland action movie any. The dwarf ""Tim Roth"" is really funny to want to do too much. Moreover it should stop doing action films of science fiction (as Al Pacino). This kind of movie is not really for people of small sizes. It is like seeing actresses frail and without muscles (Jennifer Garner, Jennifer Lopez, etc.). Making action movies.

259,Hellrazr360,A Remake That Assumes You Don't Know It's a Remake,6,17 July 2008,"I'm one of the few people out there that made the mistake of seeing Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes a good while before seeing the original. What kept on making me look away from the 1968 original more or less was the fact that it's over twice as old as me, which I guess you could attribute to me as being ignorant. And after hearing so much complaining about this remake with me and my best friend not seeing why (who also had never seen the original), we decided to just rent both this and the original and see what the fuss was all about.I think after seeing the ending alone you know how I feel.If I'm not mistaken, this film was handed down to several directors before Tim Burton was finally ""credited"" as the main director (and towards the end of the film's production unless I've misread something). Either way this film really doesn't feel like a Burton film to me, if it did I'd be calling this film ""gritty"" or ""dark""; at least, for a few of the scenes. But other than some great visual style and excellent make-up on the apes it's tough for me to mention Tim Burton along with this film, it just doesn't feel like something he actually directed; not the whole way at least.It's funny that this film is supposed to be a ""remake"" when the only things it has in-common with the original are the name and the fact that the apes are superior to the humans. This is another odd thing that another reviewer pointed out; the apes don't seem to have that much over the humans other than brute strength most of the time. Whereas in the original the apes were both tougher and far more intelligent than the humans.Outside of this the film has little to nothing in-common with the original. The plot, characters, location(s) and even the ending are all different from the original. The only similarity you might be able draw is that one of the apes (a female that sees the humans as more than the other apes give them credit for) decides to help a few of them escape the ape city and go to the lands of their origins. Beyond this, and maybe a select few throwbacks to the original (the scarecrows part was pretty clever) you might be wondering if this is really a remake or just a very different re-imagining.As I mentioned earlier, this version has some great art/visual style and excellent make-up on the apes, which are even better than those of the original (even though in this day and age it's really a given for that to be the case if enough effort is put in). Really this is the film's biggest strength because outside of all the excellence visually there isn't much of a film to be had. The performances from almost everyone is average at best. Mark Wahlberg really isn't given too much to work with and you'll get plenty of his typical ""shocked"" stares. Tim Roth as General Thade actually does pretty well with his character and is arguably the most effective character. Needless to say, Helena Bonham Carter was intentionally given a bit more of a human look than the other apes, possibly to reflect her character's views on the humans in the film. Michael Clarke Duncan does well with what he's given and while he likely won't stand out for many he is a very convincing character given his size and voice (hopefully that doesn't sound too odd). Everyone else just feels like they're tagging along so there really isn't much to praise in the characters or actors other than that two of the main ape characters were handled very well. Oh, and I thought the cameo with Charles Heston was neat.Aside from this, a fun battle towards the end with the rebel humans and apes and an ending that'll likely leave those that haven't seen it puzzled as to what exactly happened, there really isn't too much to the film. My biggest problem with the ending is that we likely will never get an answer or resolution to it because of how negative the reception has been towards the film. I hate it when movie studios and the crew make a movie and leave room for a sequel but they never fully take into account possibility that the film will flop or just not do well. And in this film's case we're stuck with a film that had and in a sense still does have potential but are left asking ""when"" and ""what"".This film is very, very different from the '68 classic it's based on and as a result, it assumes you haven't seen the remake; or at least hopes you didn't. Since I saw this one before the original, my views on this remake were defensive and while I think it's far from as bad as some might make it out (and even as I myself might have made it out as well), it's very tough to fully appreciate it after seeing the original. So if you haven't seen this film yet (or even the original for that matter), I would personally see this one first so you can make a verdict on the film itself, then see the original and then make up your mind. As for those that have seen the original but not this, just go into it with an open mind and don't expect the same movie. And if anyone has seen both and wants to at least try and like this movie, try and watch it without having the original in mind. Keep the original in mind, and this film stinks. See this as its own film, and you should be able to find some redeeming values.",Planet of the Apes
260,mikhail080,"""Apes"" gone Hollywood",10,4 August 2001,"I remember the original quite well, it having made a great impact on me as a 10 year-old boy.  I remember awaiting each sequel as it arrived in theaters in the 70s.  Tim Burton's film comes as totally different take on POTA, and this time with mind-blowing makeup and outrageous action sequences.Movie-goers who cannot appreciate the joys of ""Planet of the Apes"" have become too mired down in investigating plot-points and errors in logic -- all of which could be explained away by any talented sci-fi writer.  Tim Burton (surely one of today's greatest film makers) isn't concerned with exposition and plot contrivances -- only in entertaining his audience like a great showman would.  And that he does in a big way with this epic-scale adventure, which hardly resembles the original 1968 movie in character or theme, so pre-conceptions best be left at the door.Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"" supplies more black comedy than the first, often jumping over-the-top in its ability to constantly amaze and amuse the viewer.  The scene of a ""mixed"" ape dinner party has to have the most outrageous and amazing makeup effects ever created.  Tim Roth as bad-to-the-bone chimpanzee General Thade is terrifying, evil and ugly and probably gives the best performance among excellent company.  Mark Wahlberg makes for a perfect leading man, understated in manners and voice as a contrast to the bizarre and outlandish apes.  And Paul Giamatti as Limbo (a stand-in for old orange Dr Zais?) gives one of the best comic performances ever seen.This is ""popcorn"" style cinema, and it really bends over backwards to amaze and amuse the viewer.  Credit must be given to Burton and his art department for the campy sets, costumes and obviously the convincing makeup jobs which trumped any similar ones ever on film.  Rick Baker (the great makeup up artist) has taken his art to a higher plane in this monumental effort, and really should be acknowledged for giving audiences such thrilling creatures to view.  They're like no others ever seen on the screen, and to watch the expressive faces of these apes is a remarkable experience in viewing. The faces appear so life-like that you begin to believe you're watching actual apes.Kids should love this outing, with the violence all being decidedly PG and usually occurring off-screen.  Parents can also sit back and enjoy the trip to this wild planet since its loaded with symbolism and cultural references all cleverly packaged in Hollywood's best style.",Planet of the Apes

I really enjoyed almost everything about the film. First, the story was good including the surprise twist ending. The performances from Roth to Wahlberg to Carter to Duncan were all top notch. The special effects were about what I expected with a couple of minor flaws. The settings of the villages were realistic and convincing as well. My one complaint would be that the film was a little dark.

I liked Helena Bonham's character-she was the one friendly likeable ape that didnt hate humans like her counterparts did.

I enjoyed the first Planet of the Apes and I was very happy to see this one had a completely original plot.  This gave the movie a new flavor. 
The story, for the most part, was well presented and it made sense as well. However, there were a few areas which it was a little weak and where there were errors Wahlberg's character of a military officer with a science background, would not have made.  Wahlberg was good and helped the film along.  Tim Roth was also good and gave the film a sinister side.

Meanwhile, if you watch the behind the scenes making of this film, you also get the distinct impression that Tim Burton knew the script was crap and so he gave up on it and treated it like a joke that he was getting big bucks for delivering. Which it is.But having said all that, I have a suggestion for a sequel. In the sequel, Wahlberg, Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Burton play themselves. They all get into a spaceship and try to go back in time to change the future where no remake of the Planet of the Apes will appear on their resume. After 2 1/2 hours of mindless hijinks and special effects, they emerge in modern day to find they didn't change a thing, because as Alec Baldwin's character states so glibly in Glengarry Glen Ross: ""a loser is a loser!""And anyone who read the script for this film and didn't walk away was -at least in this instance - a loser.",Planet of the Apes
270,Herbest8,Literally defines the term LAME,1,5 June 2010,"Tim Burton is my absolute favorite director of all time and he rarely strikes out but when he does, it can be quite embarrassing. Case in question: the 2001 remake of one of the most famous sci-fi films of all time.I do have one confession. I've never actually seen the original 1968 film but I am familiar with the story. Here, astronaut Leo Davidson (played forgettably by Mark Wahlberg) crash lands on a distant planet ruled by intelligent apes. From there, he treks with a small band of outsiders towards these mysterious, ancient ruins which may hold the key for his return home.Where do I begin? Well, the cast is thoroughly wasted and this film has quite a cast (David Warner! Michael Clarke Duncan! Paul Giamattei!), the special effects are pretty generic, and the production design is slimy and claustrophobic. On top of all that, the final battle is very lackluster.Adding to all this, the ending is a joke. While the original film had an ending that was surprising and strangely appropriate, this one feels forced and confusing. Additional sore spots include a bland score by the usually reliable Danny Elfman and a pace that BEGS for a steroid shot.You may be wondering are there ANY redeeming values? Well, Charlton Heston's cameo is pretty good but since it is just a cameo, he's not in long enough to truly save it.What else can I say? This film stinks.",Planet of the Apes
271,studhead182,The Best Remake I've seen,7,3 August 2001,Tim Burton's Planet Of The Apes is the best remake I've seen. It's not really a remake if you think about it. It's more of a re-visit. They got some of the same things going on. Some dude is stuck on a planet ruled by apes. The storyline is quite similar. Well not really. It's a pretty good movie. Go see it for yourself.WARNING: SPOILER The movie takes place  in the year 2028. Mark Wahlberg plays Leo Davidson. He works on a ship where people test chimps to fly ships and such. Anyway they have captain Leo Davidson's monkey go on a test flight. Then sooner or later the chimp gets scared in some weird magnetic force field. Leo Davidson goes out to save his chimp then his ship accidently lands on THE PLANET OF THE APES!,Planet of the Apes

273,daved-3,The Ending Makes No Sense!!,6,13 August 2001,"I admired the technique that went in to making this version of Planet--not just the make-up, but the sets, the costumes, the ""re-imagining"" of ape culture and society.  But much of the script seemed to be on auto-pilot, as if the prologue was rushed through because everyone knew the main character was going to end up on, well, the Planet of the Apes and so they went through the plot contrivances as quickly as possible.  And then there is the twist at the end, about which I will say nothing other than I didn't see it coming because it makes NO SENSE AT ALL!  I of course cannot explain why without giving it away, but trust me, it was a major let-down to have a well made film end with that nonsense.  All in all I do mildly recommend the film; it is one of the better summer releases I've seen this year, second only to Apocalypse Now.  But maybe that just goes to show what a weak summer it has been.PS  In the film there is a female character on the space station with the name tag ""Alexander"", but IMDB lists no character with that name.  There is, however, an ""Anderson"" listed among the characters; I wonder if this is an error.",Planet of the Apes

Mr.Wahlberg does a walk-through, which is all that is required of him.  The rest of the humans are negligible; it is the apes which dominate the screen and the story and all are excellent.  The ending chosen was unnecessary; the shock and surprise value was nonexistent. Much better to have gone for something completely original rather than a re-interpretation of Heston's famous last scene which WAS a shock and a surprise.",Planet of the Apes
275,tfc,"This movie did not go to the apes, it went to the dogs",5,15 October 2006,"Concerning the ""Planet of the Apes"" (2001). First, let us pretend there is no other ""Planet of the Apes"" movie (1968). To do otherwise would invite comparisons and I want to minimize my negative review. My thoughts/summary on Tim Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"" remake is as follows:The ""hero"" (Wahlberg), a highly trained and professional astronaut, blatantly disobeys his commanding officer to rescue a space monkey. After being sucked into a convenient local time warp that just happens to appear outside the space station. The hero crashes his tiny space pod on some strange planet, without getting a scratch on him. He gets out and immediately runs into some oppressed humans being chased by leaping killer apes. The hero becomes a slave, escapes, and finds his pretty space station has crashed on the planet and all of his friends are dead. The hero realizes that he is on earth and thousands of years in the future. With a look of ""shock""(or lack of), the hero says ""oh no, it's not possible."" Then the hero, using some old rusty technology and an expected plot twist, holds back an army of apes, stops the fighting, and brings peace, love, and harmony between humans and apes. The hero then hops into his sub-compact space pod and takes off for his own time period (going from Saturn to Earth in thirty seconds) only to crash land again on a planet and discovers the big surprise ending which leaves one bewildered. Watch the movie and see what I mean.In the background of this riveting tale is Helena Bonham Carter, playing a sympathetic, human loving, but annoying representative of the ape equivalent ASPCA/PETA. Tim Roth plays the ultra-violent, bellicose villain Thade, who flies/jumps through the air with the greatest of ease (Short of having a cape with an ""S""). The other characters are little more than window dressing for the hero/villain/heroine triangle. Overall, a simplistic movie with great special effects. IMHO, the movie should have explained more about Thad's genetic killer ape ancestry, ape/human history, man's technological failures. There should have been believable spaceships and space suits. Also, the movie devoted too much time to the cute and funny bits of ape society.",Planet of the Apes
276,Psycho Mantis,Better than the original,8,8 August 2001,"Tim Burton´s re-telling of the novel ""Planet of the Apes"" by Pierre Boulle is a stylish and exciting adventure. In the year 2029, astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) travels through a storm in space and is separated from his comrades. He lands on a remote planet, where humans are slaves and the apes are rulers. He is captured but attempts to escape and tries to revolt against the apes. You might think that a new version of ""Planet of the Apes"" from 1968 would be a bad idea. But since the story in the new one is rather different than in the original, it becomes a whole new film. Burton´s version comes up with many interesting ideas. He develops the racial issues more than the first one did, and questions the real differences between the humans and the apes.
The acting is first class all the way, Mark Wahlberg is perfect in the leading role, but the real stars here are those who play apes. Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and Tim Roth are all excellent, especially the latter. Roth is terrific as the evil General Thade, a character whom in the wrong hands could have been a bit silly. But Roth makes him a great villain, and he actually steals the show. I would love to see this British actor in more big budget productions in the future. The acting through the very realistic ape costumes is definitely something worth seeing.Overall, I liked the new ""Planet of the Apes"" better than the first one, and I still liked that one a lot. But the new one has better actors, cooler effects and a clever and entertaining script. It´s not perfect, the movie becomes a bit sentimental and cheesy towards the end, when Wahlberg tries to motivate the humans to fight. And why does it always have to be a kid who wants to be a hero in these big summer movies? I first thought that it was only in the ""Jurassic Park""-trilogy that this was common, but ""Planet of the Apes"" was no exception.  This is still the most exciting adventure I´ve seen this year, and it´s nice to see a summer movie with both brains and muscles. And I liked the ending, even if I didn´t understand much of it at first. But it certainly blew me away, just like Michael Clarke Duncan said it would, in an interview I read.

278,NeelyO,Monkey mish-mash,4,25 July 2001,"Tim Burton can usually be relied upon for visionary, provocative entertainment, but this time all we get is ""Braveheart"" with baboons. This remake is consistently uninvolving and uninteresting, all the way up to the zinger surprise ending which flat out doesn't work.Stick with Chuck Heston and the original ""Planet.""",Planet of the Apes
279,taikman,"Good, if you expect a standard action-science fiction tale, but not nearly up to the original",7,21 March 2002,"For those who haven't seen the original, this is a 'reimagining', which means that it shares some elements of the classic version but not others. Basically the stories involve a spaceman who lands on a planet where the barbaric humans are controlled by intelligent apes. This version is a good film, entertaining and with a surprising ending, but it lacks the punch and depth of the first edition.Tim Burton is my favourite director. 'Bettlejuice', 'Edward Scissorhands', the first two Batman films, 'Sleepy Hollow' - all excellent: macabre, gothic and filled with black humour. 'Apes' also looks great - the sets are spectacular and the makeup is amazing: the apes truly look real. What the film lacks is some of Burton's darker, slightly disturbing touches. It plays too much like a straight action/sci-fi flick, whereas the original was a powerful allegory for racism and animal rights as well as great entertainment.One of the reasons why the latter film doesn't match up to the original's power is because all the human characters talk. In the original the human's mysterious silence added to the theme of 'men as beasts'. Here that impact is gone, but they might as well not have bothered - the humans still have nothing interesting to say. It's the apes that have all the good lines and characterisation.Also, the ending of the original 'Apes' is one of the greatest in movie history, resonating with meaning, whereas this version's finale feels like a tacked-on surprise designed to set up sequels.The other main reason why the orginal is superior is that Mark Wahlberg lacks Charlton Heston's macho charisma in the role of the heroic spaceman. Heston was cynical, angry, confused. Wahlberg is bland.Nevertheless 'Planet of the Apes' is is a good movie, a cut above the average Hollywood science fiction film. However if I was given a choice of renting the original or the new version in a few years, I know which one I'd chose.6 1/2/10",Planet of the Apes
280,unbend_5440,Is this the best they could do?,1,28 July 2001,"Tim Burton announced that this is a ""re-imagining"" of Planet of the Apes. What he did was ""re-imagine"" it into the dud of the year. I don't want to spend a lot of time comparing it to the original, but it's nowhere near as good as the original. During the first 45 minutes, I was partially impressed. There was some great makeup and a few decent dialogue scenes. But as soon as Wahlberg and company escaped, it was all downhill. Once the battle scene came I was rolling my eyes and laughing. The action was pretty boring compared to some of Burton's better films. The last 20 minutes just drag on and on. And what was the deal with Tim Roth's performance? He spent the whole time growling and trying to act scary. To me it came off as a bad impression of Mr. Furious from Mystery Men. There were some genuinely entertaining moments, I'll give it that. Charlton Heston's cameo being the high point. But I spent most of the movie waiting for it to end. I found the original Planet Of The Apes to be an intelligent movie. It had great themes on the relationship and treatment between Humans and Animals. And while Tim Burton does play on those themes in the early parts of this film, it loses all sight of it in exchange for a load of action sequences.I'm sure that there is an audience for Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes. I'm just not part of that audience. Just like Psycho, Planet of the Apes is a film better off not being remade.",Planet of the Apes
281,cToTh-2,You'll never look at Curious George the same again!,10,22 August 2001,"I was going to use the old cliche, `You'll go Ape over this movie,' but after watching General Thade during the climax of the movie, I felt that the summary above served the movie justice.This was some movie, and while it has similarities with the previous releases, it is a more modern tale of simian evolution.  Just don't call them monkeys...they've killed humans for less.This movie was very entertaining and captivating with very few lulls.  Mark Wahlberg (once known as the rapper `Marky Mark' from the turbulent nineties) performed quite well, although he did not seem to have the proper demeanor for a soldier of the US Air Force.  He seemed to be a bit too `common.'I was also equally impressed by Tim Roth as General Thade.  Thade is a chimp, but not like the cute and loveable ones you see on television.  He was a homicidal maniac with a deep hatred for humans, so deep that he would go so far as to betray his own kind.  He made Adolf Hitler look like the Easter bunny by comparison.The special effects were marvellous.  It was amazing how they were able to design the make-up such that the simian masks mimicked their human facial expressions.  Some of these actors must have spent some time at the nearest zoo or something, because some of them portrayed the instinctive reactions of apes, such as throwing their hands up in the air and screeching loudly. Fantastic.  I also loved the way the apes would leap through the air and land on their opponents.As with the majority of the movies I like, I do not watch them for their artistic content.  If you want artistic content, watch `The Piano' or something like that.  If you want a movie for the adrenaline rush and you have an open mind, then do not hesitate to watch this one.The saddest part about this movie is that I had once seen on tv that Tim Burton is not planning to direct a sequel.  That would be a shame, but you never know - once Tim sees all the revenues generated by this movie, he may reconsider.  Or perhaps another director will take up the mantel.  We can only hope.***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***I was not kidding about the spoiler alert.  One of the paragraphs mentioned below will briefly discuss the ending of the movie, and if you have not seen the movie yet, I would not recommend that you read any further.First of all, I did not like it that the movie started out in the year 2029. So am I supposed to believe that we as a race will be capable of space flight and capable of designing self-sufficient space stations away from the Earth's orbit in just 28 years?  Unless there's influence from an alien specie, I cannot believe that we will progress that well in such a short period of time.  However, despite this `flaw,' it did not affect my overall view of the movie.Another question I had pertained to genetic diversity.  With so few humans and apes aboard the space station, how is it that they were able to populate that planet?  With all of the inevitable in-breeding (and I do NOT mean inter-species mating), how is it that either specie is not riddled with disease or deformities?  And for those of you who did not catch it, they were on a distant planet.  It even had several moons, so they were not on Earth the entire time.Finally, I was not impressed by Capt. Davidson's flight home.  In a matter of what appeared to be a few seconds, he escaped the planet's atmosphere, flew into the storm, arrived back into his own solar system (near Saturn by the looks of it), and then immediately arrived at Earth.  What makes this all the more amazing, this was done in a spacecraft not much larger than my car (apparently it is capable of deep space flight), and it's fuel and oxygen reserves were likely expended beforehand, yet Davidson made it some in one piece in about 30 seconds.The ending itself was fantastic.  Davidson landed on an Earth that had evolved the same as ours with the exception of one difference - the apes became the dominant species, not us.  Apparently, not only can the storm bend the laws of time and space, but apparently it can throw someone into an alternate reality.  I would just love to see a sequel to determine where this movie left off.",Planet of the Apes

It is the first that did not disappoint...in fact it actually exceeded my expectations.  Let's get something straight, right off the bat, I did not go to the theater expecting to be enlightened. I went to be entertained and Planet of the Apes is extremely entertaining. The costumes and makeup are first rate. Rick Baker should, deservedly so, garner another Oscar for his work. The apes are REAL...more real than the dinosaurs in the disappointing Jurassic Park 3. The actors were great. Tim Roth is menacingly elegant as General Thade. Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary Tagawa are excellent in the student/sensei roles. Helena Bonham Carter...ah well, is it me or does she actually look and perform better as an ape?

Mark Wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor (as if BOOGIE NIGHTS wasn't proof enough).  I was embarrassed for genuine talents such as Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter.

Equally, I imagine the screenwriters probably did an admirable job with their story. But any hope of a performance by Wahlberg, as anything more than a stereotyped dosage of testosterone, was trashed. It's really a pity. And to think that Tim Burton's name is attached to this film leaves me reeling... Having seen so many of his films and his genius revealed, I cannot help but believe this latest project suffered nuclear fall-out. Just think back: ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", and so many more: I could just keep writing... They were all fabulous.The most to be said for the end-product is that it allows Wahlberg to be likeable. Tim Roth, on the other hand, comes off so badly that he reminds me of Gary Oldman (whose talent, by the way, is huge and underutilised...) with too much make-up and a bad hangover. Only Helena Bonham-Carter and the special effects (read: Tim Burton) make this film worth seeing. Bonham-Carter is not only likeable, but believable, convincing, and showing real talent despite the obvious handicap of the costume. She really does deserve high marks here, but I don't think the voting public will take the end-product of this film seriously. Again, what a shame... The Marketing Gurus and Editors really need to be strung-up for hacking to bits what could have been fabulous.Entertainment value. Go see it for the special effects and noted items above.

Another explanation is that the astronaut is travelling through space-time.  But the first unlogical thing is that the Apes are speaking English(well, this is the only language they can say to show to American audiences).

290,formicidae,"Tastes great, less filling.",7,29 July 2001,"Tim Burton does a great job on the new Planet of the Apes. He manages to make a film that will not offend the traditionalists who enjoyed the original (like me), while at the same time creating something new that audiences of today will appreciate.First and foremost, this movie looks great. Even if all other components of the movie were weak (and some are), I would still be partial to this picture. The costumes, makeup, and sets are rich and extremely authentic-appearing, and really bring to life the apes and their culture. In a movie about a different culture, this is important. (There is by no means a comprehensive vision of a simian society, but enough is touched on to give us a good taste.) Without giving away the finer details, the plot is equal to the original, and the same interesting philosophical qualities of the 1968 version are here, with the social commentary on animal treatment, tensions in communities over diversity, the place of religion within the state, etc. There is enough action to make things interesting on a primal level (the initial capture scene is much more intense in the new Apes, the apes themselves being much more intimidating), and some personal relationships also add an element to the story.Even though many of the actors are covered in convincing makeup (with the possible exception of Carter, who looks a little too cosmetic), their personalities come through, and you can buy the idea of a speaking simian. Roth is especially good--his character plays a constant game of testosterone repression that he doesn't win often. His rage is palpable. Mark Wahlberg does a much better job as protaganist than Charleton Heston could ever have done. Overall, a good job by the cast.It's still not a perfect movie, not by a long shot. The comic relief, as with all action/serious(?) movies, gets a little distracting (although, by comic relief standards, Giamatti does a pretty good job). The humans seem a little too articulate to be so ""primitive"", and the entire explanation as to how/when/where Wahlberg's character gets where he is is never really reasonably explained.

On its own, however, this is a pretty good sci-fi action film complete with a little character development (for those who need that).In my opinion this movie did parallel the original in terms of certain basic plot points (sorry, no spoilers), but I think the parallels can get lost in the translation/interpretation.What I didn't like was that I had to be prepared for the ending by those who had the DVD commentary; we're supposed to leave the movie in a state of ""Huh?"", and we're supposed to assume a certain event took place which is just barely eluded to at the very end.Besides being rude, this may or may not set things up for a sequel. The original movies managed to create a final ""setting-up"" for a perfect cycling in time. Maybe we didn't get a perfect happy ending, but we left satisfied about the reasons behind the first movie's social setting.I believe that a sequel has to be made to explain *clearly* why the movie ended as it did. I think there's too much arrogance behind the current ending; someone is ignoring the population of viewers who aren't well versed in sci-fi versions of warps, portals, etc.Hint: When Thade finds himself in what looks like a control room pay attention to what he sees.

There are two earth in the movie one is normal human earth and second is monkey earth where Leo landed, you can see two moon in monkey earth so both normal and monkey earth can't be same.In the end There was 2 pods one of Leo's and other one of that trained chimpanzee so in one pod leo travel back to earth and in second pod Apes follows him.Electromagnetic storm works in reverse, remember Leo goes in after the trained chimpanzee in storm but came out before him in the monkey earth.Similarly in the end Leo goes first in the storm and then Apes follows him which is not showed in the movie.Because of electromagnetic storm, Apes landed many years back in the past and they did what they were doing in the monkey earth, whereas Leo landed many years after in the future on the same earth and that is why he sees that difference in the end.",Planet of the Apes
294,doctorow,Special effects do not make up for plot and script weaknesses,4,11 August 2001,"A poor excuse for a movie.  Tim Burton needs to take about 5 years off and go reorganize himself.  This movie had no soul, no cohesion, and a really insipid script with all kinds of inconsistencies and errors. It is a shame to see a big budget movie like this when there are so many really talented directors and script writers just struggling. Hollywood continues to prostitute itself and Tim Burton has now joined the ranks of the brothel-panderers.",Planet of the Apes
295,ShannonAmidala,A fantastic blast! **possible spoilers**,8,28 July 2001,"Wow, this was such an excellent movie. The casting list was fabulous (Mark Wahlburg in a role you'll never forget; Tim Roth as the sly, malevolent Thade; Helena Bonham Carter as the warm human-friendly ape; Estella Warren as the beautiful Daena)! The visuals are absolutely wonderful and the highlight of the picture. Tim Burton excelled in imagery, costume design, makeup, and detail. The appearance of the film was absolutely spectacular. Certain scenes will take your breath away, and leave you wanting more. A few of the ape scenes are appropriately harrowing, which makes you appreciate the actor underneath all of those costumes and makeup. The only downside of the this film was the ""love-triangle"" among Leo, ape Ari, and Daena. I just didn't buy into it. I would've much rather loved to see Leo and Daena share a romance. :)I give this film an 8/10.",Planet of the Apes
296,epsilon3,See the Original,6,6 March 2002,"I was expecting a lot from this movie as the original had a major influence on me and is a genuine Science Fiction classic. I enjoyed this re-imagining but it was just okay - not great. The acting was mediocre - the sets and special effects were good and the make-up was of course spectacular.What really lets it down is the plot. For example, in the original film the human slaves couldn't speak, reinforcing the fact that the apes saw them as savages. When Taylor (Charlton Heston) spoke, it was a potent weapon against the apes' prejudice - the fact that he had language and thus cognitive abilities shook their entire belief system. In this movie the humans are chatting away normally which lessens the importance of Davidson's (Mark Whalberg) arrival.And could somebody please tell me what the point of the blond woman was? Sure she is beautiful, but her character just felt tacked onto the plot to provide some eye candy.I found the ending to be a big let down - again it was clumsily stuck into the film to provide that twist in the tail. It just didn't feel like it was part of the story, but more of an afterthought.Despite my criticism, I enjoyed the movie. There's some great action scenes and hey - it's Planet of the Apes! There's nothing horribly bad about it - it just doesn't live up to the wonderful original.Rent this one or wait for it to be on TV.7/10",Planet of the Apes
297,srooks1,Unfulfilled Potential,5,14 October 2021,This film could have been more. More social commentary about the simian civilization. This film was too concerned about violence in the simian-human civilization. There could have been more humor to serve as a vehicle for social commentary. It appears that Tim Burton wanted to make a more serious film than the original. The ending was a clumsy leading to a new film series.,Planet of the Apes
298,okami_ito,Waste of apes,2,10 May 2009,"A planet full of nasty apes is a great idea. Someday somebody will make a great movie about it. Until then you'll have to watch this one:Wahlberg is lost on a strange planet and who of all people does he encounter? Kris Kristofferson! Complete with his groomed beard portraying some kind of a caveman. One wonders why he isn't wearing cowboy hat and boots. Then we have little Tim Roth as a British(?) chimp. Burton orders: ""You're a chimp! Act like one! Make at least 10 grimaces a second!"" And Roth obeys. He is the bad chimp, so he tries to look really mean, but doesn't. Roth also hops around a lot. It's real method acting, you know. As if the bad apes aren't, well, ""bad"" enough, there are also ""good"" apes, who talk like liberals, so the kids who watch this mess hopefully will turn out as ""good"" citizens one day. Of course they won't listen to the drivel of the good apes. It's too boring. Talking of boring: Wahlberg gets captured by the bad apes in a boring way and soon escapes in a boring way. Then he's on the run and has to talk a lot to the other humans and a female chimp (Carter) which has the desire to be just as smart as him. Sometimes we see Roth the chimp, who wants Wahlberg back. he gives orders to his favorite gorilla, then hops out of frame for the most time. At the end he and a lot of other apes get whacked in the head by Wahlberg and his feel-good-posse. Some big apes roll around on the floor in deadly combat. The final duel belongs to Wahlberg and Roth the little chimp, which leaves the monkey completely bonkers. Finally a real chimp saves the day and shows Roth and the others how to act. Obviously Burton had no influence on the animal. The last minutes gives us a tiny impression what this remake maybe should have been about, would it have been made by a director with a vision.",Planet of the Apes
299,buiredintime,Very Disapointing,6,26 July 2001,"If this movie was not directed by Tim Burton I would concluded as just plain stupid.  I mean the original did not cost no 100 million dollars to make and was very original.  This time it is the same story with just a few twist which I will not give away.  Basically it's about a man who crashes onto a planet which is totally flipped in the ecosystem where the apes are the rulers and the humans are the savages. Sounds Familiar right.  Like I said Tim Burton is a great director he does do a good job of trying to make his mark in visuality ,but it's the same old story. Now the only real good thing was Paul Geomanti(Sorry if I miss prenounced his name)he brought a little bit of humor to the story.  If your a big fan see it for yourself don't let me stop you if you aren'tthen go see something worth your money beacuse this isn't.6/10 grade",Planet of the Apes
300,pc_dean,What Would Dr. Zaius Say?,6,17 August 2001,"When I first heard that Tim Burton was going to ""re-imagine"" the original ""Planet of the Apes"" (which is a much nicer word than ""re-hash""), my question was, ""Why?""  Now I've seen it, and I still don't know.  When you remake a movie, it will inevitably invite comparison with the original. You need to bring something new, interesting, and different to it, and most importantly, it helps to know what that something is.  And that is the chief weakness of the new ""Apes"".The original movie had weirdness and originality, plus satiric bite and subtext out the wazoo.  The apes in Burton's movie behave more like real apes, which is neat, but part of the original's charm was that its human-ish apes lent it a surreal ""Twilight Zone"" quality, no surprise given the involvement of Rod Serling.  Plus the original had that ending, which has become a classic cinematic moment.  The new ""Apes"" obviously lacks that dramatic punch, and the makers were wise to alter its premise accordingly. But to what?  The new movie works best as a comic takeoff on the genre (since the original spawned four sequels and an armada of imitators).  It's fun to spot all the references in this movie, both to the ""Planet of the Apes"" series and to other cultural icons.  But the movie fails to keep the satiric edge through the second reel until the bravura, witty finale (which suggests that any sequel might be funnier and better than this one). Otherwise we get a lot of ho-hum posturing and a surprisingly yawn-inducing battle scene.  The movie also leaps over gaps in the plot like a steroid-crazed chimpanzee.  As an example, the hero is confronted by an army of human refugees who have come from all the land to ""see the human who defies the apes.""  That's impressive communication: he'd only escaped the night before.The story is weak and wandering, and the cast isn't up to the task of buoying it.  This is especially true in the pivotal lead character. Charlton Heston's performance in the original was hammy (but admit it now; we love Charlton BECAUSE he's hammy), but his character had fire and emotion.  You could identify with him because he was trapped in an insane situation, and his fear, confusion and rage were palpable to you.  Mark Wahlberg in the new one barely registers.  Wahlberg is not a bad actor, but neither is he a lead actor.  He is subtle, and best when playing quiet supporting characters to more vibrant leads, like in ""Three Kings"" or ""The Corruptor"".  He also has a flair for deadpan satire (he was the best thing in the misfired ""The Big Hit"").  But this is a role that requires less subtlety and more big expressiveness.  Wahlberg comes across not as an ordinary man trapped in a bizarre nightmare out of time, but just befuddled, like a commuter that has gotten off at the wrong stop.  And, just before the big battle, he gives what has to be the least inspiring speech-to-the-troops in film history.  If Marky Mark had been at Valley Forge, we'd all be mailing our tax returns to London.Heston, incidentally, crops up in an in-jokey cameo as the wizened old leader of the apes.  He shows his son Thade (Tim Roth) an ancient pistol which he says is proof of the ingenuity and wickedness of humanity, in one swoop spoofing both his role in the original and his day job as NRA President.  Between this and playing a gun-toting nut job in ""Town and Country"", Heston seems intent on retiring the Good Sport Award for this year.It happens that all the good performances in this movie are among the apes (hmm, maybe they ARE superior).  Roth is magnetic as the power-mad, swaggering Thade, and kudos also to Michael Clarke Duncan as his adjutant, with a booming voice that was made to say things like, ""Bow your heads!"" Estella Warren is very cute in buckskin, but contributes little else to this movie (this is not all her fault; for an ostensible love interest, her character is woefully underwritten).The movie is not all bad; I'd certainly say it's worth seeing.  It has visual flair, there are a lot of funny lines and moments, and the ending is inspired; but as comedy it's too dull, as drama too flat, as allegory too unworkable to rise above the ordinary.  In the ""Apes"" ouevre, I'd place it above ""Escape From..."" and ""Battle For..."", but that's below the level of ringing endorsement.And if you do see it, one last thing to ponder:  Where the hell did the horses come from???",Planet of the Apes

302,mrphantasm,A Refreshing look on a classic.,9,26 June 2005,"Planet of the Apes could perfectly be a part of the selected group of good remakes. This group of films could include movies such a The Fly, The Thing, and some others. The criteria to be a part of this selection would be that every new remake should try to take distance from the seminal classics. Those old and dear movies are classics, there's no sense in make the same movie using the same script and so. If there's any need of release a remake it is necessary a new take on the same tale.Tim Burton has done just that with his version of Planet of the Apes, and also has made the whole myth of this saga his own. Leo Davidson is a hard action astronaut but still he's very innocent just like many of the heroes of Burton. And these Apes who are a distorted image of us as society (greedy, intolerant). The special apes that don't follow these ideologies are the good sensitive beings. I think this is probably one of the most important messages in every good movie of Tim Burton, the special outsider view of the artist in a world who's not sensitive.Owning an amazing design of make-up, scenarios, and lots of practical FX, P.O.A is honest to the old fashion style of Sci-Fi .This is the remake that the seminal classic of 1968 deserves. A great cast of actor and actresses is here and they deliver over the top performances even wearing pound of Makeup! This new version pays homage to the first Planet from the first minute to the last. It deserves an absolute 10.",Planet of the Apes
303,on_the_can,Underrated,7,6 April 2011,"In the spring of 2001 audiences seemed eager to see Tim Burton's retelling of the 1968 classic, ""Planet of the Apes."" By the summer of 2001 it seemed to be the movie everybody loved to hate. Were the criticisms fair? Not if you ask me.2001's Planet of the Apes' biggest downfall, in my opinion, is unfortunately also it's biggest strength. Unlike many remakes which often end up as nothing more than weaker rehashes of their predecessor's this version of 'Apes' dared to be different. The plot has been stripped down to its bare bones and then rebuilt into something completely new. This is refreshing, if you ask me. Especially when rewatching it now, because just a few short years after this film came out we launched into sort of a remake renaissance, where half the tent pole films that come out every year are the same lesser rehashes that I spoke of a second ago. This film does take a moment here and there to wink at the '68 original, but Burton and his merry band of screenwriters has created a world completely original...it could be watched next to any entry of that original series as a wholey different film.This is also the film's biggest flaw though, or at least financially speaking, because the original 'Apes' franchise has a cult following behind it that could almost rival that of Star Wars or Star Trek. The core audience for this film really only wanted to see their favourite story told with modern day effects and makeup. I don't think we needed that, but I'm not sure how many would agree with me.Now, if you want to compare the two films plots and decide which one is stronger that's a whole other debate. But I don't think that's fair, that's why I champion it for taking such a different approach. I don't think this movie should be compared to any other movie and with that mindset a much better appreciation can be found. To put it bluntly, this movie ain't bad...in fact it's actually pretty good.I won't deconstruct the plot for you...if you're interested enough to be reading this you probably at least know the jist of it anyway. But it's a solid and interesting plot that sets up a very fun and entertaining action adventure flick. Visually its in many ways a departure from typical Burton fair but his stamp is definitely evident in its art direction, and the atmosphere he creates in this jungle/desert/urban/high tech universe is really something to behold. The apes are not only impressive in terms of makeup but they are also creatively impressive from the choices of the species to match personalities, the incredible costumes and simply perfect performances by a cast who act through all that latex. And while I'm praising I'll also throw up a shout out for Danny Elfman's great score, which just might be one of his best.The only caveat I'll lay on the movie is that the twist ending, obviously conceived to rival the famous twist of the original, kind of falls flat. BUT...considering how many instalments the original franchise had I have no doubt that the producers had hoped to make a sequel had this film been more financially successful, and had that sequel been made maybe we would've learned the story behind this twist and all would've been forgiven.It's a little too late to say, 'long story short,' but I will anyway. Give this movie a fair shot. It may not be without its flaws but how many movies are? Try not to compare it to the original, just watch it with a bowl of popcorn and have fun.",Planet of the Apes

I remember seeing the now classic 1968 science fiction film as a boy growing up in Indianapolis,Indiana on late night television with my younger brother and my dad. It was some of the more pleasant moments of my childhood,but that's a tale for another time.Ok,fast forward to 2001. My wife and I took in this flick on a nice friday afternoon(matinee) and I must say this: Rick Baker is a GOD! His make-up is fantastic!Breath takingly real. He is going to get his seventh oscar for this or at least,nominated. Danny Elfman's score was magnificent! That man is a genius. Tim Burton did a good directing this although,it was a very weak script. Mark Wahlberg does ok. I mean,it's no oscar performance.He just acts like a man who just is determined to get off where the apes can talk.Helena Bonham Carter,I tell you,no matter how much make up they put on her,she still has presence and beauty that cannot be denied.(Even though there is one scene that sent a chill through my bones.eeeewww.)Tim Roth and Michael Duncan Clark both make worthy bad guys for this film..but i wanted a little more from the script to make them MORE menacing..alas that was not to be. Now, don't go to this film to expect a masterpiece. Just go and enjoy yourself.Ignore(if you can) the bad dialouge and plot holes.Sit back and relax.It's a little bit of escapism that is worth the matinee price.(Key word:Matinee) The ending leaves a kind of twilight zone feel and perhaps a hint of a sequel,but hopefully they will have a better script with the next one.",Planet of the Apes
306,Boris-57,"Visually stunning, but the money is wasted",2,2 October 2001,"Well, it turned out as I expected: visual overload but nothing else added to the original. What did surprise me however was that the storyline was fairly drastically changed compared to the 1968 flick. Initially this awoke my interest, but what eventually surprised was that the new twists and turns (a) were apparently invented in order to present us with a typical Hollywood-like product and (b) made the whole storyline improbable! The 1968 story was breathtakingly straightforward, and included no time-storms or any bogus of that sort: it just stated that when you come home after a long journey, things might have changed a bit. Earth might have fallen in the hands of apes, for example. Like many 'old' movies, it's main ingredient was suspense (hell, does anyone understand that word these days?). In this Burton movie, an attempt has been made to turn the whole thing into an action movie, but at what cost? Surely, the images are overwhelming, and a lot of time and money has been put into the design of a complete ape-culture (even ape-music!), but what's wrong?First, the suspension of disbelief is made very hard, because the apes have a lot of Hollywood-human traits. I refer especially to Ari and the slave-trader. These traits include emotional skills like irony, sarcasm, and an overtly displayed array of 'subtle' emotions. It makes you forget that the apes are apes, which is essential.Second, the humans TALK. Of course, we can imagine that humans will never forget how to speak, but the fact that the apes had speech and the humans didn't made the ape/human role-switching very tangible and stressing in the 1968 version. The wound in the throat that Charlton Heston gets there is essential to his survival and his later regained speech essential to his uniqueness and the interest that Dr. Zira has in him (so, no need for things like human rights activists or ape-human love in order to explain things).Third, the fact that they talk ads a great deal to the implausibility, but is a necessary twist in the new movie, since Capt. Davidson has to play the Hollywood-let's-save-the-whole-world- and-have-a-good-ending-for-everyone- and-still-make-it-to-the-lounge-bar- for-a-cool-diet-coke character. Oh my god, will they never learn? I new it from the start, when there was only one guy who got lost! They were in need of a hero! And then the script writers go on reasoning: we need one guy... so, why would one guy get lost... because he tries to save an ape from an electromagnetic storm... implausible! But it's necessary because it shows the audience that he respects apes! Since, in these modern and politically correct times, we can't have a xenophobic ape-hater like Charlton Heston's 68 character loose on the screen: let's give them a bubblegum version!Fourth, okay, the general twist of the original 'discovering the truth' of the 1968 film to the modern version (he finds that his own mother ship crashed on the planet ages ago and that their lab-apes developed their society, where Heston simply discovered that just, somehow, the apes overtook the earth while he was away) is nicely done. The second, battle-part comes as an anti-climax. That's because this movie has added the first two Planet Of The Apes movies in one plot. Nice try, but the chill you feel when Davidson and you discover that he's lost on the planet forever just washes out due to the uninteresting battle-part.Fifth: the ending!!! For chrissakes, who came up with that?! (a) Davidson crashes TWICE with his escape pod, which seems an unsteerable object, while the chimp manages to simply land gracefully? Come on, who'd believe that? If the pods are really small space crafts (Davidson simply flies off into space at the end) and not merely escape vessels, he might have managed a safe landing at least once, no? And what about that ending???? I mean, in the original film it was clear that everything took place on earth. But here: the whole movie takes place on a distant planet, and suddenly the same (there's a Thade statue) ape culture is on earth??? How come? Did the apes of the far planet evolve technologically, flew into the time storm and colonised earth before Davidson's mission took off? Why is Thade worshiped? Stupid stupid stupid.Helena Bonham Carter is even adorable and beautiful as an ape, but I'd expected no less. I preferred her ape above Estella Warren as a human, but maybe I got some loose wire in my head. Nevertheless, the only convincing apes were Tim Roth as Thade (wonderful!) and Ari's household ape (the ex-general, but I forgot his name).Nonono, a lot of things could and should have been added/altered to the 1968 pic, but not the plot, at least not in that way. It was simple and clear and needed no additional explaining. It was nicely tongue-in cheek and caricatured. Don't stylize everything...",Planet of the Apes

They were right! Leo Davidson (Mark Whalberg)who works on a large space station goes out in a spacecraft to save his chimp that has gone into a mysterious cloud formulating in space, he too is sucked in and lands in a planet ruled by apes where humans are the prey and are tortured and are pets to the apes.Davidson must get back to his main ship and along the way finds friendship in a female ape called Ari (Helena Bohnam Carter) who helps him and he helps her. But General Thade (Tim Roth) is intent on destroying all humans and Davidson and his band of rebels are top of his list.The film as a whole is very good and i was much surprised at how much i enjoyed it, i was very skeptical with it being that i really didn't get the original film but this film i got.I really got Burtons vision and really saw this as a good attempt at a reworking from the man i like to call a hero of mine, i did think in places his usual directing skills lacked in some places but for the most part he did an ace job.Mark Whalberg put in a very good performance as the hero of the picture, in places i found him to be slightly annoying but like with Burtons direction for the most part he put in a very good performance as did Tim Roth who comes across very evil in his portrayal as a bitter and twisted ape which i don't think would be an easy feet for any actor.The dialog i have to say in parts is poor as is some of the character interpretation. One of the best and great things about this picture is the production design and once you watch the film you really see where the money for this film went and it really is a well deserved effort of the production designers part. Job well done! For the most part this film has spectacle and awe and this is needed for a summer event picture and i wasn't unhappy with the final product at all.

(Which are sure to be tied up by the obviously sequel that the end sets up)Mark Walberg's tries to find his monkey and lands on a planet where Monkeys are superior and humans are the lesser primate. The make-up is astounding, and Mark proves to be a pretty good no-brain action star. Tim Roths is a pretty good monkey-gone-bad, but as I said before, this movies too silly to be taken seriously and his intense performance is kind of lost.After it's revealed how the monkeys got the way they were, (and why their english was so good) the plot just get's silly and builds up too a fairly laughable ending. The blond girl, Estelle, isn't bad as far as models-turned-actresses go, but her character serves no purpose other than to give 14 year old boys something to look at. Plus, even with more makeup than the cast of Cats used for 20 years, the best apes-actor is still the real thing, Mark's chimp Pericles, who gives a better performance than half his human-cousins.It's not a bad movie, it's a style-over-substance movie, but hell, so's most everything else that's at the theater.

313,jerk1483,Comparison to original luckily stops at the first credit,8,5 August 2001,"Yes, I too caught that AMC Planet of the Apes festival back in 1998 and learned the whole, convoluted chronology of the original series.  I also learned that somehow, apes just learned to talk on their own, a lot like evolving, but maintained their hunched appearance and brutish looks.  You couldn't call the original series science fiction, because it wasn't really based on science.  In fact, in order to really enjoy any of the original films, you had to forgive a lot of fuzzy logic.This new ""revisioning"" of the original film makes a whole lot more sense of how apes learned to talk and walk upright and possess all those ""human"" qualities without having any overt explanation scene.  It just makes sense on its own if you really think about it.  You don't have to though.Anyway, Mark Wahlberg proves again that he was never supposed to be a hip hop star and acts his way very effectively through this pretty darned intelligent film.  First off, leave it to Tim Burton to make comedic yet emotionally trying jabs at bestiality.  If you see the film, you'll see what I mean.  Secondly, we see how operatic life in politics can be, and still be fun.Tim Roth leads a tremendous supporting cast of action movie veterans.  Of course, you won't recognize any of them through the amazing make-up.  The action is amazing, and artfull while the story moves at a locomotive pace.
Honestly, this movie never stops.  And we all expected a big twist ending, better than the original, but instead, we get a twist ending with such a huge sequel come-on that I almost vomitted.  The ending manages to work, come out of left field, and tickle you pink, all at once.  I was either elated or nauseous, I can't decide.  Overall, a really good film.  Better than the original, possibly.  The 68 classic had no limitations as to how high morally it could reach.  So this new revisioning decides to change gears.

But sadly, not good, either.",5,22 March 2002,"There are two kinds of remakes: one, where people, for whatever reason, think, they should redo a film in the same way it's already been done before. Vertigo and Vanilla Sky come to mind. Then there's the idea of taking a premise of a movie and see what you would make of it. Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes falls into that latter category. As such, I will not compare it to the earlier movies. Sadly, it manages to under-deliver all of its own. It's the last half hour that ruins it for me. Until that point, I was entertained. The apes all look individual and very good. Although they go over the top in demonstrating the hideous conditions in which humans are kept, around 80% of films about social injustice go even further (Mad Max, anyone?). The action was fine, and, considering the genre, made a sufficient amount of sense. Apart from that, Tim Burton is one of my favourite directors, so it couldn't be all that bad, could it? Well, let's see.
Spoilers ahead. Then, of course, they had to go for the happy-ending-that-isn't. How Attar was so easily convinced of Thade's treason, I'll never know. Just because a monkey - sorry, prophet - landed at the right moment, in the right spot? Speaking of which, what a prodigious coincidence! Give me a break.What really did it for me was the ""shock-ending"". Wasn't the guy going BACK in time? Does the Apeworld run on Anti-time (as seen in Star Trek TNG, All Good Things...)? Yes, we knew it could not end well. But we hoped it would at least make some degree of sense. Is that too much to ask?",Planet of the Apes

Good costumes, good sets etc, and worth seeing for these things. However (!). The plot has load of holes in it. 1. Marky can't land a space craft to save his life. Both times he totals it in a crash landing. Then the chimp shows him how its done, in a perfect landing, in the middle of a confused battlefield. 2. The space station just happens to crash land a couple of days ride from Markys crash site. 3. When he leaves the planet, three moons are visible suggesting to me he wasn't on earth. 4. All the apes speak English with american accents - fair enough the space station was manned by Americans - but how many generations had passed up to when our hero makes his appearance. Human english has changed alot in the last thousand years. 5. Ok, so the space storm spits out objects at random intervals in time. The space chimp sure chose his moment anyway. A hairy 'Deux Ex Machina' (sorry if I spelt that wrong!) 6. Oooch! People seem to fly about the place, flung by angry apes then just get up again, particularily Mr Whalberg. A gorilla can rip a mans arm off easily.Ok, I'll stop there. I just had the feeling Burton thought, this is Sci-fi, they will buy anything, so I can do whatever I want to push the plot along. I like Mark Whalberg - but he didn't come out very well in this film. The young boy falling under his horse was soooo predictible - we all groaned. Charlton repeating the last lines from the origional was a nice touch though. The other human characters may as well not been there, for all the difference they made. Unlike the book, or even the origional film, this was pretty brainless. Still, It had its moments and clever touches, I thought, and although we only had glimpses of the ape society (which is what the book focuses on), and the film focused on 'hero-on-the-run' action, I would still recommend it, if only for Tim Roth - the antithesis of a PG Tips Chimp.",Planet of the Apes
316,stevenleadbetter,Expensive monkeys,1,7 November 2001,"It takes a plethora of qualities to make an outstanding piece of cinema. Many things can go awry, from direction to production, casting to lighting. Any one thing can put the whole thing off kilter. Try watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to a background score of 'The Sound Of Music' and you may begin to see what I'm driving at. It just doesn't ring true. It would come across as, if not ridiculous, then certainly somewhat odd. This is how I felt about this film. Mark Wahlberg plays a United States Airforce space pilot who also trains, luckily for the plot, monkeys. It would be easy to harp on about paying peanuts, getting monkeys and other such witticisms. Instead of blindly denigrating this film, as many have done, it would seem more politic to look at the reasons why. Hammy acting, cliched one-liners, `Never send a monkey to do a man's job', for instance. Lack of plot; Star thrown into space turmoil, gets stranded on an unforgiving planet dominated by Apes. Apes catch star. Star escapes from potential slavery. Star gets home again safely. Everybody's happy. Apart from the audience. Widely slammed by critics and punters alike, and fairly so. A poor excuse for a film which tried, and miserably failed, to live up to the original. Bad, bad, bad.

It was mildly entertaining, with a pretty good storyline that featured some interesting twists and turns. But, when compared to the original classic, this has legs shorter than ""Tattoo"". And when I saw ""Marky Mark"" in the leading role, it really made me want to say ""de plane....de plane!"" I expected him to bust out with a rap at any moment about his plight on the planet. But in all seriousness, another major flaw of this film is the colors. The film in general is very dark (in color), and this didn't help. Who wants to watch a colorless film?

319,jasonbourneagain,This Movie Stunk,5,14 November 2005,"Perhaps I had too high of expectations for this movie. Tim Burton has made some great films -- Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow. He also made some turkeys in Batman Returns and Mars Attacks! Put Planet of the Apes down as another turkey, one of his worst.This movie is billed as of the Sci-Fi Action genre, but there is little science in it. We are supposed to believe that a chimp and later Captain Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) flies through a cosmic storm and is instantaneously transported through time into the future. Not only that, the ship that tries to save the insubordinate Davidson ends up crash landing on the same planet but in the present time. They were carrying a cage full of chimpanzees and one of them starts a colony on the planet. Some of the humans who survived start a human species, but yet on this future parallel world, for some unexplainable reason the chimpanzees evolve faster and become masters over the humans. The air and water is equal to that of our own Earth but mysteriously the planet was uninhabited before.Given the chance, Burton can make some great character driven and imaginative movies such as Batman, Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. In Apes, he doesn't have a chance with the poorly written script and weak direction. The movie instead focuses more on the action and we don't see a buildup of Wahlberg's character except towards the end. Other characters are introduced, but there are few connections with the audience. Helen Bonham Carter's performance as Ari is worthy, but we don't know exactly why she feels a connection to humans enough to risk losing her life. Kris Kristofferson is there to be killed off. Tim Roth does a creditable job as the angry and malevolent General Thade, one of the descendants of first chimpanzees on the planet. Both Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa are good as Attar, General Thade's friend and trusted warrior Krull who is Attar's foil and Ari's guard.The cinematography, set designs, and technical aspects of the movie are fabulous. Rick Baker and Colleen Atwood does superb and remarkable work as the make up and costumes. Danny Elfman, who won an award for the Batman score, does a fantastic job again with Apes. This was a big budget picture and money was well spent in these areas.The ending made no sense whatsoever. If you get that far, suffice it to say the final scene looked as if it was added just so there would be some storyline in order to make a sequel. I truly hope the producers of this stinker lost so much money, they won't dare try again.",Planet of the Apes
320,sbrobin,What a waste of a good novel,1,1 December 2001,"I saw the original and thought it was great.  This ""re-imaging"" was so vastly inferior to that, that it's a wonder the script ever got greenlit to begin with.  I had heard that the film was bad, but I liked the original so much I rented it when it came out on video anyway. What a mistake.I didn't simply dislike this version because I'm a fan of the original, it is truely a horrible horrible film.  The script is pathetic and the ending seems like it was made by someone under the influence of heavy narcotics who didn't care about whether it made sense or fit into the movie or not.
This film is almost ridiculously campy with the bad dialogue and lines thrown into it simply to elicit a slight grin beased on a connection from the first film.  The apes act ridiculous and you're never left with the feeling that this could actually happen given the absurd things they do. I'm surprised Burton didn't throw in a monkey car that runs on bananas or something.  There's even a little dwarf that runs around collecting money like a chimpanzee would do at the circus.  Even if they took all the ""ape camp"" out, it's still a pathetic movie. Mainly because of the script and the horrible directing by Burton.  The stunts look pretty bad and fake. Many things don't make sense, like why apes would ride horses if they can move faster than horses anyway.  Even Wahlberg gives a pathetic performance.The only entertainment value in this entire movie is the ""funny"" things that an ape society does that compare with what humans do.  The only redeeming thing about renting this trash was that it was the best sounding DVD I've ever heard, and REALLY gave my 5.1 surround system a work.

I figured it would be a cheesy ripoff of the first, since i already knew it had little to do with the original. i also used to like mark wahlberg in movies like three kings and the perfect storm, but the more i see him in interviews and in public, the more i wished his career died with the funky bunch. however, this movie was a very pleasent surprise. The make up was incredible, especially when you take into consideration the massive cast who all needed to be made into apes. i was also impressed with the way the actors who were portraying the ape characters moved and acted like the real animals. also, i was able to put mark wahlberg's over-all annoying behavior when he's off camera  aside, and really enjoy him in this movie. the only thing i didn't really buy was the relationship between mark wahlberg and estela warren, who plays a very hot slave woman, human of course. towards the end of the movie you get the feeling that there is supposed to be a deep meaningful relationship between them, that simply wasn't built up enough. the only other low point was when mark wahlberg kisses the ape woman who has been helping them. this was supposed to be a very sensitive part of the movie, but the audience on hand that day responded with a resounding ""EEEEWWWWWWW!!!"" One of my friends even yelled, ""GO FOR THE BLONDE!""(Warren) No one laughed at his joke but everyone felt the same way. the best part of this movie was the ending, which i would never give away. but i will say it meets, and nearly outdoes, the original ending. with all of the big summer dissapointments i've seen in the last few months, Planet of the Apes was easily worth the money, do yourself a favor and see it.9/10 stars or if you go by the four star rating: 3 1/2 out of 4",Planet of the Apes

Now, this guy has just fallen from the sky unto an unknown planet. You would think that he would take it slowly as he is not familiar with his surroundings, but no. He instead walk as if it's his daily road to work and not once do you get a sense that they are being chased. There's a scene where all the soldiers are ready to march and at the last minute the general played by Tim Roth, gets called away because his father is dying. Yes it was perhaps a pivotal scene (which isn't saying much as there aren't any pivotal scenes) but why place it just before marching off? The movie is just not worth watching. Really watch the original if for nothing else than the famous lines by Heston.And for those of you who think the makeup is good...well...maybe I've gotten accustomed to better things because I was not impressed. I mean...The Lord of the Rings had way better makeup than this one, and they premiered at roughly the same time.

330,The Overdrama,"One of the best remakes ever, but from where did the horses come?",9,28 July 2001,"Tim Burton turned out to be the right man for the job of remaking a cult classic. Casting Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth as the lead chimps allowed for Oscar-caliber performances, though I doubt the Academy will award a sci-fi remake (lol). Moreover, Tim Roth is sort of reminiscent of Roddy McDowell while Mark Wahlberg is the same of Charlton Heston (who appears as Thade's father, a cameo in the tradition of casting the original players of a franchise). Moreover, Paul Giamatti's orang utan character Limbo, a slave-trader, plays well to the crowd as an excellent source of comic relief.The origin of the apes and the movie's exposition gel well, despite the downpour of negativity from the so-called critics. Hints to the origin pop up in the exposition with such examples as the female scientist announcing a role that the pivotal chimp character, Pericles, is to undertake (I'll keep that role hush-hush).As for the setting, die-hard cult fans of the original films will not be disappointed. While the film is being marketed as happening on another planet rather than a post-apocalyptic Earth, there is a scene in the movie that plays to the original. In other words, Burton didn't mess much with his adaptation, only changing minor details as he had done with ""Batman"" in 1989.Finally, for those cynics who like to pass science-fiction off as superficial, this movie offers up a taste of abolition, reversing the roles of ""dominant"" and ""submissive,"" much like what was done in the film ""White Man's Burden,"" starring John Travolta as a white inferior to a rich Harry Bellafonti.

When I saw the trailer I feared this one wouldn't be as dark as his previous efforts, but there are still plenty Burtonesque images for the fans to be happy.I saw the original Charlton Heston film and although I appreciated the camp qualities and the shock ending, it was basically nothing more then a long episode of the muppet show.  This version has so much more style and the apes are truly impressive, you forget they're just humans, unlike in the original.  Rick Baker deserves an oscar for his work. I also think Mark Whalberg makes a much more realistic hero then Heston.

336,manalone923,"Tim Roth is great...Not worth the fierce hatred it's gotten, but still just average",7,28 November 2003,"I'll state right off that this is a prime example of the burning backlash that resonated after this film's release: The Oscar for Best Makeup went to A Beautiful Mind. Apes wasn't even nominated!!! A SPECIAL Oscar was created for the original!!!And that's a problem. The costuming and, especially makeup, in the 2001 Apes is absolutely marvelous. But people nowadays just seem to despise the film, and Burton himself for having directed it. But this is not deserved, although I'll express my problems with it.The story in a nutshell resembles the original: A lone astronaut crashes on a planet ruled by talking apes, and must survive their prejudice against him. But whereas the original had a deeply philisophical plot and dialogue to provoke thought, the 2001 remake is little more than a glamorized chase scene, running too long.I believe Mark Whalberg is a fine actor, evidenced in films like Boogie Nights and the Yards. But here as main character Leo Davidson, he has little to do besides look awed and run away. Literally. There are some lines here and there suggesting what could have been deeper thoughts, but for the most part it's just plot city: React to the apes, run from them, find shelter, rally to defeat said apes. And the worst part is that the rest of the human characters are a mixed bag of nobodies, equivalent to what I call the ""Shirts"" of Star Trek lore. You know them, they're the extras who get killed defending the heroes whose names we actually know. Giving the humans the ability to speak does nothing more than hand them the chance to rebel more vocally. There's no explanation for why they can speak, and it doesn't really matter that they can. And worse, the fact that the apes are used to human speech takes away from one of the most powerful moments and subsequent scenes of the superior original, which of course is where Chuck Heston speaks for the first time.That does remind me of the fact that although there are a few too many silly puns (as with the original as well, to be fair), the opportunity to reference the original is met successfully too. Heston's famous line is mirrored by an ape this time, as is his famous last line from the first film. In fact Heston himself appears in a role built in irony: Not only does he play an ape this time around, but he also condemns the evil capacity of a gun, which must have made some of his NRA pals a little miffed.Aside from some fun moments like that, the movie's redeemable aspect is, of course, the apes themselves. Using the aforementioned excellent makeup, the actors in ape costume can now emote with the best of them. They snarl, sneer, smile, and speak mostly clearly. No more muffled sounds coming from the almost duck bill appliances that the 60's actors had to work with. The apes MOVE like apes too, loping about, running on all fours, using their feet to hold things. If the movie focused more on them and far, far less on the throwaway humans, the movie would have been much more enjoyable.
What I did like, or rather love about the film, was Tim Roth. I saw the film in the theater multiple times, directly due to Roth's portrayal of the cruel main ape, General Thade. This character absolutely lit up the screen when he was on, delivering lines with the cruel ferocity and impatience of a madman just brimming over with contempt. He has passionate, naziesque hatred of the human race, and makes it no secret that he longs to exterminate them in any way possible. Roth chews the scenery and loves every minute of it, and it surely makes for the most entertaining part of the film. He swaggers, swings, and essentially becomes the most believable portrayal of a primate that I've ever seen. My favorite scene in the film is when he grabs Whalberg's leg from under him, tripping him onto the floor with a crash without even looking at the human. He then jerks Whalberg up and bends him over his lap, to pry open his mouth and look inside to see if a soul exists. Satisfied that he sees nothing, he pitches Whalberg back onto the floor without looking, as one would do to a piece of wadded paper being tossed aside. It's good, energetic stuff, and gives the film a very dark edge that the original didn't quite have.I've established that the film consisted mainly of scenes with Whalberg and other humans running, escaping, and otherwise walking away from the ape city and any other real interest. Now for the ending..I won't spoil it, but I must say this. The original film had one of the best shock twist ending in history, and was a very tough act to follow. This time around, there are two main twists, none very adequately explained or built up to, and at the end the viewer isn't left with awe but rather a shrug, as he ostensibly thinks ""some of that was cool, but the ending was pretty lame and / or confusing."" And since Tim Burton said he'd rather jump out of a window than direct another Apes movie, we'll probably never have a follow up.
That's sad, considering that this movie WAS entertaining, but not really done right. The apes were very interesting, but at the sake of the expendable human characters. I left feeling as though the raw power and fierceness of the apes was represented, but not enough. And if the movie focused more on them, as I'd said, it would've been more entertaining. But I admit there would've been less story and conflict as well, so what can you do? Now if only General Thade was in it way more....Ahh, yeah.In closing, I found it a fun but disposable film. The original is still better and a way more engaging, thought-provoking film. The 2001 remake is kind of a more short-attention span flash-fest, with some fun stuff here and there but not much more to sustain your interest after a couple viewings. The makeup, costumes and scenery were great, and Tim Roth's General Thade was a blast. But past that, not too much to sustain interest. But I do maintain that it wasn't the horrifying, joke-and-cringe inducing wreck of flames that pop culture might be saying it is. Decide for yourself, but whatever you do don't blame Burton entirely. The man's done some great work, and he honestly tried. Besides, he didn't write the much-rewritten finished script.",Planet of the Apes

I was a kid when the POA movies came out(I read the book at age 7, and saw the movie(Heston's version) at age 6. I marveled at the apes, and their culture, but even then I knew there was some dumbness in the script. Like why didn't Taylor place one of his 2 other crewmen on guard duty while they were swimming? They each had a gun in their survival backpack(and didn't all my friends and I want those cool metal packs with guns and stuff inside!)? So my dad and I groaned at that one! But the rest of the movie was cool, and had some important sociological stuff to say. Tim Burton's movie has none of the coolness or important stuff to say!(IMHO). It DOES have what I call ""idiot disease""---the current(since 1980 or so) brain rot of writers and filmmakers, which says ""let's assume the audience all has double digit IQ or even single digit IQ !"" Well, maybe the writers and money men in Hollywood DO have single and double digit IQ, but unless all of my generation and the one before it(and slightly immediately after it) are all dead, and I'm a dinosaur who forgot to extinct, some people who drop large amounts of money for a night at the movies, DEMAND Smart(read that common sense-ical and intellectually adult) writing in our movies.

He went for:boobs,babes,interspecies sexual encounters,cgi headache giving animation,and stupidity masquerading as ""Art"". How in the hell does the spaceship remain ""dormant but operational"" after what has been declared ""a couple thousand yrs""? why not arm the humans with the guns STILL IN THE SHIP?

These may seem bitterness driven quibbles, but I'm an English Professor darn it, I cannot see wasting my life trying to educate people who are happy with a world in which there is no common sense, no intellectual discourse, and no intelligence in their choices of reading(?) materials, music, movies, Art. Burton should be spanked for making this trash--He's a brilliant visionary, and a talented thinker--where was his head during this? As for actors, Marky Mark hit the high point in FEAR, with Reese Witherspoon. Helena Bonham Carter threw Lisa Marie from her place in Tim's bed(i was there as a fly on the wall), and Estella--dear, you need to get a life, honey! Only Roth and Heston saved this gawdawful idiot's parade!",Planet of the Apes
338,dhallen,Not as bad as I thought it was going to be....,7,26 February 2002,"I was very surprised by this film. I thought I would dislike it intensely, because that is how I feel about just about everything else that Tim Burton does (Beetlegeuse, Frankenweinie, Legend of Sleepy Hollow). However, it really wasn't that bad. That said, here is what I found lacking:The plot. Pretty ho-hum. Man gets lost, man tries to get found.The hero. Mark Wahlberg just doesn't cut it for me. He is fine as a supporting character, say, as a crewmember. But he doesn't carry this film. I never really cared about him as a person, and he never really did anything that could be called virtuous or admirable (except for the predictable scene where he saves the teenager as the apes attack). His character is shallow and wooden.The make-up & costumes. Sometimes great, as in the gorilla generals and Gen. Thade. The female ape make-up was silly, and the pants suit that Helena Bonham Carter wore through the entire movie made her look like Carol Channing. Estella Warren looked like she had just robbed her costume from Raquel Welch on the set of One Million Years B.C. (although at least Raquel's role had some substance to it). The stunts. More of that silly flying around stuff that seemed to get popular after Hidden Crouching Tiger or whatever it was called came out. Since when do gorillas fly through the air?The ending. My 13-year-old daughter predicted it. And it doesn't even make sense.The sets. Stolen from the Ewok Adventure, apparently.What did I like? The pacing. It moved the movie right along and made it seem shorter than it really was.",Planet of the Apes

This isn't just ""let's shoot the same movie all over again with different actors"", it's actually a fairly different take on the same material.  The basic concept remains the same, but it's most definitely a different movie.One of the most noticeable differences is in the apes themselves.  They're a great deal more bestial, athletic and...well, ape-like than their 1968 counterparts.  Charlton Heston was threatened by the apes because they had guns.  Mark Wahlberg is threatened by the apes because they are, as one might rightly expect, much more than a physical match for a human.  I did miss the caste system that ruled the simian society in the original, but that probably has more to do with the script overall being much less allegorical than Rod Serling's 1968 screenplay.Mark Wahlberg is an appealing enough hero, though there's not really much of a character to play.

I could hardly understand him under the growling and mumbling. Helena Bonham Carter's make-up was Amateur and Mark Wahlberg was awful.Luckily I'm a male and Estella Warren provided the stimulation for me, even though she got to say about five dumb lines.What's good about this film?

This movie has a great vibe to it and the story is fairly decent. However, the main protagonist is miscasted in my opinion and some events are also quite lacking. Like how easily an order from a superior officer is disregarded for silly selfish reasons putting himself at great risk. The same thing at the ending because there couldn't possibly be evenough fuel and oxygen left in that small vessel for the 'final trip'. The main battle was also a dissapointment because 'the plan' didn't make much sense, it didn't work, and choppy editing at times.

The original Planet Of The Apes is a sci-fi classic with Charlton Heston and Roddy McDowell, no remake needed to be made, no remake should have been made. It looks pretty, all of Burtons films do, but it has no soul. This film is a tangled mess that falls flat in almost every respect. The lead guy has no personality, unlike Hestons gritty Taylor, the apes jump about like fleas on a dog and don't seem anywhere near as organized or likable as the originals, and the ending???.Sometimes it's just better to leave things alone, this was definitely one of the those times.",Planet of the Apes

Like most, I love the original film because it had a great story along with fabulous camera work, music, makeup and costumes.  The remake is nothing like the original and I knew that going into it.  Burton's Planet of the Apes has great things (set design, matte' paintings, special effects and makeup) in it, but the story and pacing are disappointing.  The mood is too claustrophobic.  There are no interesting characters (Markey Mark the underwear model can't fill Heston's loin cloth). Cliche's are abundant.  Tim Roth's character is a little too evil and over the top.  The humans talk and have nothing to say. It would have been preferable to keep them mute like the original.  Maybe my point of view has been warped by the excellent 1968 version.  Burton's work ended up being one big jumbled mess.  I even took a short nap in the middle. My 12 year old son woke me up by grabbing my shoulder and when he saw I was dozing said ""oh my god.""

I remember the original keeping me on the edge of my seat and hating the bad guys - Here there weren't any real characters - EVERY ONE WAS A CLICHE!Some of the long range scenes looked like the actors re-used the cheesy ape suit from Octopussy (or Trading Places)!I could go on - but why waste time on this.

346,austex23,"A painfully contrived, good-looking mess",3,28 July 2001,"2001 may well be memorable as the prime year for really stupid movies.  Tim Burton's ambitious attempt to remake a dubious classic is certainly not the worst offender of the summer, but it may be the one that wastes the most potential.  In trying to avoid the pitfalls of most remakes, Burton and his scripters have tortured logic to contravene the ""surprise"" ending of the original to the point that their story makes little dramatic or logical sense.  With decent make-up (the lady apes are a little silly-looking), cool sets, and impressive stunt-actor acrobatics, the movie has great visual appeal, but the story veers between an allegory of man's inhumanity to man-like beings and an epic action film without ever managing to be entertaining.  See coincidence stretched once again to the breaking point, lame one-liners that no one laughs at, meaningless characters who serve no dramatic or thematic purpose, all in the service of a story with no real point.  Have to applaud the hilarious scene where perennial NRA pimp Charlton Heston as a dying father ape reveals that the secret family treasure is a hand-gun, and some of the ape cultural touches (loved the way they mounted horses) are really neat, but generally this movie left me feeling like I had wasted over two hours of my life and several points of my IQ.  And after this summer, I don't have much left.  Easily Tim Burton's worst movie.",Planet of the Apes

These ""characters"" should be written well and portrayed with good acting so as the audience that has spent its hard earned money may relate to them, believe in them, and ultimately give a damn about them.  Poor Mr. Burton, this film has but a trace of his talent.  It you love bad dialogue and some cool looking dudes in Ape suits  this movie is for you.  The best part was when Bubbles got his but kicked.  I'm sorry, but not even a descent performance by Tim Roth could save this plotless film.

Makeup:  good, set design: outstanding, acting: awful, script and dialog: the worst piece of rubbish yet this year. Just because it is said to be a revision doesn't give it the right to completely be disrespectful of the audiences intelligence. To go from sleepy hollow (which I enjoyed throughly) to this?

I'd rather watch the Battle for the Planet of the Apes (the weakest of the series) on a 24 hour loop then ever see this again. At least Aldo would make me smile with his terrible acting because his was probably only paid in peanuts (no pun intended) due to budget restraints.

You can't call this intelligent sci-fi, it is too generic and moronic for that.  The ending is clearly trying to one-up the ending in the original film, but it makes absolutely no sense.  At least the ending in the original film A) Explained the history of the planet and B) Left you with a powerful message.  This ""remake"" is a waste of time for everyone involved, and a waste of money for anyone who shelled out $8 to see it.Don't get me wrong.  I like Tim Burton.  But since ED WOOD, he hasn't made a decent film.  He's lost his touch big time, and this film is the prime example.  Mark Wahlberg has been good in other movies, but here he is a joke.

It was painfully obvious that their speech was being impeded by the prosthetic teeth that they had to wear, which I found to be ultra-annoying. I have liked about half of Tim Burtons movies but this one knocked him down a few notches in my mind. Do yourself a favor, avoid this crappy remake and watch the far superior original 1968 film.

354,mido505,A Desecration,1,6 August 2001,"Well, where do I start? When the five original Apes movies were remastered and re-released on DVD, I spent a week rewatching them. Not only were the films pleasing on an aesthetic level, but I was better able to appreciate the complex political subtext that had been inserted by Rod Serling and later screenwriters. These are angry, intelligent films, which in many ways, despite diminishing budgets, get better as the series progresses. The revolutionary implications of the fourth film, Conquest (its climax was modeled after the Watts riots), were so extreme that the studio forced a re-shoot of the ending, which originally had Caesar (played with amazing Shakespearean grandeur by Roddy McDowell) leading a final slaughter of the hopelessly debased human population.How can a film over two hours long contain so little? There is not one good line, there is not one good SHOT in the entire remake. Given Tim Burton's track record, I expected at the very least a memorable visual experience. Instead we get a dim bluish murk, clunky editing, and shoddy, oppressive studio-bound sets. The oh-so-clever 'relevant' dialog wouldn't pass muster on a lackluster episode of Politically Incorrect, and the 'shock' ending is just completely incomprehensible. Also, why did they make Helena Bonham Carter's ape character look like Michael Jackson?In 1968, Chuck Heston, as the misanthropic astronaut Taylor, ran around in a loin cloth, bared his ass, and roared bitter imprecations in his great, gravely voice. Now Mark Walberg (the new Cary Grant, according to Vanity Fair - go figure) keeps his bulky, restrictive space suit on for the entire film, and DOES NOT EVEN BOTHER TO ACT. His voice never rises above a whisper. His facial expression never changes. Well, that routine only works when you have charisma to spare. Had I been casting this film, it would have been Bruce Willis all the way. He would have known how to empathize with an ape.How sad that the three-dimensional characters of the original series have been reduced to platitudinous stereotypes; or that the story is now nothing more than 'heroic astronaut liberates oppressed humans from evil monkeys'; or that, had I not read the reviews ahead of time, I would not have known who played the apes (in the old days they put distinctive voices under the make-up: McDowell, Kim hunter, Paul Williams, John Huston). THIS IS WHY I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE MOVIES ANYMORE! This is why I would rather stay at home and watch Kurosawa on DVD.Thank God Roddy did not live to see this.",Planet of the Apes

I wonder if it's because everyone seems to be comparing it to the original, and that's probably not fair, as the original is one of the world's all-time classics. I think this new version deserves to be judged on its own. I rather liked it. It did get off to a bit of a slow and predictable start, but the second half of the movie was excellent. I must, however, agree with some of the other reviewers here in that I did not understand the ending!About the ending (MAJOR SPOILER TO FOLLOW): At first I was thinking that something Davidson did somehow changed the past, and hence he returned to Earth to find the apes in charge. But on reflection, Thade's face & name replacing Lincoln's has its own meaning -- not just the apes in charge, but Thade in particular. When and how did Thade come to Earth? Or was the other planet really Earth, too, just in the distant future? I am still confused about this. I would welcome hearing anyone's theories (my e-mail address is shown above). All in all, I think this was a great movie, and very undeserving of all the criticism I'm reading here.

But with the blatant holes in the script, I walked out of the movie shaking my head. How could a director of Tim Burton's character make this version of Planet of the Apes with a script that made Lost in Space (TV Series) look good.I could probably ignored some lapses of common sense in a movie but when the whole premise of the story has so many gaping chasms you cannot ignore them. The effects were good, but I would wait until they had a movie double with Battlefield Earth. That way you can feel really ripped off.Spoilers don't read on unless you really want to see this movie. When you see a movie the last thing I hate thinking is how silly, why did the hero do that. Example, After he escapes the ape city then he gets his survival kit from his ship rather than when he first crashed. The Holes - If they descended from the original space station and the only animals they had on board were chimpanzees. Where did the horses, gorilla's, orangutans & parrots come from? The worm hole? It was so convenient. I can imagine the scriptwriter, William Broyles saying to himself, ""gee I have painted myself into a corner here, I'll just use the worm hole, nobody knows how they work"". And worse of all he did it a couple of times. Very weak writing, with no understanding of plausible continuity.Finally I could see why they were training chimps to fly the Pods (That incidentally can reach speeds 6 times that of light.

358,drrap,Tim Burton does not disappoint,6,27 July 2001,"After reading some of the early reviews of this film, I was beginning to worry that Tim Burton had finally become just another cog in the mind-numbing machinery of the SFX-laden film industry.  It was a huge relief to discover that Burton's *Apes* -- easily the most entertaining film so far this summer -- is perhaps his most visually and dramatically gripping film ever.  This is despite Mark Wahlberg's woodenly resolute performance, which displays about as much screen charisma as an orangutan's hairbrush.  The apes, however, in their far more pliant makeup, steal the show. Paul Giamatti absolutely steals the film as the conniving human-trader ""Limbo,"" and Tim Roth's General Thade is robustly animalistic.  The apes' habit of leaping in the air in displays of anger owes something to Jane Goodall and something to Hong Kong action flicks -- but wherever it comes from, it adds an extra zest to the simian world. While it doesn't reach the darkly sublime heights of Batman or Edward Scissorhands, *Apes* is Burton's best in some time, and easily steals the show from the series of  stumbling (and expensive) zombies the studios have vomited forth so far this summer.",Planet of the Apes

He just stood around with a stupified look on his face.  The action scenes were contrived and trivial.  There was never a sense of danger.  The ape makeup was one of the good things of the movie, but it was probably best on Tim Roth.  Helena Bonahm Carter's makeup was the worst.  There were so many plot holes, illogical plot elements, and incosistencies with the apes that it ruins all the enjoyment of the movie.  Not one actor gave a half-decent performance.

360,MovieTrey,Ome of the better summer movies,7,6 October 2001,"Planet of the Apes was a real delight after a summer of disappointing movies.  This summer has been one disappointment after another.  First there was Tomb Raider, which was full of dumb cliches.  Then there was A.I, which had too much hype behind it and was too long to keep your interest.  After all the disappointments it's a real relief that the studios can still come up with a good movie. 	Tim Burton brings us another blockbuster hit.  This is Burton's best work since Sleepy Hollow.  Burton uses his unique techniques to bring the apes alive for the film.  His artistic expertise that Burton displayed in the making of Planet of the Apes has probably made him one of the most well known directors today.  The mere talent that Burton brings to a film makes him one of the most unique directors of our time. 	Mark Wahlberg is wonderful in this film.  He plays Leo Davidson, a United States captain who crash lands on the planet and discovers that the apes rule the planet.  This is a step up for Wahlberg from 1994's Renaissance Man, where he plays Private Tommy Lee Haywood.  This is probably Wahlberg's best film since Boogie Nights. 	Tim Roth plays the evil General Thade, general to the ape army.  He despises the human race.  Charlton Heston makes a small cameo appearance as General Thade's Father, the only ape with a gun.

361,mozart827,"Half-good, half-bad",6,30 July 2001,"(Some spoilers in this review...)Even without comparing this film to the original, I was rather disappointed. The first half, the effects, costuming, score, and some of the characters were all very good. The story was interesting and somewhat original and suspenseful up until the midpoint of the film. However, in the second half the film degenerated into a rather derivative, uninspired, Hollywood-ized, feel-good ending. It appears as if THE MATRIX (and XENA) has set a new standard for fight scenes (i.e., unbelievable aerial moves, violence that results in nary a scratch, etc.), which is getting rather tiresome. I'm also disappointed in the obligatory mass-combat scene (granted it is necessary in some films: GLADIATOR, THE PATRIOT, etc., but not in EVERY film). POTA also continues my dislike of children in most science-fiction films. The main human child character in this film was uninteresting and your typical film child character (rebellious and obnoxious) and he gave a stereotypical non-suspense scene during the climatic battle. I was also disappointed at the lack of atmosphere that one would expect from a Tim Burton film.SPOILER: Normally I can figure out any sort of time-loop, paradox thingy that a story has. However, the ""surprise-ending"" in this version of POTA does not seem possible at all, at least not as a consequence of Leo's actions.Because this is a remake, it begs to be compared to the original POTA. Because Burton's version is not set on Earth, it lacks the emotional punch that the 1968 version did and still does.

Skip this and watch reruns of FARSCAPE on the telly - far more entertaining.  And why *is* Mark Wahlberg a movie star, anyway?

369,Mercader79,Close. But no banana.,5,23 September 2001,"Perhaps there's no such thing as a bad Tim Burton film, but Planet of the Apes comes perilously close. Visually the make-up is generally impressive  the overall effect of seeing so many simian humanoids at once is quite overpowering, even if most of the set-design is pretty unimaginative.
Tim Roth's performance as a sort of Richard III ape is perhaps the most memorable  his strangulated restless manner is reminiscent of the mortally wounded Mr Orange in Reservoir Dogs (although he wasn't a monkey). Bonham Carter is also impressive in a decisive departure from her flowery Merchant Ivory image. Only the make-up lets her down  her visage seems to have been tampered with in an ultimately futile attempt to make her look her like an attractive ape. This fails. On the other hand, Estella Warren's Daena is far too much like a supermodel to look like a convincing native girl.So why does Planet of the Apes fail? Here are some ideas.1) Why do the humans on the planet speak? In the original film and the novella there was a direct human-apes reversal situation  the humans could not speak or communicate anymore effectively than monkeys can on Earth. That was why the arrival of Heston's character stirred the waters. Here the humans are clearly ruled over by the apes, but given their supposed mastery of technology' which the apes lack, there seems no real reason why the apes should be so dominant. Burton seems to be striving for a civil rights parallel. Roth's ape even misquotes the reactionary Senator Barry Goldwater at one point. But this paradox still makes little sense.2) Too much of the dialogue is banal or just stupid. There are a number of signs the film is rushed.3) The comedy' orang-utan is annoying. 4) Wahlberg is no action hero. He got away with it playing a porn actor but not here. 5) The ending seems to be an attempt to echo that of the novella. Yet that made sense. This one doesn't. It is not clever, just inexplicable. I HEREBY DEFY ANYONE ON THESE PAGES TO EXPLAIN THE ENDING SATISFACTORILY! It's impossible - it's nonsensical.Overall, not a disaster, but highly disappointing.",Planet of the Apes

371,silentmallrat,It' GRREEAAAATTTT,9,1 August 2001,"I went in seeing the Tim Burton Planet of the Apes, with my hopes aimed low.  I loved the first Planet of the Ape, though i have yet to see the entier series, I was wondering how they were going to pull this off.  I was very suprised.  The angel that they took was better than i expected.  They didn't go for a ""Remake"" of the original, but took some elements of the first one, and gave a Buton-esq spin on things.  WARNING< SPOLIERS:  The direction of not making the planet Earth was much better.  Knowing that nothing could live up to the orginal, they basicly said ""Screw it"" and gave a whole new origin to the Apes.  Mark Walburge's charecter is very belivable. Unlike Chuck Heston's charecter, Walburge's Leo excepts that apes are in control.  He could care less.  All he wants to do is get out, get this monkey, and go home.  The ape in the movie are also presented more human like than that of the original one.  They are more reminisant of people in the mid to late 1800's as where people were into slavery, those who flet it was wrong, began making their voices heard.  Same as with the Apes.  They felt that Humans where inferior, and thus should be slaves, but then there where those who felt that humans should be free and equal.  Tim Burton was an excelent choice for director.  Though Planet of the Apes was an odd movie for him to make (unlike the genius Sleepy Hollow, which he was born to make)  Burton really makes what he has to work with, work.  The dark theme of the  movie is not the usuall ""Gothic"" dark that Burton has in most of his movies (Edward Sisccor hands, Batman 1 and 2, Bettle juice, Sleepy Hollow)  he gives a dark theme that is some what moody and evil.  My only small problem is that they used the great Chuck Heston on liners, only the Apes said them.  But it was Chuck Heston himself that redeliverd his great ""Damn them, Damn them all to hell"" line, but as an APE!!  I recomend it highly.",Planet of the Apes
372,palpatine89,good enough without that ending,6,1 December 2001,"Tim Burton's ""re-imagining"" of Planet of the Apes was actually pretty good. I think it's just the ending that brought it down.Astronaut Leo Davison (Mark Wahlberg) goes to find a chimpanzee named Peracliese who was lost investigating an electro magnetic storm.  Leo is swept up in the storm and sent to a world where apes rule over humans with an iron fist.  He is captured and brought to Ape City.  A human rights activist named Ari (Helana Bonham Carter) frees Leo and Daena (Estella Warren).  They all escape with others and soon become  hunted by General Thade (Tim Roth).  The group reaches the sacred ruins of CALIMA, and have a huge all-out battle between the ape army and the humans.This movie has intense action sequences, amazing make-up, a good score, fair visual effects, and great directing.  The best performances are Roth's (who I think needs a nomination for best supporting actor) and Carter's.  Burton again does a superb directing job.  The movie itself is good.  I just hated that ending.I give Planet of the Apes 8/10.",Planet of the Apes
373,palpatine89,didn't need ending,6,1 December 2001,"Tim Burton's ""re-imagining"" of Planet of the Apes is pretty good except for that ending (no spoilers) that I really didn't like.  Burton really didn't nee that ending to make it good.  it was great by itself. USAF space station Oberon is doing experments on geniticly altered monkeys in space.  One day a chimpanzee named Periclese  gose to investigate an elctric magnetic storm and disaperes.  The film's hero, Leo Davison (Mark Wahlberg), who has become freinds with Periclese, gose out to find him and is swept up in the storm.  He eventualy crashes on a planet that is contrloed by apes, and is captured.  He then mets Ari (Helana Banham Carter) and escapes ""Ape City"".  The group is being hunted by the comander of the ape army, Thade (Tim Roth).  They reach the sacred ruins of CALIMA, and have a hugh battle with the ape army. The film had incredible scenery and make-up.  I loved ""Ape City"" (probubly so did everyone else), and all the scenes were the veiwer gets a look at ape civilization.  The action sequences are also outstanding with a whole lot of apes flying through the air.  I also liked that the actors actualy moved and looked liked apes.  Mark Wahlberg's preformance could have been better, but was berible.  The stand-out preformances are realy Tim Roth and Helana Bonham Carter.  Both did exelently in their roles.  Roth is no where. It's all Thade.  This is undoutibly one of Burton's most imaginitive films, but not his best.  I give Planet of the Apes 8/10.",Planet of the Apes
374,Allan-14,"Visually Stunning, Impressive... and of course, Flawed Version of ""Apes""",8,19 November 2001,"I first became a fan of the ""Planet of the Apes"" saga when I was 12 years old. HBO was showing the original film and I came in on the scene in which Charlton Heston's Taylor was being interrogated in the apes' court. I was hooked from that moment on. I bought all five original films and watched all of them countless times and re-bought them when Fox put out the THX-Widescreen tapeset for the 30th anniversary. What did Apes do for me? Well, to begin with, it made me examine my religion. The end result? I determined I wasn't Christian. It also made me want to be a film director even more. THIS WAS WHAT SCI-FI COULD DO. Even the weakest entry of all, ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes,"" was above standard sci-fi entertainment.So here I am, 22 years old, exploring religion, life, and directing my first ambitious independent film, which is even titled as a small homage to the fourth ""Apes"" film, ""Conquest of Area 52"" (there will be an IMDB entry on it next year sometime). ""Planet of the Apes"" is among my biggest reasons for wanting to make films and it's impacted the way I think as well.I've read the wonderful Pierre Boulle novel (and own the first printing, which I um, borrowed from my high school library) and I will be buying the ""Apes"" TV series on DVD. And of course, I saw Tim Burton's ""reimagining"" of ""Planet"" on opening day.From the beginning, I'm already biased. The original Apes saga was my Bible. To paraphrase, ""Everything I Needed to Know I Learned From Apes."" Heh-heh. Tim Burton... love the guy. He made ""Ed Wood,"" one of my top ten favorite films. His unique visions and styles have always intrigued me. Admittedly however, Burton normally did not have strong points in plot or character development. His ""Batman"" films were a mixed bag, not showing enough of the psychology of what it meant to be Batman, but they were so visually entrancing that I am still able to watch them on their own merits. In fact, both ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" get an 8.5/10 from me. ""Mars Attacks"" is a joy to watch on the right day, and the same goes with ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Beetlejuice."" By the time he directed ""Sleepy Hollow,"" I felt that Burton had evolved so much as a visual storyteller that he really could not be judged for weak plot or character. That's the way he wants to be as an artist, so let it be.But...This time, he's done ""Planet of the Apes."" If it were anything else, like say a remake of ""2001"", I could still watch it and not crucify it. No, this new version is not anything worth crucifying. ""Apes 2001"", shall we call it, has the all the Burton standards- plot and character on the back burner, awesome visuals at the forefront. What sets Burton aside from say, the biggest hack of all time Michael ""Pearl Harbor"" Bay, is that while his character drama may not be the most engaging, it's not exactly boring or annoying. It's just SIMPLE. This version plays out like the 1968 version except cut down to the core: an astronaut crashlands on a strange planet, he gets caught, is imprisoned at Ape City, gets away with the help of a lovable chimp, goes into the Forbidden Area, finds out the origin of the apes, and leaves the apes to go home. That last part is the only thing really different in the overall structure, except this time, the film does not end there, and we get an ending which both pays its respects to Boulle's original novel and Franklin Schaffner's original film.There are several references this version makes to the original series. With the Apes army we get a nod to ""Beneath."" With the love story, er, triangle, there's a similar feel to Zira and Cornelius' plight in ""Escape."" The look of the astronaut costumes is very similar to those in the first two. And the origin of the apes rings in similar tone to the fourth film, ""Conquest.""Did I like it? I've only seen it twice, so its a bit hard to say that without going, ""except for this... and that... and this... and that..."" What I liked: the cinematography, the sets (which are never all that real-looking but invoke memories of illustrated children's books, which is a Burton constant), the movement and makeup of the apes (maybe the two most noteworthy things done here), the cameos by Chuck Heston and Linda Harrison (Nova from Apes I & II). I also liked the love triangle between Ari, Leo, and the blonde; this was very humorous. Wahlberg didn't add much depth to a written character already lacking depth, but he certainly had the right expressions for his character. I wouldn't be particularly overjoyed by my stay on the Planet of the Apes either. Helena Bonham-Carter is always good in whatever she does, and her character in this was endearing enough to accept her makeup, which differs greatly from the others. Paul Giamatti's Limbo may be the best character of all, providing the most comic relief. Tim Roth as Thade is brilliant, as are the rest of the key players. I didn't appreciate that the social commentaries were sometimes rather clumsily slapped on; indeed a lot of the time they seemed like desperate attempts by Burton to put SOMETHING in there saying ANYTHING when the script had little to give him (Burton arrived on the project fairly late and had little time to shape the film).Overall, this 2001 version of ""Planet"" is far better than it should have been, given the success it had to live up to. It doesn't hold a candle to the original, and I certainly never expected it to. I'm glad Fox put a commercial artist in charge of it, rather than a commercial hack such as the afore-mentioned Michael Bay or Tony Scott. It may have been more intriguing had Oliver Stone worked on it (Stone was attached several years back).Tim Burton did the near-impossible for me: I didn't want to kill him after watching this. And for an Apes fanatic such as myself, that is saying a heck of a lot. Let's all hope that when Fox greenlights the sequel, they don't hand it over to Joel Schumacher. I'd take Ed Wood's Planet of the Apes over his anyday.I do have one quibble I think is more than worthy of consideration to even a non-Apes fan not familiar with the original series:We know where the Apes come from in ""Apes 2001."" But why the heck would that space station have HORSES on it?! Sorry, I'm not gonna take the old lame scientific explanation about how life on other planets must be similar. I may be a Darwin enthusiast, but come on. That's stretching it.",Planet of the Apes
375,behemuthm,Better than the original...almost.,9,29 July 2001,"*SPOILIERS*I think this movie was re-edited shortly before it's release. I say this because there are two things I've noticed: One, the line in the trailer ""Bring me the space man!"" is omitted. Two, there is not one, but two big plot twists in the film. The first one is cool and works well, the other is HORRIBLE. Burton, if this was your fault, you are an idiot. If it was Fox's fault, all you studio execs are idiots.The similarities between the original and the Burton films are few. There's the forbidden zone, there's a quick cameo of Dr. Zeus (ever so briefly, you have to be looking for him in the background). There's a bigger cameo of Charlton Heston as General Thade's father, also saying the like ""Damn them! Damn them all to hell!"" which brought on cheers in the crowd. There's also the first line between Marky Mark and an ape: ""Get your hand off me you damn dirty human!"" which wasn't received so well.The main plot twist was a good adaptation of the original, and perhaps a bit more realstic. However the second one brought on ""boo's"" from the crowd. People were really p***ed off at it. I won't give it away here, but let's just say that the other 99.9% of the film BARELY makes up for how bad this ending is.Tim Roth as Thade was INCREDIBLE. He stole the show.

It makes me wonder why they bothered to make this crap. Answer: money, the movie is rediculous and has no value add to the original. Sure the apes look more real, but their dialog is rediculous and a huge missed opportunity to even make the apes scary: something that shouldn't be too hard.I hold Burton responsible for this blunder and I'll never see another movie he makes in the theatre again, he's violated my trust by churning out this crap.

Of course, like the first film, it was only BASED on Pierre Boulle's novel. Like the 1968 film -- the only thing this film has to connect it to Pierre Boulle's work is the title (and a single plot twist). This film does deal with the same moral issues as the original (bigotry) and has some interesting angles of political ambition thrown in to the mix. However, the film ultimately failed to capture my interest as the original did. The characterizations were just flat and 2-dimensional. The ending was the only thing that was shocking. THADE had been beaten, yet his defeat ultimately won him the world he had sought to make.This twist ending was straight out of the book, but I wasted my time for all intents and purposes.

I really liked the soldier uniforms given to the apes. Another great addition was casting Mark Wahlberg as the leading character Leo Davidson and Helena Bonham Carter as the ape, Ari who assists him to escape the ape village along with her bodyguard.

There's nothing worse than the last scene of this movie.",Planet of the Apes
384,Nedla24,So bad that it's kinda good,5,28 July 2001,"Tim Burton is obviously a B-Movie fanatic.  I bet he has Roger Corman's entire collection.  Why else would he make a good film about a terrible filmmaker (Ed Wood)?  Why else would he make his own B-movie contribution (Mars Attacks), and why else would he remake the most famous B-movie EVER? 
Well I will say one thing; Burton is true to the genre.  What we have with Planet of the Apes is a somewhat diverting, overbudgeted, ridiculously scripted and acted movie.  However the worst part of this movie is not anything inside the movie.  It was the promotion.  This movie looked like a serious sci-fi attempt to succeed where the old version ridiculously (and entertaingly) failed.  But Tim Burton is unfortunately too true to the original.  Sure the make-up and special effects were cool, but there was nothing truly spectacular.  There were no moments where the audience was left in awe.  The battle sequences were huge disappointments and there was no real conflict set up anywhere.  It seemed that the screenwriters tried too hard not to let the movie drag and subsequently there was no tension or catharsis at the end.  The enormous cast is given criminally little to do.  Especially Tim Roth.  Yes the same Tim Roth that a few years ago created the deliciously evil Archibald Cunningham in Rob Roy is wasted.  His character Thane does nothing but snarl, growl, and bare his teeth.  There are attempts to make him human, but the script keeps the character so flat that the audience doesn't hate him, they just think he is annoying.  Luckily Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Paul Giamatti are all given a little more to do, but none of them are really compelling.  As for Whalburg, I can't find a thing to say about him, which means he did his job, but he didn't necessarily shine.  So the characters are flat, there is no dramatic tension and no catharsis, save at the very end when you find yourself laughing hysterically at how incredibly bad this movie is.  And then you realize that Burton is laughing too.  He meant the movie to be bad.  his tongue is planted firmly in his cheek.  And then you think maybe just maybe it's not so bad at all.
But while this movie succeds in being good by being bad, it falls way short of greatness.  You may be entertained, but I guarantee you will be disappointed.  5/10",Planet of the Apes
385,juliomontoya2000,"What have you done, Mr. Burton?",1,31 July 2001,"One of my friends I went to see the movie with, asked me, at the very beginning of this new version, if it had any resemblance to the original. He hadn't seen it. It was right at the time the starship of the movie's hero landed in the strange land. And I told him that yes, more or less, at this point, the movies were pretty much the same. Right there and then, similarities just vanished. The starship of this new version landed, and then the new version began to orbit around the old one, as tough admiring its excellency, but never getting into its atmosphere. The thing is that this new movie remind me of the old one over and over again, not because the latter is revived, but because its essence completely absent, and I missed it. Where the original gave us a science fiction story with RATIONAL twists of imagination, the new one develops as a succession of events that happen just because somebody said so. And when things happen just because they have to, the wonder of science fiction disappears, and we are left with a boring movie. And I heard about the `surprise' ending before I saw the movie. It is surprising, all right, but for the wrong reasons. Just when you think that nothing could be worse, well, it does. At this point, the new version just decides to give up the orbiting and finally heads for the space of oblivion. This ending leaves interrogations, not about the argument, but more like `What was Tim Burton trying to accomplish with that?'. I admire the fact that Tim Burton wanted to do something different, not just copying the original version. I mean, he dared to go against the odds and try and build something new inspired by a true classic. But as expected, he has only shown, once again, that you better don't mess with classics of that caliber.",Planet of the Apes
386,mikerichards,"Of man, apes and lip-gloss",4,29 August 2001,"'Planet of the Apes' was originally made in 1968 and turned out to be a box office smash, despite a rather limp plot and none too subtle allusions to the racial problems wracking America. It went on to spawn a number of weaker sequels and a short-lived TV show with ever decreasing results.Having said that, any of them have to be better than this luke-warm effort from Tim Burton. The studio was clear that this was not a sequel or remaking of the first film, it was a 're-imagination' - but it is quite clear that imagination is one thing missing from this movie.As with almost all big studio movies in 2001, the plot has been released back into the wild and is noticeable by its absence. To make up for this oversight the movie lurches from set-piece to set-piece throwing off any semblance of thought and coherence. Rather than have a plot, the movie sets up all sorts of gimmicks to get the heroes out of difficult situations. Mark Wahlberg has a gun in his survival kit, uses it to scare off some hostile apes. But two minutes later the gun is destroyed - oh no, what will they do now? No problems, right at the end of the movie ANOTHER gun is introduced from thin air to help out the heroes. Why not just keep the first one, or not have a gun at all?Instead of having the heroes, (or heaven forbid), the audience think, the movie always plays dumb. The climax is set in a ruined space ship that has been sitting in the desert for thousands of years. This ship (a hugely impressive set) has rusted through almost entirely, collapsed in places and is filled with sand. Yet little tiny switches work first time, convenient doors open and close with satisfying swooshing noises and there are video clips to explain the plot to the hard of thinking. There is simply no magic to the film, no satisfaction in working it out for yourself.And when its not playing dumb, it has gaps in the logic that make you go 'eh'? For instance, if the apes and the humans are both only on this deserted planet because of a crashed space ship, where did the horses come from?Is there anything worth seeing? Yes, Tim Roth's performance *IS* excellent, he does convince you that he is playing an ape and has a fine time chewing the scenery in the finest pantomime tradition. This is helped by some truly astonishing prosthetics used on his face. The rest of the ape designs are less successful, particularly Helena Bonham Carter's mask which is so thick and expressionless that she looks like a Muppet and forces her to talk with an irritating lisp.But if there is one thing that sums up all that is wrong with the film it is Estella Warren - beautiful, blond and completely and utterly pointless. Long lingering shots are devoted to her pouting and flicking her hair, but she does nothing else. Perhaps it's my age I couldn't help but think of Raquel Welch in 'One Million Years BC', but at least she had the decency to be chased by a dinosaur, Ms. Warren just stands in the background like a sulky teenager appealing to the teenage demographic. Perhaps I'm being too hard on her, because she does provide a tiny glimpse of hope for humanity. Apes may well be ascendant, mankind is reduced to savagery and the whole edifice of Western civilisation has come tumbling down but thanks to Estella Warren we know there is a bright future for orthodontistry, a girl can be sure of a fabulous leg wax and there is no shortage of non-smear lip gloss.

387,firedude440,Better than I thought,7,30 July 2001,Once again it is summer and the big blockbuster movies come out and they all stink such as Jurassic Park 3. (Which you can read my comment on if you want.) But this is not a bad movie. This is a great movie. Mark Wahlberg does a terrific job and so does the whole cast. It is incredibly interesting how it is made. Now since I am only a thirteen year old boy I have not seen the original but the person I saw this with says that they are incredibly different and it is hard to compare this and the 1968 version. When I heard a few years ago that they are making a remake for Planet of the Apes  i didn't think that it was going to be very good and I already knew it would be very hard to make with just the apes and at the end there is over a couple hundred apes. They had put in an extrordinary amount just when they had put the names up at the beginning. Although it is a good movie it is also confusing at the end.

In short, I wonder why this movie has been made at all. There was an older -better- one already. Why had this one been added? Of course, special effects are better now, but that is no reason for a new version. The makers did not use the challenge to give the movie the tension and suspense it really needs. They did add some -misplaced- humor, which really almost makes the film a kind of cartoon.Where is the time when SF films were full of suspense? ""Alien"" is an example, although that one has a bit too much of suspense. But was Tim Burton not able to make something better of it? In that case he should restrict himself to animated movies, like ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", which was brilliant.",Planet of the Apes

But because Tim Burton was my favorite film director and I thought it was only okay But watching it again, I'm one of the the few --probably on the planet--who really likes this First of all you really need to accept this film is not a remake, and I like the story more.Many criticize the direction, and I've found as an older person, I really liked it much more than when I was younger. In fact I was twelve when I saw it in the cinema -- the violence disturbed me, but I love the ending. I still love the ending Not enough films (or at least big films) have a finale like this, in fact that was one of the criticisms on Minority Report (which I need to watch again) But my favorite director of all time has made a film people consider his biggest fault, they don't like Alice in Wonderland either I love both, I love all his films.I'm proud I have the DVD, and don't need other people to like it as much to make me feel like I'm allowed to feel that way Oh and the cast and acting are wonderful, so is the make-up.

I did NOT like what he did with Batman, but Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas and of course Beetlejuice, were friggin great. But as Sleepy Hollow taught us, Tim Burton can make a stinker! And guess what? You found another one. Even if (Especially if) you are a fan of the original starring the NRA's Heston, you will hate this movie. All the good actors are dressed like monkeys, so good luck taking them seriously. Then there is Marky Mark. Fortunately he left the funky bunch out of this one. He is good when he plays an idiot being sucked into the porn industry, he is bad as action star. He just is. Rent The Italian hand Job and you will know what I am talking about. He is just not SMART enough to be an astronaut or thief. He is more.... Dirk Diggler. Perfect role. Anyway, if you had to watch this crap (airplane or someone who said its SOOO good) you know that it only gets worse.

Don't stop reading because I mention Star Trek.  Here goes: (One thing you have to know first, when Mark goes through this storm in space, he thinks he is taken to another planet, when he is really taken to another time on his). If you remember, when he was crash-landing on the ""other planet"" (Earth), his digital calendar was moving the years ahead very quickly.  He was going into the future.  The space-station he came from was pulled in too but not at the same time as him.  The space-station got pulled into a time 1,000's of years before him.  That space-station was carrying many genetically enhanced chimps.  When that station landed (crashed), the apes got out, killed the humans and populated the planet.  Since, Mark was sent to a time ahead of that, the apes had already evolved (genetically enhanced).  So, they evolved.  Remember, this is Earth.  Remember that at the end when Mark locks the General in that room he doesn't kill him.  So, after Mark leaves to go back to what he thinks is his planet, but is really another time, the General escapes and still has his armies so he exterminates the humans.  Mark goes through the time portal and really instead of going to what he thinks is Earth, he goes ahead in time even farther, to where the apes have evolved into a society like ours.  The statue (Abraham Lincoln) is of the General because he saved the planet for the apes (by exterminating the humans).",Planet of the Apes

397,Sithlord-20,Another Disappointment in a Summer Replete With Mediocrity,4,28 July 2001,"Does anyone else out there fondly remember summers past when James Cameron would wow us with intelligent action flicks like ""True Lies"" or ""Terminator 2,"" or Steven Spielberg would show us the true measure of his genius with an Indiana Jones adventure or the original ""Jurassic Park""?  Much to my dismay, those days are long gone.""The Mummy Returns"" was an exercise in overkill.  ""Pearl Harbor"" was a tedious bore.  ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Swordfish"" were both so thoroughly awful they don't even merit discussion.  Spielberg's ""A.I."" was a pretentious mish-mash of vague concepts.  And you know things are bad when the usually reliable Disney delivers an uninspired dud like ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire."" Only slightly better were ""The Score"" (buoyed by its actors) and ""Jurassic Park III,"" whose makers were wise enough to give us only 90 minutes of a rapidly tiring novelty.Which brings us to this disgrace.  While I am not a huge fan of the original, I am sure this version is sure to enrage those who are.  The writers of ""Planet of the Apes"" have substituted a series of lame jokes and puns for an actual plot, while subjecting us to a bunch of bland, one-dimensional characters and familiar action sequences.  The incessant screeching and growling of the apes stands as the most annoying redundancy in a film since the depth charges of ""U-571.""  Only the superb make-up by Rick Baker et al. make this film worthy of a one-time viewing.Finally, some thoughts on the director, Tim Burton.  For the life of me I cannot figure out why so many people adore his work.  Yes, I love ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,"" and the original ""Batman,"" while no masterpiece, is one of the best comic book movies to date.  But his track record of late is atrocious:  ""Sleepy Hollow"" was awful, and until I saw ""Mars Attacks!"" I never thought I'd see Jack Nicholson give a truly bad performance in a film. I will give ""Beetlejuice"" full marks for comedic value and originality, but ""Edward Scissorhands"" is a cheesy sentimentalist abomination.I find it interesting that ""Ed Wood,"" far and away Burton's best film, is the one least remembered or mentioned by his legions of acolytes.  The talent of which he is capable shines through that film, but it appears he has sacrificed it for the allure of big-budget bombast like ""Planet of the Apes.""

Burton usually provides nice twisted stories and wonderful sceneries. But not this time. There is none of crazy of Mars Attacks, and too little of the moodiness of Batman. None of the skilful storytelling of Sleepy Hollow. The apes are wonderful and quite believable, except for their wild jumps. The ape city is fabulous. But the rest is rather bland. And the story sucks big time! It is too predictable, too simple, just done without feeling. If anyone is surprised at the end, I am amazed.The acting is quite OK, Helene Bonham Carter does a wonderful job as an ape. The crazy ape Thade is a lovely psychotic. But the hero is wooden, and the babe unnecessary. The movie had me twisting in my seat wishing certain scenes would end quickly. The logic at the end, when here can choose between staying and being everybody's hero and have at least one human and one ape girl to enjoy himself with, but instead goes off into space and into a storm is just mad. If I were the guy, I would stay and not risk the storm again; never know where it would put me.The one redeeming quality is the few massed scenes were the ape legions leave their city and the attack at the big battle at the end.

404,benqstock,response to some questions.,8,19 August 2001,"i know i am nnot meant to directly respond to another post, but i think these questions need to be answered:
*******SPOILER ALERT************
Q. How did the clock in the mini-spacecraft know what year it is? You see the year quickly moving forward - on what signal or date is this based?A. I dunno. But it turned out to be innacurate anyway, as Davidson was actually in the past.
Q. In the original movie, the humans could not talk. This made it believable that the apes would treat humans like animals, because in our own world, animals do not talk. One of the biggest problems in this remake is that the humans CAN talk. This makes the idea that they would be treated like animals ridiculous. You can bet that if apes could speak English in our world, we probably wouldn't keep them in zoos, animal rights notwithstanding.A. Remember when Americans kept black people as slaves? I beleive they could talk, but it made no difference to their 'masters'.Q. How is that when Capt. Davidson (Wahlberg) lands on the planet, he enters it in the future, but when the main ship crashed on the same planet going after him, it was thousands of years in the PAST? Wouldn't the time be the same for both - after all, they are going through the same space-time distortion?A. The distortion was unstable, so it spat anyone that entered it out at many different points in time. Hence Davidson, the Monkey, and the main ship all entering at different times.
Q. It's never clearly explained how the chimps mutated to become apes, and intelligent, English speaking apes at that.A. In the film it is mentioned that they were genetically engineered apes. After arriving on the Planet and killing the humans on the ship, thy evolved into English speaking apes.
Q. How did the apes get from their planet to Earth and replace all the humans? A. The apes never left their planet. There planet was in fact Earth. Davidson landed on Earth in the PAST, therefore affecting the future. Since he didn't kill General Thade, we are meant to assume that after Davidson left to return home, Thade escaped from his captivity, got the apes to join him again and dispatched all the humans. So when Wahlberg returned to Earth in the FUTURE, it was populated by apes.

Why they chose to take a perfectly good idea and change into a bad idea is beyond me.  This movie was designed to please thirteen year olds. Lots of monkeys jumping around and some cool special effects.  Those of us who have seen the original and know that it was an intellectually effective movie, should generally be disappointed with this sad re-make.  Don't get me wrong, the apes were cool looking and the special effects were decent.  In fact, take the monkeys of today and put them in the Charleton Heston film 34 years ago and you'd really have something.  I don't want to spoil the film for anyone so I won't, but what is the deal with the end?  Those of you who have seen it know what I'm talking about.  This is a perfect example of poor story telling, from completely undeveloped characters who suddenly play a somewhat surprisingly important role in the protagonists actions, to scenes which have even the most intelligent of critics at a loss (in reference to the end).I gave this movie 6 out of 10 because as I said, the monkeys are cool.  I love Tim Roth and they obviously spent a great deal of time teaching the actors to act as apes.  However, this is never enough to make up for a bad story (those apes evolved awfully fast).

415,Mr Dread,It could have been... but it isn't.,5,30 July 2001,"WARNING: May contain minor spoilers!( C+ ) I have mixed feelings about this movie, but overall impression is negative. It definitely was not what I thought it would be. and what it could have been if not for some painfully obvious flaws. And despite the `re-imaging' it is still inferior to the original 60's version. Simply, it doesn't offer much more than what I've already seen in the trailer.
One thing is true: the movie did have some amazing special effects and the makeup. Both of these crews did a phenomenal job. The make-up effects were simply extraordinary, and of course, far better than in the original. But again, with the budget they had, the high expectations from the public and the special effects and make-up wizardry we've already seen in the movies, we already expected it to be great. I have only one complaint: the artists tried to make the female apes too feminine and human-like. Simply put, the make up for the female apes wasn't as convincing as the make up for the males, but no big deal.When I first saw the trailer, I was astounded. However, one thing bothered me ever since then, and it was the human characters-more particularly, their appearance. They were all. too pretty. Handsome. Beautiful. This had always set off an alarm in my head, especially if I have high expectations for a movie, like I had for the Apes. Such smooth and pretty faces are all right in such small TV shows like The Relic Hunter or Xena: Warrior Princess. But in a huge sci-fi motion picture like Apes, I expect some reasonable detail and realism. And as the movie progressed, I found that the apes were more believable than the humans and that's not necessarily a good thing, since I know I should be rooting for the humans, but I just didn't feel any sympathy towards them. The characters seemed shallow, and the only real feelings and emotions that I encountered in the movie, were those of the apes.Imagine: you find yourself in a word that has been turned upside-down, and suddenly you're a slave to the apes. You eat whatever they give you. You sleep whenever you're not needed. You work hard. You wear the same clothes everyday, and you haven't bathed in a very long time, or haven't had the chance to practice any kind of hygiene for that matter. And to add to the list, you're beaten and kept in an atrocious environment. Then, you happen to stumble upon a mirror. how would you think you'd look like? Well, if you happen to be a male, I can almost guarantee that you wouldn't walk around clean-shaven, with a nice, smooth and bright complexion. And if you're a female, your hair won't be nice and curly (even if the curls are natural, they wouldn't look too good), and you would have light traces of lipstick or any kind of makeup. And here's where Tim Burton really disappointed me, because I've always thought of him as a director who pays attention to detail. However, the slaves almost shine for goodness-sake! The only reasonably believable character was Kris Kristofferson's character, but unfortunately, he's not in the movie long.The human clothes are torn, dirty and so on. But notice the `beauty' in this movie: Daena, played by Estella Warren (I'm not really sure if this character was necessary. I rather think not). Yes, her clothes are dirty and ragged, but conveniently crafted as well. It's as though, these slaves had their own fashion designer that was forced to work with dirty scraps of material, but still managed to create a nice little dress with a cut to show cleavage and nicely narrowed in the waist to accentuate her great body, and cut nice and high to show her great legs. Like I said before, that's all great for a little TV show like Xena or Relic Hunter, but here of course, I expected higher quality filmmaking.Mark Wahlberg was good, but he wasn't great. I didn't think he projected his emotions well, because I didn't feel his pain, or shock. To think that Wahlberg's character encounters not just talking apes, but loud, human-size, scary-looking talking apes. If that's not enough to defecate in your own pants, I don't know what is. But Wahlberg's character gets over this realization unusually quickly.The movie was worth seeing just for the apes. Not only were the makeup and costumes terrific, but also the actors underneath it all. Two apes in particular stick in mind: Thade (played by Tim Roth) and Limbo (played by Paul Giamatti) used effectively as a comic relief. Both roles were very convincing and the makeup on these particular apes was incredible. But Thade, the evil General, impressed me the most. I thought it was a great character, superb makeup and phenomenal acting by Tim Roth.
And finally comes the ending. Understandably, there is nothing the writers of this movie, or Tim Burton could have done to overwhelm the ending of the 1968 version-that movie delivered a punch in the gut like few movies have. It was possibly one of the greatest, most powerful endings of all time. But what they have done in this version is simply ridicules. This movie would not have been so bad if not for the last few minutes of the film (which feel incredibly rushed) and a pathetic attempt shock the audience in some new way. I think they failed miserably and I found the ending laughable rather than shocking.Overall, the movie wasn't bad but it was very disappointing. The visuals were great, and so were the apes, but everything else seems to need a lot of work. Too bad-it really could have been something great.",Planet of the Apes
416,cscjr8,An incredible waste of effort,6,6 August 2001,"Tim Burton's latest bears his signature: it looks great. Most of the sets are original and the actors' stint in ""ape school"" has paid off. The ape characters walk, move, and even fidget like apes, chimps, and orangutans, and the actors blend their movements seamlessly into their performances and the scenes. No one seems to be saying ""Look at me! Look at me!"" (with the exception of Charlton Heston). Helena Bonham Carter and especially Tim Roth give standout performances.Unfortunately, most of the effort that went into making the film is wasted: very little seems to happen and there isn't much suspense. The humans escape from confinement too easily and then have a pretty clear path to their final destination. The explanation for the evolution of a planet of apes is a good one, both surprising and plausible. But then this explanation is quickly followed by a brutal yet lame battle sequence. The film's ending is a shocker, but more of the head-scratching than the jaw-dropping kind. Ultimately, this movie underlines the greatness of the 1968 version.",Planet of the Apes

Clearly, the creators of this fill were more worried about how to grunt, look, and walk like an ape, than in conveying a story.   The dialog is, for the most part, grunts on the part of the apes, and practically non-existent on the part of the humans, with the exception of the lead (male) character.   The lead female character has perhaps no more than 3 or 4 lines during the entire movie.As for the story, its ridiculous and unbelievable.  Yes, yes, I know -- we're talking about a sci-fi movie where apes rule the world -- how realistic can it be?   My answer is this: when we see a movie, we allow the writers/directories to withdraw a certain amount of fantasy from our fantasy bank account.   Subsequent withdraws are at the cost of the movies believability.  Continual withdraws, as this movie does, have us thinking the writers are idiots and the movie ridiculous.

423,Danielramos16,What have you done!?!?!?,3,30 April 2008,"Oh god no! why!? Planet of the apes is such a classic ground breaking film. It's a true masterpiece because it said more about ourselves & society then any other movie, so when you try and remake it your really asking for trouble. The expectations would be so high that such a film would be doomed for failure, which is kinda what happened.I don't care what anyone says, it's always a bad idea to remake a classic like Planet of the apes, hell look what happened to Psycho! it's just better off not to be remade. Heres why this movie ultimately failed: For one thing this really doesn't fit directors Tim Burton's resume. Tim Burton has done masterpieces like Edward Scissor Hands, Sleepy Hollow, Nightmare Before Christmas, Big Fish, etc. So how does a Sci-Fi Action movie fit his bill? I give him credit for having the balls to try but come on! The Lead character (Mark Whalberg) was stupid, Shallow, Arrogant, and bone headed. Whalberg could never fill in the shoes of the late great Charlton Heston. Heston was Larger than Life, Whalberg is kinda annoying in this film. Besides him most of the acting is shallow & over the top. Seriously the dialogue is ridiculous, were the screen writers monkeys or something. The best performances by far were Tim Roth & Michael Clarke Duncan, they were the only bright spots in the film. I thought the Make up was fantastic and worthy of Oscar consideration but that's it for the positive's of this film.I've heard from many people who like this movie and say don't compare it with the original. Of course were gonna compare it to the freaking original! They both have the same titles and similar story what do you guys expect!? My problem is that there are many references to the original, but this film lacks any soul or message that the original had. The original made a serious political statement on society and where were going in the future. This remake is basically a way to cash in. It lacks any of the magic of the original, It doesn't take itself seriously, there are way too many moments of comic relief, The ending made no F*****g sense, and it's just totally forgettable.Planet of the apes probably should have never been remade. Perhaps with a different director, and definitely different writers, a Remake could have been meaningful.

They grunt. They scream and jump on a planet that seems to have the gravitational pull of our moon...one blow will send an ape or human flying 20 feet into the air on obviously ill-concealed wire harnesses.

Hero Mark Wahlberg makes one yearn for a real hero in the mold of a Charlton Heston or a Harrison Ford...his heroics consist of simply unfastening a few poorly locked chains and walking free. Couple all this with a some outlandish spacecraft wreckage that functions perfectly after 3,000 years and an army of 10,000 apes that inflicts absolutely no damage to its enemies and you have a turkey that defies description.

I won't talk about the little amounts of acting because i blame that on the writing. I won't get into the details because, like i said, they are murky at best. This is a two hour effects powerhouse except that when you look under the hood for the engine you realize what's running the show is a bunch of monkeys.  THe movie fell short in too many areas for me and the cool monkey outfits and such could not overcome this.  There were more plot holes than in a slice of Swiss cheese and each and every hole was a dark, endless one. Spinning you deeper into a vast array of nonsense and excuses to get Marki Mark to his next ordeal with the monkeys.  I would only recommend this movie to those who love completely mindless action movies and for big fans of Marky Mark walking around breathing heavy and doing nothing much else.   Other than that i would not recommend this to my worst enemy.  It was a formulaic mess and a shameless attempt at using a classic story that has become part of our culture to make money and make the hollywood big-wigs smile a little wider and their wallets a little fatter. 
Kudos to them because as i've read now that the movie grossed 70 million over the weekend.  They made the perfect, mindless fodder that thousands of kids go screaming to the theaters to watch. They'll think the apes are cool and Marky Mark is cool and in the end that's all that matters.  In the end Tim Burton, whom i once cherished as a director, will be regarded as a master mind.  Why?

How did the clock in the mini-spacecraft know what year it is? You see the year quickly moving forward - on what signal or date is this based?2. In the original movie, the humans could not talk. This made it believable that the apes would treat humans like animals, because in our own world, animals do not talk. One of the biggest problems in this remake is that the humans CAN talk. This makes the idea that they would be treated like animals ridiculous. You can bet that if apes could speak English in our world, we probably wouldn't keep them in zoos, animal rights notwithstanding.3. How is it that a chimp is able to land a spacecraft but that a human crashes it TWICE?!4. How is that when Capt. Davidson (Wahlberg) lands on the planet, he enters it in the future, but when the main ship crashed on the same planet going after him, it was thousands of years in the PAST? Wouldn't the time be the same for both - after all, they are going through the same space-time distortion?5. It's never clearly explained how the chimps mutated to become apes, and intelligent, English speaking apes at that.6. How did those monkeys survive the blast unleashed on them from the crashed ship?7. Last but not least - that ending made no sense on any level whatsoever. How did the apes get from their planet to Earth and replace all the humans? And even if they did, the timeline would have been completely different. There wouldn't be anything like the Washington monument, the Lincoln statue or even Washington itself, because Earth would have been a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT place!Unfortunately, ""Apes"" is another in a long series of films by Burton that are visually appealing at times, but lack any kind of coherent plot.

It doesn't make you think, it doesn't hold your, but it does re-affirm the belief that Marky Mark is one of the worst actors in Hollywood.The movie starts out with Marky Mark and his funky bunch floating around in space for no apparent reason. They use monkeys as subjects for experiments and also send them out in pods (very similar to Kubrick's in 2001, in fact their whole space station looks the same, more to come on that...) to do experiments. Well they find some weird force field stuff and send a monkey out. What else happens but they lose communication. Well Marky Mark, being the animal lover that he is, goes out and tries to save his monkey friend. But, alas, he is sucked through the force-field-black-hole-blah-blah and crash lands on a strange planet. He lands in the midst of a human round up where the apes are getting the humans to sell in the slave market.The main symbolism in this movie is racism. Unlike the first movie, the people in this movie can talk. After the apes catch the humans, they sort them out in groups of male and female. Hmm, sounds like a Nazi concentration camp to me. The apes don't notice that Marky Mark is wearing a weird space outfit and everyone else is wearing rags made from animal skin.Marky Mark realizes that apes don't like humans too much so he tries to escape. He is helped by an ""human-lover"" Ari to escape the city.
SPOILER ALERT: They get out of the city and Marky Mark finds his old ship via GPS or something. He then realizes that the ship has been there for thousands of years and figures out he traveled through time. The movie never tries to make you think it is earth though. It's just some weird planet. You also find out all the monkeys they had on-board, all CHIMPS, are the apes now on that planet. Pretty hard to believe considering there are all types of great apes: gorilla, chimp and orangutan. Anyway, they have a battle with the apes (hmmm, reminds me of....SPARTACUS, another Kubrick film).

Tim Burton truly knows how to put his movies together, in this case hiring amazing actors for their roles, from Tim Roth whose eyes just scream Evil, to Micheal Clark Duncan, who let's face it, already looks somewhat like a Gorilla.  It's the makeup by Rick Baker though, that really makes this movie what it is, Gone are the rubber masks from the classic sixties and seventies films. This is truly state of the art mask techniques, with ape faces that movie with the human faces, from frowns, to smiles. The one part of this movie that I DON'T think was any good, was the ending!! I'm not going to discuss too much about it because I don't like to give Spoilers, but let me just say that the first Ape movie, the ending made sense, and it fit to the rest of the plot.  The ending of THIS ape movie, comes out of nowhere, and makes absolutley no sense with the rest of the plot.",Planet of the Apes

All the plot-holes have been mentioned elsewhere in this review section, suffice it to say, there is little ways of getting around most of them. They just don't make sense ! - and the chimp saving the day was a very poor way to end it.The actual plot runs thin half-way through the movie and the final battle was rather anti-climatic I thought. I will go and see a sequel if there is one, but with a lot less excitement than I had for this film.I can't say it wasn't good, because I never looked at my watch during the cinema, but it wasn't the best BLOCKBUSTER SUMMER movie of the year (that was Jurassic Park 3 and earlier Bridget Jones and Hannibal), but it was entertaining enough.

The sets were enjoyable and even the dialogue was survivable. **Very Light Spoilers** If you can set your frame of mind for utter fantasy, including how high apes can leap, their mortal fear of water, and their completely superior strength(when it serves the movies purpose), you can enjoy the film. The ending of the film was the true blight on the movie, which made us leave the theater groaning.  My advice is to leave the movie 5 minutes to the end, and you won't miss anything and will feel much better about the movie.  Up until the end they presented explanations/scientific facts to make the realm of the movie believable.  then they tacked on an ending that didn't make any sense at all, as it was completely impossible even in the world of the movie.

453,mukor,Some amazing technical achievement but...,4,30 July 2001,"Planet of the Apes is a breathtaking spectacle, a technical masterpiece highlighted by Rick Baker's remarkably emotive simian make up. 
This is an exciting film, one that sets up beautifully at a near future research station in some unidentified area of space.  Once Mark Wahlberg arrives en medias res at the Primate Ruled Planet, we are carried through a remarkably other world, a masterpiece of set design.  In addition, choreography of primate movements is entirely believable, a foreign yet familiar fusion of primal simian movement and human barbarism. 
Where the film begins to show its warts is its inability to follow up on the plot premises it establishes.  Various mentions and trappings of mysticism, which serve the film well, disappear under the relentless pacing. Wahlberg's prophecied astronaut is not significantly charismatic enough nor spiritually aware enough to be the centerpiece of a film that wants badly to do more than simply be another big, dumb action movie but seldom achieves more than those humble lows.And in the end, an error in editing, direction, writing, or all of the above brings a film to lows that I was perfectly will to accept, warts and all.

I thought the ending was better than the original because Leo, unlike Taylor is in immediate danger.  If it doesn't make sense to some of you, why don't you take time to interpret?  Remember, the ship Thade gets stuck in may still be of help to him.  I don't want to give away my interpretation of the ending, you people better start thinking for yourselves.  All I could say is you can't forget that time travel is very possible in this movie. Both this POTA and BTTF have their main characters find something changed when they get back their times.  I like the adrenaline-pumping plot.  The dabbling of humor in it also helps. It dips just enough into the animal-human relations(and relations within the same species) to prevent distorting the plot.

456,akpiggott,"Flaws aplenty, but entertaining nonetheless!",6,20 August 2001,"CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!!! First, I just wanted to say that I haven't yet had the opportunity to see the 1968 version and I'm not one of those people who prefer remakes over originals just because ""the effects are better"".Anyway.. what can I say about this movie? I'll start on the positive side of things. It was very entertaining and seemed to actually have a bit of intelligence behind it, a rare (but welcome) combination in modern Hollywood. The makeup and special effects were absolutely stunning. The apes looked and moved like apes, yet effectively had the human characteristic of being able to distinguish the characters through face recognition. It made a great combination. This great imagery was backed up by impressive looking sets. Watching the two connect together, it was hard to believe these were human actors in ape costumes acting on a studio set, you get the full impression of a real world. The cast were good enough, Mark was convincing as a lost and puzzled human, the rest of the humans were appropriately primitive-like, Carter portrayed the human-sympathising Ari well and.. well Tim Roth as Thade.. he stole the show every time he appeared, his portrayl of the character echoed frustration and anger and his voice was more than appropriate. The film also had a well suited soundtrack, provided by music magic man, Danny Elfman. The direction throughout this movie was also very strong and of the usual Burton quality.Anyway, onto the bad stuff. There were countless plot problems and issues that weren't explained either fully enough or not at all. The apes rode horses.. however, where these horses came from was unexplained. Mark kisses that blonde woman at the end (whose character is so insignificant, her name isn't even worth remembering) even though he only said about three words to her throughout the whole film, I have no idea.. was there supposed to be some sort of love triangle thing going on with Mark, Ari and the blonde? The part near the end with the chimp arriving in his pod was so coincidental that it just seemed completely unbelievable. The apes were scared of water, for some bizarre reason they couldn't swim, even though they are physically superior to humans. The apes are unable to cross water because they can't swim, so why can't they build a boat? I'm sure there were other plot issues too, but those are the only ones that I can remember. Now onto my comment on the ending, which, if you've seen the film is probably the part you've been waiting for. I warn you, if you haven't seen the movie, then do yourself a favour, don't read the paragraph below, it will completely spoil the almost remote chance that the ending will shock you in a positive manner.Three words: what, the, hell? I've questioned myself over and over about how this ending could make any possible sense whatsoever. As Mark's pod landed and he walked up to the Lincoln statue I thought to myself ""Hehe.. it would be funny if we find out that Mark's world is now inhabited by apes.. but then again.. the writers aren't that stupid.. are they?"". I actually felt quite gutted the moment where we saw the statue's face, because the rest of the story (despite the plot problems mentioned) actually made sense. I've since heard lot's of interesting theories, but they've all had some sort of reason for not being correct. The most popular theory was that Thade repairs Leo's space pod and goes back through time to Earth and edits the world. First of all, Leo's pod is underwater and apparently the apes can't swim, so it is unaccessible to Thade. Also, even if Thade could get the pod, the apes don't have the technology to repair it. The pod was only big enough to fit Thade in, how could just one ape make such a difference? Finally, if apes did inhabit Earth instead of humans.. what would be the chance of the apes building a city exactly the same as Washington DC with a Thade memorial looking exactly the same as the Lincoln memorial? Pretty damn slim to say the least.Anyway, final verdict: entertaining, but too many plot problems and an appalling ending. If the movie ended the second that Mark's pod takes off at the end, my overall opinion would have been better, let's just hope a sequel will come our way and remedy all our frustrations about that ending.

460,SandyLiz,The Lack of Sense,5,25 August 2007,"Okay. SPOILER. The only way this movie & ending makes any sense is if the planet was earth all alone...Leo is not aware that he traveled in time...AND if he traveled at the end, NOT back to his own time, but into the future again (or as my husband insists into another dimension which would not work because the anomaly was a time warp not a dimensional warp or none of it would have taken place.) Anyway, if you go back in time and make sure that you and all the other humans don't exist, you would then never be born and therefore couldn't go back in time to change anything. If he were on earth the whole time the future aspect works better -- so the readings on the space module were shown rewinding in time in error. Why do that? There is not the remotest chance that someone could go through a time warp and find the exact time he left and get back to his home era and place (hitting it exactly would be like throwing a dart from earth at the stars hoping to hit a specific one.) I can only assume that somehow Thrase got loose, crazier than ever, and finished the task of killing off all the humans. Sorry for any misspelllings.Also why would Washington DC still exist and be the same as it was only with apes instead of humans? How would they even know to put Thrace there except they tore down Lincoln and erected their own statue in his place. The similarities could not have been random. The only other possible explanation of the ending is that there really were no people at all and this astronaut is dreaming the whole thing. I hate that premise...it's a cop out.Also, where was his chimp friend in the module those few days? Past, present, future? Could he have altered the course of evolution somehow? Evolution, as far as we know, takes more than 2000 years anyway...billions of years to develop language and speech, too. So DUH.The movie was fabulous as far as costumes, acting, cinematography but the plot was terrible and awfully unsatisfying ending especially is you were expecting something like the awesome surprise ending at the end of the original Planet of the Apes which was an explanation not something that created total bafflement and left you wondering what the H***?Also, will the message about being humane to humans and apes, why didn't they list the names of the real chimpanzees in the movie on the cast and credits?

470,Sparse,"O, So Horribly Inbred!",3,15 July 2017,"How do I put this lightly. . . . I loathe this movie with the entirety of my being.This isn't a Planet of the Apes movie. I can't just turn off my brain and enjoy a mindless ""re-imagination"" of one of the most thoughtful movies I've ever seen. Watching this movie made me feel physically sick. Writing about it made me feel physically sick. I was literally on the floor. I can't handle this movie. That being said, this movie isn't necessarily an assaulting kind of bad. Some will find entertainment value in it, at least it has a plot, and (generally) it has a nice aesthetic quality. But it's still bad.Tim Burton is someone who I have a lot of respect for. I think he's a fantastic filmmaker, and more blame belongs to the writers than anyone else on this project. Burton's hands however still aren't clean, and he's committed his fair share of offenses here. On the commentary he actually explains that apes make him uncomfortable (which would explain the apes' performances), and he gave the impression that he didn't want to direct the film in the first place. It shows.This is one of his weakest efforts in terms of direction. For example, we actually don't get to see all that much of the Ape City--only dimly lit, claustrophobic sets and homogenous formations can really be observed (though what we do see looks pretty good). We get a few wide shots, usually attached to other sets like the forest, adding a kind of close-knitness that detracts from its sense of scale. Making that issue worse, relatively little time is dedicated to travel, so even the military camps and the set from the battle scene don't feel very distant. This simply isn't the best effort Burton could have given, but was maybe the best we could've hoped for given the script.The screenplay for this film was written by William Broyles Jr., Lawrence Konner, & Mark Rosenthal, the last two of whom worked on such hits as Superman IV! Now, to the writers' credit, at least there's a plot for the most part, but that's about all I can praise them on (if that indeed counts as praise). I'm not really quite sure where to begin with the flaws actually. As I watched the film I started making a list of questions regarding anything that disregarded logic or broke my suspension of disbelief. I can only use so many words, so I guess I'll just post the list:Why send a baby chimpanzee into space? Or a chimp at all? Humans pulling the carriage instead of horses? Wild humans have the time and resources to curl and dye their hair? Where'd she get that 20th century hair dye? What's with the stoner apes? He's feisty? He just grabbed your leg on accident and looked at Thade all confused- like. Where were the doors in the houses? Why won't the humans talk? They're not mute so. . . . Why'd the one human signal not to talk, then? Do the apes not know they can talk somehow? They didn't seem surprised. If humans are lower on the evolutionary chain than monkeys, why can humans talk but not the monkeys? Are there talking monkeys we don't know about? Were there even any monkeys on the ship they came on? Considering the ship's population, they'd be really inbred by now right? How were the apes in that blast only stunned? Did they see the 1968 film? Did they even read the book? It's closer to the book, but still nowhere near it. Should have just called the movie something else, like: ""Inbreeding: The Movie"".A few other points: There's some almost-commentary on religion, but nothing that pans out. Any allegorical content is an afterthought at best. It's tonally unsure of itself: half wants to be taken seriously, half cartoon. Mark Wahlberg's character really just doesn't care, and is too blank to be relatable. The apes might be talking about something expository or of their interest, and then Leo just mentions something unrelated that pertains only to him. It's almost pleading you to assume character depth for it, but you don't because there isn't any. The apes in this movie are completely cartoonish, including their preposterous fear of water (maybe they can't swim because their prosthetics will fall off, as my sister observed).Mark Wahlberg and the Chimp are pretty damn cute, I'll give it that. Otherwise, Tim Roth is a cartoon. Paul Giamatti is a cartoon. Helena Bonham Carter is a cartoon. The humans are all bland. I suppose the actors are into it enough to pass as flamboyant caracachures. They sell it, but it's for the wrong movie. And I love Paul Giamatti. He doesn't belong in this movie, but I love him.The wirework is pretty bad. The CGI is fine. Though the sets and colors are nice. If there's one thing I can give Burton credit for it's for making a (generally) good-looking movie. The prosthetics for the most part actually look pretty good, sometimes as good as Chambers' work from the 1968 film. Some of the makeups look out-of-proportion or bizarre though, like stuff conceived on mutations or not-to-be-named perversions-- genuinely concerning designs.The score by Danny Elfman is simply fine. It's inoffensive, maybe slightly better than the average modern-age film score, but that's not really saying much. At least there's actually a melody (even if somewhat derivative of his Spider-Man score), and as bombastic and obnoxious as the drums are at least they have personality, though it's a far-cry from Elfman's best.This is not a Planet of the Apes film. It's a movie with apes in it, completely unrelated to Planet of the Apes. If you're a die-hard Planet of the Apes fan, maybe watch it once. Otherwise, seek out the 1968 film.

But instead they send the genetically altered monkeys, just like canaries into a mine.Well Leo's furry fellow astronaut is in trouble out in space and Leo goes out there to bring him and the flying pod back in an unauthorized rescue mission. And as you can probably guess, from there things take an unexpected turn. Crashing into a simian world Leo has to fight the persistent General Thade (Tim Roth) and his army of apes.  General Thade has a merciless hatred for humans which is boundless and unexplained.  And so the story flows from one battle scene to another.The story is simple and therefore easy to understand; the battle for survival.   The battle for freedom from slavery.  The battle for dignity and self determination.The fantastically twisted ending leaves an opening for a sequel.

I wasn't really very happy to find out Mark Wahlberg was starring in it, but I've been wrong before about how someone can hold up a role so I decided to give it a go.As others have said, Tim Roth does a good job, Helena Bonham Carter is pretty decent, and most of the others are basically blase. Marky Mark, however, was a disaster. He has absolutely ZERO on-screen presence, he can't act well enough to even convince me that he is a human being, much less a astronaut, and the movie suffered badly because of this. I didn't care about his lead character, I had no idea what was going on in his head at any time, he never showed fear, anger, happiness, or any of the myriad emotions that most real people have. It was truly awful. Charleton Heston may have overacted in the 1968 version of this movie, but at least you could associate the word ""act"" with his performance. And Charleton had the on-screen presence that was so lacking in this version.Others have mentioned some of the various plot problems, including the ending, so I won't go into them except to say they are there and they make a number of plot events implausible. I would also like to point out that, once again (just as in the original POTA), the presence of horses on this ""planet"" is yet another obvious plot problem.As a straightforward action film the movie is pretty decent. The ape makeup and the ape movement is pretty damn good.Overall, I was considerably disappointed in this version of ""Planet of the Apes"" It had no originality, they chose the wrong leading actor, and the plot had huge holes. If you want to experience ""Planet of the Apes"" rent the original...it's so much better that there isn't really any comparison (except for the title). That's too bad, too, because this movie needed to be technologically updated.",Planet of the Apes

It did however have it's plus points: It was at times entertaining, it had a very good trailer, Helena Bonhem Carter was very good, and the science side was more thought out.  However, the characterisation of all the characters was poor at best.  The action slant Burton took destroyed all subtlty or poignancy within the movie and the action scenes were rather lackluster and unimaginative.

475,BryMan-4,Emotionless,2,27 July 2001,"The best way to describe Planet of the Apes is mechanical.  It's a high-tech movie made by a high-tech machine.  It is coldly put together like a car on an assembly line.  The actors are so laden down with makeup, emotional expression is impossible.  Even actors who are lucky enough not to wear any makeup have one-note performances: p***ed-off.  Tim Burton, whose fish-out-of-water thing is getting real old, forgot to add what made Batman, Sleepy Hollow and Beetlejuice work - a sense of humor.  This is, after all, a ludicrous situation.  Why not treat it as such?  Instead, we have Mark Wahlberg who seems to have a permanent scowl etched into his face.  Where is the wisecracking Arnold when you need him?  Tim Roth is no better.  While his mannerisms and swagger are excellent, his over-the-top anger makes his General Thade into nothing more than an enraged chimp throwing feces at everyone in the film (and the audience).  Somebody please call the animal control unit!  Planet of the Apes is SO cold, SO angry, and SO dark that I finally became bored with the whole thing.  Burton, however, is clever.  In an effort to generate repeat business, he tacked on an ending that is so baffling, audiences will be lined up a second and third time just to try to make sense of it.  Lacking the clarity to be shocking, it is simply an inexplicable, absurd anomaly.  Like the rest of the movies this summer, Planet of the Apes fails to live up to its promise.",Planet of the Apes

If you care about story or characters (the makers obviously did not) you should look elsewhere.The half thought out plot has holes you could push a planet through.  Tim Burton tries to paper some of the holes with action cliches, most of which are embarrassingly bad.As to the cast, Mark Wahlberg is not bad in the lead, but the rest of the cast saved their good work for another film.  Tim Roth badly overplays the villain, General Thade.  Helena Bonham Carter is just there as the pro-human chimp Ari.  The rest of the cast has so little to work with, that they must have collectively said to themselves, ""why bother?""Then there is the surprise ending.  It is a total waste of film.  While the ending of the original (and far better) Planet of the Apes was integral to the story, the surprise in this new version has that unmistakeable ""tacked on"" feel.  It comes out of nowhere, goes nowhere, and does not make sense at all.  It is as if the film makers wanted a visual surprise ending for no other reason than that the original had one, but that they didn't want to put very much thought into creating it.That is the overriding problem with this movie.  It goes for the easy sell visual, without putting any thought behind it.  As a result, it is only good for shutting off your brain for two hours.

One of the things (aside from the hammy Heston) that would put people off the original is the obvious ape masks. I would have thought that if one were to remake a film, it would at least improve upon it's major flaw. I know little of ape behaviour, however, I did appreciate their efforts in adding ape gestures (i.e. rubbing knuckles on another's chest). It took me twelve years to finally see this movie.

483,pierotti,Tim Burton has always been overrated,1,3 August 2005,"It may be a bit late to weigh in on this film, but I feel compelled to if for no other reason than that Tim Burton has just arrogantly messed with another classic, Charlie and Chocolate Factory, and has once again screwed things up. Burton has no concept of plot or acting, his style is entirely visual, and he is dishonest as all get out when he wants to make a point. I'm sorry that Tim had problems with his parents, especially his father, but that does not justify his screwing with classic stories so that he can whine once again about how parents just don't understand you and might even abandon you.Having got that off my chest, I would like to summarize POTA as follows. The movie makes no sense and the reason it makes no sense is that the director has no vision, no sense of a story that he wants to tell. Even the highly touted ape makeup is a mistake, because the director has no idea whether the apes are supposed to be subhuman or better than human. As a consequence they behave in a manner that simply leaves the viewer confused.I am a biologist who has studied behavior in apes, so I might be more picky than most, but I defy any viewer to answer the following question. Why are all the female apes chimpanzees? I have watched the ape village scenes several times and to my view there is not a single female gorilla or orang utan in the entire place. Also these female chimps don't look like chimps, but like some sort of odd chimp/human hybrid, which might explain the attraction between Marky Mark and Helena BC, but otherwise feels just thrown in (This is what I mean by Burton throwing logic out the window to make his themes fit his preconceptions). For example why does the female chimp (Carter) have eyebrows, a trait missing from every primate but humans? Also why do chimps, which seem to make up the vast majority of the apes, walk upright except when they charge? This makes them very ineffective as warriors. They can't hold weapons, so why do they wear armor? The acting in this film is confusing and few characters seem realized, and once again I think Burton is to blame. In Burton films the only actors who are memorable are those willing to create their own characters and overact shamelessly, e.g. Michael Keaton's Beetlejuice, Nicholson's Joker, DeVito's Penguin, Walken's headless horseman. In this film this tradition is carried on by Tim Roth's Thade, a character so psychotic it seems amazing that anyone takes him seriously. The cast includes some good actors, but all are handicapped by bad direction. For example, Paul Giamatti an excellent character actor, tries hard to create a believable character in his whining sycophantic slave trading orang utan, but he is made up as a female rather than a male orang utan, which collapses the character completely.Other actors fare no better. Wahlberg, at best a charming male ingénue, cannot act like a leader, so I was startled by the idea that all the humans would follow his lead when he seems to have no idea as to what he's doing throughout the entire film. The other humans seem to be merely tagging along looking confused. Michael Clarke Duncan, subtle and wonderful in the Green Mile, here plays sort of a King Kong who can talk. As a subtext, why are the Gorillas played by Afrcian American actors, and the chimps by white actors? This leads me to what I think is Burton's greatest weakness, his ability to direct actresses. The only actress who has ever turned in a memorable performance in a Burton film is Michelle Pfeiffer's sly, slinky Catwoman in Batman II. Otherwise excellent actresses have been left to flounder by Burton, e.g. Christina Ricci is Sleepy Hollow, Kim Basinger in Batman. Given this history, I find confusing all of the hostility and crass comments about Estella Warren's performance as Daena, the only human in the film with any personality. Estella Warren is a powerful presence, who in every film in which she appears works from the premise that she is, at the least, the equal of all the male characters and that she is smarter even than most of those. She tries to pull that off in POTA, but she is left to flounder, trying to work off the giant vacuum emitted by Marky Mark. Warren acts using her face to communicate subtle emotions and changes of mood, but that tactic backfires in this film, where subtlety is lost. She gets no perceivable reactions from Wahlberg, who seems lost in his own world, and she has almost no scenes with anyone else. As a result Warren has little to do but look distressed and confused. I think most of the negative comments directed at Warren's acting come from silly insecure young men who feel that a pretty woman should not also be strong and competent, and simply want to ogle her.To summarize, this film is probably the worst big budget film ever made, but don't blame the actors. As they say in Russia, fish begin to stink from the head. In this case the head is the director.",Planet of the Apes
484,Mr. Gore,This Apes more than scrapes by as an entertaining and provocative film-going experience.,6,24 July 2001,"While retaining some of the source novel's and original picture's themes, Tim Burton's version of Planet of the Apes is a very different movie. The subtext, however, remains largely intact. Religious, social and political themes abound, as a distorted funhouse mirror is held up to our own culture.There are plenty of good performances, notably by actors portraying apes--Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and David Warner. Helena Bonham Carter manages to be oddly appealing and even winsome through the chimp makeup.While my initial reaction was highly favorable, I'm not sure this new film will posit the longevity of the first one. It breaks no new ground to become a classic.It does feature more simian-like behavior. The apes exhibit physical characteristics of their respective species as they move about and react emotionally. The makeup is extraordinary. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should polish up another Oscar award for the brilliant Rick Baker.The movie also seems to be missing a few scenes of motivation or development. I know it was supposed to have been re-edited at the last minute. It would be interesting to view some of the deleted scenes. Here is to hoping for a wealth of bonus material on the DVD.Viewing the 1968 film is not necessary but beneficial to pick up all the intentional references, both in dialogue and situation. Some of them are rather humorous.",Planet of the Apes
485,TLB73737,"The original was better, but the 2001 version was fair.",5,31 July 2001,"This movie is not bad if you don't compare it to the original.  Do not see this movie if you enjoy good acting and a great story.  But if you have the mind of a 12-year-old boy, you'll probably enjoy yourself.  The movie was not as stylized as other Tim Burton movies.  And I use the word movie as opposed to film.Most of the characters in this movie are two dimensional cardboard cut outs. There is not one character who we get to know with any depth.  This is a major flaw of the movie.  Because the audience really doesn't care about what happens to anyone of them.  I suppose that some people would believe that the audience's loyalty it is built in - since the audience is human and we would naturally root for our own kind.However, in the original we get to know Cornelius and Zira and therefore cared about what happened to them, even though they are chimpanzees.It both helps and hurts to have seen the original.  It helps, because you a familiar with the background, you don't need to have things explained to you.  However, it hurts because you will inevitably compare the two works - the 2001 version failing in almost ever respect to a comparison of the first.Watching the two will only make a person realize how little acting and directing talent there is out there today.  Some might say, the past is not better, it was just different.  That would be ridiculous. No objective observer,  looking at the acting talent in the first one, (Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, James Whitmore, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans), could argue that today's version, with its cast, is actually a better movie.  Even the mute Linda Harrison character Nova, said more with her eyes and facial expressions, than the updated Daena (Estella Warren) with all her lines of dialog.  Charlton Heston's death bed scene (as Gen. Thade's father) is about the only real piece of dramatic acting in the whole movie (2001).  Although, to his credit, Paul Giamatti's Limbo character does provide some nice comic relief throughout the 2001 version.In the original, we had political, social and cultural commentary.  Today's version has very little.   When it does attempt to offer some, it is so brief and mealy-mouthed in its delivery that it only serves to weaken the picture.That's the real weakness of this movie.  It doesn't know whether it wants to be gritty and dark or light and campy.  All to often, it falls into the latter category, hurting its otherwise fine production values.

Burton does well to convey the Wahlberg character's sense of desolation after crashing on the planet and an interesting subplot ensues, involving Helena Bonham Carter's ape character and the attempt to escape from their masters. Tim Roth is absolutely outstanding as the general - you won't see a more expressive pair of eyes! The love triangle element with Estella Warren's character (what a beauty!) is also fairly well handled.The film simmers along nicely for the first half and then completely degenerates towards the end. The first absurdity is when (*SPOILERS AHEAD*)Wahlberg's monkey jets in and stops the battle - the scene just looked silly, it did not look like it could turn the tide of the battle...then later the henchmen (sorry henchapes!) of the general capitulate too quickly without really being convinced.And the ""twist"" ending was just well...incomprehensible I thought...another writer here said he found it easy to understand because it was a take on the original film's ending....but for someone like me who hasn't seen the original, I just thought - huh?

The make-up was absolutely incredible. The design of the ape soldiers awesome. The script? Sit in a room for five minutes with a couple of friends. Think of a few everyday human situations. Now think of the same situation with an ape in it. Write down what you think would happen, (try and be funny about it) - Once you've written a few pages you'll no doubt no have your own version of the Planet of the Apes script sitting right in front of you. Basically a bunch of quickly thought up ape jokes and a story that had characters with shifting, mis-placed, heavy-handed or non-existent motivation.Some examples of why I didn't like this film? SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT PLOT AND ENDING MENTIONED - Who really cared when the boy fell off his horse in the battle if he lived or died? His arrogance got him there, his inept horse riding got him stuck. Why was he even in the film? - There seemed to be a thinly veiled attempt at satire and role reversal on animal rights. But when the humans get a chance what do they do? Bash ape heads in as the apes did to them. What's the story point - The strong survive? Violence with superior numbers is the answer? A mixed message especially when the sympathetic 'hippy' ape is seen helping the humans fight. - The humans out number the apes 4 to 1 we are told early in the film. In the battle we see humans and apes fighting fairly equally. Whose going to win? Hmmmm...So what was the point of this bit again? - Bonham-Carters sympathetic ape comes across as a bleeding heart hippy. Not very likeable. And not very smart. If only she'd played a more political role against the main bad guy Thede instead of straight out verbal confrontation and an embarrassing attempt at seduction later in the film.
 - It was like a comedy, that wasn't funny. The humour involved taking a human situation, replacing them with an ape, and making them a joke about them using their feet instead of hands (this particular joke was used twice in the film!) - The writers never stopped to question why apes, evolving without human influence, would be playing Basketball in T-shirts? - Sci-Fi films need to create a believable world, no matter how fantastic the setting, in which to tell the story. Way too often I would think 'If they can do this then why don't they do this...' and my mind would wander off. Too many inconsistencies. - The sets looked like sets. - Burton's usual visual eye was not apparent until the battle. - The ending is just stupid. Where did all the helicopters and the fire truck come from. If I'd have laughed at the jokes this would have been the punch line. But I didn't laugh at the jokes and this was an insult. Apes in police hats on motorcycles... I'm hoping it was supposed to be a joke. I just didn't find it funny. END OF SPOILERSFrom the director of 'Mars Attacks' not 'Batman'.

491,filmdrift,"Burton's Movie Lacks Innovation, Is Disappointing",3,21 August 2001,"Tim Burton has proven to be a director with vision.  Many of his previous movies broke new ground artistically, like Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Ed Wood.  They were wildly imaginative, visually intriguing and entertaining.  That is why I was so excited to learn that Burton was directing Planet of the Apes.  I expected him to take the classic Apes from the 60's and give it his own Burtonesque twist.  I expected ingenuity and to be immersed into a weird futuristic ape world.  What I got was a modern-day Hollywood formula movie.  It is as if all the creativity and intrigue of the original had been beaten out of the film.You know the story.  An astronaut crash-lands onto a strange planet ruled by primates.  Humans are on the planet too, but the humans are considered `animals' and are treated as slave labor.  The biggest problem with Planet of the Apes (2001) is that it is simply not captivating.  There is no discernable plot, except that the astronaut wants to get back to his mother ship, and the apes want to make him their slave (or kill him.)  And while other `slice of life' films may not need a plot to succeed, sci-fi epics do. There is nothing compelling here to move the action and characters (and us) forward.  The result is . . . boredom.  Burton's job at a minimum with this film was to entertain us.  He fell far short.Mark Wahlberg plays astronaut Captain Leo Davidson in a performance that is largely inconsequential.  Helena Bonham Carter is Ari, a female ape (and unspoken love interest) who cares about the plight of the humans. Carter's performance is measured and effective.  Tim Roth portrays Thade, the leader of the ape army.  Roth is a fine actor whose performance here is at times captivating, and at other times one-dimensional.  The actors who play the humans, Kris Kristofferson and Estella Warren, are almost as unimportant as Wahlberg.  I liked the original movie better when the humans just grunted. Also, Charleston Heston even shows up in disguise to waste away a scene with us.To be fair, the makeup and special effects in Planet of the Apes are well done.  The costumes and sets are all good, if not too dark (but the art direction is disappointing when compared with Burton's previous works).  The music, by Danny Elfman, is great, if not distracting.The film's final scene, which I will not give away, has been deemed by some as clever or cool.  I think not.  Imagine if you will, what closing visual would be as evocative as the Statue of Liberty scene in the original movie? I guarantee that if you allow your mind to wander, you will guess it. That's not innovation, that's more of the same from Hollywood.  What happened Tim?",Planet of the Apes

I guess that when you expect a movie to be kinda dumb and pale in comparison to its original version, then the good qualities of the new version can catch you by surprise and provide a lot of fun when you least expect it.
I had been disappointed by Burton's ""Mars Attacks!"" (It could've been a classic considering that amazing cast), so I let some friends drag me to ""Planet"" with more than a little trepidation.In one of the earliest scenes, the lights of the space station all go dark, and I heard probably half a dozen people around me whispering various versions of ""what, no emergency lighting?!"", so I thought ""Here we go; more Hollywood dumbness unleashed upon the screen..."" but within the next few minutes things started picking up...and from then on I was completely along for the ride.My favorite part of this movie has got to be Danny Elfman's propulsive score; I can't wait to buy this soundtrack. It's great! My second favorite aspect of this film is Tim Roth's wild portrayal of Thade; he delivers quite an inventive homage to great SF villains, all the way back to Ming the Merciless! There are some scenes in which his character is so malevolent that it's spine-tingling.As for the ending (NO SPOILER) - I think it's all intended in fun, with a nod and a wink, not to mention unleashing a spectacular pun upon humanity!

This may be connected to the fact that Walberg doesn't have much screen presence.

Marky Mark may know how to model underwear, but a great actor he aint.

""Batman"" showcased a vividly realized Gotham City; ""Ed Wood"" had the authentic look for the story of the worst director ever; and ""Sleepy Hollow"" showed guts by prominently displaying twisted trees and full moons for a great Halloween treat.

Deserts, jungles, extravagant makeup and costumes are all stunning in this film.Mark Wahlberg plays the role made famous by Charlton Heston (who has a short cameo that is terrific fun to see).  He is an astronaut who gets more or less stranded on a strange planet where the apes rule and humans are slaves. Wahlberg leads the people to rebellion, rather reluctantly.Unlike the original ""Apes,"" Burton seems content to throw in more action scenes than dialogue to tell the story.  There is very little social commentary really and the main story seems centered on how Helena Bonham Carter, as a loving ape who cares for the humans, helps Wahlberg in his attempts to save the other people from the evil Thade (a terrific Tim Roth). General Thade doesn't want the humans to rise up, because he'll lose his power as a ruler.But this is nothing new, however entertaining.  While the original pushed a few envelopes by raising social issues, some of them relevant today, and providing real characters, this ""Apes"" is mostly for show.  I liked the movie on its own terms, however.  It's enjoyable, looks great and has a twist ending that shows the trademark Burton imagination that we've come to expect.  In short, expect a few sequels.My Rating:  * * * (out of four)",Planet of the Apes
496,faradaygrean,Nice Saturday afternoon movie,7,5 April 2015,"At first, I thought this was a parody movie- Mark Wahlberg, Helena Bonham Carter, Paul Giamatti and Michael Clarke Duncan- I was wrong. This turned out to be a loose remake of the 1968 original. It was nice to see Charlton Heston (uncredited) as the iconic Dr. Zaius. Mark Wahlberg did a fine job, as did Helena Bonham Carter. Paul Giamatti's character felt like comic relief to me, slightly out of place, but not unwelcome. It was well made, the acting was good and it kept me interested throughout the movie, but no spectacular 'whoa!' moments. I consider this a fine movie and I would watch it again but I wouldn't purposefully go out of my way to find it. All-in-all, a nice movie for a Saturday afternoon.",Planet of the Apes

A perfect storm of bad luck, bad casting/acting (Wahlberg), messing with a classic, and the ending, oh what an awful ending. I love a portion of every Burton film to date except for maybe Pee Wee's Big Adventure, and even consider a few classics (Batman, Batman Returns, and Sleepy Hollow), but this film has NO redeeming qualities whatsoever. Bad concept, bad idea, bad casting, bad acting, bad writing, bad directing...get the picture (ok, the special effects are slightly above average). Poor Charlton Heston has a cameo as an aging ape and it is by the numbers acting and a shame that Moses and El Cid had to cash a paycheck while participating in this dreck. Skip it.",Planet of the Apes
498,transmitter,Not Great - But Certainly Enjoyable,7,5 March 2005,"I've been following Mark W since The Corrupter, and I had low expectations about this film and his portrayal of a classic role and classic film ... even though this film has supposedly ""star power"" behind it.At the end of the day, I was very pleasantly surprised in the director's take on the character. Mark W's character is developed as fairly short-sighted, selfish, and egotistical, and it's his faults the ultimately doom the people/Earth/etc.Some might say that it was Mark W's lack of depth (in that Tom Cruise fashion) rather than true acting that gives the character his two dimensional feel (which works), but I think the actor and director sculpted the character in this fashion with intent.While I don't care much for the other actors (including Heston's cameo, which was foolish, and the model who very Arnold/Terminator like had about 14 words), they didn't entirely detract from one's enjoyment of the film.",Planet of the Apes

Sure I enjoyed the customes, the visual effects and the sexy blue eyed blonde, but I would have enjoyed it more if the movie showed at least a fraction of the impact the original series did. Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter.. they were good enough, frankly I believe they are wasting their talent on garbage like this.  I wish them better vision to choose better scripts in the future. Only one more thing:  I'm really dissapointed at Tim Burton.",Planet of the Apes
501,cdtressler,One of the WORST I have ever had the Discomfort of Seeing,1,28 March 2002,"I love Tim Burton movies.  I have been a ravenous fan of his since the first of the Batman movies (as we know them today) came out in 1989 (there is another movie made in the 60s based of the classic TV show, starring the one true Batman, Adam West).  Furthermore, I loved the original Planet of the Apes.  It was one of the most well known, recognizable, and thought provoking movies of all time, with one of the greatest twists in cinematic history.  Not only that, but if you look at the series of `Apes' movies, as a whole, you will most likely find that they are one of the greatest, most well fitting together with respect to continuity (if that is even possible to say) franchises ever.  So with that being said, could this movie possibly go wrong?Oh it did. It went WAY wrong. This movie is righteous garbage. The twist at the end (not a spoiler) makes absolutely no logical sense, independently. But if it sets up a plot that will be explained in the sequel, then I don't want to know, and have no desire to see it.  But what is my major grievance with this movie:Marky Mark.  In this movie, he single handedly gives a horrible performance, AS ALWAYS, and disgraces the name of models gone actors, which if you think about it is pretty bad considering they have a bad reputation to begin with. One of the more subtle problems that I have with him, besides his pitiful excuse for acting, is that throughout this and seemingly all of his other movies he has the same facial expression, which is something of a mix between constipation and just got done running a marathon.  Even moreso is the fact that throughout the whole movie, he never seems to be surprised at the fact that not only is he in a world completely different than his, nor the fact that it is primarily populated by gigantic, walking, talking apes, nor does he ever seem to ponder, even ask, or want to find out, `hey, what in the righteous heck is going on here?'Here is my breakdown of the other key players in the movie:Helena Bonham Carter  brilliant actress  waste of her talent.Charlton Heston  cultural icon  waste of his talent.Tim Burton  one of the greatest and most imaginative, and visually impressive moviemakers of all time  completely shot himself in the foot for making this garbage.Anyone else remotely involved in the making of this movie - waste of their collective talent.The only redeeming factors of this movie is that Danny Elfman once again provides a good score to the movie and the shot where they look back upon the city (it's the only shot in the movie that is signature Tim Burton). 
Now I have seen some BAD movies in my day, and not only does this one take the taco, but to categorize it as only a bad movie would be an insult.  This is beyond a bad movie.  This is a complete waste of your life if you watch it.  Please, please, please if you want to see Planet of the Apes, look past the fancy special effects, good makeup and prosthetics job, and the fact that it is a newer movie, and go watch the lower budget, older original. Save yourself the agony.",Planet of the Apes
502,JAKick,Bad Bad Film,1,2 August 2001,"Actually horrible film, slow, boring, without focus, and probably the worst ending I have seen in years. The ending pushed it from bad film to horrible film. an absolute deus ex machina, since there was no ending in sight, then a badly made ""suprise ending"". The audience I saw it with about 40 minutes into the movie were just making jokes the rest of the time.  This was a full audience on opening night that was excited to see it.  Just pathetic.  Right before the Deus Ex Machina happened , a person said "" This better not be...(what it was)"" and the crowd started just groaning in pain when it happened.  TIm Burton needs to re-evaluate his ability to direct.Jason.",Planet of the Apes
503,whatson,Awful doesn't begin to describe it,1,28 July 2001,"This movie was terrible.  It was essentially a movie about slavery and little else.  There is no logical reason for the premise of this remake.  In the original, the humans couldn't talk and were essentially disorganized savages creating a more plausible basis for the movie.  In this one they are merely weaker and presumably more stupid.  The Apes seemed to continually shift between the intelligent creatures to primitive apes lending even less credibility to the plot.Some of the costumes were very well done and some looked only marginally different from the original movie.  The effects were ok by today's standards but subpar for what this films tries to bill itself up to be.",Planet of the Apes
504,mtaulbee,Monkey's Fall Down,3,30 July 2001,"What a bad, bad movie.  The costumes were nice and it had a scene or two that was interesting, but overall, the movie stunk.  Apes who leap 60 feet in the air, dialogue that would be better found in a WB Sitcom, and effects right out of the Saturday special on TNT, leaves the viewers less that satisfied.  I saw this movie on opening night and when the credits ran, a few of the patrons applauded.  Nothing new for opening night, but when people began to boo and hurl leftover popcorn at those who were clapping...that was new and more entertaining than the movie.Burton made many blunders with this one, oh it had such potential.  Estella Warren's only function in the movie was to be a trophy wife, I think she had all of 2 1/2 lines to deliver.  Marky Mark Wallberg was less than stellar and his character is one that you will root for the crazed apes to kill. Only Tim Roth and Michael Clarke Duncan made this movie worth watching. While Roth's character (General Slade) leaps around like a frog, he is a good villain and Duncan's character (Attar) is enjoyable to watch.Overall, you would be better served to watch ""The Mummy"" all over again, as you will get the same thrills, better acting, and, can you believe it, a better story line.",Planet of the Apes
505,Mark-457,"Looks great, great attention to detail, loses it's plot half way through",1,30 July 2001,"Great looking film. Great acting, particulalry Tom Roth and Helena Bonham-Carter. Ape movements and portraying them as a culture used to moving in all three dimensions is excellent, well thought out. Great use of cameos and dialogue from first films. But...Estelle Warren has a pointless role and is completly wooden. The plot peters out into cliches on top of cliches as soon as they arrive at the final destination. Brave but idiot child doing something idiotic, so hero has to rescue him - even has the old weekly serial device of the danger being right on top of him them shifting to not being nearly so close once the situation is resolved. Gimmick to resolve the major conflict is unconvincing, no explanation of why secondary protagonist should drop all his objections and want to live in harmony with species he has despised all his life. Hero doesn't even make a case to him as to why he should do so. Doing for mere appearance of an apparent saviour is incredible. Using small pod to traverse god knows how many universes and our solar system to get home requires too much suspension of disbelief. Ending is just silly.",Planet of the Apes
506,joserus,Disappointing,5,8 August 2001,"I wasn't sure what to make of this film.  Was Tim Burton doing a parody of the first movie?  It felt like Fox was rushing through production to complete this movie before a writers strike and sacraficed the writing itself.  The film never really explains itself and relies upon the audience knowing the premise of the first film for plot guidance. When I saw this film, the audience actually exploded in laughter during the final scene clincher.  Was that supposed to be funny?  The only saving grace of this film was the acting of Helena Bonham Carter which makes Marky Mark's acting appear even worse than it is in their scenes together.  I should have waited for it on video.",Planet of the Apes
507,Spinky McSpanky,Visually Stunning but Emotionally Empty,7,1 August 2001,"Tim Burton once again unleashes his unique cinematic vision upon the world. PotA is never less than visually spectacular however the plot is underdeveloped and the script weak. It is unfair to compare this film to the 1968 version (but I will), as Burton himself states this as a 'reimagining' rather than a remake - neither film 100% true to it's source material. However it is interesting to compare this film to its predecessor in terms of technological advances and budget. This film suffers, like so many of todays 'blockbusters', from too much finance, too much wizardry and mis-spent funds. Quite apparently almost entirely studio shot the film is lush, the space scenes well realised and the planet rich and green. Studio bound filming, though, also makes the film look small - Ape City seems to contain only five or six houses. Compared to the less technical 1968 film which was stark and devoid of enhancing effects, menacing and desolate and decaying due to majority location shooting.The acting is acceptible given the script, and the majority of ape-make up is very good. Some of is is truly dire, and unconvincing. Helena Bonham Carter's 'Ari' looks like a woman in ape makeup, yet Tim Roth's 'Thade' is very well executed - however neither look or performance are as menacing as PotA '68. Danny Elfman's music, although good, also fails to create tension or mood.HBC has fun with 'Ari' and her obsessiveness and jealousness over Mark Wahlbergs 'Leo Davidson' is funny and sweet. Wahlberg has approx. 5 lines of dialogue, but he could be reading the phone directory for all I care -  he's just wonderful to look at.Semi Spoiler ------------
The End. Impossible to recreate the horror of the '68 film, Burton has dispensed with any revelatory thrills and the ending throws up more questions than answers. Obviously gearing up for a sequel one is left with a hollow felling. Just where did Leo go and how long did it take him to get there? Where did he end up and how much further into the future had he been propelled?I found it hard to rationalise but still found the film enjoyable, well paced and visually stunning.

So it's easy to understand I was both anxious to see this new version as well as sceptical.I was expecting to be disappointed, but nothing prepared me for what happened. The first hour of the movie was ok, the last was embarresing.The humans could speak. The Gorillas were silly. Helena Bonham Carter behaved and looked like a human..

511,plaid ideals,this was complete crap with a capital C and a capital R and a capital A and a capital P,1,28 July 2001,"Today was to be a great day, but then this horrid thing called a movie ruined it. Today, or rather yesterday at this point at 1pm nine friends came over and we watched all 5 original Planet of the Apes movies.  Those movies were complete crap but still entertaining (if not only for the extreme taunting they invoked). As bad as all those movies were this new one is worse. It is quite the repulsive movie and not anything I would pay to see...again.***I plan to go through this whole CRAP movie and explain everything wrong and bad about it...as such there is likely to be many a spoiler contained here in***POSITIVES:1) Great make-up! That's all I gotNEGATIVES:1) The first thing I noticed was that in the year 2029 we are super advanced...we have laser guns and nuclear powered spaceships and super-smart genetically engineered apes.2) The ape society is nearly identical to that of the Romans.  They have a senate and military rule and slavery... and I'm sure there's some kind of crazy combat arena where one referred to, as ""the Spaniard"" will defeat the emperor in combat.3) General Thade is the primary villain. And he is the most annoying and most absolutely evil thing in the world. He is constantly breathing exceptionally loud all the time, even when he sits down to dinner he is loudly breathing. And then there is his complete bloodlust as he kills anyone he can even when it doesn't help him to do so.  For instance he is shown that marki mark (our brave hero) has crash-landed in the forest and he kills the two that told him about it because...I don't know why it doesn't make sense.4) The apes refuse to go into the water at any cost. The movie explains they can't swim, but that doesn't make sense either. Even if apes can't swim (which I assume is the case otherwise there is no reason why they would put it in the movie) I believe that if they were super intelligent apes then they would be quite capable of overcoming such a basic fear of water and would be able to learn through common sense. Unless monkeys are made of lead or something, which they may be, I'm not sure.5) The second bad ape, Attar is his name, is a religious little ape. Religion and blind faith were key components of the original and were actually a nice little commentary on humanity (despite the overall poor quality of the movie), however it plays little to no role in this newer version.  By the end of the movie Attar, who was shown to be quite devout to his beliefs, has renounced his beliefs and with great willingness accepted it.  Which is hardly realistic. If some monkey came down from space and told everyone or anyone that there religion was wrong it would hardly be just accepted.  So that's another wasted point of the movie...in fact at one point the movie specifically points out that the general populace of the apes is not religious at all.6) At one point in the movie a lot of people descend on the spot that marki mark and the funky bunch are at. They go to an area within the forbidden zone and as far as we know nobody has been there since the apes first left the desert it is located in and yet they find it with ease...not just a couple people but a whole horde of people and they all seem to reach this destination no more than a couple minutes or so after marki mark reaches the place. It is peculiar at best and ludicrous as a fact.7) Not one character is developed in any manner in any way what so ever. The closest they come to developing a character is creating some kind of weird monkey-human love triangle, but that was just weird not really even developing the characters.8) The ending battle scene is overall your typical action movie battle scene, except the titanic clashes between the great warriors/leaders of each side are meek at best.  There are two such battles. One is between that Attar guy and another gorilla. The two gorillas simply take turns pinning the other one on the ground and beating on the opponent's chest till he is dead. This battle isn't even fair as Attar has armor and the other does not so clearly the one with armor will not easily die when simply having his armor hit with fists.  Another battle is between marki mark and general Thade. General Thade simply beats the crap out of marki mark...its not even close to a battle its just marki mark getting beaten up. Oh wait that's not true, at one point marki mark gets a gun and starts trying to shoot the ludicrously fast monkey.9) Oh yah I completely forgot about the fact that the monkeys could jump roughly 30 feet in any direction they wished and with complete ease.  They were also frightfully strong, they merely throw humans around as they pleased and that was it. Also in the climactic battle Thade handles most enemies by tossing them away. Yes, he was quite strong and threw them a good ten twenty feet but that will hardly kill a man. I'd be willing to bet that most of the people thrown to the side got up dusted them off and continued the fight.10) There's a lot more that doesn't make sense but I'm tired and this movie is depressing me...(tear) so I shall end with one more11) As for the ending of the movie (which I could only begin to explain how bad it was) I have but two words...

Mark Whalberg was pretty good, Micheal Clark Duncan was great, but the real credit goes to Tim Roth as the evil Thade.  My mom thought that he was pretty scary and almost left the theatre.But there was one thing that was wierd, which many people have pointed out: The Ending.  It was pretty twisted, but I'll buy the DVD to see the other endings.Well, I'm gonna go see the movie again because I love Tim Burton and the movie is really cool, (half of the credit goes to Rick Baker's make-up, which will no doubt be nomminated for an oscar)HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",Planet of the Apes

514,Exploited,Completely missing the point...,3,3 August 2001,"OK...maybe Hollywood doesn't produce movies with deeper meanings any more. *sigh*The original ""Planet of the Apes"" tried to incorporate some social criticism in the story. Things like 'beware of the bomb' and 'where is this technological World coming to?'. At the time, space-faring people were very much on everyones mind and PotA was part of what people were interested in.Nowadays things are a little different. The cold war and the nuclear threat are all but forgotten and people travelling into space are only of interest to some people at NASA and a group of Trekkies. When this movie was announced I was very interested in the way this remake would re-actualize this movie.Let's be short about this: They didn't.Not only didn't they translate the original into something current audiences would relate to, they also used some lines without giving it any relevance to the rest of the new story. At some point General Thade is warned about the dangers of humans...about their inherent violent nature and such. In the original this was caused by the key-event responsible for apes-taking-over, namely the nuclear war. In this new remake this warning has NO basis in the story at all! The opposite is true.The 2 endings to the story are even more unlikely and illogical.

The makeup was truly fantastic, and theaction choreographed well.  As a standalone movie, it would havebeen alright, but unfortunately, it has a legacy to live up to.  Thesecond reason for the high score was the sexy, sensuouspresence of Estella Warren.  It seems she was cheated out of arole here; why didn't she become romantically involved with him? What was her backstory?  Anyway, a fairly decent action flick worththe matinee price; not $8.25.",Planet of the Apes
524,Gyaos,"Without comparing it to the original, it still fails.",4,20 August 2001,"Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors/producers now working in the motion picture industry so I was interested to see what he had done with _Planet of the Apes_. The original movie stands as a classic of the sci-fi genre and many people, myself included, wondered why they choose to remake the movie. Fortunately the current _Planet of the Apes_ is more a reinterpretation of the material than than a remake of the movie and on that note it succeeds.However, the results are disappointing to put it mildly. There are enough plot holes to drive a Mac truck through. Often I found myself looking at my watch to see how much longer the movie would be lasting and felt my intelligence being assaulted. Some effects,  especially several jumps the apes make, would be more at home in _The Matrix_ than here. The occasional resused/reinterpreted line from the original movie are delivered poorly and come across as a weak attempt to pay homage to the original. While the story line itself was OK, plot holes aside, the script writing was lacking and the delivery of the lines by the actors more so. Interestingly enough, the best acting job is turned in by Charleton Heston who make a brief cameo appearance. Overall the production value was good, however, the apes village would be more at home in a fantasy movie than a sci-fi flick and as for the the much heralded make-up, I found it lacking, save for the gorillas. Of course one has to mention the ultimate ending of the movie which reeks of being tacked on and proves that sometimes movie makers just add too much footage for no good reason. The final few minutes should have wound up on the cutting room floor. All in all, it is a failure. Everybody makes a real stinker every now and then and Tim really has one here.",Planet of the Apes
525,H I/I H,Don't be hatin',10,4 August 2001,"I can't help but think that people who call this movie 'horrible' are mean spirited. In fact, one reviewer gives a completely false description of how ape civilization started which makes me think he hasn't even seen the movie, but is only spreading bad hype. Folks, maybe you haven't seen some of the other movies that came out this year, but compared to the likes of ""Mummy Returns"", ""JPIII"", ""Swordfish"" etc., Tim Burton's POTA is a modern-day ""Citizen Kane"".I understand people don't like to see their favorite movie remade, but that's no reason to diss this movie. Besides, it's not a remake, it's a re-imaging.The original movie was a social commentary. The new POTA is a sci-fi action summer movie, and I don't see anything wrong with that especially if it's done the way Tim Burton did it. Racial inequality and fear of nuclear annihilation don't plague the world as much as they did in 1968. The story line is basically same.The acting is top-notch as opposed to the original's melodramatic and sometimes over-the-top acting. Mark Wahlberg gives a subtle and understated performance. Paul Giamatti provides great comic relief. And can you say Academy Award Nominee for Tim Roth and Helena Bonham-Carter. There are a lot of complaints about bad dialog. I must have overheard it, because I don't remember any cheesy or nonsense lines.The ending was fascinating. In two years, no other movie, besides Memento, made me think about it as much. The makeup and cinematography are absolutely amazing, as is the kick-ass score. I see how someone could get frustrated with the ending, because it makes you make use of those damn brain cells. Tim Burton used the original novel's ending, so when you trash the ending, you also trash a sci-fi classic.So don't listen to all the bad hype. Go see the movie and make up your own mind.",Planet of the Apes
526,Raptor24,Please stop comparing. Wahlberg is 'Leo' not 'George'.,8,5 August 2001,"Please note that Planet of the Apes (2001) is not a re-make of Planet of the Apes (1968).  It's a re-telling of the story.  And please look up the word ""re-make"", which in the context of ""filmmaking"", means ""to make a film using the same story as that of an old film"".  To expand on that definition, it's means that in that same story, all the same characters are used like that of the original story, and the script is, more or less, the same.  Examples of true re-makes include Sabrina and Psycho.  POTA (2001) is not a re-make, because Mark Wahlberg's character was Leo Davidson, not Col. George Taylor.  If 2001's version was supposed to be a re-make, you would see Tim Burton use the same characters, but he did not. So it not a re-make.  Please stop comparing.  Comparing 2001's POTA to 1968's POTA, is like comparing Tim Burton's Batman (1989) to 1966's Batman: The Movie!!!!!!  They are not the same!!!!!!!!  That's sound ridiculous!!!!!The title for both films are the same, but that's it...the plot is different, the characters are different....stop comparing....My review of Tim Burton's POTA is very positive.  I was very impressed with this film.  POTA (2001) was one of a few films I was willing to go see in a theatre this year, and I was not disappointed.  Kudos to Burton and the cast and crew of POTA (2001).  No need to make people understand the film, if they can't use their own heads.  GO SEE POTA (2001) TODAY WITH AN OPEN MIND if you haven't seen it yet...OR SEE IT AGAIN, SO YOU WILL SEE THINGS YOU MISSED THE FIRST TIME AROUND, and enjoy it even more, like I did!!!Can't wait for the DVD for this one!",Planet of the Apes
527,ArthurHeath,A different film than the original. Appropriately.,10,31 July 2001,"I'm tired of hearing all the complaints about this film. Burton's Planet Of The Apes reprise is ambitious, and ambitious undertakings are always subject to harsh criticisms by the unenlightened masses.Credit must be given to Tim Burton even if alone for coaxing out the single decent performance of Marky Mark's overabundant career.Superior performance by Helena Bonham Carter. Worth seeing again and again. The characters of Ari and her loyal companion the former general remain with you long after the film ends. As do many of the ancillary characters.
Rough transitions between model shots and CGI can be excused due to the studios refusal to grant director Tim Burton further time.
5 endings were shot and until postproduction concluded last week, just three days before release, no one was sure which Burton was electing to use. This DVD should be good. Burton is a masterful director. Here is a prayer for sequels.",Planet of the Apes
528,sudianx,Groans about the acting and the plot holes.,3,28 July 2001,"The Planet of the Apes movies have been going on for ages. Between 1968 and 1981 no fewer than six were made, as well as two television adaptations. Just when you thought enough was enough, or much more than enough, here it comes again: Planet of the Apes (2001).What has changed? Well, a few changes in the plot keep this from being a word-for-word copy of the movie we've all seen years ago on a Saturday afternoon when absolutely nothing else was on television. The people can talk this time, and yet, other than three or four lines per person, they refrain. You'd think these subjugated humans would be full of questions for the space-man, but no, they trudge along in silence throughout most of the movie as little more than scenery. Toward the end, one little boy gets tired of being an extra in a loincloth, and protests. ""I want to be in this movie, too!"" But our hero does not want to share the spotlight. There is one human who doesn't trudge; she prances. While the rest of humanity, dominated by simians, looks as though they've been trying merely to survive, she seems to have thrived and grown to be a supermodel. Actually, she is the face behind Chanel no. 5. Unfortunately, she had no perfume to offer our lead actor (ha, actor. That would imply acting, which is being far too generous), so she stands around as the ""pretty young maiden in the loincloth"" part of the scenery.Our speaking roles are divided up between pretty much three characters. Our space-man and ""hero,"" who actually caused much more trouble than he fixed, Leo Davidson, is played by Mark Wahlberg. He galavants about and spits out his line in a very John Wayne fashion: with as little emotion as possible. We never see him do much except walk along to his destination, dragging some others along the way. Our ape that sympathizes with the humans is Ari, played by Helena Bonham Carter. Watch this one closely if you see this movie. She is one of the two people you'll see acting. The other is Tim Roth, the man who plays our villian, General Thade. He plays a very angry ape.The special effects are good, but what about those plot holes? All of a sudden at the end, people are kissing, but where did that romance come from? It's as if Burton were thumbing through the script, and all of a sudden said, ""hey, we have no romance in this film at all! Quick, somebody film these folks kissing. Nevermind if it doesn't fit in with the story at all."" And while the apes all started out as chimps, they grow into apes that resemble chimps, orangutans, and gorillas, just like in the first movie. But while the difference of species amongst the apes made sence in the 60's version of this movie, it does not in this movie, because of the changes they've made. I can't get any more specific without major spoilers, so email me if you want the specific reason for this. Oh, and the biggest plot hole of all. Our little band is traveling, on foot for a long while, and then on horseback. All of a sudden, a thousand people show up. Why? ""Word has spread."" What?? How?? The pony express? Cell phones, what? No, no, no. We simply didn't have time for details, and we need an army. So, word has spread, we don't know how, but here's the army. Ok.And finally, the ending, which will go down in history as one of the worst endings of any movie, ever. This rivals the endings to ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" and ""Pink Flamingos."" If you hadn't already been groaning at many of the scenes in the middle of the movie, you'll groan at the last. I groaned, and if I had been holding popcorn, I might have thrown it at the screen.",Planet of the Apes
529,gabbyzach,Somebody please explain!,5,26 August 2001,"WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*** While the special effects and makeup in this movie are very well done, the ending of the film leaves you with a sense of ""WHAT THE HECK?"" I love a good twist and I did like the concept that Marky's character ultimately caused the whole thing. THAT made at least some sense. What troubled me, however, was the ending where we see Leo heading home supposedly BACK in time. Now, if he went back in time, how did Tade become a hero being that he didn't even exist until the future? This makes no sense at all and I think is a major flaw. The original ending is much better. I did like the little monkey showing up in his pod, that made me smile although it was totally predictable. I also did enjoy the references to the original movie with the ape saying to him ""Take your filthy hands off of me you damn, dirty human"" and then later on when Charlton Heston, in his cameo apparance, repeats his famous line from the end of the original movie ""Damn it all to hell"" or something to that effect, I don't remember the exact line now. Overall, I would say it was OK. I'd wait to see it on DVD. Maybe there's some explaination with an interview with Tim Burton (who I usually love). In any case it will be interesting to see the behind the scenes stuff. I give it a 5/10",Planet of the Apes

I mean what the hell were they? I couldn't look at Helena Bonham Carter without thinking of Michael Jackson. But then I thought, wait.. maybe it's Latoya.",Planet of the Apes
531,sethbarnhill,This film missed a couple of evolutionary steps...,6,30 July 2001,"What was wrong with this film?  Let me count the ways.  ""Planet ofthe Monkeys"" was somewhat entertaining.  However, it was alsoan extremely safe film, and I would have expected more chancesto be taken from a filmmaker such as Tim Burton.  There werequite a few plot holes that I was willing to forgive for the sake ofmoving the film along.  But when the ending comes and it is not somuch shocking (me and a friend each predicted it) as completelymind boggling.  Even in a world such as this, the question thatbegs to be asked: How is that ending even possible?  Throughoutthe whole movie, through all the bland human characters and theinteresting but tried and predictable ape characters, I was able tosuspend my disbelief; then the ending comes and the disbelief isunsuspended.  The ending simply is not possible. What makes a movie memorable is always a strong ending, onethat gets talked about (read: The Sixth Sense).  Just because thisending will be talked about do not make the mistake of assumingthat it is a memorable ending.  The original ending in the 1968'Apes' was in there for shock value and I never did like it but atleast it could be explained!  Anyway, go see the movie foryourselves if you must, and if there are any physicists or scientistsout there who feel they can adequately explain the plausibility ofthat ending please feel free to tell me.  This film is just the latestbig budget disappointment in a summer saturated with moviesthat do not live up to the hype.  My advice, save your money on thisfilm and go see a worthwhile film like Made, The Princess and theWarrior, Sexy Beast or even Kiss of the Dragon, which makes nopretenses about the kind of movie it is (not to mention that you getto watch a teaser for Black Hawk Down before the movie!).",Planet of the Apes

533,nelly3,Grimly disappointing,1,19 February 2004,"When Charlton Heston fell to the first planet of the apes, it offered something profound. It neatly and cleverly captured much of the social climate of the late 60s. Though not without its antecedents, it certainly has to stand as one of the more important social commentary films posing as sci-fi. Burton's remake, however, doesn't even seem to have a coherent story line. I first saw the Burton film upon its release and found it sorely lacking then. But I worried that my reaction might be too colored by my affection for the original. Remakes are frequently hated by fans of the original, and I didn't want to spout off with an unexamined emotional outburst. But I just sat through it again (this time on TV) and my loathing hasn't diminished. Wahlberg's performance still strikes me as wooden and lacking in purpose. From the very moment of his arrival to the ape world, his only objective is to escape from the planet. So why did he travel out to the planet in the first place? Heston's character of more than 30 years past at least went to explore (to see if there was anything better than man out there). Baker's ape makeup in the remake was good, but effects alone can't make a movie. The humans were no doubt the worst characters in the remake. Like Wahlberg they lacked any depth, and their passivity to ape domination produced more annoyance instead of sympathy. In the original the humans were primitive mutes whose mannerisms were bestial. They brought on pity one might feel for a hunted animal, which they were supposed to be. Another strikingly annoying element in the Burton film was the strange love triangle formed by Helena Bonham Carter as a chimp (albeit a very cute chimp), the collagen-lipped Estella Warren as a primitive human, and Wahlberg. I have no idea what Burton was going for there. While Burton's early films didn't wow me, they nonetheless didn't annoy me. My first impression was simply that he could churn out glitzy Hollywood pablum. Then he made Ed Wood and I suddenly wondered if I had overlooked a film genius. But the profound lack of substance in Apes convinces me that I was right the first time. (And Big Fish hasn't caused me to alter that view).",Planet of the Apes

I hope my warning will at least keep a few from seeing what they will be disgusted with two and a half hours later. First, the apes are unrealistically strong, and this factor throws the entire main conflict out of proportion making the story that much harder to fathom. Second, the humans can talk, which throws the story far from a Planet of the Apes movie in the first place (this may just be personal preferance). Last, the ending ruined any good coming out of the movie.  Charleton Heston's great scene couldn't even make this movie.

Well, he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could've been directed by anybody available out of film school...and in fact, they probably would've done a better job. They would've at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script.Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes. (gasp!) Except this time around, the apes squirm through groan-worthy dialogue, nonsensical plotting, and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could've been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered 'masterpiece' next to this tripe.As much as I enjoy the superb acting talent that is Tim Roth, his performance as evil ape leader Thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing.  Luckily for him, the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap-dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles.And alas, the always dependable Hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause. And the ""haha, we're so clever, aren't we?"" way that Hollywood intermingles references from the original POTA into this one.

He totally crapped up what could have been a great Batman movie and did the same thing with Planet of the Apes. The plot was such a snorer as it trudges along in a uneven pace. It leaves me to wonder,did he ended it so crappy as to not want to make a sequel? I anticipated the release of this film for so long and when I threw away my eight dollars and fifty cents to see it on opening night i wanted to send my bill to Burton. GOD!!

541,LordDave,Monkeys rock!,8,29 July 2001,"*slight spoilers contained herein*Monkeys rock!  That's a good summary of my review of Tim Burton's re-imagining of the 1968 sci-fi classic, Planet of the Apes.  In this version, Marky Mark, as the astronaut guy, loses his astro-monkey, which disappears into a magnetic plot device.  Marky brashly rushes in after his little buddy, and soon finds himself stranded on the aforementioned Planet. This world is run by apes, which are amazingly well portrayed (by both make-up and acting) as powerful and intelligent, but still very simian. Mr. Mark is captured, leads an escape, starts a war, and some other stuff. Plot is not that important here.  Neither are any of the humans in the movie. The apes are obviously the stars. In the original film, the personal conflict between Charlton Heston's human astronaut and the ape rulers was the central factor in the story.  In this movie, Charlton Heston plays an ape, and I think that is a big clue as to the focus.  Mark Wahlberg plays the astronaut as rather dim and singleminded.  He's just a military flyboy who wants to get back home, where things are normal.  More interesting are Ari, an ape played by Helena Bonham Carter, Paul Giamatti's sleazy Limbo the orangutan thingy, and Tim Roth as the frightening, zealously anti-human General Thade.  They have much more complex personalities, and while they might not drive the story as effectively as the ploddingly courageous spaceman, they give it all the depth it can muster. Of course, all of this brainy stuff is mostly beside the point.  What make it so enjoyable are the visuals and action.  The big action; armies of monkeys fighting, Thade throwing an insane, violent hissy fit, and Michael Clarke Duncan beating his chest and kicking some monkey butt .  The little action; monkey behaviorisms adopted by the actors behind the make-up.  The way they walk, screech, and groom each other is one welcome difference from the original, where the apes acted like... well, humans with monkey-masks. And the monkey-masks are much improved, as well.  The apes (of all kinds this time, including those weird big necked thingies and orangutans) are very convincing, and incredibly cool, as are the locations, from the ape city to the rocky wasteland. I liked the way some of the lines from the original were borrowed, in a cleverly turned-around fashion.  I liked Charlton Heston's cameo (even if I almost giggled at his anti-gun statement).  Whatever anyone says, I liked the silly `big surprise', which didn't surprise anyone, but was fun anyway. Heck, the movie even had the Chinese Foooood lady, from Dude! Where's My Car?.  Overall, I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  It may not be Burton's best, but I'd see it again.Rating:  8/10 (nothing to fling poop at)The Score:  Ah, the main reason I was eager to see this movie.  Danny Elfman does it again!  A mix of his old-style weirdness and his more recent leanings toward the mainstream, the score is driven by distinctive percussion and big, blasting monkey music.  While it isn't quite Batman, or even Sleepy Hollow, it fits the movie perfectly, underscoring the action and adding to the feeling of primitive power, evolved and unleashed.  If you buy the score, be warned:  the last track is a pointless remix by some dude named Paul Oakenfold.   I pressed stop after 15 seconds.",Planet of the Apes
542,Number 9,Eeeeeh Eeeeeeh Eeeeeeeh! A-pe +,9,26 July 2001,"Being a lover of the original series I was nervous to say the least. But Tim Burton surprised even me. His take on the ape story is just as good and fresh as the original! This film starts off fast and keeps moving. Burton's dark avant-garde  style of film making does not interfere with this flick. And yet his style is all over. This film has witty dialogue, GREAT special effects, and great ape performances from all. The ""monkeys"" in this version are so much more menacing here that I just may have nightmares. Mark Whalberg's debut into super-stardom is also noteworthy. His mile a minute, never stop attitudes is refreshing and brings his character to life.

What i wanted to see, logic put into its place, as mark wahlberg explains his story to the apes and enlightens them, however they still reject him and thus the war breaks out. For anyone who is a fan of the first, there is no doubt that it was far superior. Old Guns and Moses was much better in the title role, as opposed to our renegade hero who doesn't have much to talk about, in the movie all in all, the movie sorely needed much better dialogue, and a stronger plot integration, as opposed to a movie of pure violence, simply throwing apes in the title roles. the idea of this movie was action not plot, however, action always takes the back seat to a good plot, never vice-versa, explain first, then fight despite my disliking of the movie, i hafta admit, the last quarter of the movie was alright, and i was fond of the ending, and the last plot twist i give the movie a **1/2 out of ***** and i hope that the sequel will be better,though it probably won't be",Planet of the Apes

I walk into the theatre with a clean slate. I sit down wanting to be entertained and for about two hours my imagination should flow. With Planet of the Apes this is what I saw. 1) A beginning credit sequence? On a summer movie? 'Take it easy,' I said, 'you're just anxious for it to begin'. 2)After the credit sequence concludes we see a space station. A title appears stating that it's 2029, a mere 28 years from now. I squirm, the future date should have been left to my imagination 2)On the space station we see Mark Wahlberg interacting with his comrades. Nameless, numberless comrades. It dawns on me that Wahlberg maybe the only major lead. 'Oh no, he's good but he's not that good.' 3)After a monkey is shot out into the unknown in a space probe, Wahlberg, who was against this idea, straps himself in a pod of his own and states, ""Don't send a monkey to do a man's job."" My heart sinks. 4)Wahlberg crashes into a very fake looking sound stage jungle set. I'm instantly taken out of the movie. 5)But then I perk up when the apes appear. They jump through the air and leap through the trees with wreckless abandon just like I hope monkeys do. I like this. 6)Upon his capture Wahlberg grabs onto an apes legs. The ape responds with a knowing wink, ""Get your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human!"" I'm out of the movie again. 7)The apes and their captives arrive to another claustrophobic sound stage which they warmly know as their city. 8)Darn near every shot is a close up further inducing my claustrophobia. My best defense is to fall asleep. 9)I wake up sometime later. It turns out that the apes are afraid of water so to get away from them Wahlberg suggest to his merry crew to cross the river. Ari, the friendly she-ape is afraid. Wahlberg says, 'Don't be afraid you silly nit, we'll be on horses and horses are good swimmers.' She submits and they proceed to cross the five feet deep river. Question: When the apes see the horses safely swimming to the other side why don't they follow? 10)We discover along with the main characters that Wahlberg's space station passed through the same time warp he did but crash landed 3,000 years before and that, presumedly, the smart little monkeys aboard went crazy and killed all the humans. And then I take it they evolved into the warlike big apes we now see. In only 3,000 years of evolution??? 11)As for the trick ending that everyone has now heard about. Can someone please tell me because I fell asleep again. I'd like to state for the record that I loved Starship Troopers.",Planet of the Apes
545,kschwantes,Who directed this film and what have you done with Tim Burton?,6,30 July 2001,"I am a huge fan of all of Tim Burton's previous films. They contain fantastical fairytale worlds inhabited by beautiful and strange beings. They have a degree of warmth regarding the beauty of the outsider. His almost baroque and gothic imagery are sublime within their own right, and the ultimate message of understanding and appreciating those who are different completes this magical composition. His wonderfully facetious dark and light humor dominate and charm audiences. None of these qualities were present in Planet of the Apes. Mark Wahlburg was an unsypathetic hero with very little character development or history. The same can be said for the rest of the cast sans the comic relief character of the slave trader. No magic here, except for the disappearance of Burton's usual artistic and unique vision. I honestly could not believe that he directed it. Tim, please, come back to us!",Planet of the Apes
546,Fludlerk,Very nice effort,8,29 July 2001,"As a retelling, this story was very good, if a little predictable at times. I think the only down sides for me were the lack of any acting talent in Mark Wahlberg, and the obvious 'we're planning a sequel' ending.  Other than that, it was a very enjoyable experience, and the addition Heston was a treat.  But to be perfectly honest, Helena Bonham Carter is one sexy monkey. :-)",Planet of the Apes
547,clubmike00,Well done!,6,28 July 2001,"I have to admit that I had been looking forward to this movie since I first heard that it was being made.  That usually results in disappointment (e.g. Star Wars, Episode 1).  Despite the hype, I very much enjoyed this movie.Aside from the superlative effects and make-up, the script was tight, the story worked well and the acting was very, very good.  Surprisingly, the actors who portrayed some of the apes really stood out.  I find it interesting when watching animated films, I can almost always tell who is voicing the characters right away.  Had it not been for some help from the opening credits, I don't think I would have guessed any of the ""ape actors"". Tim Roth deserves an Oscar!",Planet of the Apes
548,imajk,"Plot holes, yes. But, please, slavery not one of them!",9,17 August 2001,"Yes the movie has some pretty serious plot holes, all described in other reviews and won't be repeated here.  I don't want to ridicule other reviewers, but to suggest that the apes would not enslave humans, or consider them savages because THEY CAN SPEAK ENGLISH and display intelligence is unbelievable baffling.  The very point of the whole D*** movie is to point out how unfair and bigoted people (or apes) can be.  Of course it's illogical, that is the point !!!  Has no one heard of the basically continuous human history of enslavement of our fellows ????  Funnily enough there was ample evidence of intelligence and language there, even English, and yet slavery went on!  All this real life enslavement with one hell of a lot less motivation (greed basically) than is provided the apes in this movie.  Please if you are going to go on and on about plot holes at least stick to safer ground. 
Do the other plot holes really detract from the movie, decided for yourself. I thought the whole look and feel of the movie made up for the its other shortcomings, and that it was a worthy remake of a much loved classic.",Planet of the Apes
549,karateman777,Liked it but didn't love it,7,16 December 2001,"My main beef with this flick was the lack of dialogue between Mark Wahlberg's character and the apes where he tries to convince them he is smart.  That is what I remember mostly about the original; Charlton Heston was desperate to prove he was intelligent.  I remember just feeling helpless concerning his plight, and aching for him to succeed.  I would have felt the exact same way had that angle been explored more in this remake.  Helena Bonham Carter's character doesn't go through that discovery, she believes in the intelligence of humans right away it seems.  That fact alone made this version of ""Planet of the Apes"" far inferior to the original.  Instead of just making it look more sleek, Tim Burton should have been more concerned with this thematic element, an element that in my opinion made the original so compelling.",Planet of the Apes
550,xzis10s,This movie is not The Original!,10,1 August 2001,"First off, as a fan of the original POTA i found this movie to be EXCELLENT!!!  I grow tired of hearing all the comparisons to the original. The worst complaint is that the film was not Satirical enough. This is a new movie.  A satirical version of this movie already exists.  Why would Tim Burton want to do another satirical version???  He wouldn't, that would be redoing a movie.  This is a re-imagining! Perhaps this is why tim burton decided to create a more literal interpretation of the subject matter.  And in so doing takes nothing away from the original and actually amplifies the sentiment of the original while actually maintaining a social message!  It may have be in a different area and more straight forward but it still echoes the sentiment of the original.  As for the complaints that the film makes no sense, it makes perfect sense.  One gets the sense that much of what happened will be explained later, in a sequel.  I could think of several explanations of various plot ""holes"" and inconsistencies.  It just depends on what they have in mind.  Just remember how much was left out of the original POTA.  To watch that film alone without all the sequels prompts many questions.   Also, I thought the small homages to the original were brilliant and fun.  And, The Special effects were astounding.  The makeup alone is completely worth seeing.  It really saddens me to see such a backlash against this film.  I left the theater actually feeling like this film stands right in line with the rest of the Apes films.",Planet of the Apes
551,alighthall2000,Spoiler Alert! Don't read unless you have seen the show,4,8 August 2001,"I didn't leave the theater, and I didn't fall asleep.  Neither was I riveted to the screen.  Though the apes in this remake are better looking, and the sets more lavish compared to the original, the plot, characters,  and dialogue leave much to be desired. I expected more from Tim Burton. The characters are tepid, shell people (apes).  A little ""character development"" was in order.  The plot, hokey enough with time travel as main device,  was an unworkable, meandering journey through the frenetic pace all to common in todays' typical Hollywood offering.  I thought some  new angle as to how the apes took over the planet would have been cool.  But the usual ""humans caused the problem"" babble continues.  And there are holes galore in the story.  For instance, since there are supposed to be four humans for every ape, then why would it be so hard for humanity to fight the apes? Especially since people have the power of speech in this new version.And how, at the end of the flick, did Capt. Leo get from Saturn to Earth in his little space pod thing. And of course I must object to the usual liberal political correctness that permeates Hollywood.  Would we seriously expect a bronze age culture to have a ""Human Rights"" group? As usual, so much more could have been accomplished with this film.  But instead they settle for the two week thrill.  Another great movie theme sacrificed on the alter of the summertime box office. The sequel can only be better!",Planet of the Apes
552,TVvuer69,"Pretty good, in my opinion (minor spoilers)",8,22 December 2002,"Don't get me wrong.  I enjoyed the original Planet of the Apes and its sequels.  But the new version does tell a different story and therefore not a remake of the original.  Here, Mark Wahlberg plays Captain Leo Davidson aboard the space station Oberon in the year 2029.  After routine simulated test flights with chimps, the station's sensors detect an ion storm (a term familiar to Star Trek fans).  Despite Davidson's protests, his chimp is sent out to take scans of this storm up close.   Greatly concerned for his well-being (you just gotta love his compassion for animals), Leo goes on an unauthorized shuttle launch in efforts to rescue him only to get caught up in the storm himself.  Sure enough, he goes forward in time and crash lands on a jungle-like planet.  Before he knows it, he's caught in a conflict where humans are running for their lives against an army of huge, talking gorillas.  He, along with the rest of the people are captured, imprisoned, and sent into slave quarters in a civilization run by these intelligent apes.Unable to accept life as a slave, Davidson organizes an escape with his fellow humans and a few ape sympathizers, including Helena Bonham Carter's character, Ari.  After returning to his wrecked ship, Leo is able to recover a few devices that detects a signal indicating his crew is searching for him.  The ensuing 2-day hike leads to some shocking revelations for Leo once they find the signal's origin.  It's from this point that Davidson is thrusted into the role of the reluctant hero as more and more humans become inspired by the quest to escpae slavery from the apes.  The ending of the movie also provides a major twist that most certainly indicates a sequel. After what happened in those last scenes, I'm quite looking forward to it.Overall, I thought this was pretty well-done.  Many of the lead characters undergo significant development.  Mark Wahlberg goes from being a happy-go-lucky animal-loving pilot to the role of reluctant hero to a bunch of rag-tag humans.  Carter's Ari becomes more of an activist for humans knowing that they are capable of being more than slaves.  Of course, you have the main troublemaker in the form of Tim Roth's General Thade, who's willing to murder even his own kind to maintain the status quo on the jungle planet.  Of all the character developments, my favorite was that of Michael Clarke Duncan, whose Attar character goes from being one of Thade's lackeys to a free-thinking ape who realizes the truth as to whom the real enemy is once he's presented the proper insight.  Duncan was a pretty good choice for this movie, especially considering how big he is.  Some might say he's really part-gorilla, and thereby born for the role.  I got the DVD of the movie and liked the process he went through with the make-up people. They were still applying his fur and make-up as Mark Wahlberg comes in for a brief touchup, which lasts less than a minute.  The two actors trade jokes and in an instant Wahlberg's back out shooting scenes while Duncan's still changing into ape form.  A good funny bit here!Again, we have a good story that goes from basic science fiction to the main theme of the battle for freedom.  At the end, it goes back to the element of sci-fi with a major twist.  Hopefully, the sequel will help to provide some revelations as to how this twist occured.  Mark Wahlberg has proven to be a good actor in previous film roles, as he did in this movie.  With the numerous trashings of this new Planet of the Apes movies, it's very likely he'll do a good job for the upcoming sequels.  I'm definitely looking forward to them.",Planet of the Apes

I was most impressed with the way the apes move. Really good stuff. The different kind of apes are also good in this film.One thing that I didn't like though is that the conversations seemed ""empty"". I mean when the big gorilla brakes his gun ( the only gun on the planet , wich I suppose had unlimited ammo) the guy just said "" Hey,what did you do that for?"" . I would have flipped out!

How wrong I was. With 'Planet of the Apes' Mr T. Burton has produced a movie which is absolutely devoid of characterisation and totally lacking in wit or imagination. The plot holes are so gargantuan that one fears the bored looking cast members may tumble into them never to return. Even Burton's visual panache, the saving grace in such uninvolving one joke efforts as 'Mars attacks', is utterly absent here. This looks exactly like what it is: slapdash, cynical filmmaking of the highest (or lowest) order.Do yourself a favour and go back and revel in the wonderfully unnerving atmosphere of the original.

The stench should have put an end to awful remakes forever",1,6 January 2009,"The saddest observation(s) on this lame-dog, utterly unnecessary remake are that it managed to squander the contributions of three alumni from the classic original: RICHARD ZANUCK-responsible for green-lighting the 1968 version when he headed 20th Century Fox in 1967,was also at the helm of this travesty of cinema-- it also wastes CHARLTON HESTON, the great mega-star who so effectively inhabited the character of GEORGE TAYLOR (here in ape-make up panting through a clichéd, embarrassingly written cameo/death scene), and once again poor LINDA HARRISON (Nova in the first two APES entries) is reduced to a token 3 second cameo shot,essentially lampooning her original character.This film's announcement created a huge buzz in Hollywood, and among the fan-base of the original classic APES franchise. Instead what audiences receivedwas a pathetic, unengaging,poorly executed load of overblown B.S Tim Burton seemed to very removed from his usual hands-on approach that made his best work so imaginative. The make-up is pretty well done, but unappealing and the actors sure had their work cut out for them, trying to reinvent the genius of former characterizations made by Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall and Maurice Evans.--but all was for naught with such a lame-ass script, lead character and senseless ""action"".I will say that H Bonham Carter did do a respectful job at her character, and gave a noble performance. But she was conducting it aboard a sinking ship.Weeks after this 2001 version opened (to 120 MILLION dollars worth of box-office!) the tragedy of 9/11 occurred, and it was quickly forgotten-where it has remained at the very bottom of Tim Burton's resume.And judging from most every other comment on this board, the bottom of the barrell-period!It never should have been made-plain and simple",Planet of the Apes

Except about the fantastic overall look and special effects, far above the original -- after all, special effects and make-up have come a long way since 1968.It is not a copy of the original. It gives a nod to the original in several places, rather obviously, and with a bit of whimsical tongue-in-cheek; apparently Charlton Heston agreed, and I trust I need not elaborate.I actually rate this one as a 9.5, and would have gone to ten, but for the unclear ending; they were obviously looking for something that would have the impact of the Statue of Liberty showing up, half buried, as we saw in the first film; this one falls a bit short in that regard, and while I could ""figure it out,"" it should have been more simple and obvious. It wasn't.Helena Bonham Carter pretty much walks away with this one, as she makes about the cutest chimp anyone can imagine.

To kick things off I do have to say that this film does have a a fairly exceptional cast in Mark Wahlberg, Helena Bonham-Carter, Michael Clark Duncan, and Tim Roth. I thought that Wahlberg was a good fit for his role considering he usually takes up a daring, adventurous role quite well, and that Tim Roth was a bit out of his element I felt but he took on the Role of Thade quite well. As for Clark- Duncan and Helena Bonham-Carter I don't really want to get into my opinions as to how they fit into their parts, but I will say they performed satisfactorily. I liked how the story developed and I enjoyed most of it. Special Effects are lacking, and the ending was kind of lame. But overall I can give this movie a solid six.",Planet of the Apes

Their only purpose seems to be solely to dismantle a poorly thought out story line into complete unrecognition. Carter, Roth, and Duncan however, are excellent. They're good outside of the ape suits but within them, they are transformed into sci-fi Gods. If not for them, the movie would be a B flick.

564,Niels Martin,it's entertainment,5,11 August 2001,"Being a formidable Burton-fan, his remake of the 1968 classic, THE PLANET OF THE APES, was an affair I'd looked forward to for quite a long time. But, after having seen the film, I regret to say that my emotions are mixed at best. First off, THE PLANET OF THE APES, doesn't have the feel of a Tim Burton film. The one thing I love the most about his films, are the characters in them. You really get to care for a Burton character. But the only character in this film that might resemble a previous Burton character, such as Edward Scissorhands or Jack Skellington, is Ari. She's the typical outcast in her society, set aside by her revolutionary ideas that humans should be treated equally as monkeys (sorry, apes), but other than her there really aren't any other characters in this film that can evoke care and emotions. The film doesn't visually have the Burton-esque style to it, either. There are occasional shots where some of that Burton magic shines through, like when we see the ape-city at a distance (it looks bewitched), but for the most part the visual style of the film is typical Hollywood extravagance. It would actually seem fair to compare this film with BATMAN. Both films are financially huge projects, where the producers seems to have put a lid on Burton's imagination, perhaps in fair of loosing the bigger audience. Tis a shame Also, the film doesn't feel grand. I, personally, was expecting a huge film. After seeing the intense trailers, I though THE PLANET OF THE APES would be a film that could give us a taste of what's to come, with LORD OF THE RINGS looming in the distance, speaking in terms of huge CGI made battles and such, but alas There's only one such scene, and it's over in a flash.There are also several things that bothered me in the script. First off, the beginning, which was too short too explain why a pilot would risk his life going after an ape lost in an electromagnetic storm. More time should have been spent, or been spent more efficiently, on this bit. There was also stuff in the characters development, which didn't fit. *SPOILERS* There's a scene in the film where Ari sneaks back into the camp of the vicious Thades, to conduct some sort of peace meeting, where she ends up being branded by Thades with the mark of humans. The film doesn't explain why Ari would attempt such an act in the first place, or why Thades would just let Ari and Sandar, who accompany her, leave afterwards, and the scene isn't followed up later in the film. It's only there to give Thades a chance to mark Ari. The writers should have thought of another way for this to happen. Also, towards the end of the film, we see Colonel Attar suddenly betray his patron, Thades, after, for the most part, being a pretty grim ape himself. It didn't seem like a logical course of action for this character. They should have sown the seeds for such an act earlier in the film. I also thought the filmmakers dispatched Sandar too easily. He was the former superior of Thades, but cast into shame when Thades betrayed him, and in the battle scene, where he's supposed to fight his previous protégé, he's intervened by Colonel Attar and defeated in a minute or so. I would have thought such a character, as Sandar, would have deserved a better exit.The ending, high above all things, must be discussed. Naturally, there was a huge amount of pressure on the filmmakers to come up with an ending that would match the original 68-ending, and take it's audience by surprise. It seems to me, that in their desperation to concur such an ending, they exit the film with more questions than answers. *HUGE SPOILER* I see only two possible answers to the end: (a) Everything took place on earth all along, and Captain Leo Davidson has only been traveling back and forth in time, as in the original film, or that (b) we are talking about two different planets. If it's the first, (a), then Captain Leo Davidson should have been able to figure all this out, by calculating coordinates and such, but if it's the second, (b), then how in the nine hells did Thades make his way to earth? Puzzling.Tim Roth, who stars as Thades, makes it clear that he's one of the meanest villains out there. Mark Wahlberg is a fine enough actor, who's done better before, that pulls of the part of Captain Leo Davidson quit nice, not being especially heroic, but not too much of an anti-hero either. Helena Bonham-Carter, as Ari, is, next to Tim Roth, the best actor on the cast. Putting Michael Clarke Duncan behind the make-up of Colonel Attar was also a good move on Burton's behalf. First off, because he's big enough to fit the role, and second, because his melancholic eyes are perhaps the only thing that lends credibility to the fact that he chooses to disobey his patron, Thades. Paul Giamatti was superb, creating comical relief with Limbo, the slave trader. Estella Warren, in her skimpy Xena outfit, was incognito at best. So, all in all, as I arrive upon my conclusion, it must be said that THE PLANET OF THE APES is a pretty entertaining film, if nothing else. The film is clearly less political than it's predecessor. It seems to have no ambitions. It only wants to entertain. And so it does, many thanks to a good cast, great make-up, enough funny scenes, and, last but not least, an excellent villain.",Planet of the Apes
565,Hylo Bates,A film for Primatologists!,8,31 July 2001,"Finally, a movie a primate-lover can watch and not groan.  I'd read a lot about the making of this movie and was optimistic to see it, because along with LOOKING like apes, the actors reportedly had training to make them ACT like apes.  I was not disappointed!From vocalizations to subtle physical movements to the violent tantrum thrown by Thade (Tim Roth), the actors did a good job of portraying apes, not just being humans in ape suits.  Anyone who's studied apes (or watched the Discovery Channel a time or two), would recognize the animals on-screen.(Spoiler alert in this Paragraph) To me, the most important line in the movie was very early on, uttered by Leo (Mark Wahlberg) to the primatologist on the spaceship Oberon.  In speaking about the chimp he's training, Leo says something to the effect of ""He's the best money can buy...gene-spliced and chromosome-enhanced"".  In that line is the key to the whole movie, what made it so much better from a scientific point of view than the original. In the original 1968 picture, the premise was that apes had ""evolved"" on a post-apocolyptic Earth, learning to speak and walk upright.  This, of course, is ridiculous to a scientist and goes completely against evolutionary theory (I'll refrain from a long explanation of that...if anyone's confused, just email me).  But in the new version, humans TAMPERED with the genetic makeup of the apes (presumably to make them more human), and THEN the apes were left to evolve after the Oberon landed on the new planet.  That is a scientifically plausible event (if we suspend our disbelief and accept gene-splicing, which is not difficult for a futuristic film).So, this version is far more palatable in respect to plot and the portrayal of apes.  I did NOT like the ending of this one as much as the original, and that's what keeps me from giving it a 10 (I give it an 8).  I felt like the ending was trite and contrived, but I forgive Burton for doing it.  A ""trick ending"" was obligatory and necessary for Hollywood to remake a ""classic"" like POTA.The not-so-subtle social commentary on how we humans treat animals, particularly apes, was fairly glaring, but I think it was well-done.  The scene where the little human girl is pried away from her mother to be made a pet is something anyone considering taking a primate as a pet should see. And the line about getting rid of her before she hits puberty because ""one thing you don't want in your house is a human teenager"" is apt on several levels.I liked the humor in this film, too.  The comic relief of the human trader and the human sayings the apes used were good.  And the best bit of humor was achieved through irony in the cameo part played by Charleton Heston. Heston, a known NRA lacky, portrays an elderly Ape who cautions his son to be wary of the humans because they possess the power of dangerous technology; he holds a gun in his hands and declares it the root of human evil.  That was masterful!So, overall this film was a joy to watch.  From good jokes and clever irony to a plausible plot and interesting characters and conflict, this movie had it all.  I will see it again and again, just to take in all the details of the apes' world.  I will, however, not watch the final two minutes, because I think the obligatory Hollywood ending spoils an otherwise great film. It's still better than most movies made today, but Burton's remake would have been better without the ending.  As I said before, though, I forgive him for it, and I thank him for making a movie in accord with primatology.(Spoiler alert)One side note about the movie... one other problem with the believablity was created by a simple fact of biology that some people may not be aware of.  At the end of the movie when Leo's chimp lands and exits his spacecraft, it is obvious that he is much smaller than the ""evolved"" chimps, and that creats a visual inconsistency.  That is because that chimp, as with all chimps used in films and TV shows, is a very young ape, probably just four or five years old.  An adult chimp is close to the size of a small adult human and would have looked much better.  However, adult chimps are not used because they are so large, agressive, and strong.  An adult chimp is easily three times as strong as an adult human, has large canine teeth, and could kill a man in a few seconds.  So the necessity of using an immature chimp in the role is evident, and we can forgive the movie that small inconsistency as well.",Planet of the Apes
566,jayly,"Looks like we're not in Kansas anymore, Toto!",3,8 August 2001,"SPOILERS!!! Watch the movie.

That is fine, but when the storyline (macro level -ape vs man, micro level the humans on this planets apparent desire to rebel against the apes) hinges on the hope that he will- he is the humans savior. He doesn't care, and any effort to care seems half hearted at best. The writing is terrible, wasteful and at times just stolen and ba****dized. If we aren't supposed to compare this movie to the original, then why did they steal superb lines from the original and force them into this one? Early in the movie, on the spacestation, one of the scientists tells Wahlbergs character that the female apes are the aggressive ones. I thought at that point there would be a female general on the planet of the apes. Was there? No. Did that line ever come into play? No. So why have it in the movie? It didn't further the plot, it wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting, it provided nothing at all. Is this nit picking? Perhaps, but it just goes to show how unattached the people making this movie(and films in general) are to the point of cinema. Shakespeare never wasted a word, and here these people are, using millions of dollars to produce a story and they can't even get a quality script written. All this movie is a chase scene, but the end of the battle scene is ridiculous, the only way the writers could save their hero, and the apparent peace that arises between man and ape is forced because no real discussion of the topic occurs. The ending makes no sense, only cents- it is the launching pad for a sequel to try to explain what the hell happened. I'll only touch on the awful directing (hey Burton- why does everything important have to happen when it is dark) and the complete lack of attention to detail (Estella Warren's character was supposed to be the love interest- but the female ape and wahlberg had more chemistry, ape costumes looked just like ape costumes.) Did anyone else notice that at the bottom of the lake in which Marky Marks spaceship crashed was brighter than the dark jungle in which he crashed? Do the fish in that pond have lightbulbs? This movie was the pits- and if fits right in with the rest of the garbage I've seen this year.",Planet of the Apes
568,Andy-154,Wonderful,9,28 August 2001,"I was hoping I would enjoy this film and I did!!!!Planet of the Apes really is a wonderful and engrossing film to watch. It has a unique look throughout, with some wonderful and vast sets and locations. The scenery is always slightly different, and that makes it interesting to look at.The conversations between the characters are involving, entertaining and in places even charming. There is some very amusing humour in there as well, nothing hilarious, but enough to get a laugh from the audience.... ""There's nothing you want around your house LESS than a human teenager"" for example, or the Ape with false teeth!The plot is also good. And to a certain extent keep you wondering what will happen next. Mark Whalberg is excellent as the main character. He's just the type you want in a film like this. Lets face it, you wouldn't want Sylvester Stallone or some other muscle bound 'Conan' type bloke down there. But Whalberg makes a very believable main character. General Thade's character is fantastic throughout also.Finally, you know throughout that SOMETHING will happen at the end. It was inevitable. And what IS at the end was very satisfying, hard to get your head around, but really cool none the less.And anyone who thinks that your a shallow individual for thinking that a 're-make' (or re-imaging) is good, is totally wrong. Planet of the Apes is a fine film that entertains throughout and doesn't disappoint anywhere......... and thats ALL anyone can ask for!",Planet of the Apes
569,BadMrKitty,"Get your hands off me, you damn dirty human!",5,27 July 2001,"Tim Burton has always been an atmosphere artist, and in Apes he does an excellent job.  The scenery is compelling, and the ape costumes are fantastic!  There is a cloud to that silver lining.  It's called, character development.  He does a below average job portraying Wahlberg's character, the star of the film.  Other characters get slightly better treatment, but what about the kid who Wahlberg's character saves as the ape army attacks? Almost no background, just a couple of shots of him being insubordinate to Wahlberg, a person that the humans on the planet are in awe of.  Would a kid really be that brash?The story is good, the acting is fine, the scenery is superb.  The climax of the film is great, though I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it. However, one thing can always ruin a good movie: a bad ending.  Let me just say I think Mr. Burton wanted to see apes in police squad cars and ape tourists.

571,MasterJereel,Tim Burton Made Me Vomit,1,3 August 2001,"""Planet of the Apes (2001)"" has soared its way all the way to the number one movie in the country (USA), which does not surprise me. I don't know why all the movies I happen to despise became huge successful films. Probably because the general person now-a-days is just looking for visuals, special effects, and action sequences.What happened to plot? I suppose it's dead. If you even remotely liked the original ""Planet of the Apes (1968)"", then don't see this mockery. It was definitely up there with, ""Hannibal"" as one of my most hated films.Even the score of ""The Planet of the Apes (2001)"" is repetitive, slow, and unoriginal - admittedly similar to the film's plot. The only surprise I found in this movie was Tim Burton's cunning idea of putting a frame of Hitler in the start of the film. The background for the frame or two of Der Fuhrer was some kind of nonsensical sci-fi blur that couldn't even logically happen in a galaxy far, far away let alone our own. However, don't worry Burton even hinted bestiality in this film (Not a surprise, I suspected it). I know that's horrible, but it's worth a good laugh... at how bad this movie was.Tim Burton: Does this movie even smell of his style? No. This movie doesn't have anything that would make me remotely think Tim Burton directed it. It has none of his early style and ideal that made his earlier work appealing and launched him into the mainstream. If you think you like Tim Burton's work and this movie's got to be good because he directed it, think again. If you liked his earlier work like, ""Edward Scissorhands,"" an excellent film in my mind: Don't go see his remake of Planet of the Apes. It will make you nauseous and annoyed.This film eliminates most of the great ideas of its original, which inspired so much wonderment, joy, and captivation, i.e. In Burton's version every single human can talk. The ending is all wrong, distorted, and makes literally no sense. All of the appeal of the original is casted away. Even the acting in this remake is quite dull.I need to warn you again, if you liked the original Planet of the Apes, or Tim Burton's early work, this movie will make you sigh - big time. This movie is even a disgrace to the Sci-Fi genre.",Planet of the Apes

The makeup by Rick Baker is amazing and the CGI effects are used well. You can hardly tell they're there at all. Tim Roth practically steals the show as General Thade. My quibbles: Mark Wahlberg wasn't the best choice for the lead. Burton should've cast someone a little older, with a little more presence. George Clooney perhaps. The humans being able to speak in this version  (as oppossed to the mutes in the original) added nothing to the story as they really had nothing interesting to say.

When I heard about this flick, I though that this ""re-imagining"" would be at least visually better than the original film. Well, it's not. The new makeup is more complex than the appliances used in the firs film, but the apes are grotesque. Ari, for instance, has hilarious ape features, and so David Warner's character. The problem, I think, is the ""realistic"" sculpture of the masks, made by Rick Baker. I don't know if ""realism"" is a good choice in a movie called ""Planet of the Apes"". The general concept is quite bizarre, and realism can make things even worse.In the original, the characters looked like apes, but had a more sophisticated appeal, a noble aspect. It's very difficult to achieve this balance, and perhaps it explains why the makeup of the new ""Planet"" wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Add to that a bunch of apes running like rabbits, ""primitive"" humans that think and talk like evolved humans and poor sets, and you have a natural looser. But what really upset me about this film is the title: it should be ""THE VISITOR"", as Burton had originally envisioned. ""THE VISITOR"" is more accurate in the sense that the movie is a ""re-imagining"", not a remake.",Planet of the Apes

Furthermore, the new film is not exciting or entertaining. I am not sure why the film industry would invest so much money in a film that has already been made. I think that if the original was good, there is not need for a remake! It seems that in this modern era, many film makers have either run out of ideas or sold out.

Rosenthal put together a movie with too high-brow of a plot for you to understand.  I'm one of the first people to nit pick away at movies for defying the laws of physics and continuity but most of the complaints I've read in the reviews have no basis whatsoever.  You simply didn't understand what you were watching.Now that that's said; Wahlberg's acting skills needed a lot of polishing before trying a role like this.  Granted, we all know he's no Charlton Heston, but come on... he's worse in this movie than most and that's saying something.  Beyond that - and having the lead role that poorly cast does, I'll admit, have a huge impact on the overall movie - it's hard to fault this picture.

If there was I didn't hear it.A few observations:We don't really care Leo (Mark Wahlberg) tries to rescue his pet chimp, it's way to early in the movie to care, put it down to bad writing.None of the human characters has anything of interest to say so why have them speak at all in the movie?Flying apes? That's what it looked like to me. Sure, the stunt looked great in The Matrix and MI:2 but do we have to have it every movie, even one with apes?Nice cameo from Mr. Heston, and he gets that great line again!The battle scene at the end is a very bad rip-off of Braveheart/Gladiator, if you can't better it, leave it alone!As for the ending... well, you'll have to see the movie for yourself but rest assured, it doesn't work.

586,JP-20,Two hours of your life you wish you could get back.,1,30 July 2001,"Tim Burton can deny it all he wants, but Planet of the Apes (2001) really is a re-make... and a poor one at that.But even without comparing it to the original (which is far superior in too many ways to even begin listing here), I can honestly say that this movie left a bad taste in my mouth, and dreams in my head of how I would better spend the 6 dollars I wasted if I ever run into the studio exec who gave this film the green light and demanded that he pay me back.The movie drags on and on, and quickly overstays its welcome.  What few special effects are in the movie (make-up, set design, and stunts are totally separate categories, and should never be included under the heading of ""visual effects"") could have been much better.  The ape makeup is Oscar-quality good, and is perhaps the only thing in the movie worth noting.The story seems like someone accidently dropped the screenplay into a wood chipper, randomly taped pieces of it back together, and then tried to shoot the movie from that: The story leaves us wondering too many things that are not explained, and most of what is explained is downright laughable.  This movie is funny when it tries to be serious, and never funny when it tries to be humorous.  I was so bored watching this, I tried counting (and lost track of) all the plot holes, but the big one at the end completely made me lose faith in this movie as anything but a 99-cent corner store rental to watch with your friends during a night of serious drinking games.Excellent talent like Tim Roth, Paul Giamatti, Michael Clark Duncan, and Charlton Heston (and even the far less-tolerable, media flavors-of-the-month ""Marky Mark"" Wahlberg and Helena Bonham Carter, whose names we probably won't even remember in two years) are wasted in this contrived piece of junk.  I never once felt anything for any of the characters in the film... except maybe sympathy for being trapped in such a lousy movie.This film is extremely unrealistic (even assuming that you accept the idea that evolved apes have formed a civilization, which itself is an excellent premise for a film, but a premise that could have - SHOULD have - been handled much better than this movie does it).In a summer boxoffice where intelligent dinosaurs roam, a misunderstood ogar finds love, and deceased Egyptians seek vengence, Planet of the Apes (2001) brings nothing of interest or quality to the table.

About twenty minutes in the story arc was readily apparent, I figured out the time loop, and started to predict just about every major plot point before it happened.Then, there was the ending. At least what had come before had mostly made sense (allowing for some real puzzles, like why was a research ship obviously not built to land carrying horses?). In the original POTA, the ending not only managed to answer all the questions the rest the film posed while remaining completely consistent to the rest of the story, it was surprising because it wasn't an answer you expected. With this one the ending is unnecessary, as the story loop is already complete; totally inconsistent with the plot; and surprising only because it is so completely illogical. For me, the ending knocked a 'six' (mindless fun) down to a 'four' (just mindless).

Still, this movie not only violated real-world logic, it violated its own created logic, thus making it one of the messiest, frustrating movies I have seen, ever.  Mark Wahlberg was brilliant in Boogies Nights and Three Kings, but here he is unspectacular.  There is never any reason given why he stands out among all other humans as being special, though the story depends on Ms. Carter's interest in him.  He wears a white shirt, that is all.  Otherwise he is quiet, and does nothing out of the ordinary until later in the movie. Roth's Thade also takes an interest in Wahlberg's character, but again, without reason or logic.I believe Thade was the worst villian, ever.  He had no logical reason for wanting to wipe out the humans.  And this is where the story really breaks down.  The motivation is gone.  The apes have achieved supremacy, but yet there is still a need to kill all humans, who live like wild animals, and are thus harmless to the much more powerful and advanced apes.  Apes who ride horses (which the movie refuses to explain why they are on this planet, though it explains the origin of the Apes and Humans).  The logic comes to a complete break down when Thade's general turns on him, for no reason.  He has not seen anything to warrant his turn-around, and this unexpected and unlikely twist further diminishes the story.I thought I was going to vomit and retch, I desperately tried to plead with this movie to make more sense, that if you set up a fantasy world, you must abide by the rules of that world.  But it did not, and it caused my head to explode in complete pain.I give it a 3 out of 10, for costumes alone.

I don't even know where to begin with how disappointing this movie was.The action sequences were non-existent. Times when there should have been a good scene (like the horse-ride through the camp, which could have been really great) were very detached from the action, and consequently quite boring. Both the cinematography and the editing in such scenes were really, well, bad.The acting was stiff. I guess Burton was trying to do this whole thing where people actually moved like apes. But that was annoying. And they seem to have spent two or three times as much time and effort on that as they did on more typical (and effective) elements of acting--you know, emotions, character development, little things like that.The CGI was pretty transparent. When Marky Mark first lands and is standing in the forest looking around, for example, it's SO clear that he's in front of a bluescreen. Ugh. The makeup, on the other hand, was really well done.The score was stifled, I thought. But maybe it was just because it had nothing decent to accompany/illuminate.I expected more cool references to other movies. 2001 was a completely obvious allusion, for example, and they only made one (probably accidental) allusion to it--when Pericles is about to take off in the pod.

594,MinusMe,The blundering of Tim Burton strikes again,2,28 July 2001,"Let me first off say that I fell victim to the hype of this summer ape-fest. I had high hopes for this recent installment of what might have been Burton's genius manifesting itself again on screen.My proposed delight in seeing something harkening back to days of Sleepy Hollow and Batman, was dashed mercilessly on the rocks of apedom by this very ""Mars Attacks"" type movie.  The plot does not meander in the least bit for there is nowhere for it to go.  It drives on endlessly whilst my company and I waited anxiously for death or the credits, whichever came first.The acting is quite weak, the characters have no development at all and the only performance worth mention is that of Helena Bonham-Carter.  She plays the role of Ari with gusto, albeit there is no explanation of why she does anything she believes in doing.  The role of Attar had so much promise being played by Michael Clarke Duncan, but there is little to enjoy in his character's action or motives.Everyone loves the villain Tim Roth plays as Thade, but even I could not stomach the growling and snarling of a pointless villain for 2 hours.  His angst-filled dialogue and actions do nothing to advance the story or draw in the audience.There are numerous plot holes that would be passively filled in if the movie made any attempt at epicurian status, but it falls short of even the humor or action of a M.A.S.H re-run.  I would have rather watched a full day marathon of old C.H.i.P.S than see this movie again.  My limited edition lunch box and movie poster will be auctioned off to lowest common denominator to be sureI may not have said much about the movie itself, but there is little to comment apon.  Average effects, weak plot, poor writing, aimless ending. The first 45 minutes is like a walk through the life of apes, which are exactly like human in their mannerisms at the table, in company, and with the help, as we are.  Burton didn't need to bludgeon us to death with the similarity.Spoilers:Don't worry about spoilers because nothing I could say will make you enjoy the ending or plot line, with my robust affirmation or denial.  I can say there was one moment I enjoyed.  I truly enjoyed Charlton Heston's role as Thades father.  It was epic Heston.

Although direction wasn't the main problem with this film, the writing was 2-dimensional and atrocious to character development.  It relied heavily on apes screaming and tossing humans 20 feet in the air at the drop of a hat (not that I blame them; I would've done the same to Mark based on his wooden performance).  The battle scene was solved with such an element of corniness, the teeny boppers behind me with eyes glued to Mr. Wahlberg actually came to their senses and laughed.  This movie deserved better craftsmanship of plot vehicles.The only really redeeming thing about this film was a ""pretty good considering"" performance by Helena Bonham Carter, monkey makeup and all. She found a wry character and an interesting crush on Mark Wahlberg's character, handling everything that she came across with a fair amount of grace.All in all, the movie is worth checking out- once.  And on video.  It ranks higher than ""Starship Troopers"", but is certainly not the best thing that Tim Burton has laid claim to.",Planet of the Apes
596,CaesarMB,Very Well Done,9,28 July 2001,"Firstly, I think the original Ape movies are among the finest films ever produced.  The entire series is brilliant and I frequently watch them.  I'm not a big Sci-Fi fan, but those movies are just about the best representation of a mix-and-match between social satire and pure ""what if"" filmmaking that makes viewers question themselves.But anyways, the new Apes movie is no different.  The only thing that I really have issues with is the fact that some of the characters didn't really serve much purpose.  I don't know if they had all their lines cut out or what, but they don't really do a whole lot for the film.  Even Mark Wahlberg doesn't have a hell of a lot of dialogue.  But the film starts off much different than the first, and continues along that idea.  Most of the same themes are revisited, but skewed a bit.  The cinematography and makeup are both amazing.  This movie lived up to my expectations.  Go see this movie and judge for yourself.  I heard people coming out of the movie and saying that it sucked.  But, they probably have no basis for comparison if they haven't seen the originals.  I would give this movie 9/10.  Nearly perfect.",Planet of the Apes
597,HinxLinx,What Else Left Besides Makeup and Effect?,1,19 August 2001,"The biggest problem in the Planet of the Apes is that there are no deep feelings within the characters. Leo (Mark Wahlberg) does not care for any of human on the planet of the apes but himself. His goal was just get himself out of the planet as soon as possible. The director knows too well that he is not a hero, that's why he decided to add a scene of heroic rescue of a young boy in the movie. But it doesn't help to make him a better character but too obvious of an effort. Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) was a confusing idealistic character that she believes ape and human should be equally live together. But the movie fails to show her feeling when she watches human killing her own kind. Instead of an internal struggle inside her, she just blindly help human beat up her own people. And the third main character, Daena (Estella Warren) she was just a pretty figure follows Leo everywhere until the end. It's not her fault that she couldn't act, it's the movie doesn't give her any chance to act. It was a failure when Leo farewells to Ari and Daena in the end, there's nothing there to drive the audiences to any feeling. It's as if we watch some stranger say goodbyeThey could have brought up much more than this. They could use the scene when Ari heard about how human treat Apes on Earth (lock in the zoo) as an ironic moral in the movie. But they didn't go further Everyone agree that the makeup in this movie is awesome. There's no doubt about that. But beside the makeup, Tim Burton directed nothing shine in this remake of sci-fi classic.Everyone agree that the makeup in this movie is awesome, but beside the makeups, there's nothing shine in this remake of sci-fi classic.HinxLinx",Planet of the Apes
598,wolf_beautell,Another example of why Burton and Roth are so good,9,10 October 2001,"""Planet Of The Apes"" clearly has the ""Tim Burton"" seal on it, but unfortunately shows both imaginative and argumental development voids, which I blame not to bad directing, but to an irregular script, revised and changed thousands of times, due in part to the late entrance of Mr. Burton in the project. However, here I'm going to focus on the most positive points, rather than the negative ones.The Seal I talked before is present as in any of Burton's films. I mainly refer to the conception of the eccentric, delirious, out-of-this-world characters and to the Gothic-romantic, fantastic art direction this films radiates (I don't have to mention previous examples, but Batman, Nightmare and Edward are and will remain in our minds). Danny Elfman gives again the best of himself with a dynamic, at times majestic score where percussion leads.The apes are incredible, they work, they really rock in the show. Not only for Rick Baker's make-up masterpiece (which deserves not the nomination but the Academy Award NOW!), which gives them live and expression unlike 1968's sort of dummies, but because they are credible... and light years far more credible (and even more human) than the film's humans, except for Mr. Whalberg. The script said they had to talk this time.Can anybody tell me if they liked them? If they found their importance to their dialogues? And why Stella Warren hasn't been issued with the ""manikin"" label, as Jake Lloyd was in ""Episode 1""? The native roles show no interest and slow the rhythm of the movie.Now, returning to the apes, I have to talk about the real showman:Tim Roth as Thade. Exceptional. Histrionic. Aggressive. Cool. Evil portrayed as an ape. As the Ape General, he gets so very deep into the role that you end up thinking Roth, after all his extense and peculiar filmography, has finally turned crazy and really believes he's a monkey free in the stage. He is of the very few actors, along with Gary Oldman, Edward Norton and De Niro, which I consider as chameleons:ready to face any kind of role, however obscure, violent or psychologically strong they are.About the rest, I'm definitely getting in love with Helena Bonham Carter (another example of the ape's astonishing expressivity),and Mark Whalberg is fine as always. I liked his role, in comparison with Heston's in 1968, because he is a pure survivor who wants to go home with his friends and family (he just doesn't fit in that planet), while Charlton arrived there by accident and became a revolutionary hero. .To finish with, about the ending: perfect. I love it. And I love it because 1) It is different, it's of the few which make the viewer's imagination work, so anyone can figure out an explanation to the ending the way they want, 2) Its philosophy, the paradox it represents, which I'm not going to tell, and 3)It is extremely ""Burtonesque"".""Planet Of The Apes"" reflects again the style of an excellent director, but shows his vulnerability in works he doesn't personally project (remember the initial idea came from James Cameron), in which a studio, and not himself, determines most of the finished work. However, an entertaining film, recommended to any sci-fi lover. And an advice: read the original book by Pierre Boulle for another view of the story... Vote --- 8/10",Planet of the Apes
599,Lisandro Berenguer-Grassi,Disappointing,6,28 July 2001,"Tim Burton has shown many things in his life as a filmmaker: a knack for gloomy atmosphere; a real sense of empathy for the lonely and different ones; a wicked sense of humor; he's even shown that he can play by the rules of the studios, delivering not only once but twice, even making a sequel and pulling it off.Sadly, none of that shows in ""Planet..."". The problem does not lie in the fact that they tamper with the story from the first film. As they've made clear, the producers and director are not trying to remake a classic, but use it (and the book it originated from) as a stepping stone to build the new movie, so their deviations from the original would not be a problem... if they were good.Burton doesn't have a good starting point: the script is very, very bad, your usual Hollywood-esque pastiche of old lines with (supposedly) new parallelisms and not-very-bright pop culture references. All that would be interesting if something happened, along the story, to the characters. Sadly, it is not so: the astronaut, the good apes and the pretty girl remain the same (that is, totally uninteresting) throughout the movie. Even the bad apes are not really changed, as the ending goes. And let's not even start with the inconsistencies...This is by far Burton worse movie ever, light years away from his classics. His trademarks barely show: we don't care about what happens with the characters at all, the sets lack the grandeur that we've learn to love and expect (""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Batman"" come to mind) and his ""wicked sense of humor"" is limited to changing classic lines from being spoken by humans to simian mouths.The acting is really bland, too. Mark Wahlberg has proven that he can act. But he wanders through ""Planet..."" with his best ""Keanu-I-don't-know-what-the-heck-is-going-on-Reeves"" look on. And Stella Warren... well, she IS pretty. Helena Bonham-Carter is as boring as usual and Tim Roth has lots of fun but is well below some of his best movies.The summing up of all of this is in one word: disappointment. Not from what it is (even at this point the movie can be seen if one has enough popcorn and soda) but from what it could had been with the talent implied. And yes, the make-up is awesome and Heston's cameo is really cool, but somehow they are not sufficient to save a picture from being just another fancy way of wasting your time and your money.",Planet of the Apes

Blah, Blah, Blah.This new ""Planet Of The Apes"" is probably the most-hyped and most-anticipated summer release for 2001. You've got extremely dark and stylish director Tim Burton paired back up with scoring buddy Danny Elfman. Cool ape costumes and Marky Mark out in front. How could any of this go wrong you ask? Well, it does.Now, don't get me wrong, I did like this movie. That was until the last ten minutes of the film. The ending is so ridiculous that it cause the rest of the movie to make NO SENSE at all. The ending is terrible and I cannot express enough how much sense it does not make! I'm not going to give anything away, but you aren't missing anything life-changing. The movie was good, except for this contrived and senseless plot twist that is completely tacked-on.Besides the fact that the movie ends up not making any sense after it was on the right track, the musical score, I hear, had to be completely redone mere days before release. So, the new score has no resemblance of Danny Elfman at all. It's your generic action movie score. Thanks, studio executives! That's why you guys collect the money to back the film and you leave the movie-making to the movie makers! What an original concept.I don't need to go into the story or the plot, you know it. The only thing you don't know about is the new ending, which causes the whole movie to be worthless. Oh, and did I mention that there is no resemblance of Tim Burton's style anywhere?

I'd hoped Tim Burton would bring the same clarity of vision he brought to Sleepy Hollow, Ed Wood and even the first Batman.  Instead, he gave us the second Batman: some great visuals, a few strong archetypes and a terrible script.  Tim Roth as the feral chihuahua was ridiculously over-the-top and not in a good way.  Perhaps Rick Baker should've stopped punching Estella Warren in the mouth long enough to find her motivation.  Or at least a personality.  This was a straight-ahead, cliched escape movie, with no pause for character development.  The ending wasn't as bad as many suggest and is definitely feasible if you consider that Thade's ultimate fate is left up in the air.  It'll take some explaining but it's possible.  All in all, I'm hoping Burton will take a pass on the sequel and let someone with stronger STORYTELLING skills take over.  NOTE TO JOEL SCHUMACHER: THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU!",Planet of the Apes

All of that aside though, this is one damned good movie.  The special effects and make-up look fantastic.  Each ape actually looks different from each other one, and they all move like you would expect an ape/human hybrid to move. The acting is great, especially Tim Roth.  His character Thade is one of my favorite parts of this entire movie.  I have to say I think that the only real weak link is Mark Wahlberg.  I usually like Marky Mark too, but this time his performance seems to fall a little flat.  I know alot of people probably aren't going to like this one.  Some people will mistake certain aspects as being corny, but that can be said about just about every piece of Science Fiction in existence.  The end is good, maybe not as good as the beginning of the original, but good nonetheless.  Overall I enjoyed this film a great deal and recommend it to all.",Planet of the Apes
611,halderic,A Real Disappointment,2,31 July 2001,"Tim Burton, known for his visual style, delivers yet again with Planet Of The Apes (POTA), but the film is lacking in virtually every other aspect, from the thinly drawn characters, the barely-there script, to the shockingly bad/incomphensible ending. I'll start first with the character development. There is none. Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg)is so one dimensional that at no point did i care if he ever got off the planet and back to, well, whatever and whomever. His entire time is spent throwing out cliched lines instead of being awed, inspired, terrified, or confused of his surroundings. Any emotion would have worked. As for the humans who live on the planet, I'm not sure what their problem was, they werent savages, they outnumbered the apes supposedly, they could communicate at the same level as the apes (unlike the original movie), so why exactly were they living in the hills scared for their lives. Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) and General Thade (Tim Roth) are by far the most interesting, and well acted, characters.  Miss Carter brings a sensual aspect to her character that is very appealing (yes, i know shes playing a simian, but it doesnt seem to matter). While Mr Roth plays Thade deliciously evil and cunning, and his ape-like movements are a sight to see.I was especially disappointed with the relationship between Leo, Ari and Daena (played by model Estella Warren, who is way to beautiful here to pull off a role as a jungle woman). There are obvious hints of attraction between Ari and Leo, yet these scenes go absolutely nowhere in developing the awkwardness of it all. The script doesnt go beyond yearning glances, which is a shame. The last half hour of the movie was basically the standard action plot. The movie builds up to an inevitable war between the humans and the apes, with Leo devising this absurd plan to stun the first ranks (out of thousands of CGI created apes) with the remnants of his old ships ignited fuel tanks. Never mind the fact this would only eliminate maybe 5 percent of the total forces they are up against. The final conflict is never exciting, but then how could it be when we have no emotional investment in the characters.I will not discuss the ""surprise"" ending, except to say not only is it not surprising, it doesnt make sense, and i defy anyone to explain it.In fact, i read an interview with the higher-ups involved in this fiasco, and they revealed that the ending isnt supposed to make sense, its supposed to leave the viewer confused and guessing. Well, thats just what i want after watching this for two hours, and ending that insults the viewers intelligence by admitting ""we didnt even care enough ourselves to give you a plausible ending."" Thank you Hollywood. And thank you Tim Burton, for reminding us once more that classics should be left alone and time honored. If you're going to remake a movie, remake a bad movie. In fact, remake this remake.",Planet of the Apes
612,thehockeyczar,"""Damn Them All to Hell !""",8,2 August 2001,"The new installment to the ""Planet of the Apes"" saga is a skillfully made film.  It combines a new adaptation to the familiar story of the original. However, it is by no means a remake.  The new movie has some very striking similarities, but is a new and different film.  This ""Planet of the Apes"" uses enough of the now famous content, that made the original great, to sell it to the older fans, as well as a new story to win over a younger generation which would not properly understand the social gripping message of the 60's version.  This film is clearly Tim Burton's best work.  The cast does a very good job, especially considering all of the makeup.  Charlton Heston steals the show as Gen. Thade's father, proving once again that no one does a ""Planet of the Apes"" film like Mr. Heston. Despite the overall excellent nature of this film, it is flawed in one major aspect.  This film has no star quality.  No offense to Mark Wahlberg, but he is not capable of carrying a summer blockbuster by himself.  Mr. Wahlberg is a fine up and coming actor, but he has not yet reached the point in his career (and maybe never will) where he can open a film by himself, let alone a major film such as ""Planet of the Apes"".  Wahlberg tries his best to play the reluctant hero, but the key word is ""tries"".  He lacks the major presence that Charlton Heston provided in the original.  Wahlberg is unable to sell himself as an ""action star"".  His lines are not believable, and are quite commonplace.  In order for such a film to have been properly done it would have required a big time action star.  That star could only have been Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose name was mentioned for the Wahlberg role. His presence in the film would have made a big summer hit into a mega summer blockbuster.  Just imagine Arnold delievering the lines ""I'll be back..you dirty apes!"" If the casting directors have any sense they will make sure that Arnold is back when they make the sequel. Despite all of this it was still a very entertaining film. 3.5 out of 4 stars.",Planet of the Apes
613,salfamily,Yawn,4,27 July 2001,"Yet another Hollywood attempt at cashing in on a proven franchise, Tim Burton's supposed ""re-imagining"" of the 1968 sci-fi classic Planet of the Apes is a dreadfully dull, meandering affair, which consistently fails to engage the viewer on any meaningful level. Sure, it tries to live up to the lofty social-political commentary of the original, but here there's nothing to back it up-- the plot is shallow, the dialogue lame and the characters are so underdeveloped we can hardly recall their names.
For example, near the end of the film, a human boy stands up to his ape oppressors in what I assume was meant to be a moving moment. But it has little impact because the character has never been properly introduced; the scene is the first in which he figures prominently. Similarly, two Ape generals square off at one point in what is clearly intended as a battle between two giants. But the set-up for their feud is so scant (the bland line of dialogue inserted earlier in the film) that the pay-off is virtually non-existent. They fight, one wins...whoopee.Characters like these appear throughout the film. The lead female human seems to exist solely for her cleavage; Kris Kirstofferson appears as a human male who does almost nothing and who, like his counterparts mentioned above, engages in a Big Moment that fails to have any impact. It's hard to feel bad for human slaves who are this dull. As for the apes, they're so one-dimensional they're better described as types than as actual characters. Most notably, there's the evil general (played with wonderful vitriol by Tim Roth), who seems to simply hate all humans, period. His behavior is entirely one-note: he stomps about, growls and acts viciously at every opportunity, and almost always without sufficient motivation. As a villain he's about as interesting as Skeletor was in the old He-Man cartoon. Likewise, Helena Bonham Carter's character, an ape with a soft spot for humans, is little more than a caricature of good will.Finally, the lead character, played by Mark Wahlberg, walks through the film in an apparent daze. Never does he seem amazed by this monkey planet he's landed on, nor does he appear distraught by the predicament in which he's found himself. Charlton Heston's lead character in the original POTA film may have been over-the-top in places, but he at least struck the right notes of paranoia, amazement and outrage. By comparison, Wahlberg seems drugged; and this is a problem because we're supposed to be seeing this world, at least in part, through his eyes. Recall the introductory portions of the original POTA, in which the team of wayward astronauts slowly makes their way into Ape territory. Their journey becomes stranger and stranger as they encounter human skins, a tribe of primitive humanoids, and finally the fully-clothed warrior apes. Never does this new film approach this level of horror and amazement. Instead, its protagonist runs through its world like a blip in a video game. And that's a shame.On the good side, Rick Baker's makeup is, on the whole, extraordinary; Danny Elfman's score is rich and bombastic; and the physicality of the ape characters' performances are fun in that they are much more simian in nature than those featured in the 1968 original. But even fans of Tim Burton will have a hard time finding his personal stamp on this film.
And what of the surprise ending? It's there, and it's fun. But it feels tacked on and most viewers will probably figure it out a minute or so before it actually happens.If you really want to enjoy this movie, go buy the action figures. That's the point, right?",Planet of the Apes
614,DTOdlum,Edward Scissorhands trip to Planet of the Apes,8,4 August 2001,"I have been so often disappointed in the past going into movies with high expectations: Indianna Jones and the Last Crusade, Phantom Menance, Batman, to name a few.  So I suppose my learned skepticism somewhat saved Planet of the Apes for me.  I had absolutely no expectations for this film, after having enjoyed the first one so much.  And of course, the new version does not live up to the original.  The original was filled with layers of political, racial, and sociological themes; and it had an incredible ending.  And who can match the tortured, almost humorous essence of Heston.  Oh, and it was fun too. 
But the greatness of the original does not make the new version a bad movie. In fact, it was in my opinion quite an enjoyable movie.  It surpasses the original in terms of its visual effects. While the theme/story is more simplistic, it is very well told; it moves very fast and fluidly, yet is not so packed with chaotic action (see Armageddon) that it does not allow for slower moments that can be saviored.  For example, there is a great scene with Heston in a cameo.  I wonder if he knew what he was saying when he said it: humans are deceptive and dangerous and are even more so because they have guns; beware of them?  Not exactly the NRA's mantra.  Anyways, he had a great cameo.  There are many other humorous moments as well.  Basically, the movie did not take itself seriously.  It tipped its hat to the original without trying to mimick its feel.  It is obvious Burton wanted to have some fun with this movie, paying tribute to the original while at the same time trying to give this movie its own unique perspective.  I believe he succeeded and I believe that that is the movie's saving grace.",Planet of the Apes

My number one pet peeve in a movie is when a character does something that makes no sense, but gets the writer out of a jam.  This movie is filled with that kind of action.The mixed metaphors of animal rights and civil rights, where humans fill each role as the script demands, are full of cliches, ultimately making this B-O-R-I-N-G. And while I like much of Tim Burton's sense of humor, the over-the-top jokieness here was the saddest, right down to a female ape complaining of a 'bad hair day'--Yuk yuk yuk.Icing on the cake was the 'twist' ending, which would have been cool HAD IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY BEFORE IT.

616,ferryman-999,What a waste of time and money. Give this one a miss.,1,2 September 2001,"***This review contains spoilers.***  You have been warned.I gave this film a 2 out of 10 which means it wasn't *entirely* bad: some of the make-up was reasonable and the music didn't make me ill.  That's it for the film's redeeming features.As for the awful bits, where do I start?  Let's see:(1) An ultra-politically correct message hangs round this film like a 52,000 ton battleship.  We're supposed to bring away the message 'Let's all live together in a nice, warm, and fuzzy multicultural society in which each individual has his own special little contribution to make, etc, etc'.  If I wanted to hear such a message, I would read the PC rubbish the UK government puts out.  If the apes and humans have to all 'sing from the same hymn sheet', who will determine what the music and words of that hymn are?  Who dictates what is in and what is out in this 'multicultural blending'? Living in so-called harmony is *NOT* some 'intuitive, natural' thing -- someone is going to lead, lots of someones are going to follow and that is just the way things are -- and any film that ignores this is just pushing another insipid 'feel-good' fairy story.(2) I object to the insults to men.  Both the woman scientist who is in charge of the genetically-modified apes on the ship and Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), the woman-ape 'human rights' activist, make comments about men either being insensitive or making women miserable.  It's a sure bet that no such comments would have been allowed if they were to have been made about women.  When is Hollywood going to give up its love affair with feminism? When is it going to see that films that contain such insulting material drive men and women -- and I am a woman -- away?(3) The plot, such as it was is a mish-mash.  This film could have gone the straight-forward science fiction route, or gone down the path of satire, but instead, it is neither one nor the other.  All that happens is that the pilot, Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), goes from one pointless bit of so-called action to another.  The plot is also riddled with illogic. Certainly I don't expect films to be completely logical or even mostly so, but I do expect them to have at least a passing acquaintance with logic. How in the blue blazes did horses get on the planet?  If the apes are so non-technological, how did they get the armour they wear and how do they manage to build houses and other things?  How did the apes even manage to dominate the planet if they are terrified of water?(4) The ending is idiotic.  Yes, I know there are x number of possible explanations for Davidson going back in time to Earth to find an 'Ape' Lincoln statue and a world populated by apes, but so what?  Certainly I don't want a film to tell me everything -- I want to read between the lines -- but I want some lines, just a few, between which to read.  It is clear this 'surprise' ending was just tacked on for the shock effect.    It didn't even shock me, though, it just bored me.(5) The acting was boring, boring, boring.  Does anyone ever bother to portray a character these days, instead of a few traits labelled 'hero' and 'villain'?  The human characters, including Davidson, haven't even the depth and presence of onion skin paper.  The apes are just plain silly, and that includes General Thade (Tim Roth).  So what if the make-up makes the men look like apes of some sort?  It takes acting to make a man into an ape, and acting was clearly beyond anyone in this film.(6) The atmosphere was as bland as low-quality white bread (the type sold so that the masses can always afford something that at least looks bread-like). Part of this is down to the sets, which were surprisingly uninteresting and even minimalist for such a big budget film.  Funny thing is that in the low-budget European films of the sixties and early seventies, the sets, although clearly crude, managed to convey a wonderful sense of time and place.  It is clear that today's sets are just bad money thrown after a lack of imagination.(7) The 'action' sequences were boring.  What I wouldn't give to see a film with the flair for violence that the Spaghetti Westerns had.  If there's a fight, I want to see some blood, some guts, some death and pain.  The fight sequence at the end looked as if the humans and apes were just slugging it out in a Saturday night pub fight, and a nice, mannerly fight at that. Grown chimpanzees are said to be strong enough to rip a human's arm out of its socket.  That would have made a good scene.  And why in the world did Davidson wait until after the apes started recovering from the effects of the explosion to tell the humans to go out kill them?  The whole point of stunning your enemy is so that you can slit his throat while he is helpless. Doesn't anyone know anything about fighting dirty these days?This list isn't comprehensive: I almost certainly have left out other reprehensible bits.  I can't be bothered, however, to make a complete list. Let's face it, this film is a waste of time and money.",Planet of the Apes
617,njoseph-1,I was into this film,8,30 July 2001,The story behind Planet Of The Apes is such a great one that it is almost impossible to mess it up. This new version of the film thankfully does not do that. I liked the original and I like this one as well. It adds a lot of special effects to an already great story to create something that I would want to experience again.,Planet of the Apes

619,starlight-1,too fast!,1,28 July 2001,"Does this movie MOVE! Don't blink or you might miss - the plot? You didn't miss it, it really was that short.Here's a tip off for a bad script: If you see more than one name in the writing credit, WATCH OUT!There are alot of reviews of this blockbuster, so I will just ask a few questions which you could answer as you watch the film:Was Michael Clarke Duncan was the only ape that sort of looked like himself? (A nice touch that George Lucas did in the Phantom Meanace).Did you catch the meaning of CALIMA? CAution LIve ANimals, easy to miss!If the apes wanted no one to go to CALIMA, why was the it so poorly protected?If it was the center of their universe for thousands of years and so easy to reach, why were there no apes AT ALL there? Wouldn't they come to ""worship"" at least?How come Davidson all of a sudden cares about this kid? Just exactly what was the point of having him stay behind the ship? Who was the kid? What the heck was going on there?Did you care at all when Kris Kristofferson got killed? Nope!
Did you care a little when a couple of guys in Davidson's original band got iced? Only a little.What was the point (from the writer's point of few) of taking out the (cool) gun? He brought back later, anyway. With two guns, that might have been fun. One guy shooting up himself was just stupid, didn't you think?Just exactly where did all the aps and all the humans come from? I mean, seriously, would the humans live so close to the apes if they were rounding them up as pets and slaves? Give me a break! I'd have found a better neighborhood.  (On top of that, there's a little problem of genetic diversity here of there were no natural apes and humans on this planet in the first place. But, we'll give Tim poetic license on that).So, the GOD arrives, literally out of the sky in a space ship. NO ONE is scared of this technology AT ALL. They recognize this is a prophecy come true yet they have NO PROBLEM letting the UNCLEAN Davidson walk right up to their DEITY.  Then, they proceed to beat the daylights out of the diety nearly kill him.  (I guess that answers why no one was worshiping). Question: Is there a story here or not? No!Would a good alternate title be ""Crouching Humans, Hidden Monkeys?""Who exactly would have the Lincoln-esq Thade have liberated to get the statue? I think it might have been humans, don't you?

620,ryanbsmith,remake or re-creation... weak either way,4,1 August 2001,"Crash landing... capture... escape... battle... the end.  Intricate plot isn't it?  Burton decides to sidestep any meaningful themes in this film, and that's a shame.  There are a dozen social issues that could have been examined in the movie, but apparently Burton was in a hurry to get to the Braveheart-style Ape vs. Human battle.  As for the acting: Wahlberg was a jerk, Roth was too dramatic, Michael Clarke Duncan was bland, and Estella Warren hardly said a word.  The only worthwhile performance was from Helena Bonham Carter.  As for the ending, it's sad that Burton felt he had to match (or top) the original by throwing in that outrageous ending.  He fell short by a longshot.  I suppose the movie was entertaining if you didn't compare it to the original... but can you really watch it without comparing?",Planet of the Apes

622,DAS-1,Terrible. Special Effects don't make a good movie.,1,12 August 2001,"I left the theatre wondering what sort of opinion the makers of this film must have of the audience.  Do they think we're stupid?  Do they think we will accept anything they put on the screen just because it has special effects?  What was the point of making this film?Despite being very courageous to even attempt re-making such a popular and well known movie, the perpetrators of this waste of time and effort seem to have forgotten some of the cardinal rules of movie making.  It's great to have special effects and lots of make-up artists working for you but a decent screenplay and some talented actors might have helped, too.  The actors in this debacle were one dimensional, at best, with the most believable character being that of Pericles.  There was little if any development of the characters and there was no  hint of the messages found in the original.The worst part of all of this is that the altered ending of the movie opens up the opportunity for a sequel.  If it gets made, that's one movie I won't be spending time or money seeing.In summary, this is a thoroughly forgettable movie that deserves no more than the score I gave it: 1/10",Planet of the Apes

The lifelike and varied ape makeup, combined with the effort that has gone into making the apes... well, apes, and more individual than the oppressed humans can manage to be, makes their society utterly believable. Helena Bonham Carter delicately brings out the character of Ari, shewing us that a full face prosthesis need not handicap a great actress, and Tim Roth camps it up completely as Thade (which you may not think is a good point).On to the bad parts. Mark Wahlberg does nothing to arouse my sympathy, or indeed interest. It doesn't help that his character is halfway between James T Kirk and Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz, and does not develop at all throughout the film. The plot is stupid, ridiculous and yet utterly predictable, and forces characters to act unrealistically. The eventual resolution is contrived and unsatisfying, it gives no extra depth to anything, in fact, it seems to be the only way the writers could think of to finish off the plot. The ending is tacked-on and inconsistent.I would recommend avoiding this film unless you really have nothing better to do, and no expectations of intelligence. But stylistically it's worth something, and Helena Bonham Carter's performance is worth adding a couple of marks, so reluctantly, i give it 4 out of 10.",Planet of the Apes

the movie was very low on character developments, i can hardly remember any names save Leo, the main hero, and some 2-3 more. one thing that bugs me a lot is the female apes. the way they're portrayed is simply.. disturbing.. i dunno maybe it's just me. and the human blonde babe! she's obviously being paid for simply walking around in that jungle outfit and looking worried (and pretty at the same time). she's hot, though. and mark wahlberg is just plain bad here. i like him in some other movies like three kings, but here he just dont have that hero feel.the script needed a lot of work, with lots of plot holes (why did/didn't he do this?/ why does this happen when that doesn't?). but while everyone bitches about the ending, i kinda like it, as it finally grabbed my attention, there, right at the end of the flick.disappointing movie, really.",Planet of the Apes

The first Apes movie spawned 4 sequels that got worse with every film, If this one is followed by one or more sequels I really hope these sequels can beat the sequels to the original ones. Go out to the video store and rent them both, you will know what I mean, the original is super(ior), the ""remake"" is not bad.",Planet of the Apes
626,techkid1990,The reason why I don't like Tim Burton anymore,2,2 February 2011,"Before seeing this film, I was a fan of Tim Burton's famous work such as Beetle juice, Batman, Edward Scissor hands, and Mars Attacks! When I learned that this move was directed by him (I didn't see the film until 3 years after it came out), I was dying to see it. I had watched the 1968 original and was familiar with the original novel. After seeing it, in all honesty it was the biggest waste of garbage I had ever seen. Oh sure the make up and special effects were good, they always are, that's why they spend so much time working on that stuff rather than writing a good plot or developing characters. The dialogue was cheap and the acting was more wood than a redwood tree! Mark Wahlburg's acting was so out of place for this film, throughout the entire film, he really shows no emotion and when he does it's only for a split second. I wasn't expecting something like that of Charleston Heston's epic role in the original (heck his role in this film was only minor yet beats the crap out of the rest of the cast), but I'd at least expect some effort to be put in it. All the characters really just filled out the stereotypical roles seen in the real world today from the war mongering general, the peaceful animal loving hippie, the rebellious doubtful sergeant, the ignorant leaders, the royal waitress, and the bumbling idiots the humans. The plot was as straight forward as a derailed train. Everything was just hoping around and far fetched even for a movie like this. It is basically this, guy lands on planet, gets caged, frees a bunch of prisoners, goes through a chase in the desert, rounds up prisoners, rebels, uses rocket buried in the sand for centuries to blast away charging army. Than monkey comes from the sky and everyone is best friends with each other. h yeah, Apes can not swim, because... well that's never explained. And the end was the worst attempt at a twist I have ever seen. And it's bad when the director in the commentary couldn't even make heads or tails out of it. I was relieved when the end credits came. That was the last Tim Burton film I have seen and since seeing this utter failure I avoid all his films, even the ones I liked before. If you don't want to take my word for it, fine, but don't blame me for wasting your time with this sad excuse for a movie.",Planet of the Apes

Everything about it was half-assed. I doubt this review will be published, but it is worth writing 10 lines just to express how much I think this crappy movie sucked. IMO, Wahlberg is a crappy actor and must've slept with producers to get into the movies. I've always thought Helena Bonham Carter was somewhat overrated, but her performance in this movie verified it for me.

It was, I believe, very well acted and filmed, and I believe that the plot was basically good.

We waited to see this at the 10:20 showing-so maybe I expected too much or was tired. Having said that... The movie was so-so at best. The makeup was phenomenal as were the special effects. The apes were BRUTAL. Exceedingly so. This is one PG-13 movie that our girls will not go see for a long while. We carefully screen ""older"" movies and deem some appropriate-this is not one of those. The original was so fantastic-perhaps it was too good to ever improve upon. This version did stick closer to the original book story, however. Lastly, the ending was horrible.

Compared to the original film the ape effects are great, and actually make you feel that you are seeing human sized apes, and not some guy in a monkey suit. A+However all looks and no plot make for a bad film. The film starts of promisingly enough, but one we get to the planet of the apes it is as if the scriptwriters figured just shooting scenes of flying apes and a ragtag group of humans trying to escape (Hmmm sounds like something from the Wizard of Oz) would be enough. F-One feels sorry for the cast for having to muddle their way through this script, but then cast is not up to the task of even handling this script. Only Tim Roth as the evil General Thade turns in a great menacing performance, and winds up out acting the rest of the cast. D (Roth A+)And let's no even talk about the ending! Anyone who has watched any sci-fi films involving wormholes, etc, must have seen where this film was going from the opening few minutes.

Unfortunately, I was very much unimpressed with what I viewed. The special effects were great, the scenery was realistic, and the cast seemed to be very talented (opinion not based on this movie). However, they were lacking in one MAJOR department: the script! As someone said before, I agree that you and a bunch of your friends could have written a better screenplay for the movie than these talented, well-paid writers did.There were many interesting directions this movie *could* have taken and didn't. I noticed that in the beginning of the movie, the woman scientist on the spaceship mentions that with chimps the female is dominant sexually. Of course, this led me to think; `What an interesting twist to the movie! The female apes could be really domineering instead of the males!' But instead the comment seemed to hold no relevancy to the rest of the film whatsoever! It turns out there were hardly any female apes at all, and those were hardly very aggressive.Maybe I shouldn't have gone to see the movie with such high hopes for a great flick, but I did. I am officially insulted at spending good money on a film that seemed to have lots of possibility but no delivery. For those of you who haven't seen the movie and plan to, my advice to you is to go into the movie with lowered expectations and maybe you'll appreciate it more than I did.5 out of 10",Planet of the Apes

Although the two films are about future human interplanetary adventures, ""Planet of the Apes"" stresses more on human compassion for and understanding of other living creatures. The film is also a good satire on men's foolhardy behavior to launch nuclear wars that could annihilate everything on earth only to find that, in the end, they would be ruled by ""wiser-than-human"" apes.

635,steelman-5,Great film. I have a few quibbles,9,2 August 2001,"Taking this movie for its own merits instead of needless comparison to the original, I thought it was quite good. As many have said, the acting (at least of the apes) was astonishing. The villain chimp (Tim Roth) and Ari the sensitive chimp (Helena Bonham Carter) were amazing, both the acting and the technology to support the believability. Yes, the ending was strange and didn't follow logically whereas for the most part the rest of the movie was logically self-consistent. However, it was a good ending and I'm willing to reserve judgment to see how they develop it in the next film. My few quibbles with the movie were these: * I didn't see any gorillas on the space station and such large apes seem entirely inappropriate to the space mission, so where did the gorilla breeding stock come from? * I realize the apes are stronger than humans, especially the gorillas, but when they hit someone, the impact of the punch was ridiculous even considering their strength. If you could hit as hard as 5 Mike Tyson's on his best punch, you couldn't even come close to getting the target rocketing through the air like they did. And if you hit that hard, it would seem to be instant death but wasn't in the movie. I know, I know, Hollywood needs to really exaggerate. * The year was something like 2032 that it all began, right? Well, there is no way the world will even be close technologically and space achievement in 31 years. Transportation pods smaller than a compact car that can land on an earthlike planet and launch again? The apes genetically engineered to be very smart? The military has a massive space station?                This would be more believable in 2132. Enjoy, Jon",Planet of the Apes

He gives the moral a 180 and suddenly man is the utmost being and technology is his savior.  It just goes to show how self centered and over confident we have all become.For the record, even if there was no original Planet of the Apes, this would still be a worthless movie.

637,firejack007,An entertaining but inconsistant film,6,30 July 2001,"After watching this film, you appreciate the films of the past that so many have tried to redo. There really not a lot of action in this film except for some fight scenes toward the latter half of the movie. Looking back at the original Planet of the Apes, you could see where there was a definate plot and goal. This remake doesn't have that cohesion. It does work well with the relationship between Whalberg and Carter. But the relationship between Warren and Whalberg develops too quick after the demise of Kristofferson. In that type of primitive society, Kristofferson could be father or husband but we don't know because Warren just says ""my family"". It's too obvious that the writers used her as competition for Carter. In fact you really see no reason for Kristofferson to even be in the movie. Whalberg's involvement with the primitive humans comes too quickly also. It's like they cut out a part where Whalberg should find out what this planet is for the sake of the length of the movie. The fight scenes seem inconsistant. One minute an ape kills a human with one blow but our hero (Whalberg) takes several blows and falls. But somehow,again, Whalberg maintains the common sense he has in many of his movies. Somehow through all his movies, writers give him lines that make him act (or react) realisticly. While the others have lines and actions that don't seem be what it would be if it was real, Whalberg comes in and acts like the only one sensible or realisitic being. (as though he walked from the seats into the film) So much so that when we see him in the end....an ending that makes absolutely no sense or connection with what we just saw in the rest of the movie, the look on his face is as though he thinking, ""what kind of stupid ending is this to a movie"" right on the screen.*see more in goofs for inconsistant content",Planet of the Apes

Was I the only one (on this planet) that noticed that the only living things on this planet were humans, apes and horses?  Hello!  Where did the horses come from?  Why no fish in the swamp where the shuttle crashed?  Why no bugs?  Why no birds?  Did I miss something?  Do I need to see this movie again?

Sorry, but it stinks!",Planet of the Apes
640,vampireangel,This movie with great potential was ruined by the ending and lack of development of characters...,1,31 July 2001,"First of all, this movie is not as bad as a lot of the reviews make it out to be.  Second, it didn't bore me and I was actually pretty content with the film until the last 10 min.SPOILER**** When the chimp landed on the planet during the ""big final battle""  I just knew that this film was spiraling down, and in my opinion it did.Mostly everyone knows the story of this movie regardless if they've seen it or not.  It's about a human pilot Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) who crash lands on a planet ruled by apes a few thousand years in the future and tries to escape because the living conditions of humans there are very poor due to the tyranny of the apes.  This simple plot I think would have made for a good movie.  Also, I'd like to mention that I haven't seen the original Planet of the Apes so I'm making no comparison.  However, what ruined this movie was the fact that there were too many plot holes.  A big part about enjoying a movie is to understand the story and when a movie is presented with a plot-holed story-line, you'll be spending a lot of time wondering instead of letting yourself enjoy the film.Anyway, the plot summary seems very simple, yet the movie is cluttered with so many different things going on.  This proves to be a big obstacle for portraying the development of the characters.  This was unfortunate because I believed that the characters were worth relating to, especially Daena (Estella Warren).  Actually, now that I think of it, she had about 5 lines in the film, other than that all she had to do was pose, and by the time of her last scene, I still didn't know her name.Another thing that bothered me about the film was the somewhat love-triangle between Leo, Ari, and Daena.  Throughout the movie, it was so obvious that a romance between Leo and Daena would've worked well, but they didn't even have a conversation together.  As for putting Ari in this equation it was just a bad idea because why would Leo even give Ari a second thought as a love interest when he has the HUMAN Daena right in front of him.  It was clear from the beginning that Daena was smitten with Leo, yet he doesn't even notice because he's too busy with trying to get off the planet which is understandable, but I think it would have been good for the film if Leo and Daena had connected emotionally.  First of all, Estella Warren who I think has enormous potential would have had a better role.  She could have been sort of the woman behind the great man, helping him believe in himself and just being there for him.  They really wasted the character of Daena in my opinion.  It's also unfair for others to criticize Estella Warren's acting, I mean how much better could she have been with the script she was given?Thade, annoyed me after a while because he sneered and growled too much. However, overall I didn't think Tim Roth did such a bad job.
I've mentioned how Daena's character was wasted, well actually all the human characters weren't much for the plot.  Karubi, Daena's father had absolutely no relevence to the film.  Birn (Luke Eberl the boy) was a waste of screen space, and then they try to make him important during the end of the film, but that falls through because his character didn't develop just like everyone else.SPOILER*** Attar's (Michael Clarke Duncan) conversion at the end of the film was also unbelievable.  It's also hard to believe that when Thade gets stuck in the ship and starts shooting off his gun, that he didn't get hit at all even though there were like 7 bullets ricocheing off the tiny room at the same time.Finally, the ending.  A movie's ending can make it or break it.  This movie's ending broke it.  It left far too many questions unanswered, but not only that, it didn't make any sense AT ALL!  I have a feeling that the movie makers only put this ending in so that people will hear through word of mouth about this twist ending and make them want to see it.  It's nothing but a money making sham which unfortunately is working.  It leaves room for so many different types of sequels, what bothers me is that it doesn't seem to leave room for most of the characters to return for the sequel (eg. Daena, Ari...).Well, this movie was a feast for the eyes, it's visually a masterpiece, but unfortunately visuals aren't enough to make a great movie, a story and characters one can relate to are still the key and unfortunately this movie lacked this.  It's definitely a movie worth a look at, just not at the price of today's cinema admission.",Planet of the Apes
641,nnchung,Nothing Special......1968 Apes were better period.,6,29 July 2001,"Honestly, my expectations for this movie diminished right after I watched 2001 version of the ""Apes."" I thought that Tim Burton would bring something fantastic but it was a total failure.....Not as much passion inputed as an old ""Planet of the apes."" I wasn't fully disappointed with the special effects but I was well disappointed with the story lines and the visual content of the film. Apes didn't look as real as the 1968 Ape.I would just like to say that this movie is for an entertainment, not for an enlightenment of the hidden meanings and themes behind the film. If you just want to relax and watch the film off the curiosity then this film is a perfect feature. However, if you are a person who wants to be in awe of unexpected glimpse and extraordinary story lines, then either read the novel or watch the 1968 version of ""The planet of the Apes."" I personally didn't enjoy 2001 version of ""The planet of the Apes."" 6.3/10 I would give.",Planet of the Apes
642,grefly73,Steaming pile.,4,8 October 2002,"I loved the original.  It had a lot more to it than a simple sci-fi flick. Everyone agrees with that.  Did I expect this remake to be up to the same level?  No.  I went in with a fresh perspective, letting the movie stand on its own.  What a mistake that was.One plot' point that bothered me was all the people wanting to see the man who defies the apes, since they defy the apes every day by congregating in roving bands of scavengers evading capture.  Also, there is a difference between giving the ending a hanging twist, the sort that requires you to think, and incomprehensible one.  Oh, and the two swiped lines from the original (""Get your stinking hands off me..."" and ""Damn them..."") had the feeling of being forced into the script.  They just did not flow.Warren is a horrible actress.  Wahlberg was fairly stiff.  Bonham-Carter was a caricature.  Roth was the stereotypical mister-mean-man.  The script was just plain weak and the craft of storytelling was nonexistent.So, I thought I would read the book.  Let's see, the beginning was nothing like the book, the ending had little in common with the book, the middle wasn't really that much like the book.  However, there were talking apes... So, yeah, it was similar in that respect.I am glad I only rented this.  Well, not really.",Planet of the Apes

I admit with each new sequel the quality of the story went down, but one tends to be forgiving because they were made so closely together and had some cohesion.  This new film doesn't have that luxury. They took a chance and changed the story and failed miserably.  The original had implications of mankind's destructive nature which caused this twisted society to be born. In the new version the ape society was born from an astronaut not following orders. How Trite! I'll say that the make-up was impressive, but so what. I'll take a story with some depth and meaning any day.",Planet of the Apes

I mean, first the makeup was amazing it makes you think its actual monkeys acting! Second the story about how the apes came to be was better than the original story in th '68 version. I mean the space station with apes crashes on the empty planet and the apes become superior than humans. Mark Wahlberg lost in a phenomenon in space and crashes a thousand years after the station after only minutes since he left. The culture of the apes is more defined. The ending if directed by me would either have him leave and go to HIS time period or stay on the planet. BBUUUUTTTT .......... how on earth did that happen??? weren't the apes ruling on another planet???? that ending was lame.......will stay this way until a sequel explains what happened!!!!!! overall it's worth your $$.

The whole about time warp and the station with the apes crashing and Mark Wahlberg crashing a thousand years later was cool. Everything was going so amazingly well......when it came to the end. SPOILER AHEAD!!The movie should have ended with him staying on the planet...but he takes off.....and crash lands on earth in the past(1990's)and its ruled by apes....how did that happen????? i mean earth was far from everything......well i hope a sequel will explain everything.....7.5/10",Planet of the Apes
646,johnnyrayflynn,Smarter than the Original,10,2 September 2001,"The original Planet of the Apes has been around for over 30 years so It's not that big of a suprise that the fans of it didn't like this version. They left their comic book stores and went to the theater expecting a shot by shot remake of the original. Well -- suprise! -- This wasn't a remake. Tim Burton's Apes was a different story all together with a similar --more sensible-- plot.   This one, in my opinion, was better. It contained connections to not only the first few movies in the series but to the novel as well [examples being with the GREAT suprise ending or the 'fun for the whole family' monkey named Pericles - who sadly died in the book]. Also, The Special Make Up Effects to this 2001 version --when analyzed-- blew the original out of the water. Rick Baker's work to this is his best since 'an American Werewolf in London'. When you combine all of that with Danny Elfman's pounding score and Tim Burton's smooth direction you get something that hasn't been conceived since Warner Brothers' BATMAN was released.   Oh, and In regards to a few news group critics' spiteful reviews, Tim Burton's visual style is very much evident in this million dollar 'Blockbuster' movie. If you'll think back to the cold white/black contrasting space station segments or the jungle / desert shot lay-ups then you'll realize that a sort of Hitchcock reminiscent style of frame composition is present. That's pure Tim Burton. The colors and set designs are prime examples.   In my opinion, Don't you compare this one to the original, it's a great movie on it's own. It explains more than the original did --or the book-- and makes more sense, like how the apes speak English. Tim Burton hasn't done something of this calibre since his 1989 comic book film renderings. So in summation, for all of you whiny little 1960's Apes Fanatics, just think about the references this one made to the original, Think about how much better the old one could have been and think mostly about why the movie made so much money - if it was so bad? Tim Burton's a genius artist and this film was his pallet.",Planet of the Apes

That version may at least have enjoyed some campy fun.",Planet of the Apes

General Thade is probably the best villain I've seen on screen since Darth Maul, but being probably the worst movie of the year, likely no credit will be given. The dialog is insipid, the acting is grade school and the action never gains momentum. What a waste of a premise.

What I found was that the film was poorly written, and it lost all of the flavor of the original. All of the social commentary is gone, as well as all of the mystery. The plot has been replaced by some substitute filler, and the entire thing wreaked of recycled plastic. Although I did find some scenes laughable (most notably the ones that required acting) I would see it once just to know what I am talking about. If you are looking for some of Tim Burton's better work, look elsewhere.",Planet of the Apes
651,OneGarbageman,I hope it doesn't turn into a Star Trek,4,29 July 2001,"I saw this film the day it came out with high hopes.  My friends told me how great the original was and i could only think of how awesome a writer must be to create such an original story.  Oh, i was a fool.Burton has had a successful streak, hasn't he?  Batman, Batman Returns, Sleepy Hollow, and the cult favorite Nightmare Before Christmas.  Yes it is an awesome life.  But every career has a hitch.  This is his.  Mark Wahlberg's career has also been rising.  From the innovative Boogy Nights, to the highly rated Three Kings and The Perfect Storm with another blockbuster (Rock Star) on the way.  Maybe this can be an oversight.No matter the director or the stars, our hero, Leo Davidson cannot see that his ape costars are real actors.  Whenever speaking to them, he inserts a short pause, as if trying to prove to himself that these are real people. His eyes are blank and emotionless.  He plays a hero just as well as Steven Seagal, take that as you will.The apes are frighteningly lifelike, but you can't base a movie on its makeup.  The film is dark, very dark (visually) for the first 3/4.  As if these future apes couldn't figure out lightbulbs, or even gas lights.  The film also uses the rope and pulley system made popular by the Matrix.  While it looked new and exciting in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and even Romeo Must Die, seeing apes jumping vertically eight feet (from a sit down) is just silly.None of the ""human"" characters, beside Leo, play an important role.  It makes you wonder why he's trying to save them.  Apes have evolved into intelligent, thought processing individuals over thousands of years... but what happened to the humans?  Did we just stop at a certain point in time, and someone said, ""This is enough for you""?  The ending is so confusing it's physically impossible.  Burton rearranges time so much i think HE get's lost.  Overall, it's a 4/10- saved by the makeup and the ape's acting.",Planet of the Apes
652,pookacat,"A fun movie, though not burtons best",10,29 July 2001,"Ok let me say this outright.  The people who were expecting the original planet of the apes are idiots.  The original, though it had its strong points dragged on to long.  The extended walking in the desert scenes were just silly.  And for all these people are hanging onto, it is still just a B-movie. Tim Burtons version, which is exactly that, is tim burtons version.  It is pretty silly to compare it because the whole entire movie was reworked. But people forget the whole entire original book was reworked to have some commentary on racism and nuclear war in the original movie.  But back to the point.  I went in this movie expecting burton to deviate, even hoping. That is exactly what happened, burton reworked everything.  Thank GOD.  (no offense, but the original is a pretensious, seriously flawed, sixties, B Sci Fi movie, that has alot of inconsistancies to it, but it is probably the funniest movies I know of, because of all those reasons) Let me put it this way, this is a film that burton did for fincial reasons, mainly to fund his pet projects(Ed Wood the most notable). I was not expecting greatness, i was not expecting this to be sleepy hollow or ed wood.  I was expecting this to be a b-movie.  The acting was bad, but who cares, all acting in action movies is bad, the exception being batman, where jack nickolson brought it to a whole new level.  That and i did not think burton wanted good acting, or he would have cast his regulars.  Tim burton saw this movie as an opportunity to indulge in the b-movie genre, and make a bundle(which he will).  It was not supposed to be high art, just a fun sci-fi movie, and it would be foolish to expect anything else.Visually the movie is not so trademarky burton, but his touch is there. Yeah some of the battle scenes are silly, and in fact there are alot of inconsistancies.  But who cares.  The movie moved along very well, though a bit to fast at times.  The movie alone is worth seeing for the charlton heston apperance, which is possibly, and probably intentionally on burtons part, the funniest scene in the movie.   So go see it, but do not expect a masterpiece, or a loyal remake of the original(which never was a masterpiece).",Planet of the Apes
653,superbob92,"Rather entertaining, rather memorable, rather good",8,31 July 2001,"I think Burton did well in creating Planet of the Apes for a generation that did not know it, and as well, keeping the ones who did satisfied. The acting by the human-played apes was marvelous, mannerisms such as hoots and grunts in amusement, anger, or excitement were quite well done.  Burton was also able to create a scientifically logical theory behind the concept, engineering the thought that the primates were tampered with in the human image, and taught English when they were genetically engineered, which all of course was fantastical but eerily plausible.  The ape culture was intriguing as well.There was moments where I was saying, ""Wow, that was a really great idea"".  However, there was also times when I found myself saying, ""Jesus Burton, not that!"", although the latter was less common.
All throughout his career, Tim Burton was trying as hard as he could to balance entertainment with his cinematic vision, and this time he struck gold.
All in all, Planet of the Apes is not the kind of remake that people who loathe action films would enjoy, nor people who despise art films, but if you have no preference (Or you can at least stand both), the new Planet of the Apes is truly great science fiction! My only complaints were the blonde supermodel (Paper thin character), and some really lame dialogue(More character developement would have been nice too).  Both a B movie and a cinematic marvel (If it's possible).Ah, and on a final note, Helena Bonham Carter (the period-piece-princess) made a rather attractive chimpanzee!",Planet of the Apes

CONTAINS SPOILERS,10,20 August 2001,"*Spoilers* Unlike, seemingly all of the people who went to see this movie, I have read the novel on which the POTA series was based. The twist at the end being that by the time the main character had returned to earth the apes had taken over society. This is what would appear to have happened at the end of this version of the story, not some of the bizarre interpretations other people have posted. The main problem people seem to have with this film is that it has a sense of humour about itself. at a time when so many films are ruined by taking themselves to seriously, this film probably should have taken itself  seriously but a sense of smirking fun prevails throughout. Burton's unique visual style is perhaps not as dominant as in some of his films but it's still clearly there. The film is riddled with plot holes and nonsense which are clearly going to drive the petty logic obsessed viewing public crazy, in short if something about this film annoyed you, (most of these complaints are just to stupid to list) chances are you missed the point.

What did the horses eat, is their food from the jungle or the desert? #2. How did Leo grow no facial hair in this entire movie, which I am assuming spanned a larger amount of time then a day. #3.

I think what's so flabbergasting about it's awfulness is it's the same director who brought us Edward Scissor Hands and Sleepy Hollow. How did such cheesy dialog and typical action movie twists and turns get by him. Maybe they should never give large action movies to more artistic smaller budget directors. They get so swallowed up the studio machine protecting it's investment in a franchise and happy meal tie-ins kinda way. I bet someone like John McTiernan might have actually been a better choice.

659,tdao360,SPOILER ALERT - interpretation of the ending,9,30 July 2001,"************SPOILER ALERT******************This is my interpretation of some of the events about the movie that people have argued about here.Go to the next review if you don't want to know what happens in the movie!First off, I don't believe that Leo (Wahlberg) ever goes to the future. Sure you see the year in the ship fly up, but I still don't believe he went into the future.  I believe he actually goes into the distant past, on Earth.  Why else would there be humans (and monkeys, as noted in one conversation) on that planet?  All the humans on the ship were killed by Zemos.  It's too hokey to think there are humans on another planet.  By the time Marky Mark gets there, the humans will have learned the English language that the apes had been speaking all this time, thanks to the brain enhancements the ship scientists had been making to the apes.At the end, Leo goes back to the present-time of the movie (2100something, I don't remember) and lands on Earth, as the monitor on his ship stated.  He never notices he landed on Earth the first time, because he was going after Alpha Pod, and was busy trying to land safely, etc.  And in one scene in the beginning, the people in the Obeuron start getting the signals on their monitors that are showing all the events of Earth's past - hence, giving Thade and his future generations, the idea to construct things like the Lincoln Memorial and cop cars, etc (ok, it's strectching a bit, but it still works).So basically, if Leo didn't chase after the chimp, thus having the crew chase after him and crash land on ancient Earth, and if humans weren't trying to manipulate the Apes' brains chemically, the Apes would not have evolved, and in the end they would not have taken over the Earth.The movie, especially the ending, which I thought was a little silly, but still satisfied me, makes a lot of sense when you think that he actually never did go into the future in the first place, but the past instead.Which brings this movie to the same lesson that the original one did: Humans are always F-ing themselves over....Oh yeah, I gave it a 9 out of 10.",Planet of the Apes

I thought that with today's effects technology, and a story idea as compelling as Planet of the Apes, I thought there was no way this could fail. But boy was I wrong. There is utterly no character development aside from pointing out to us who are the villains and who are the heroes. There was no motivation for General Thade's (Tim Roth) hatred or Ari's (Helena Bonham Carter) great compassion. To call the plot shallow would be to imply that there was any substance at all. And all the inside jokes concerning the original series got old, too. However, nice touch having Charlton Heston appear in a cameo as General Thade's dying father. Mark Wahlberg, who has consistently turned in very good performances in films like ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""Fear,"" falls flat with a one-note character stolen from the pages of a comic book.Sure, the effects were great and the costumes were superb, but no matter how much make-up they pancaked onto my grandfather at his funeral, he was still lifeless, as was this film.

However, a smarter move on the part of the directors would have been to scrap the film, and screen the preview in theaters.  This film in the region of the worst film I have ever seen.  Mark Wahlberg, as usual, adds nothing to the film with his despicable acting and moronic facial expressions, except the impression that he is severely constipated; Tim Roth (who has contributed to such great films as Reservoir Dogs and Little Odessa) was physically painful to watch; and I still don't understand why they bothered to include Helena Carter in the cast at all.  It takes a flight of the imagination to imagine Tim Burton saying ""cut!"" on the set, and being pleased with what he had created.  Bottom line: DO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY ON THIS FILM.

This is a typical reaction of moviegoers who are kinda uptight about certain films, mainly those who deal with humanistic philosophy of good and evil, like Lords of the ring, Star Wars or the Star Trek series. Probably Dungeon and dragon players too. Kinda nerd? I thought the movie was okay, not great but Burton did a good job considering he was touching sacred material (a cult film, woooow!). And I especially like the ending which was like a finger (guess which one!) pointed at those freaks who like to have an ending that answers all questions for them and let them think they are intelligent. It reminded me of the ending of Hitchcock's the Birds which still drive people mad because it doesn't explain why the Birds decided to attack. Who cares: it's a movie!!!",Planet of the Apes

We are both Tim Burton fans and were willing to overlook the mixed advance press.Suffice it to say that this film is a mess, doesn't make any sense, and has severe acting problems.  The male lead is a man who used to advertise underpants and is a complete emotional blank.  Even worse, his love interest is that curse of Hollywood films, a model woman who has no acting ability whatsoever.

I really wish that people would leave the classics alone and come up with new ideas. It is impossible to try to capture the feel of the original movie, even with modern CG effects. Then to add insult to injury the producer even went as far as to re-write the movie to their liking! The only place this should have been seen was on the cutting room floor, and that is even being nice!

Yes people the movie is bad and cheesy and whatever else you'll make of it, but many seem to forget that is exactly what we have always loved about these films. This addition does not ruin the series at all it just adds on a slightly prettier addition to the wonderfully awful movies we have always enjoyed.

672,VeraWade,Disappointing effort to relaunch good series,3,27 July 2014,"Tim Burton has made quite a lot of good movies, but none of them would ever give you the idea he would be the director best suited to direct a ""Planet of the Apes""-remake. His style of filmmaking pretty much couldn't be further from what was needed here.The film abandons just about every detail from Pierre Boulle's original book. At the start of the movie, Wahlberg's character, Davidson, is working on a space station, and he is involved with experiments with primates. While the back-story behind this seems interesting, you don't get to know much about it because not long into the movie, one of the chimpanzee's from the station disappears with his spacecraft, Davidson follows and ends up on the eponymous planet. Unlike in the original movie, here all humans have the ability to speak and are completely civilized. Since the apes are in that sense not dominant over the humans, that removes a lot of the suspense present in the original movie. The humans still are slaves though, but Davidson escapes with a female slave and convinces a female ape to sort of join their cause. Two apes, military commanders, start chasing after them and we get to see some uninteresting chase scenes. The Ape City also looks badly compared to the one from the original. Later, scenes take place at Davidson's old space station, which crash landed at the planet hundreds of years before he did. The apes apparently created some kind of temple there. Eventually, there is a battle between the humans and the hostile apes.Now, I've heard people say they were interested in seeing this movie because of a cameo by Charlton Heston, but his appearance is so short and since he is unrecognizable I would hardly say it would be worth sitting through this movie just for that.This movie is also infamous for the horrible ending, which deserves a special mention of its own. They must have worked really hard to make the last scene especially as bad as possible, in the vain hope they would get to make a sequel to tie up the infinite number of loose ends they created in this.Fortunately, the series got a proper reboot with ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" in 2011. Do yourself a favor and watch that one instead of this.",Planet of the Apes
673,davidleach2000-1,should be called Planet of the Pants,1,16 April 2006,"A horrid, hateful, hash of a movie. A totally needless exercise. What is the point of remaking a perfectly good film made less than 30 odd years ago? Put simply, it's because Hollywood has run out of ideas. Why waste effort trying to create something new when it can simply rehash superb older movies and create garbage.For all you people out there who've never seen the original I urge you to. It's a wonderful and powerful film with a truly exciting and surprising ending, which if you don't know will come as a startling shock.I saw this 2001 abomination when it first opened I was hoping that perhaps Burton might be able to do something with it - sadly, Burton did. He took a fantastic film and turned it into a turkey, filling it with tedium, nonsense, overblown effects and Walhberg. It's so obviously a film made by committee - 'we can't have the humans silent! We need a sexy, strong female freedom fighter, we need massive war! We need sexy female apes! And we need to out-shock the original film's ending with an ending so shocking, the audience will leave their seats shocked by the shocking revelation of it all!' Boy, was I shocked.There's so much wrong with this film I'm not going to even try.Don't waste your time with this, don't waste your money.It was shown on TV recently and I thought I'd give it another go and work out when it goes off the rails. Actually it's not difficult to spot. It's happens just after the main credits have finished rolling.I'm surprised the entire film isn't just listed in the goof list.Goof - the entire film.Avoid and save a precious couple of hours of your life. Because when you're lying on your death bed wishing you had a few more hours of life left, you're gonna wish you hadn't wasted them with this trash. I know I am.",Planet of the Apes

The producer, director, and screen-writer should all win 'Chumpies' (or should that be 'Chimpies'?) at the Anti-Oscar Awards.The acting is so bad that, no doubt, Kris Kristofferson pleaded to be killed early in order to escape the locale. Most of the other actors were mainly trained to say, ""Grrr!"" and leap about like demented chimps.The attempts at humor are pathetic, being mostly banal take-offs on modern stand-up one-liners. The hero is a blockhead space pilot who can't fly as well as a trained chimp, and whose face is far less expressive.If you're going to rent this movie, be sure to rustle up a biiig bag of popcorn, 'cuz you're going to want something to put over your head to escape the worst remake, ever!",Planet of the Apes
676,bjorn-5,Deeply flawed but beautifully made,4,21 June 2004,"I'm ambivalent about which of the two is more significant: It's a beautiful movie, but the story has more holes than swiss cheese.I was impressed by the production values: the makeup, sets, editing, and such. I'm less sure about the costumes. (Most outfits appear to look like they're made primarily from vinyl.) In many ways, it's visually stunning. A lot of the things they did with ape culture, modes of expression, even movement were very creative. Though some turned out silly, like the ""running"".The acting was, on balance, pretty good. Some of the characters were preposterous (even ignoring the ape makeup), but in particular Tim Roth and (in stark contrast) Paul Giamatti were amazing in their roles. In some sense, just the variety of personalities shown in the apes was impressive.But the story had holes in it bigger than the ones the spaceships flew through. While I understand that it's a fantasy, rather than SF, given the ""auteur"", the inconsistencies in the plot, if you will, were too much for me. I can suspend disbelief for the big things, but the details are too much to handle. (Some of these questions may be spoilers.) How did the apes become masters of vinyl-making, when they can't produce a decent knife? Where did the horses come from? And for that matter, where were the gorillas from? Their ""escape route"" from the city was laughable. The climactic battle was *terrible*! And the ""twist"" at the ending evoked more stupefied laughter than awed thrill.Maybe upon repeated viewing, I can gloss over these flaws, but I don't think so.",Planet of the Apes

It's simply a reinvention of the same story, filtered through the eyes of one of the most creative Hollywood directors. Everything in this show work in a perfect way: the screenplay is inventive and brilliant. All the performers gave their best, in particularly Tim Roth portraing the main villain, General Thade, and Helena Bonham Carter under the make-up of the kind chimp Ari. Costumes, art direction, special effects are amazing! Great part of the success of this film is due to the wonderful make-up effects by the genial wizardy of Rick Baker and the complex score composed by the talent of the sublime Maestro Danny Elfman.

It all seemed like a rather cheap (well not if the budget is $100m) attempt at a 'sure-fire' summer blockbuster - but on hearing that Tim Burton was to directed I began to look forward to seeing the finished product. After all wasn't this the man who had brought us Edward Scissorhands, Sleep Hollow and BeetleJuice.But after seeing the film all I can say is stick to gothic horror Tim. It doesn't engage at any a level, its not exciting, not at all interesting, predictable and worst of all the shock ending makes no real sense. It does look 'authentic' and the make-up was first class with Tim Roth and Helen Bonham Carter doing their best to kick some life in a hack script.

679,einga,I cannot believe how bad this movie was,1,9 August 2001,"Let me just start of by saying that this movie was a total waste of time, money, effort and was possibly the biggest dissapoinment I have ever seen.With all the hype behind the movie I expected a lot, and I mean a whole lot more out of this.  The acting was second rate at best, characters were so predictable, and the plot so thin that I was about ready to get up and leave 1/2 way through the movie.  How many of you out there actaully managed to predict the movies ending at about the half way point???  And the Ka Li Ma thing?  Makes you think they ripped that off from Star Trek when the spacecraft came looking for ""v y ger"".Absolutley no premise was given to the scientific background that would make such a series of events possible.  Not just the time shift but the whole evolution of monkeys into something more.  If in the thousadn years or so that the monkeys had become dominate then why had the humans not also changed?

680,JohnOD,Not Burton's best,7,17 August 2001,"Planet of the Apes is missing the comedy and the edge of Tim Burton's other films.  Though stranded on a strange world, Leo Davidson lacks the outsider quality of other Burton heroes like Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, or Lydia Deitz (Beetlejuice).  Similarly the comedy seems wedged in, rather than forming an integral part of the story, as it does in the likes of Mars Attacks or Ed Wood.It is really only the performance of Tim Roth that redeems this picture. He has never really had a reputation for being a physical actor but here he shows himself to be up with the Oldmans and the Nicholsons.  It would have been good to see someone more animated than Mark Wahlberg in the Davidson role.",Planet of the Apes

Last week I saw Sleepy Hollow for the 5th time, so I hoped (and expected) for some more Burton-magic. When I left for home I had seen almost none of that.First the story. The script had to many flaws. During the whole movie the story stays mainly too shallow, for instance the character of Leo is always two-dimensional. I also missed some big-scenes. Their were just a few moments in the movie that 'resparked'the movie. Also Burton could have done better, for instance the big fight-scene could have been a lot better. Also disappointing was the scenery, it looked like a set all the way. The acting was mainly poor, Wahlberg en Bonham-Carter can be good actors, but this time he couldn't convince me. Warren was a big laugh. The exception was of course Tim Roth. Maybe sometimes over the top, but in general great.

With so many writers, how could it be so bad?  One can only guess that so much attention was paid to the makeup (fantastic) that a good script was overlooked.Tim Burton has officially sold out and Mark Wahlberg is capable of so much more when he has a good script to work with and a director more concerned with storytelling than points on the back end.If you just HAVE to see ""Planet"" on the big screen, save some money and go see a matinee.

683,ROBO-Tim,Well... the makeup was impressive.,6,28 July 2001,"Tim Burton's new remake of Planet of the Apes is pretty disappointing... visually interesting but shallow.  It really doesn't explore the issues of the day as did the original.  In fact, it's best moments were based on contrived references to the original with familiar dialogue. Interestingly, the only people in the theatre laughing when those references were made were my friends and I (proving my contention that we were among the oldest attendees).  Sadly though, most of these high school students will never see the original and won't know what they're missing.  This film is predictable at just about every turn...  lacking any of the punch that allowed the original to hit audiences with its stunning visual revelation at the end.

Tim Burton slept through every single take, just to wake in time to shout ""Cut!"" and then nod through the next scene. Honestly, every single element of this movie was without vision, without style, without anything.There is honestly no one to pick on, cause everyone and everything was equally bad. Even Tim Roth irritated me as the over the top Thade. Where did that stupid kid suddenly come from just before the final battle? The so-called twist at the end seem to have been forced in there just to give this film some credibility when compared to the first film. Ironically, it just highlights the incredible shortcomings of it.There are honestly SO MANY BAD THINGS to pick on, but i'm sure the guys here at IMDB have some sort of limit on the length of comments.

I actually can't believe the overwhelmingly positive response by fans and critics alike to this movie!Okay...it looks great...but there are several major flaws...first, did anyone else notice how a few of the apes (Paul Giamatti's ""Limbo"" in particular) too closely resembled The Grinch?...second, notwithstanding the great acting by Tim Roth, everyone else seemed stiff as a board...third, and most importantly, and without revealing the ending, did anyone else notice how preposterous it was for that ending to be possible? There is NO possible way that the events at the end of the film could have followed anything that came before it. Instead of a twist ending that meant something, we are left with a sense of confusion that seems to have been tagged on to make jaws drop...until common sense prevails and you realize that they couldn't figure out how to end it in a realistic manner.I guess that the average moviegoer will walk away semisatisfied at what amounts to little more than style prevailing over substance...something we have too long settled for...but as always, most people will forget about it as soon as the next overblown hyped summer blockbuster comes along!",Planet of the Apes
686,Nostalgia,Bad taste in your mouth..,1,14 August 2001,"It's not often that I find a movie that I literally wanted to walk out of during the film.  This movie just happens to be one of those movies.  Mark Walhberg was not the cause of this movie to stink, nor was it the acting in general.  I liked the acting and the special effects.  However, the story and script should never had made it past the producers.  In fact, I am surprised the ink in the pen wanted to write it out.  This whole story does nothing but tarnish the original movies good name.  I literally, as soon as I left the cinema went and rented the original Planet of the Apes to wash the bad taste this one left in my mouth.Let's compare the new movie to the old;Actors: Charlton Heston & Mark WalhbergWhile Hestons brand of acting may not appeal to all, it IS brilliant acting. Mark Walhberg is an up and coming star, this is true, but for him to rise to the level that Heston sits upon, Mark is going to have to start looking for some seriously good scripts and take some more acting lessons, maybe even from Heston himself.  ADVANTAGE: OriginalSupporting Ape Cast Old & Supporting Ape Cast NewApes are Apes but there are aspects from both the new and old films that I liked.  The Original movie had Dr.Zira and Dr.Cornelius and who could forget Dr.Zaius, who were all pretty great characters which added a lot of character interaction and development for Hestons character(Taylor). While the new movie has Ari? An Ape with a serious case of the hots for Walhbergs character(Leo).  ADVANTAGE: OriginalSupporting Human Cast Old & Supporting Human Cast NewBased on the fact that the original only had Linda Harrison as Nova, I have to give the advantage for this class to the new movie.  ADVANTAGE: New MovieSpecial Effects:While the old has some fantastic sites where they shot the film, we do have to give the new movie the advantage in the special effects department. The only thing I really did not like where the Gorillas that were leaping distances of 30 or so feet.  Advantage: New MovieStory:Well this is the big kahuna.  The old movie had an amazing script.  The new movie was geared too much towards quick action where the old movie was a lot of character development with enough action to keep it interesting.  After watching the new movie there were definite aspects that I really would have liked to see in the old movie.  Such as the fact that the Apes were using primitive weaponry.  Makes sense.  Also they lived in the trees, again.. makes sense.   I was very dissappointed when the humans in the new movie opened their mouths and could speak perfect english.  WOW, it's actually very  difficult to see, at least in my point of view, how the apes could regard humans, that can speak just as eloquent english as they.. AS SAVAGES. Or question whether or not they have souls??  Hello?!?!  I thought the whole reason they were ""savages"" was because they could not be taught, were stupid and were almost neanderthalic in behavior.  What I saw in the new movie was an excuse to have at least a few more characters for Walhberg to talk to since they did not have the character interacton with the Apes. I liked the idea or Thade.. but he was just a tad bit too insane for my liking, then again, maybe there just wasn't enough character developement for me to like him.  Overall.. ADVANTAGE: Original
In short, this movie is a waste of time, don't see it, don't rent it, don't buy it.  I give it 4 thumbs down",Planet of the Apes
687,Hellerup-3,Mark Wahlberg is a disaster,4,17 January 2002,"I knew this was going to be a bad movie. I loved the original so any attempt to top it was, in my perspective, bound to fail. And surely, it did.
This is one misconceived film, and has nothing in the form of pace, believability or lovable characters. The ending (here we go again) is glued on for no apparent reason, other than trying to be true to the novel on which the film is based. The plot is more or less non-existent. And why is it that these ""wild"" humans, are running around with nicely combed and washed hair, and look like a million? A film such as this, has got to be more dirty. We're talking about a planet ruled by monkeys damn it! And when humans can talk and communicate with the apes the analogy to our own world is lost, along with any reason as to why Mark Wahlberg would make a difference.Speaking of; one of the main reason for the failure is Mark Wahlberg. I havent seen an actor do such a bad job in....well, ever actually. He has got the face of a robot, and less talent than one. And why does he make such a big difference in this world? He has got no charisma, he displays no leadership, he has trouble raising his voice, he delivers all of his lines with the same tone of voice and is generally as inspiring as a taxaccountant. Why are we led to believe that he could lead a rebellion against monkey-tyrrany?Without a doubt Tim Burtons worst film. Avoid!4/10 for good makeup and nice FX's.",Planet of the Apes
688,Bertrum,Mark Wahlberg a bit wooden - watch the original first,6,14 August 2001,"In this version the ending is not the same as the original.

689,trevor.hickman,PoTA - Never send a monkey to do a man's job,7,17 August 2001,"I wanted PoTA to be my favourite film of the year, which on reflection it probably ended up being. Lacking the originals social comment, and released at a time when the World's social ills and insurgency are less than in Charlton's '68 original, the film nevertheless provided good action sci-fi and a clever (if not a bit confusing) ending.HBC gave a good performance, and Roth probably outshone Wahlberg as the mean and devious Thade. A great looking film, well delivered by Tim Burton, who was the ideal director to carry the primate adventures into 2000.Burton brought subtle humour to the film (which I had anticipated being a lot darker than it turned out). The orang-utan love pastiche, the little girl as a pet, and the two card playing apes - one calling the other a ""Cheater"" (Cheetah).A lot of acknowledgements were given to it's father film. Several quotes and a cameo Heston. I preferred the fact that the apes on Burton's planet were unarmed, other than with clubs, the original (especially the TV series had them kitted out with all sorts of weaponry). It was a shame one of the original underlying mantra of ""ape shall never kill ape"" was dropped, but by and large it stayed relatively true to it's original.Overall: A good re-working. 8/10",Planet of the Apes

Helena Bonham Carter as Ape Avi is wonderful...so were the apes of Tim Roth and Michael  Clark Duncan. Very menacing for sure. Tim Burton has done a fine job putting this remake together.I rated an 8 out of 10. Visually, it won't disappoint anyone. If you like action and fighting, it is here also.",Planet of the Apes
691,sm8,Unlike the original which is good.... but...,1,12 August 2001,"but it's a very weak story with unremarkable special effects and full of gaping holes.  Which is bad.  Very very bad.I went in expecting a good movie that would live up to the name of the franchise, despite the presence of Burton in the director's chair.I cannot believe a story resembling an early draft and not much more than a comedy sketch in someone else's production would have received final approval and the go-ahead by an entire studio.When it's available on video (DVD), watch this along with the original 1968 Apes.  If you care for nothing more than MTV special effects, maybe you'll come away with a distaste for the original.  But if you value any type of consistency and plausible story, in an implausible world, then the newest Apes movie will leave you wanting a lot more.  Not even Helena Bonham Carter nor Tim Roth, both whom put forth excellent performances, could save this picture.  Paul Giamatti was brilliant - his performance might have been a little too comedic over-all, but again, that was a problem with the writing. His performance was stellar.  Mark Wahlberg has chosen far better roles in the past.Ah, Burton signs his name on another ruined production.  He certainly has earned his over-rated respect directing this type of swiss-cheesed fluff. The picture does nothing to advance the state of cinematography or story telling.  It adds an easily forgettable movie to the Apes line-up.  If nothing else, at least a sequel, with someone else handling direction, doesn't stand much chance of being any worse.POTA-2001 earns a solid (1) rating.  Wahlberg offers a one liner which would sum this picture.  I'm only paraphrasing... ""you shouldn't send apes to do a man's job"" - and that there points to one of the biggest holes in the entire story.  No spoilers though.

That gave me no expectations and disappointment that things were so different.The surprises (including Charlton Heston's cameo) just kept me glued to the screen.  I even enjoyed the ironic twist at the end even if it made very, very little practical sense.  Paul Giamatti deserves extra credit for an outstanding comedic performance.  Tim Roth has never been sexier.My only disappointment was the serious lack of explanation, mainly toward the end.

The ending made me think of a line from a Bette Midler concert film that goes ""What the f---.""  The problem is that their is not any logical explanation to this films ending (to say more would mean giving a major spoiler to the film).  It seems that Tim Burton and company felt they had to have a stunning ending like in the original ""Planet of the Apes"" but it doesn't work (unlike like in the original where the surprise was quite logically explained to the audience).With that said please check out this remake because besides for the ending it truly is a great movie.P.S.

I expected much better from such a fine director and cast, complete with what seems to have been an unlimited budget.Main beef - where's the plot?  This movie was so predictable and lifeless, I don't know where to begin.  The so-called ""plot"", was rife with absolutely fantastic leaps of logic (ie. an accidental one-button location of a space/time warp - puhleeeeze!).  Such a pity.The film offered no surprises, other than the guffaws of disbelief from many in the crowded theater.  I'm still trying to understand why somebody felt the original movie, deserving of much praise, had to be remade.The primate characters looked like actors wearing rubber masks.  Nearly every set looked like... well, a set.  Several characters (ie. young warboy), invisible during the development of the story, somehow become important near the end of the film.  But without character background, I felt nothing for them.  The requisite buxom blonde was easy to look at, but left me wondering why she was even there.  Any romance angle between man/blonde or man/girl-illa was undeveloped and anemic, and shouldn't have even been attempted.This was one lame waste of a Friday night, and my hard-earned money.",Planet of the Apes

But this movie leaves me with so many questions that I am counting down the days till the next one is released. I compare the ending of this movie to that of the original Star Wars.....abrupt. But I did indeed enjoy the movie, for several reasons. One was the great special effects and terrific Make-up and Costume usage. (Give em the Oscars now). I had to keep reminding myself there were humans under all that make-up. I didnt care too much for the beginning, it just seemed a little far-fetched, like this might have been the best idea out of a bunch of bad ideas on how to begin the film. Man risks life for monkey? As it went on, we saw the viciousness of General Thade and wondered ""Whats up his butt""? Although thoroughly p***ed off the entire movie, Thade does display a side of him that is very human. His scene with Heston as his father bleeds with politics, because the one possesion he has of the humans is a gun, and considering its Heston, Pres of the NRA, I couldnt concentrate on what they said to each other, because I was chuckling at the Irony of this scene. Heston saying humans are dangerous for creating this kind of technology? Did I hear that right? Wow...... We have all heard of movies that are too slow. This one went too fast. I wanted more explanations, and more about the apes...the general daily life of these apes is hardly delved into, and we go into the sequels knowing very little about them, except they dont like humans and they screech a lot. The ending did leave a lot of doors open for sequels, but will this movie go down as being better than the original? Probably not. Will this movie be remembered for its stunning visual images? Yes. And thats why you should see it. Dont get too entangled in the plot...because you will be tangled for a while. Enjoy the movie, and wait for the sequels to explain what we dont know.",Planet of the Apes

Everybody else, well, I stick out my tongue and beat my chest at you.  And who would have thought that all of Charleton Heston's classic lines would be hijacked by the apes themselves?

It has no resonance, no spark, no soul.  No reason for being.  I was suckered into seeing it by the promise of Tim Burton's visionary direction; but the end result could have been filmed by anyone (just a few more explosions and it could have been Michael Bay).

698,themovienut,Tim Burton needs Batman and Batman needs Tim Burton,1,30 July 2001,"Tim Burton's new vision for the ""Planet of the Apes"" is completely dumbed down for the increasingly tolerant American movie audience.  Why can't the studios just bring out the original films, instead of remaking them? I will admit that I went to see this film with as much trepidation as going to see Gus Van Sant's misguided redo of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" a few years back. This isn't as bad as that, but it's very close. Franklin Shaffner's original 1968 film is a classic (yes, classic!).  It holds up very well today and should be seen by anyone who hasn't. The new version has none of the political and social satire that makes the original so fun to watch.  I knew that Mr. Burton wouldn't even attempt a political film, so we are left with a fairly mundane film in which our new time traveler encounters a planet ruled by apes, and then immediatly wants to get the hell out of there.  The problem is there is absolutely no danger.  Mark Wahlberg doesn't face immasculation or lobotomy like Charlton Heston faced in the original. He is only faced with a villain that hates humans, but we never find out why.  Tim Roth is quite good in the role, but we need a backstory. The film does brighten up for a few minutes at the midway point, with a brief cameo.  Let's just say it's the best acting in the film. If we are going to have to sit through remake after remake, please let's try to make a film that is inspired.  Tim Burton is a very original filmmaker, who this time out is hampered by a very poor script. If William Broyles cannot come up with anything more witty than an ape saying ""Get your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty human!"" then perhaps he should start working on that script for ""Apollo 13 Part 2"" What the audience should be saying is ""Keep your stinking paws off of classic movies, you damn stupid producers."" In conclusion, I hope that Tim Burton can find some way to get the ""Batman"" franchise back from Joel Schumacher before he causes any more damage, save Michael Keaton from doing ""Jack Frost 2"" and stop screwing around with classic films from the past. As for Producer Richard Zanuck: PLEASE DON'T REMAKE 'JAWS'or 'THE STING' Leave those films alone for the love of God.

699,chris.j.warren-2,"Typically Burton - huge on style, light on substance",7,13 December 2001,"First up, I'd like to say that I liked POTA.  It is absolutely gorgeous to look at.  The make-up, effects, cinematography, costumes and sets are all pretty hard to fault.  On the acting front, Tim Roth is utterly fantastic as General Thade and he just about makes up for the price of admission on his own.So what's the problem?  Well as much as I want Mark Wahlberg star to continue to rise, I just don't think he has the charisma to carry Charlton Heston's role.  Not that he was bad or anything, his acting is fine and he is certainly a lot better looking than Chuck ever was.  But is he really the brave and indignant leader of the human race who defies the apes and their dirty paws?  Maybe he would have been better as the plucky young male that defiantly chases after the hero (read George Clooney) after being told to stay behind with the others?But in Mark's defence, I don't think replacing him would have necessarily made the film any more satisfying.  This was a difficult film (conceptually) to make when you consider how highly the original is regarded.  Do you just remake it with the same emphasis of script and story, or if you are going to do something different, what do you change?So Burton does what he does best and creates a film that emphasises style over story, and action over acting (or actors).  It worked for Batman and I think it does for POTA.  Time will tell after the franchise has come and gone whether people criticise ""POTA Forever"" as not holding a candle to Burton's original!Enjoyable: 7/10",Planet of the Apes

Tim Roth as Thade was a powerhouse, Bonham Carter was good and Michael Clarke Duncan as General Attar was perfectly cast.  He actually made a very funny quote which I read about in a newspaper.

703,dream_reiver,Only an adequate outing by Burton...,10,4 August 2001,"I found this particular effort by Burton to be not quite up to par with Batman, etc.  But, hey, Burton is allowed to falter somewhat occasionally. These comments, however, are not directed at the movie, but at the posters who complain about illogical and inconsistent events in the movie.  Some of these are valid such as the engine of the USAF ship being operational years after it crashed. Sure nuclear powered engines can last for hundreds of thousands of years, however, everything else around it would have decayed (circuitry, wires, etc).  It's a minor problem, however.  The other ""problems"" can be explained I believe though. SPOILERS AKERT(1) I'll begin with the ""origin of the apes"" point first.  Clearly, the apes (chimps, orangs, gibbons, gorillas) on the planet Leo crashed landed on were not descended from Leo's chimp.  They were descended from the apes which were on the USAF ship.  After the crash of the USAF ship, the apes (being genetically engineered to be smarter than normal) ran amok and took over. 
(2) The second point is about the time gap between the sending of the mayday message by Leo in the future and its reception in the past by his crew.  Now for those of you who were not paying attention, there is a point in the movie where the USAF ship receives a message emanating from the time warp. It was sent by the captain of the ship, only he appears much, much older. Clearly, it was sent from the future.  It's a time warp folks!!!!(3) The third and final point has to do with the conclusion.  I have to admit, it was a bit contrived, but like the previous 2 points, I think I can come up with an explanation. The only one I can come up with is that Thade somehow regained control on the ape planet and used perhaps Leo's crashed pod or salvaged pods from the USAF ship, went through the time warp back into Earth's past and conquered the Earthlings.  Yeah, I know -- it's a stretch.  I can't wait for its elucidation in the sequel, and you know that was a classic sequel setup.",Planet of the Apes
704,kvant_mitsi_com,A Chance to Go Ape Ruined by Tedious Audience Junkfood,5,31 July 2001,"Contains SpoilersNo one can expect a remake to equal up to the legendary sci-fi classic even with all the special effects and ape costumes in the world. Well considering that Mark Wahlberg doesn't show a single expression beyond stupefied' doesn't help either. It's also his character, Leo Davidson, who gets transported to the future after he dives into a nebula of testosterone.If you need me to explain the plot, go out and rent the 1968 version. But Burton and friends took liberty with adding typical action flick characters and scenes that'd not find home in the 1968 classic. Like General Thade (Tim Roth), who sets himself apart from all other Apes by talking in a series of near incomprehensible grunts. Or Karubi (Kris Kristofferson), who not surprisingly sacrifices himself to save everyone else because he's old (originality?). The movie, like the entire franchise, is hauled into a dark alley and beaten to death, kicking and screaming the entire way.
One thing that I loved so much about the original was it's unique score, primarily composed of drums and horns. The opening of the remake has exactly that, even better. I loved the opening score, yet that's the problem; it was only used during the opening. I faintly remember hearing it in the background for about twenty seconds later in the film. But Burton and Elfman decided to follow traditional boring action movie music, the kind that makes you want to attack the screen in a flurry of shotgun blasts.
I sat bored through most of the movie. It's really really boring; half the scenes are dominated by General Thade bouncing off the walls and howling `Get the humans!' Or Mark Wahlberg (who can't be surprised by anything, even landing on a planet rules by tyrannical apes) heroically taking the lead with lines such as `Uhhwe've gotta escape' Scenes invite groans, such as Wahlberg's insta-army. Once the escaped humans, and their ape companions have made if far enough away from the ape city, an army of humans come to join them. What's so terrible about this scene is that the army comes in from all directions simultaneously. In the next five minutes an army of humans are ready to go. Also, the ape city was walled off, with no room for expansion, what are they trying to wall out? Or in?You may remember Charlton Heston's kiss to Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) in the original. Considering that Helena Bonham Carter's character Ari is nearly a spitting image of Dr. Zira (the reason why I liked her the most in the film) it isn't surprising that she gets a little smooch from Mark Wahlberg. This is the big disappointment in Burton's `Apes'. Here is a chance to go over the top and really screw with the audience. Why didn't spaceman Leo Davidson sleep with Ari? Instead of kicking the audience in the ass, he's just invited snickers from the audience moms. If you're making a movie about a planet that's ruled by tyrannical monkey-men, how can you not go over the deep end? The 1968 version was a great movie with mixed satire, the remake fails.From the way I sound, you must think I hate this movie. The remake had some redeeming features I loved. I loved the ape costumes and how director Burton used the apes in a more primordial fashion. In the original the apes stood up and ran straight. In the remake Burton lets them run hunched over and perform bouncing leaps. The greatest thing about the remake? The ending of course, I won't spoil it, but it's genius. It doesn't make sense, it doesn't have to (just look at the title to the movie).The remake should've been titled 'Mark Wahlberg vs. the Planet of the Apes' because that's what it is. Instead of producing a social satire that explores dual bestiality and the inner workings of a nations ruled by apes (which would've been great). Burton throws a summer action movie at us with little redeeming features and wooden characters (except Ari, of course).",Planet of the Apes

As I was watching it, I thought to myself, ""You know, I'd really like to see this with my 9 year old brother"".  It's a slightly original action movie that supplies enough twists from the usual good guy v. bad guy flick to make it interesting.The movie makes some ham-fisted attempts at social commentary.  At one point in the movie an ape played by Paul Giamatti even exclaims ""Can we all get along?"" That line has been parodied so many times, it's almost painful.  In fact, as memory recalls Tim Burton had Jack Nicholson say the exact same line (to a much greater comic effect in ""Mars Attacks!""  The racism allegories seem so forced, it's distracting.  You almost expect Helena Bonham Carter's ape character to organize a big human-ape chain and start singing ""I'd like to teach the world to sing""But aside from the failed commentary, the movie succeeds.  All of the performances were above par. Tim Roth treaded the line of overacting, but never crosses it and makes a great, and perpetually angry, Thade.  Micheal Clark Duncan surprises as a loyal, and religious gorilla general.

Don't worry, I won't give any spoilers for either film.The acting was very good, especially Tim Roth as Thade and Bonham Carter as Ari.  I don't understand why others have complained about the poor acting. The special effects are also unbelievably brilliant in every department and a lot of effort was put into the little things like the behaviour and mannerisms of the apes.However, there are plotholes and the ending is very confusing.  This doesn't mean it doesn't make sense as so many people have claimed.  No offence to anyone but you should really make sure you understand the ending and it's relationship to the rest of the film before you judge it.  I myself don't understand the ending 100% and am therefore making an effort to find out what it means.Some of the plotholes pointed out by others are minor and don't really make the film any less enjoyable.

Anyone who claims to understand the end can feel free to explain it to me.Possibly the poorest area of the film was the action scenes.

I loved the original, but understood that this was a re-imagining rather than a remake, so the movie was bound to be at least a bit different.  Burton does an excellent job of visualizing what a city built by primates might look like, vaguely jungle-like, but with buildings.  The plot is at least as good as the first one-I found that whole humans are mute angle just a bit much in the original.  This deals with rights of a stronger group over a weaker, touches on the dangers of allowing military leaders to make political decisions, and in general creates a believable world, especially when it becomes clear just how the apes got there in the first place.  (Just a note of science here-genetically altered chimps can only mean mixing DNA with a compatible species and we share 99% of the same DNA as chimps)  Carter and Roth are outstanding, details such as the gait of the apes are considered and the special effects are kept to a minimum.  I admit I am still undecided about whether or not I like the ending, but let's be honest here-Burton would be less than human if he wasn't planning on a possible sequel.  So why the uproar?  It's not every day you get to see an interspecies love story either.

All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg is not acting, he is just in the movie, looking stupid. The other actors are also not very good.But the worst point of all, is the story. It is absolutely ridiculous! For example: the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground, but the humans don`t attack them, no, they wait until they are up again!

It's about an ape being sent into some big magnetic storm in outer space. It's being sent to see what that storm is, but it doesn't come back so our hero takes a little spacecraft and heads in the same direction as the ape. When he hits the storm, his spacecraft goes nuts/out of control and suddenly a planet appears. Too late, he regains control, just to crash down into a lake in a rainforest. After he has rescued himself out of the craft, the movie first really begins! He has crashlanded into a world where apes are like humans and humans are like apes, locked up in cages. He get caught, but after a short time, he finds out that there is this one ape that's not like the other apes...I've heard people asking me if this really just ain't either a follow-up or a remaking of the original planet of the apes - the answer is definately no!

Mark Whalberg and Estella Warren, on the other hand are more wooden than a log cabin convention.  The make-up is impressive, but from such a visionary director as Tim Burton, you'd have expected far more.

726,dannimac,The most visually stunning god awful piece of tripe you will ever encounter,1,1 June 2003,"Directed by Tim Burton, this has all the things that you would normally associate with him - fabulous costumes, gothic scenery etc etc. These are visually stunning and serve as an excellent background to the movie. What's missing is a good storyline, good dialogue or (apart from a few notable exceptions which I will come to later) decent actors. It takes the plot of the original film and ""updates"" it (although why it needed updating, I don't know).Why do I think it is so awful - let's start with the dialogue. From the moment Mark Wahlberg utters the line ""I'm going to get my monkey"" the script is laughable.Now on to the storyline - well as I said, did it need updating? Take the original, add in some human talking (although it was mostly Wahlberg) and a truly cringe making ending and you have the disaster that was this movie.The acting - I've watched a couple of Wahlberg movies now and I really don't rate him. He seems to think a perma frown relays a pensive side and that if he stomps, he will appear powerful. As a main player, he doesn't convince. Tim Roth - love him but overdone. Helena - don't get me started - ape sensitivity, I don't think so! Michael Clarke Duncan - hang your head in shame. And Estella Warren - god love her, she didn't have a chance. She gets so few lines and is blatantly there as eye candy alone.The human characters who deliver the lines don't even have the decency to look embarrassed. The one exception is Kris Kristofferson who I can pass off without comment, mainly because he wisely keeps his mouth shut for most of the time. The ape actors are well hidden and we won't know if they were embarrassed or not - and they should be. I really respect Tim Roth as an actor but this was ape ham that I was watching - overdone evil, a flat performance. The only decent ape performances that I saw were by Paul Giamatti as the slave trader and the brilliant minute or so that Charlton Heston was on the screen.If you choose to watch this movie, remember you will never get the time it took to watch it back.",Planet of the Apes
727,rgon-1,Impressive,10,29 October 2014,"Tim Burton re-imagines Planet of the Apes. To put it simply, I enjoyed watching it. The original Apes films are masterpieces of cinema to be sure. So Burton decided that instead of merely retelling the original story, he would put his own spin to the tale. As such, it should be appreciated as a film in its own right and not a mere rehash. The cast, namely Mark Wahlberg, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, etc., gave pretty impressive performances. One of my favorite bits has to be Charlton Heston's cameo. In ape makeup, no less. I will not spoil the ending here. it has to be seen to be believed, but I can assure you, you won't forget it. Highly recommended.",Planet of the Apes

The planet does not seem to be earth. The special FX and sound are wonderful. The acting is average and the movie almost seemed a little boring at times. But what I really hated was the quotes from the original (one made by the man that originally said ""Damn them all to Hell!!"" as he lay in his death bed. The ending of the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and this totally ruined the it. He clearly lands back on earth and clearly shown to be going back in time. Now if it's all about inter-dimensional travel, it still makes no sense as the present cannot be altered by an action in the future. But images of General Thade were on display everywhere indicating he was a hero in the past. It just cannot be put together to make sense and that's why I hated it so much.",Planet of the Apes
729,minsart_alain,Planet of the Apes,5,9 February 2005,"Let me first start of by saying Tim Burton is a visionaire, he has proved that over and over with films like Beetlejuice and Edward scissorhands, etc... but as far as telling this classic tale he kind of got lost along the way in expressing his vision on this tale. Resulting in the end in having more and more beautiful pics and awesome action cut scenes but the story stays behind, and even though the actors do put on a great show, as we can see that Tim Roth is on a roll while portraying a vicious Ape General, even a bit over the sadistic side. But nevertheless it is an OK flick, just that when u expecting the great story told in the novel u would come out deceived.But for pure entertainment reasons I would go for it",Planet of the Apes

I could have made a better Planet of the Apes movie myself, blindfolded, with both hands tied behind my ankles. After having seen this movie I am truly convinced that for Tim Burton, Edward Scissorhands is about as good as it gets. I don't understand how the industry continues to applaud and lavish this director with accolades. He just simply isn't all that good of a director. And he proves it time and time again. I remember when this movie came out in theaters. I knew better than to waste my time or money to go see it or to even rent it on DVD later on. I just got done watching it on TV a few moments ago. It's about adequate for TV, but only just barely. However, I've seen TV shows better than this movie. So that should say something. I won't waste anymore time critiquing this movie other than just to say this: don't bother with this re-make, do yourself a big fat favor, go and rent the 1968 original instead, or better still, buy it. You'll be glad you did!",Planet of the Apes
731,zygoticmynci,Not all that bad.,6,4 January 2011,"I'm going to be one of the few to say that this movie is not as bad as everyone makes out. I often feel that people just jump on the bandwagon when they slate it, especially the hardcore Burton fans. It's certainly not a great movie, nor is it a bad one.Visually it's amazing, as with any Burton film. The sets are spectacular, the CGI is convincing and not burdensome and the ape make-up/costumes look truly realistic and in some cases, menacing, particularly the character of Thade. Danny Elfman's musical score is suitably brooding and savage and I think the slew of weird percussion sounds is inspired. The acting is good, with stand-out performances from Tim Roth, who is the perfectly grotesque Burton villain, and Paul Giamatti, providing light relief.The story and script seem to be the main culprits for all the controversy. I actually like the fact that there is little dialogue. Sometimes movies suffer when there is too much dialogue, as it just becomes convoluted. Although Planet of the Apes is nowhere near as profound as Kubrick's 2001, this is the perfect example of 'pure cinema'. There is not one word of dialogue until 40 minutes into the film. Not everything needs to be explained with dialogue, a picture paints a thousand words, as the saying goes. As for the ending, it's more true to the novel. I will say that the Ape Lincoln memorial makes a mockery of the film, which is a fabrication and NOT in the novel. Although there is humour throughout the film, the ending loses its impact as a result of Burton's outlandish joke.",Planet of the Apes

733,jeffladda,The Remake utterly failed to set the tone of the Original Cinematic Masterpiece,2,25 January 2021,"How to describe what's so disappointing in this movie? Others have described many of those points so ill not go into them here, but for me, what ruined the remake was the crash landing.In the remake, the main character, astronaut Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) crash lands on an unknown planet into a jungle!
Compare this to the original where astronaut Taylor (Charlton Heston) and his crew crash land into a bleak desert, its awe and desolation so well portrayed that it firmly set the tone for the movie going forward, add to that the brilliant sound effects during the various desert scenes, and the tone stayed with you until the very last scene of this cinematic masterpiece!In the remake, the jungle landing instantly deflated expectations, and drowned the tone in the swampy shallow waters of the cramped confines of the dense jungle foliage. While the tone was artfully and carefully developed in the original, where the astronauts spent some days traversing this vast eerie desert, cleverly building up expectation and and a certain level of suspense, the remake assumed the audience has no attention span, and immediately sends astronaut Leo to the ape city just a short walk away from his crash site.From there, one scene runs to another, as the plot and setting is further dumbed down.
One final note: The Forbidden zone in the remake is hiding what is more or less a single object, but in the original, the Forbidden Zone conceals an entire ancient civilization. The original far outdoes the remake in scope, vision and refinement. The remake, while it made good effort in ape makeup, cannot hold a candle to the original motion picture, which far excels the remake in practically every category.",Planet of the Apes

Leo Davidson was captured, sold as a slave and escaped on the same day!  How realistic is that?  There were too many unexplained scenes.  Why did the Army Commander kill those two apes that told him about the crash?  How did they know this particular human was from space?  Why did the General switch sides?

Unless we are all turning into little children as adults and need the whole movie pratically explained to us before going to go see it.Anyway, this was a very good version of POTA. I was very pleased and a little surprised at the outcome of the movies ending. They practically gave it away, probably for the slower people who like long trailers.This is very much worth seeing and I hope they get the sequel done by next year.

You will notice if you have seen the originals that several lines of monologue were reproduced for an insider's bit of hilarity. It's a bit flipflopped from the point of view in the first Planet Of The Apes but is memorable in that people having seen the first one recognize these quotes immediately. The first and last quotes by the human astronaut(after capture and escape) in the first film are reproduced from an ape's perspective in this latest one. For example, ""get your paws off me you damn dirty ape"" has been reinvented as ""get your hands off me you damn dirty human"". Also, the famous ""damn them, damn them all"" was used by the same actor but in an ape role. All Hail, Charles Heston.K1",Planet of the Apes

The characters behaved in a more realistic manner other than the first one which just humans dressing up in ape suits.The ending was a disappointment to me.  When I first heard they were going to do the Planet of the Apes again, I thought to myself ""here we go again the movie will end with human hero of the picture in front of a monument with Earth being conjured by the Apes"".  This is what I expected from the beginning, when I walked in the movie theatre, all the way through the picture, and at the end when the space craft landed.  I heard that the movie wasn't going to be a remake, the picture took place on another planet and the ending was going to be shocking.  I was personally waiting, hoping and praying for a different ending to the picture that would be surprising and shocking.  So much for that idea.

739,VerbalK-4,Think back to when you first heard the news...,3,29 July 2001,"When I first heard they were going to ""re-imagine"" the original Planet of the Apes I just about freaked out. It is impossible. The original has such an intense impact. It works because the viewers are expected to suspend disbelief at least a little bit in order to really feel the power of the movie. The original runs more like a parable or an urban legend than it does a believable action movie. This was also in a time where almost all movies and TV shows were done in the same vain- look at Alfred Hitchcock films, The Twilight Zone, and even Welcome Back Kotter - the list goes on and on. In this day and age people want to criticize the reality of everything and the filmmakers(and TV producers) see that as a challenge. This fact makes Planet of the Apes(2001) fail. I admit that after finding out Tim Burton and Danny Elfman (both of whom I am a gigantic fan) were on board I got very excited. I believed it might be done properly. I knew it couldn't be done but still got suckered in. After seeing it I realised that what I knew all along really was true. The costumes and makeup were perfect and so were the sets but there is no denying that this movie falls flat where the other made it's mark - the ending. They did pretty good with the story by putting a whole new twist on the origin of the Planet of the Apes, but in the end it all turned sour. When I first watched the original I thought of how they were going to end it and there was a certain ending that I (and many others) thought of that would make the movie stupid and very cliche. Thank god they didn't do it and instead made history. Unfortunately the new version of this movie has the EXACT twist ending we were afraid of seeing in the original. Very stupid, very easy and worst of all VERY unimaginative. I was actually cringing in my seat hoping they wouldn't end it the way they did. All I can say is ""Bummer"".",Planet of the Apes
740,hifidigitalboy,*sigh* I think I want to cry,1,28 July 2001,"This was a BIG disappointment.  I want to cry because I am a huge Tim Burton fan and I have never been disappointed until now.  As everyone will agree, the visual effects and the makeup are amazing.  Rick Baker and crew deserve yet another Oscar.  However, this is where the compliments end.  Let's go down the list of things that I have a problem with:(1) The first 10-15 minutes on the space station looked too much like Buck Rogers for my taste.  Everything was too sanitized and too white. The acting made matters worse especially when it comes accompanied by lines like ""Never send a monkey to do a man's job.""(2) There was a long period after this where I was happy.  Once he landed on the planet things got better until they reached Calima and it turned for the worse.  Does anyone actually buy the idea that a 3,000 year old piece of equipment that crashed from space would work?  Oh yeah, that's right!  It's NUCLEAR powered.  I guess that the equipment itself would never corrode or rust.(3) Okay... the rest of the humans show up because they heard about the amazing human that will save them.  Uh?  Did I miss something?  Did he do something amazing that I'm not aware of?  At least in the original, Charlton Heston was the only human that could speak.  This ability made him stand out from the rest.  In this version, all humans could speak.  What's so great about Marky Mark?  That's right, he ""came from the stars"" to save them all.(4) Does anyone else find it extremely cheesy that a chimpanzee lands in a spaceship and saves the day?  Ridiculous.(5) The ending reminded me too much of ""Conquest of..."" and ""Battle for..""

And to boot, Estella Warren has like 10 lines in the movie - she's basically Darth Maul all over again, but with a supermodel body instead of a lightsaber. Character development, which is crucial to any good story, is completely lacking - some characters sort of get a real cheesy and formulaic revelation near the end, but the hero and antagonist stay the exact same throughout the whole movie.Sure, everyone's saying ""well, they were up against a lot when they decided to re-make an old classic,"" which is true, but they didn't make a good movie - they just took the standard sci-fi / horror / action movie plotline and put apes in the place of villans.

If nothing else, Tim Burton's new APES carries the torch in this respect- even though I knew what was coming, the gorillas, orangutans and assorted other talking simians repeatedly raised the hair on my own neck, especially Tim Roth's incredibly athletic and menacing Thade.  On top of that, Burton manages to throw in quite a bit of humor, including some goofball nods to the original APES. The sets of course are magnificent, and so are the makeup and effects.  The SciFi sensibility of this version, however, is lacking (especially compared to how far ahead of its time the original was).  The beginning of the film has a rushed feel to it, and there are some plot holes regarding space travel and basic physics that will turn off many hardline SciFi fans.  All in all, though, summer audiences don't ask too much of their summer blockbusters, and this one delivers on that count.  Never a dull moment, lots to look at, and the simians in this version are a LOT more ape-like.

So, I wasn't going into this movie expecting to not have any ""cult-classic"" expectations dashed upon the rocks.  I was hoping that 1) This film earned its ""Directed by Tim Burton"" tag, 2) I wanted a half-way intelligent story, and 3) I wanted to marvel at the monkey (excuse, me, *ape*) makeup.Let me take those points in reverse.  You've probably heard that the makeup is incredible.  Well, it is.  Different species of simians are represented, from baboon to monkey to chimpanzee, and the ""evolved"" forms represented in the movie are pulled off well.  But it would be for naught if the actors themselves couldn't ""get into character.""  Let me tell you, the ape cast did superb jobs.  Mr. Roth, playing the villain general Thade, should get an award; his imitations of simian mannerisms (pawing of his comrades, wild vine-climbing screeching fits of anger) were spot-on.  Helena Botham-Carter kept up with her costar in her role of human beneficiary; she would toggle back and forth between heated intelligent arguments on the worth of humans and ""ooh ooh ooh ah! ah! aaahh!""-ing when she'd panic.  Ok, that's exaggerating, but you get the idea.Story-wise?  Ehh... I think I would have liked it better if we were focused on the monkeys rather than the ""spaceman"".  Mark Wahlberg (sp?) was decent, but he was a bit rough in some parts, and when the movie trailed behind him and his rag-tag bunch as they fled the city, it dragged.  When the focus switched back to the apes (especially Thade), you had interesting dialog exchanges, wonderful acting, and a generally more interesting movie.
Are you going to this movie to see a Tim Burton movie?  ... Well, you *may* be disappointed somewhat.  I didn't get the Tim Burton feel like I did watching ""Sleepy Hollow"".  But if you go in simply expecting to see a well-directed movie, you'll probably like it better.  Burton fans need to draw their own conclusions, but it felt like the movie was being directed by someone else, though someone equal to the task.Bottom line: It's not the best film.  But it's a good film.  I didn't feel like I wasted $7.00 seeing it in the theater.  I hope you don't, either.

752,steveryan77,I Never Imagined It Could Be So Bad,1,17 August 2001,"Planet of the Americans - This is what happens when you take a film with substance and put it through the hollywood machine.   Buy the best special effects - the respected director - the British Act-ToRRs - the composers - the make-up and the most hyped STAR.This film was agonising to watch.  It was as though someone had fed the plot summary into an American English word processor and pressed the button ""Generate Script"".Classic lines such as ""I'm having a bad hair day"" , ""C'mon Guys! Let's Go, I have an idea, We've only got one shot!"" and ""OK kiddies who wants some asprin""This film was Dumbed Down for its (12) rating which must surely be referring to the IQ of the writer.  So entirely predictable were the plot twists that I almost fell asleep.I give this movie Zero.",Planet of the Apes
753,GPL,Infused with political undercurrent.,4,29 April 2002,"There's only one thing worse than paying $8.50 for a movie that has an axe to grind:  a movie with APES doing the axe-grinding.It's hard enough to suspend one's disbelief and get into this whole farce based, essentially, on Darwinistic evolution (which in itself is nothing more than ideological dogma, rather than anything truly scientific).  But to believe, in a ""relativistic universe,"" where we all supposedly evolved by pure chance without intelligent design nor moral purpose, a BEAST like an ape is going to develop a moral sense and espouse a knowledge of ""right and wrong"" (where this came from is never stated) is just laughable.  And this is almost how the movie comes off.I would have been more able to suspend my disbelief had the apes--ALL the apes, been truly beasts.  It would have been horrific and been, FINALLY, this remake's only shot at equalling (let alone improving over) its 1968 original by creating a more potent nightmare.  Instead, it tries to re-create the original's formula--as if any of us would still be ""oh'd"" by the notion that this ""actually could happen.""Been there, done that.So, instead of exploiting the truly hellish potential of this concept, we are constantly reminded that this is a remake.  No risks are taken.  No opportunity missed to ""sensitize our political ignorance"" (thanks, Ms. Ape). For lessons on creating a masterful (read 'believable') science-fiction world, the makers should have studied Ridley Scott's ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER, or Cameron's TERMINATOR series.",Planet of the Apes
754,Dr Dave-2,What the hell?!,1,27 August 2001,"Well, this film is Planet of the Apes in name alone.  Well, and the fact that it's about a Planet.  With Apes on it.  For anyone who has read the book, the original book, you'll know what I mean.  It bares no relation whatsoever to the original premise.  The humans talk (wtf?) and the apes appear to have evolved from genetically modified chimps in a few thousand years (yes, all of them.  Including the Orangs and Gorillas.  There are two types of chimp too).  The defined political structure has also been chucked out the window.  And the ending?  What the hell is that meant to be?Anyway, if you haven't seen the originals (been on Soror for 100 years or something) and haven't read the book, then you might as well see this.  The acting is good, and it's semi decent if you don't care about the original stuff.  There are some good moments and nice SFX.  But, it's tripe.  Next thing you know there will be a Star Wars film set in 1960's Chicago...",Planet of the Apes
755,snepsts,Nothing to go ape about,6,4 August 2001,This movie was a real letdown.  I was expecting so much more from Tim Burton.  All this movie did for me was help me to appreciate the original that much more.  Whatever it was that made the original movie work is absent in this remake.  Burton's 'Planet of the Apes' is a rental at best.,Planet of the Apes
756,mike the degenerate,Throughly Disappointing (Warning!!!! Spoilers!!!!),4,1 August 2001,"As a fairly big fan of both the original Apes movies and Tim Burton, not to mention the novel, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham-Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, etc, I had high hopes going into this movie. I don't think I could have been more let down.I, unlike many others, will back up my feelings. What is the sense of setting up the big battle between Apes and Humans if it's not going to happen? It's a complete waste of screen time.As for the ending, I suppose that Burton and/or the studio wanted to have something of the shock value that the Statue of Liberty had in the original and set themselves up for a franchise of sequels, but this one ruins all logical sense of the movie. If Leo traveled back in time instead of forward (That's what I took the ending to mean, anyways...) how did human civilization exist BEFORE the Apes'? How were there guns before guns were invented? And how do apes believe in Hell before Dante wrote the Inferno? As in ""Damn them to Hell.""",Planet of the Apes
757,obisteffs,Doesn't earn its moments.,5,27 July 2001,"The original Planet of the Apes was a brilliant satire of human nature that touched upon such themes as how man treats animals, how science being led by religion leads to nothing, and of course mankind's ability to destroy themselves. Every moment in the film was earned through a slow and effective pacing, good dialogue, and a horrific visual ending that put a chilling exclamation mark on everything the movie had been saying throughout.Tim Burton's new Planet of the Apes valiantly tries to make some of these same points again but never lets it sink effectively in our minds due to choppy dialogue, non-existent characterization, and a tacked on ending that will again cause a lot of discussion. But not in the way the filmmakers intended.The good parts of this film are how it plays with your expectations of the original. Hearing some of the classic Apes lines said in a new way gives the audience some laughs. Charleton Heston plays with his own role by being an ape in this film, and getting to talk about some of the film's best themes of humanity's power of invention and destruction. (I'm sure Heston never imagined being in another Apes movie, especially after convincing the producers of the original series to let him blow up the planet...) The apes themselves are reimagined in a spectacular way. The different species are more noticable and the primal way they move and interact with one another is better in the original making them seem more animal like. Some of the plot is revealed in effective and believable, at least as much as can be for a film of this type, ways. The setup of the film is compelling and effective enough. Which unfortunately makes the payoff more dissapointing.The bad parts of the film start to show up as more and more characters begin interacting. Characters are introduced in as simple of terms as possible. Their is no shading of these characters. Characters also seem to come to grips with difficult choices, change their views of the world, or suddenly change character with no effort at all. All this seems to stem from what seems to me to be someone wanting to show us 'cool moments' and then not knowing what to do with the characters after. SPOILERS: Examples being when an ape gets a human girl as a pet. Our heroes rescue the girl and then LEAVE THEM WITH THE APES! If you don't want your daughter around apes, don't leave them with them. Characters dies with no effect on anyone. Apes scar one another with no explanation really given other then to create a 'cool visual moment' later in the film. Suddenly a character becomes rebellious and almost ruins our heroes chances. Since this wasn't effectively established into a character I liked, or let alone noticed. I didn't care and really hoped the apes would get him. An ape's entire religion changes in a split second and it doesn't seem to effect him. The secret of the planet can work, but is highly, highly unlikely given the information shown to us onscreen. And where do the horses come from? The only explanation for them at all is that they were in the original so they should be in this remake. But having horses in the original makes sense. The climax feels very by the numbers with a huge fight scene that plays too messily. And we have our hero kiss both women, way to make a choice screenwriters. And the ending is the worst of these 'cool moments' of all. A shock ending was written just to have a shock ending. I know the ending is true to the original novel but the original novel didn't really earn that ending anyways. This film earns it even less. The original film's ending was truly an extension of everything proceeding it. This ending will cause a lot of division among filmgoers.In the end Planet of the Apes has some great makeup, great physical acting with the way everyone moves, and honestly some cool little moments. But it's script is a great example of bad big budget filmmaking. Huge plot holes that are created through the need for 'cool moments'. With the original film being such a great insight into human nature bringing to the big screen the idea that we are able to destroy ourselves the only thing this film shows us is that Hollywood also has the ability to destroy themselves.",Planet of the Apes
758,Daryk_Stone,The Ending Destroyed the Movie!,4,16 December 2001,"My father bought it on DVD and I watched it with him. The movie was quite good right up to the ENDING!!! The ending basically ruined the movie. If they ended it totally differently, It would have been an awesome ending. The Ending came out of nowhere when all they had to do was end it with Mark Whalberg crashing into his mother ship to make the cycle complete!",Planet of the Apes
759,Wholst,The little movie that could... but didn't.,5,27 July 2001,"Planet of the Apes has many things going for it.  The first three are the creative minds of Tim Burton (director), Rick Baker (Make-up), and Danny Elfman (Music).  The sets and locations work well with the costuming and make-up to give this an original look and an authentic feel even though it is a remake.  The cinematography and music work well together because neither one overshadows the other making the combination very powerful.
The acting was good and I must take my hat off to Helena Bonham Carter and to Tim Roth who did exceptional in their portrayals.  The supporting cast didn't stand out like Carter or Roth, but they did a good job of holding their own ground.  Mark Wahlberg's character, Leo Davidson, is the classic military hero who never shows too much emotion because he is trying to stay in control of the situation.  It almost seems that if Wahlberg weren't an actor, he would have actually been this guy.  Estella Warren's character could have easily weighed down the movie by being the typical sexy woman, but thankfully Burton never really draws attention to her in that way: we know she's beautiful, but we don't need to waste 20 minutes of the movie proving it.  She doesn't have any dense lines bent at attracting Wahlberg or any slow motion shots of her character taking a hot bath.  Instead Estella Warren does a good job of playing a character simply caught in the story and reacting in a realistic way.  A personal favorite part of mine was the cameo appearance of Charlton Heston, who almost has the same classic line that he had in the original.The story, though shaky at the beginning, quickly regains its composure and holds the audience's attention.  Once upon the actual planet, there are many satirical references to the way our society has treated animals, the environment, and each other (in cases of slavery).  It is this ability of holding a mirror to society that has made Burton a genius in his craft. Even though the storyline is a tad simple and any audience member can guess or just about guess how the whole story transpired, it doesn't matter because we are trapped in this world and we become interested in the characters interaction with each other.The ending is what could have wrapped up the entire experience into a good movie but didn't.  The last ten minutes of the movie was a horrible attempt at a twist ending.  If you watch closely you can see the movie end, but for some reason, another whole ending is added.  The problem with the second twist ending is that there is no bridge that connects this ending with the rest of the movie, so instead of discovering an ending you didn't even know you were looking for, you leave the theater thinking `Ummm ok, that doesn't make very much sense.'  The storyline should take you from point A to point B, but the ending tells you that you are actually at point C and doesn't attempt in any way, shape, or form to explain how you got there.I gave this movie a 5 because it has the attempt, it just doesn't have the follow through.",Planet of the Apes
760,Sybok,Don´t forget it is a FANTASY movie,7,8 September 2001,"WARNING! Don´t read if you didn´t see the movie yet!At first I have to say that I didn´t see the original movie yet (shame on me!) but I don´t consider this to be important for this review. As I´m a Tim Burton-Fan, I had to watch the new ""Planet of the Apes"" - and I liked it.It is a great movie, full of fantastic pictures - the great comic-style, which I love Tim Burton for. The soundtrack is perfect, the special effects are great and , what is the most important: the story is very entertaining and full of suspense.Of course, as many of you did, you could ask many logical questions as: - Why are there horses on the planet? - Why are there different races? - How is it possible for a few humans and two apes to ride through a complete camp of aggressive apes? - Why does the chimp land exactly at the moment when Leo is about to lose his fight? - How is it possible for a small spaceship, to fly from the planet of the apes back to the earth? And why does it only take three minutes? - Why does Estella Warren wear lipstick? - Why is the earth full of apes at the end?I read many questions like this, and of course there are many more you could ask! But please don´t forget, it is a fantasy movie! A fantasy movie doesn´t need to be realistic, and it also doesn´t want to be!Nobody asks why it is possible to hear noises, when space ships in Star Wars shoot at something - although it is impossible to hear noises in space! A fantasy movie lives of exaggerations! Why do you always bother about realism in fantasy films? If you want to watch a realistic movie, then you should watch a drama or something, but no fantasy or science-fiction movie! - Or at least, don´t wonder about exaggerations!Of course it was not a perfect movie. Mark Whalberg really didn´t act very well, and I often asked myself why Estella Warren is in this movie. She is always in the middle of the plot, looking beautiful but speaking only five sentences over the whole movie.But altogether it was a very nice movie. I will have to buy the DVD as soon as it is available!Therefore 8 out of 10.Well, I think I will watch the original movie soon, but I´m not looking forward to compare the movies!",Planet of the Apes

762,lunchboxboy,Summer movie filler...could've been better with more thought and time...,4,31 July 2001,"A summer movie, popcorn, bad script and cool FX...The Make-up creations by Rick Baker kicked butt!!! But I cannot recommend the 'new' version of 'Planet of the Apes' even for that point. Tim Burton has helmed a film that has the 'taint' of 'HOLLYWOOD' all over it...I was expecting a PIZZA HUT box to show up on the obvious sets...Everyone involved has simply hacked it out...besides the rightious make-up, the only other noteworthy aspect of the film is the decent acting by the actors playing APES...(Especially Tim Roth as the main villian...he was very menacing...) those without make-up had little or nothing to do. Sitting down and thinking it over, I realized that I hated seeing this film, and hope that Tim Burton and all involved will have better luck on their next projects...I'd rather watch 'Dude where's my car?' that sit through this big budget hooey again...4 out of 10",Planet of the Apes
763,rjosulli,Had a lot going for it... but ultimately failed,3,23 August 2001,"I just saw this film (takes a while to come out in Ireland).. and while the special effects were generally excellent, the film was extremely unconvincing.possible SPOILERS to follow:From a technical viewpoint there were many weaknesses, the number of apes in the army? In the initial marching scene there were tens of thousands, which then became about 50 in the all-out melee in front of calima. The fuel cell is another contentious point (one was full and it only managed a light fricassee of the apes... how did the ship move with only 3 of them?). I can forgive a few inconsistencies, but eventually they add up, and I'm left with the feeling that the makers just didn't care. I did feel that the movement of the apes was done very well, the slightly sideways walk, and the many gestures, sniffs and twitches were excellent.In the acting front, Tim Roth was excellently psycopathic... but ALL the time. There was no break even when talking to his father which gave the character a very 2-Dimensional, overly aggressive feeling. The romantic feelings of Helena Bonham-Carter towards our dashing hero was puzzling... surely monkeys find us as sexually attractive as we find them?Estella Warrens part was almost painful, her short dress and revealing top, coupled with very few lines made her simply a female to ogle. The film then attempts to strap on a romantic involvement with Mark Wahlberg at the end? Is there something we've missed? or is he simply regretting not having sex with her.The end, without saying what it was, was overly depressing, and pretty much expected.. what did he think? That going back into a highly unstable random time-jumping storm would bring him home? Oh well...I had high hopes for planet of the apes before I saw the ads (Tim Burton has produced many excellent films).. but I was disappointed with some glaring goofs, some fairly weak plot elements and some confusing characters.",Planet of the Apes
764,fezzick,Well Done but poorly acted.,3,27 July 2001,"It seems the actors in this movie were so busy portraying apes that they forgot how to deliver a line. Tim Roth over-acted completely, start to finish, and Michael Clarke Duncan under-acted. The ending is also completely out in left field; come on, would the apes really have evolved EXACTLY like we did? I don't think so. Okay, I've just listed all of the flaws with this movie that I can think of. Otherwise, it was well choreographed and had a decent plot. Even Mark Wahlberg did a good job.  I think, given the ending, a sequel will be ridiculous, but there's not much that can be done there. Go see the movie, though. 7 out of 10 stars.",Planet of the Apes
765,justinmorrison,Best movie ever!,9,29 July 2001,"Well, not really... but it was a lot of fun.  For all those who didn't like it, I'm curious what you were expecting.  Did you really expect a movie about angry talking monkeys to be a masterpiece?  Yes, it has it's flaws, but for the most part was well executed.  Tom Rothwas pure evil, some have said that he was ""too evil"", but isn't that the point of a super-villain?  His character was over the top, and I loved it.  The only real flaw for me was that Mark Whalberg kept slipping into Dirk Diggler, but I was able to ignore him for most of the film.  As for the ending, it was great.  I don't think that it was supposed to be logical, so stop whining!  It was a great over the top way to end an over the top film/concept.  So...go see it, expect to be entertained, not educated and you will love it!",Planet of the Apes

So I finally see it and when I came out of the theater I was very surprised about the ending it made me wonder like most people, but I won't say any more don't want to spoil it. Tim burton has done again just like with all of his other movies he has made in the past this one i think tops them all in my opinion his movies are in a eyecandy way oh and don't let me forget about the great Danny Elfman his music it so great I bought the soundtrack the next day, but I must say it's better then the original I mean Rick Baker did such a fantastic job on the make-up you would sometimes forget that those are actors up their with all this make-up on. I know that some people wouldn't agree but i hope that there is another Planet of The Apes so to speak sequel I would only see it only if Tim Burton direct's it.

The film s biggest flaw is that some characters are just plain useless. Especially the boy who always wants to help Leo and Leo's love interest ( he talks to her like 3 times in the whole movie!).On the plus side the acting is pretty good, the special effects are A+ and the ending, while it doesn t have the same impact the original had, wont disappoint you.

Burton's version of ""Planet of the Apes"" is just as good, if not better than the original idea. He adds just the right mix of action, adventure, and comedy in the movie, making it a thoroughly enjoyable experience throughout. As for Charlton Heston's cameo...that almost made the whole movie for me...absolutely classic. Tim Roth does a fantastic job as Thade, the evil leader of the Ape Army, and the costumes and effects are simply amazing. The ending was an interesting piece...leaving some I know confused.

771,filmundur,"not Burton´s best, but not bad",7,24 September 2001,"I must say that I was very dissapointed when I saw this film. The ""re-imagine"" concept just does not work in the movies (just ask Gus Van Sant). But I thought Burton might make it work. Well, I was wrong. I adore Burtons work and in my personal opinion he is Hollywood´s greatest director, but that does not mean that I love every piece of celluloid that he comes in contact with. POTA has some potentials but somehow they just fizz out. You can never stop asking yourself ""Why?"" Why make a remake of a near perfect film? If POTA 2001 would have been the first ape film, this might have been hailed as a great film. The fact simply is that we have seen this before. And what what is Burton doing with a comic relief?! Limbo is doing the same for this movie as Jar Jar did for Episode one! He is to much, to ""haha funny"" and should have been killed when the humans escaped. But no, we have to endure him throughout the whole film! The movie does have some good points though. First of all it has Tim Roth. He is without a doubt the best actor in this film and his ape impression is at times very frightening. The sets, costumes and everything in that department was impeccable, in a Burtonian way. There have been some who say that the make up in this film is no better than in the original. That is pure nonsense. I am inclined to think that these people are only blinded by some hate of Burton and his POTA and for fouling the memory of the original that they can´t give credit where credit is due! The makeup in this movie is sheer brilliance. The movement of the actors lips are now visible and so are other discreet features. This is better make up and saying otherwise just underlines that some people can´t judge films without letting feelings cloud there judgement. Last words. See the film at least two times. The initial shock wears off an you like it better the next time.",Planet of the Apes

775,Mike Holmes,A perfect translation,10,28 July 2001,"I have no idea how people could bash a movie like this. Movies like these (ESPECIALLY Sci-Fi movies) are very rare, and i must admit, when I was walking into the theatre, I thought this was going to be an awful movie ripping off the previous ""Planet of the Apes"". I was so wrong.The movie starts off with Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) in a USAF Starbase that experiences a strange nebula. The captain sends out one of Leo's monkeys to explore the nebula, but they lose contact with the monkey. Leo jumps in another spaceship and goes looking for the monkey (Which was very strange in the beginning, but they had to get him on the planet somehow, I guess). When he gets trapped in the nebula, he goes forward in time and lands on an alien planet (Unlike the previous movie, where Leo lands on a futuristic earth). He encounters a group of humans who are running from the apes. Leo is very confused, which becomes a major point for the beginning of the movie.The film is a direct remake from the original, but is much darker, thanks to the wonderful directing of Tim Burton. He captured the atmosphere from the previous film perfectly, but he also added a bit of an extra touch by making the apes seem much more menacing. The performances aren't Oscar-worthy, but they aren't bad (Including Mark Wahlberg, who I think was always a good actor since his starring role in the movie ""Boogie Nights), and the make-up by Rick Baker is sure to get him an Academy Award. The music by Danny Elfman is amazing (Including the opening theme, which in my opinion is probably one of my top 5 themes) and it perfectly captures the atmosphere in the movie. But probably the most controversial point in the movie is the ending. It was either you understood it, or you didn't. Luckily, I was one of the people that understood it, and it almost made the movie for me. But without spoiling any of the ending, let me just say this: It's very sequel-friendly (Which in my case is a good thing)Review: ****1/2 / *****",Planet of the Apes
776,kjartanthor,The planet of unoriginality (SPOILERS),4,7 September 2001,"I have to admit that this ""re-imagining"" of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment. Specially when taken into consideration that this is a Tim Burton film. He is defenetly one of the most original and, might I say, cool directors Hollywood has produced.I am personally a great fan of his work, but something obviously went wrong with his latest flick, The Planet of the Apes. I really enjoyed the original film. When it first came out people expected just another cheezie 70's science fiction film, but a very surprise anding totally proved that theory wrong. It had indeed a clear cut message. An obvious anti-war message. Fear of the cold war, where it was taking the world and fear of the use of nuclear weapons played a big role in the mind of the film-makers. Those reasons made the film rise above all expectations and it became a instant classic. Although, the new film, the ""re-making"" or whatever, leaves us with nothing. No message, no ideals behind it. It is just another money-minded summer blockbuster.Visually Tim Burton does not let you down. The dark and creepy settings were excellent and of course the make up was terrific.Obviously that is not enough to keep people intrested in a film. There has to be an exciting plot or storyline. In this movie the plot is highly uninteresting and it is extremely badly thought out. The script is very lame and it is full of gaps. It looks like this film had been written in a big hurry. The explanation for why the apes where there, and why the ruled the planet was indeed very stupid and proved the script-writers ignorance.It raised a lot of questions, which had no reasonable answers to.For example; Why did the apes speak English?, why were there other ape-species than chimps on the planet (given that there were only chimps in the space ship that crash-landed on the planet) Where the hell did all of those humans come from? How were a few chimps able to evolve into a huge raise of all kinds of monkeys in only a few thousands years. (I mean it took a few million years for us to evolve from monkey to man!)And finally, the bad surprise ending was just plane dumb. It was probably just thrown in because the original film had such an  end, then they felt that the audience were expecting the same kind of ending. The ending also raises a lot of questions, which I KNOW, don´t have intelligent answears. Did Theid learn to work the space ship?, which was power-less, and learnt to fly back in time and take over the earth single hand?, and, what did he do, breed with all the women? And lets say that that would happen, I higly doubt that history would stay the same, like Washington would be built exactly like it is today! (I mean wouln't there be a huge banana instead of the memorial?)Well, just to say something posative about  the film. Some of the cast was great. Helen Bonham Carter's character was interesting and well-acted, as for Tim Roth as Theid. He was very good, a little exaturated at some points of the film. Michael Clark Duncan  was also fine. I was not happy with Marc Whalberg. He is not much of an actor, and plays here a very macho colour-less character. Very unbielevable and is nothing compared to Hestons character in the original. And the main female character had no reason or place in the film. She was just casted for the looks. Hardly said a word throughout the entire film.Well, I think that in the future when people think about the Planet of the apes, they will think about the original one. The latest will soon be forgotten.",Planet of the Apes
777,MichaelFunk,"Good film, awful remake",6,28 July 2001,"""Planet of the apes"" was good film, it was not a great film like the 1968 classic and in fact it was horbble remake. Most of you  have probbly seen the original ""Planet of the Apes"" so i wont bother explaining the plot. But while I was watching this remake I was wandering, why did Tim Burton direct this? As I said this was a good film but, Tim Burton has directed some great films like ""Edward Scissor Hands"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"" It should have been directed by somebody else since this was a remake the whole movie was laid out, so Tim Burtons brains were wasted. But still it is a good popcorn movie witch can be viewed by the entire family.",Planet of the Apes
778,puzzleman-1,The only thing I didn't like about this movie was what the adolescent character was asked to do.,6,30 July 2001,"I recently saw this movie and was surprised to find a line.  This was the first time I had ever waited in a line to see a movie.  It was especially noteworthy because I live in a moderate size town. The stuntmen in this movie seem to be trying out for ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  At the same time they made it look very simian.  I thought this movie was well done.  It is a little too dark most of the time but I'm pretty sure this is on purpose.  There is one problem with this movie that I noticed.  Actually I've been noticing it for years.  That problem is the adolescent actor (in this case Luke Eberle).  For the past years both televison and Hollywood have written two main types of characters for adolescent actors.  In the first type the adolescent character is told to: go in the house, go over there, etc.  Why is it that the ""adult"" actors are afraid for the adolescent characters to be an integral part of the defense of the home or whatever the movie entails.  The second type is where the adolescent character either is allowed to help or just does.  However, the ""adult"" character either has to fix what the adolescent character did or save the adolescent character from death etc.  This movie is no different.  In it the Luke Eberle character is basically told to go hide by Mark Wahlberg.   The Luke character then refuses and decides to try and help.  Then in typical fashion the Mark Wahlberg character has to save the Luke character from certain death.  When is the establishment and the ""adult"" actors going to realize that adolescent characters actually can  help in defense situations and many other situations as well?  I realize that many of these adolescent actors have not ""paid their dues"" yet but to me that is a terrible reason to perpetuate a stereotype.  For that is indeed what it is.  So even though this movie perpetuates both of these stereotypes I think it is still a rather good movie.  However, it could have been better had the writers filled the stereotype spot with something important.",Planet of the Apes

It started out very promising, and I certainly enjoyed the crew seeing it's own future transmission.  After that part, though, the movie went completely downhill. Estella Warren, as far as I can tell, was in the movie solely to get young teenage boys to come out to the movie for the eye candy.  The ending was especially bad.  How does Thade exist in 2329 AND 2029.  It just doesn't make any sense, any way you slice it.

Apparently, they rightly felt that this movie couldn't stand on it's own. - Stereotypical bad guy (ape) - Stereotypical good guy( female ape , made up to look like Janet Jackson) - Drags at times. - Gratuitous ""surprise"" ending...not well thought out and inserted merely for the sake of having a surprise ending like the good, first movie.Rent it when it comes out and you'll see what I mean...or better yet, go rent the original.",Planet of the Apes

While the film has a certain awesome visual style-give Rick Baker the Academy Award for Makeup right now-we are constantly challenged to suspend disbelief for shallow plot points and trite dialog. Forget character development. Forget logic and check your brain with your ticket stub. The ending (which I will not reveal here so as not to spoil for those who have not seen yet) is a nightmare.

One thing i cant figure is how a monkey can make a perfect landing on one try and the Air Force pilot crashes twice? Aside from that i enjoyed the movie very much.

And  can you believe it they even hired one of my favorite actors of all time Tim Roth to play a starring role.Now Imagine if you will that it ""stinked""!!!!!They spent millions on elaborate sets and costumes and years in production, just to miss the whole point of the original movie: The ""Planet"" of the Apes was EARTH!

786,hmasing,Oh. My. God.,3,29 July 2001,"This is the movie I have been waiting for 30 years to see, ever since I peeked over the back seat of the station wagon at the drive in theater waiting for Doctor Dolittle (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0061584) to start.  I was five years old, and this was before the days of real ratings.  Besides, the original Apes movie was rated an amazing 'G' as was that other talking animal film we went to see.That said, I was terribly disappointed in the 2001 re-visioning of the 'Planet of the Apes'.  Tim Burton is one of my favorite cutting-edge directors, and Danny Elfman a top composed.  The cast looks excellent - on paper, but in reality the characters are mainly one dimensional and shallow. The possible exception is Helena Bonham Carter as Ari, who at least seemed to have fun playing a rather muppet-like Chimp/Human rights activist. Burton didn't dare go anywhere but the obvious places, and even with the attempt at a surprise twist ending (which left me slack jawed at the sheer disconnectedness of it).  There were so many opportunities to build these characters in an otherwise visually stunning universe.  Would it be bestiality for two sapient members of different species to actually explore their apparent sexual tension that Burton was trying to portray?  Could it have been possible for Daena (Estella Warren) to do anything other than pine and heave her fur-bikinied breasts about?  There was a real opportunity to explore something here that Burton ignored.  And Burton usually hits these on the head.The first ape line of the film made me dread what was an otherwise decent start to the movie.  I won't reveal what it is, but it was too obvious an attempt to try to a) make you laugh, b) set the tone of the film, and c) nod to the original film.Overall, I give this film a 3 out of 10 for an overall impression.  I give Rick Baker a 10 out of 10 for an AMAZING bunch of creatures.  I give Mark Wahlberg (Capt. Leo Davidson) a -2 out of 10 for mailing in his performance and avoiding any sort of commitment to his role.  Helena Bohnam Carter (Ari) gets a 7 out of 10 for her role, and Tim Roth (General Thade) gets 8 out of 10 for being a peeved chimpanzee and a vicious character, and making me truly dislike him.  Or was it the complete shallowness of his character that I hated?  Wait, I give Tim Roth an 8, and I subtract two points from Tim Burton for not allowing such a fine villain to have any depth for a total Tim Burton score of 3 out of 10.  Visually, the film gets 8 out of 10 from me.Nutshell summary:  A mediocre attempt worth seeing for the makeup and soundtrack, and for the uncomfortable laugh at the end when you realize how much Hollywood is spending to produce crap these days.  This film is definitely worth a rental, but save yourself the $8.50 to see it in the theater.",Planet of the Apes
787,spiritgumm,"Remake of ""Fistful of dollars"" using Klingons?",1,31 July 2001,"Tim Roth's ""original"" villian seems to stem from the touchy-feely evil Ramon/Indio villain in ""Fistful of dollars/Few dollars more"" spaghetti westerns (titles which sum up what this remake is all about). The bonanza of great effects make for great entertainment but the lack of a visionary story make this a one-dimensional kid's movie which won't stick in the brain for adults. There is no ""discussion"" on the moral/philosphical place of man in the universe: in the original book/movie, our hero is clearly divided since he neither fits in with the future's primitive humans nor the apes. This version is just another uncompelling ""Us vs. Them,"" and the war-like gorillas sound and look like Klingons in ""Star Trek."" Speaking of gorillas, whom did they evolve from since there were originally only chimps? Where do they live, since there are too many for that hilltown? Where did the modern-speaking humans come from if the caucasian astronauts all died? Why does the blonde babe keep ducking out of scenes - does she have a bladder like a thimble? And are we on earth in the far future or far past? Or another dimension? This last plot problem ruins the great visual ending (try as it might to be like the book's end). The soundtrack also doesn't credit it's inspiration to the better original. For those who absurdly claim we need remakes because kids won't watch the originals, it was we kids who loved the original enough to generate 4 sequels, a live-action and animated TV series, lunch boxes, etc. and inspire Tim Burton.",Planet of the Apes

And the apes in this film were just as good as the characters in the first movie.  Super makeup by Rick Baker and the sets looked fantastic.

First the good - it is visually stunning, as you would expect from a Burton movie; there are a couple of good performances, particularly Helena Bonham Carter who is outstanding. Sadly that's it.Now let's get to the bad and the ugly. The story is so full of plot holes that you'll weep with anger. Didn't anyone bother to read the script? Its nonsense. Characters do things that are obviously absurd and have no internal logic. An example (warning: very minor spoiler), when they get to a river crossing guarded by part of the Ape army, Leo tells us that they can't go around because they don't have time - they have to ride through. But then they wait hours until the dead of night before doing that. The only reason they wait is to make the visuals of the ""ride through the camp"" scene more dramatic. This makes no sense. It is literally nonsense. And don't even get me started on the ending... its meaningless.Its not just one scene, almost every point in the movie is gibberish if you think about it for more than 2 seconds.Beyond that the characterizations are non-existent. Apart from Leo and a couple of the apes, no one has a character. Who on earth are the humans? What motivates them? Would we care about them if they all got thrown into a giant meat grinder? No we would not.What is most annoying is that this could have been a great movie. The visual execution is stunning. The apes look real and move as you would expect an evolved ape to. They must have spent so many hours and so much money on that aspect of the film. Why did they only spend 26 minutes and $2.80 on the script?Finally, however much of a cliche it has become and however cheesy the costumes where, the 1968 film at least tried to be about something and its famous ending was genuinely related to the point of the film and was truly shocking. The new Planet of the Apes has no point; its ending is a crass setup for a sequel. What a waste of a great potential.",Planet of the Apes

You could probably guess what that is by the title of my comment.Battlefield Earth has been panned non-stop by critics all over the world, but is this really much better?  Come on...This film's ending is the most incoherent copout I've seen in years.  The script is completely unoriginal, the action sequences are muddled and unexciting, and the attempts at comedy are cringe-worthy.  Both are big budget mistakes.  The only difference is that this one was successful (and ok...maybe not quite so laughable).  The fact that this film has at this point grossed around $US350 million internationally is a huge indictment on the intelligence of your average human being.  If you haven't seen it yet, don't.  If you want some decent sci-fi entertainment, see Jurassic Park 3.  It may not be the epitome of originality, but at least it delivers what it says it will.Tim Burton was, until this film, a symbol of originality, style, and great black humour, but this could just as easily have been directed by Michael Bay (except he'd probably find some way to sneak in a dogfight between the apes and humans in F-15s so there'd be more explosions).To Mark Wahlberg, pick better projects.To John Travolta, you're finally almost off the hook.",Planet of the Apes

803,DaveBass,Some Ramblings,6,31 January 2003,"CAUTION SPOILERS WITHINHaving just viewed this film last night, it is fresh in my mind and I wanted to make a few observations. Not a review per se, just some thoughts.Although flawed, it does have a few good things going for it. Rick Baker's work is truly amazing. The flexibility of the masks/make up used allows the actors to produce varied, expressive and very believable expressions. Nicely done.Most of the art direction and costume design is creative and well implemented. The ape army is cleverly and boldly realized.The acting, overall, is good, and especially in the case of Tim Roth, David Warner, Michael Duncan, & Helena Bonham Carter. They help create believable, if somewhat two dimensional characters. The lovely Estella Warren does fine in an underwritten role.Danny Elfman's creative score, effectively covers a wide variety of moods ranging through suspense, comedy and militaristic combat themes quite well.And then there's the other side of the coin, an at times interesting, but largely wooden formula driven plot, with dialog suffering from a bad case of pun infestation.A few things that don't work:At no time did I get the feeling that Captain Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) was all that surprised or impressed that he had discovered a culture where apes could talk, and ran the planet. It was sort of like `hmmm, that's odd, talking apes in charge of the world, hey look over there, we don't have oak trees like that on earth, this is INSANE!'And then the escape from the ape city, whose route cleverly goes right through the center of about a half dozen ape houses, `we'll keep running through these houses until we find the forest, its got to be around here somewhere. Once we've checked all the houses we'll start searching for the forest outside.'What's up with people (and apes) flying twenty feet or more through the air when they are struck by any ape (not just the gorillas), not occasionally, but everytime?  The great strength of apes? It would happen on earth. Lower gravity? Then apes would fly when humans struck them. Lots of stuntmen with springboards? Maybe.And then there's that one scene that just defies any logic, and I'm not talking about the `surprise ending'. Its when Captain Leo, wins the battle, brings a new understanding and compassion between apes and humanity, finds himself as the leader of a new world order, and then immediately hops in the space pod to return to earth. WHAT??? I mean, what's the hurry? He knows his crew have been dead for thousands of years, he's just won this planet's version of the Superbowl, the Nobel prize, and been elected President, clearly Estella Warren wants to jump his bones, and even Helena Bonham Carter's Ari is obviously intent on more advanced and exotic interspecies research. Even if he chooses not to lead this world through a new political, cultural & scientific revolution, how about taking some time to smell the roses, you know, a few weeks to gather scientific samples to bring back, to help advance anthropology by studying cross cultural (and species) mating rituals, to work at turning his space pod into a two seater, or to even bring extra food and water for what is likely to be a long and possibly fatal journey?

This movie lacked the intelligence to make it a ""make you think"" film and the action to make it an action film.  It falls somewhere in between.

It was sent on TV and I thought like "" I am going to die along with the movie runtime "" but it was really good. So therefore I thought that Planet of the Apes Redux, or whatever one calls it, would be fun to see. And when I read Tim Burton had directed the whole thing I was even more excited. Edward Scissorhands- director doing a redux of one of the true movie classics, is that great or not.So I saw the movie and I was delighted to see how the masks had got even more realistic. And we also had Mark Wahlberg performing quite good, but alas he did not prove to be better than old Heston of the original. Helena Bonham Carter as sweet ape Ari was perfect for the role but this human-beings-seller in green? A typical sidekick, and I have never liked sidekicks. He has these spot-on comments to the movie's happenings but this true "" evil ape empire ""-feeling at once gets toned down by this fellow.
Tim Roth plays evil ape general Thade, the ultimate bad guy, breathing a little bit like Darth Vader in Star Wars. Michael Clarke Duncan have been showing off for the Apes- posters, so naturally he plays a great role as armyleader Attar.

812,wlmayer-1,Why are sequels rarely as good as the original?,2,25 November 2002,"I was contemplating that question after watching remakes of The Time Machine and Planet of the Apes.  The answer of course is that people always do remakes of good movies. They really should be doing remakes of bad movies, they are ones that need it.And there is no better example of the above then The Planet of the Apes, a movie that is such a pale imitation of the original that I was angry at myself for paying $4 to see it.Tim Burton is a very good director, I'm usually a fan of his work.  But, with this movie he seems to have gotten so caught up with turning actors into monkeys that he lost sight everything else.  The movie has great makeup, but no soul.  It just reeks of being a directors vanity project. This movie far surpasses the original in it presentation of the monkey planet, i.e. make-up, effects, acting, yet is less believeable.Burton also seems to have been so consumed with his monkey cast, he forgot his humans.  It can not go unmentioned how insipid Mark Wahlberg is movie. A potted plant would have held my attention as much as he did.And finally, nothing illustrates the futility of trying to remake this movie then the ""surprise ending"".  Obviously, he couldn't do the same ending as the original, it wouldn't be a surprise.  So it became necessary to come up with something totally different, but would still have the power and impact of the original.  Well, I guess they couldn't think anything so they decided to go with nonsensical instead.  Yes folks, the big surprise is that the movie's ending MAKE NO SENSE!!!

Your answer will be greatly appreciated. The movie is overall good for a fiction but I think can be made with a fantastic story in sequels. I do not think this is a remake of the 69 movie.

I get the feeling that being attached to the star of its namesake is why it saw theatrical release at all.  This thing was mind-numbing.  The characters made no sense, the plot was inane, and the science was terrible.  You can only watch so many scenes of monkeys jumping on each other and pounding.

The ending is much too bizzare to make any conceivable sense, and not even the director could clearly explain it.Though it falls short when it comes to the script and acting, the pace of the film is sporadic, and its clear that Tim Burton didnt give it his all, this is not a bad movie.

I'm not good at judging effects, but I found everything quite believable. On top of it, I loved the atmospheres created (mostly because it is a Tim Burton movie but with less of his usual style).The actors were incredible and sincerely, it was an awesome movie.

(Which are sure to be tied up by the obviously sequel that the end sets up) Mark Walberg's tries to find his monkey and lands on a planet where Monkeys are superior and humans are the lesser primate. The make-up is astounding, and Mark proves to be a pretty good no-brain action star. Tim Roths is a pretty good monkey-gone-bad, but as I said before, this movies too silly to be taken seriously and his intense performance is kind of lost.After it's revealed how the monkeys got the way they were, (and why their English was so good) the plot just get's silly and builds up too a fairly laughable ending. The blond girl, Estelle, isn't bad as far as models-turned-actresses go, but her character serves no purpose other than to give 14 year old boys something to look at. Plus, even with more makeup than the cast of Cats used for 20 years, the best apes-actor is still the real thing, Mark's chimp Pericles, who gives a better performance than half his human-cousins.It's not a bad movie, it's a style-over-substance movie, but then again, so's most everything else that's at the theater.

The fact it that this is a flawed movie, saved by Tim Burton's fantastic Visual Style and Danny Elfmans terrific score. The Cultural references are terrific: but once they are scrutinized further- sure it's unlikely that Apes would develop beautiful armour reminiscent of Ancient Armour worn by Turkish Knight in their religious wars, but man they look terrific and fill this strange world with a rich history and culture! While most merely see ""REMAKE"" up in lights and scoff at Hollywood- the film is more of a tribute to The concept of what Planet of the Apes has become, evolved with the help of fans through a horde of crappy sequels and weak spin off television series to the point where Pierre Boulle and what we know as Planet of the Apes are actually worlds apart. Bravely however, the films controversial finale is not to be taken seriously in any way! The ending which I will not give away, is an homage to many things.It's a tribute to Insane Sci- Fi, The deliberately profound endings to both the original film and Boulle's novel, and having a bit of a chuckle.It's like the Twilight Zone without taking itself seriously in any way.",Planet of the Apes

What I missed the most was the scientific approach that the original had. Showing why the apes' beliefs were covered in lies and why humans actually were intelligent.In this Tim Burton movie it seems he has to add the violence and fighting needed to get the big movie producing budget from 20th Century Fox.In one sequence Leo (played by Mark Wahlberg) points a gun at an ape, but is told to not sink to his level (the ape was a trader-in-humans) by Ari (magnificently played by Helena Bonham-Carter). Yet in the end there is no problem to fight the Ape army in Braveheart-style.The whole magic usually included in Tim Burton movies is never there, and somehow he falls for the blockbuster-syndrome: a cool action-hero and a lot of incredible stunts.And the ending, without spoiling anything, must be the worst ever displayed on the screens.However, the costumes and make-ups are incredible, but they are in line with modern movie-technology. They could give one or two Academy Awards next year. But I don't understand why apes covered in body-hair/fur would want to wear clothing or uniforms. Overall, the great performances by Helena Bonham-Carter as a Senators daughter and revolting youth preaching humanism and equality and Tim Roth as the dangerous and evil general Thade makes this movie a pretty good entertainment and raising the Rating to 5/10.",Planet of the Apes

But the special makeup was incredible, and the mannerisms by the actors seemed so realistic that it blew me away.  Tim Roth is amazing - truly menacing, and wonderfully intense.

The script is tight and moves at a respectable pace.  The acting is above par given the accomplished supporting cast.  Now the downside...Mark Wahlberg isn't a strong enough actor in his own right to carry this film. His character doesn't grow at all from the start to the end.  And speaking of the end; I'm not going to give it away but it made no logical sense in the context of the story that we had been watching for the previous two hours.  I was completely hooked into the movie until this ending that seemed as if it was filmed later and tacked on.

Then, even though the highly trained human pilot crashes not once, but twice, we are expected that the chimp pilot experiences none of the same problems and can land his pod without difficulty.  Why does a cute chimp landing in a space craft make the apes suddenly believe that the humans aren't so bad after all?Then there's the stupid ""suprise"" ending.  The whole movie is based on the premise that the smart apes evolved from genetic engineered apes that crash landed on the planet with the humans.  So why are we supposed to suddenly believe that Leo would crash land in a second parallel world where Washington D.C. looks just like ours, but everybody is an ape instead of a human?

834,Doug Roach,A wasted opportunity,1,21 August 2001,"My expectations prior to this film were high. Being a big fan of the original film I hoped that this new version would come some way near its excellence. In my opinion it came nowhere near. Many key elements of the original were changed, but why? To cater for today's audiences? So as not to be accused of copying the original? If Tim Burton or anyone else could make a decent copy of the original that would be great. Why were all the humans able to speak? The actors who played humans didn't even have anything decent to say so it would have been preferable to have had them mute. Yeah the script was that bad and surely the muteness was an integral part of the original. The film had some 'to be expected' special effects but no substance while the original had very little in the way of special effects and so much more substance. It seems that Tim Burton used the cover of special effects (like so many other film directors these days) to hide a poor script. There are many other aspects of the film which I could comment on but I don't want to give any of the plot away so I'll refrain. I suppose you must expect a remake to be of inferior quality, you only need to look at the vast majority of remakes to know this. This film, unlike its predecessor, will not stand the test of time.

838,moonbat9,Summer of Disappointment My ASS,10,28 July 2001,"Luckily for everyone Planet of the Apes didn't follow Tomb Raider and the many other summer movies into the major disappointment catagory.  Simply put, the latest from Tim Burton is exciting, perfectly paced, and a hoot! Rick Baker's makeup is the most convincing makeup work ever to grace the screen.  The performances by those wearing it is phenomenal.  Tim Roth may be one of the most engaging FX aided villains ever as General Thade.  The story isn't too complicated, nor is it nonexistant as we have come to expect from this summer's crop.  It lacks the predictability that makes so many FX laden movies fall on their face.  This is a movie that will be mixed with critics, mixed with fans of the original (this strays a lot from the classic's elements), extremely popular with young audiences, and worth everyone's dollar at the box office.  Only gripe is the casting of Mark Wahlberg.  He can usually turn in an engaging performance, but he's no Charlton Heston.  The ending is a mind blower, but teeters on a little too confusing.  Yet, you will leave the theater wishing the sequel came out tomorrow!",Planet of the Apes
839,darthjeremy,Interesting...to say the least,6,28 July 2001,"**SPOILERS**I'll start off by syaing that I'm not much for remakes.  I roll my eyes whenever I see a preview for a remake of a classic (i.e. The Time Machine this Christmas).  Nevertheless, I'm in line opening day.  Ever since Elementary School when my Dad made me watch the original Planet of the Apes I've been enchanted by it.  A school friend Robbie told me the ending before I saw it; yet it still captivated me.  The dialogue was a little weak in the original, and the special effects and makeup are a joke now; but they were pearls in the late 60s.  The ending was a mystical cliffhanger that made you want the world to freeze and allow you to just ponder life and our society for a moment.  I commend those actors, they did great back then, but it's just not a movie for the 2000 years and on.  This brings me to the remake. Not many people know, in fact, that both films were remakes of the original French novel by Pierre Boulle.  It upsets me when people call the new one a ""remake"" of the old one.  It's not...It's a new idea on an old book.  I commend Tim Burton.  He did a great job with the futuristic feel of this movie.  Most movies these days do a HORRIBLE job conveying the future. It's better to watch 2001: A Space Odyssey because the effects look reasonable. Take ""The Sixth Day"" for instance.  That movie was nothing but an excuse for Arnold lines and special effects.  They overused the effects, in my opinion, which created an overly-exotic, extremeley wild picture that I couldn't keep controlled.  Our current technology needs to be limited in the display of our future; a fine line George Lucas walked with Episode One.  However, I think Tim Burton did pretty good with not overly-special-effecting this film.  The opening scenes in our not-too-distant future seemed reasonable and not too stretched and wild.  I also really enjoyed the scenes on the space station, in which Tim paralleled our relation to apes with the apes relation to us.  They didn't do this in the original film.  It allowed younger viewerd to more basically understand the parallel between the two relationships.  The one thing I didn't like in the film was the humans. They didn't seem evolutionary-backtracked at all.  They seemed like normal humans who had just been scavenging around for 3,000 years while the monkeys evolved tremendously into an entirely new identity.  The ""Nova"" character, Daena I think, was interesting.  Obviously placed as a sex object, she didn't quite pull off enough of a attraction with Davidson (The ""Taylor"" of the film).  Oh ya, one more thing I didn't like.  The ending, after the struggle with the apes is over, I thought was too rushed.  THey should have slowed it down and taken it a bit steadier.  Otherwise, I loved this movie. The two parallels to the original film were great, and I felt out of place as being one of the only people in the theatre who was laughing at the line ""Get Your Stinking Hands Off Me You Damn Dirty Human.""  Ya so it was corny, it was great.  The Charlton Heston cameo was an awesome tribut to a great American symbol.  It was awesome, and his last words ""Damn them all to hell..."" made me laugh really hard.  It was a great tribute and I applaud the writers for it.  General Thade I thought was great, he did a good job acting.  It was much different than the book's/original movie's Dr Zaius, but he still had the same premise.  All the ape characters were outstanding, especially the two Generals and the comic relief slave trader.  The premise was quite different AND IF YOU DONT WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING ***STOP READING NOW*** and I liked it but I didn't.  The idea of the space station going back in time and the monkeys taking over and evolving was interesting.  As said above, I thought it strange that the apes would advance so much and the humans not, but still.  I liked that idea; it was an interesting new idea. But it still lacked all the glamour the original ending got.  It didn't make me think and it didn't really spark an interest in me to question existence. It was good, but not POTA worthy.  The ending was, however.  I thought that all the cliffhangers were over with.  After Thade was locked up I think it was rushed way too much.  It all kinda wrapped up and took off too quick. When Davidson crashed on Earth I knew something fishy was up.  And when I noticed the Lincoln Memorial I knew what I was about to see.  What I didn't know, however, was that the modern-day Earth would end up completely controlled by apes.  This was a great cliffhanger ending and it made me puzzled at first.  However when you think about it, it leaves little to the imagination.  Obviously, somewhere in Planet of the Apes re-imagining sequels 2-5 Thade will go back in time and alter past.  When this will happen, how it will occur, how well it will be pulled off, who will be the characters, and exactly how many boring sequels we will have to sit through are all questions that lay heavily on the shoulders of director Tim Burton...good luck...   8.5/10",Planet of the Apes

Easy: a bad movie that makes millions of dollars. This movie was awful, no two ways about it. I have the utmost respect for Tim Burton, but that doesn't mean he's incapable of making an absolute garbage film, which is what he did here. The screenplay had all the depth of a fourth grader's story contest submission, stooping so far as to have a character say (and I'm not making this up) ""Can't we all just get along?"" I swear, Paul Giamatti's bad comic relief character was pulled from a thrown-out Disney script. This movie was cliched at its best, at its worst it was painfully stupid. I can't say more without spoiling the ending, but know this: When you're sitting in the theater thinking ""Oh sweet jesus don't let that be the way they're gonna end it,"" stand up and leave, because the ending you dread is the one you get.

The lack of plot and character development really shocked me for a Burton film. I'm left to again wonder if Hollywood really thinks we are all that stupid?

A deep movie that managed to keep my attention for about 2 hours, spark questions and for once, NOT EXPLAIN EVERY LITTLE ACTION THE CHARACTERS TAKE.  My pet peeve today is that movies have to take so much time in explaining every tiny detail about the plot.  In essence they are preaching to the lowest common denominator. In a movie that contains so many sub-plots, Tim Burton does a great job of presenting the foundation though dialogue, and then the rest of the plot though visual aids.  If you want to understand the movie you have to look for the details and then come to your own conclusions, which isn't that hard if you were actually watching the movie, and have some reasonable level of intelligence (which of course is rare into days movie viewing demo graph, and no I'm not an old cranky manI'm only 16).  If your tired of the same mush that infests out cinema today and want to see a movie that is smart, funny, and makes you think see this movie.

855,awolit,Total trash...,1,28 July 2001,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS (though hopefully you'll read them and then not decide to see the movie and thus save yourself seven hard earned bucks...)This movie was garbage in practically every regard. The dialouge was terrible, the plot didn't make sense, the acting was mediocre at best, the action scenes were lame, the hyped ""social messages"" were blunt and shallow, and the big surprise ending was astonishingly dumb and impossible. Given how many screenplays Hollywood must get, its pretty incredible that they made this one into a summer blockbuster. There are a couple bright spots in this movie: Many of the ape actors do fine jobs, especially Helena Bonham Carter who turns in by far the film's best performance, and Estella Warren looks absolutely gorgeous wandering around in her skimpy outfits. Beyond that, the movie is worthless in every way. First of all, the plot makes no sense at all. A couple examples: 1. The name of the ape's secret city is Calia, which we learn comes from a sign reading ""Caution Live Animals"" which is covered by dust except for the first couple letters of each word, except that presumably the city was named thousands of years ago when the apes left it BEFORE any of the dust accumulated. 2. When the humans are about to be totally overrun by the ape army, Mark Wahlberg comes up with the idea of using the still intact fuel in his spaceship that crashed thousands of years ago (huh?) to blow up the apes. ""Cool"" we think, except that all it seems to do is knock over about 40 apes out of the few thousand in the army, and they just get back up again. So then the humans attack and the battle seems to be pretty fair. Huh? If they could put up a fight in the first place, why were they coming up with this dumb scheme that didn't even do anything? 3. Okay, I know Estella Warren is gorgeous, but seriously, neither her character nor any other human character in the movie except Mark Wahlberg had any significance to the plot. I think she had literally about 5 lines and was ignored throughout most of the film. Her father's only purpose was getting killed by a big ape early on, after he said somewhere around 2 lines, and that little kid (her brother?) was also completely insignificant except towards the end when he somehow tips over his horse, except that didn't really matter at all to the plot either. 4. The ending (BIG SPOILER AHEAD) was just dumb. Dumb dumb dumb. Okay, so here he is in PRESENT DAY earth except it's all apes again. First of all, this is predictable, but it still doesn't make sense. We're supposed to believe (I think) that Thade somehow managed to go back in time to earth and change the course of history, but somehow it turned out exactly the same way, down to the archetecture of the Washington monument, as it was when humans were the dominant species. What? what??? Whatever, it's dumb as wood anyway. Also, the rest of the movie was just lame. For one thing, the big hyped action scenes were ridiculously lame. Basically, a human would punch an ape, who'd turn around and punch the human and send him sailing about 25 feet into the air at which point he'd die, unless he happened to be named Mark Wahlberg, in which case he'd be perfectly fine. huh? Also, we were set up for this big climatic fight between the two ape generals, which predictably happned, but it was remarkably tame too. They pretty much just jumped at each other and beat each others chests for around 15 seconds before one the them died. Also, the whole social message thing had been done much better before and seemed unconvincing when done here. You get the impression that the actors in ape makeup are having trouble keeping a straight face while delivering these overly deep and significant but at the same time really really dumb lines... 1/10",Planet of the Apes
856,spytel,I'm saving you 8 bucks,4,30 July 2001,"WARNING: MY COMMENTS MAY HAVE SPOILERS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.I couldn't enjoy Planet of the Apes because of the gaps of logic taking place.In the original, Heston (Col. Taylor) landed on a planet with air, with apes ruling over humans, and they could speak English!--all these strange things were explained with the ending--Heston had returned to the Earth of the future.In the remake, I was thrown off from the beginning.Why are we using apes in space exploration? This would have made more sense in 1968 original, with Russian cosmonauts and apes being sent into space.But right now we use robot probes to explore Mars. Wouldn't that technology be all the more advanced and probable than using simians in the future?This planet is not Earth. It's convenient that Leo landed here and that there is oxygen to breathe. But in addition to that minor point, this planet was populated with ape and human survivors that crash landed on a ship. This begs the question--WHERE DID THE HORSE COME FROM?Again, it made sense in the original--they were on Earth from the beginning. But here, on another planet, it doesn't make any sense.Where did Ape Charlton Heston (Thade's dad) get the gun?Again, everything on this planet started from what survived the crash of the ship on the planet. Leo uses a modern laser-like weapon. Where did Ape Charlton Heston get an old gun even by our current standards, to present to his son, Gen Thade?How can the apes evolve so quickly, and yet the surviving humans are in the caveman stage of things?Apes can speak, ride the ""native"" horses of the planet, have a whole society and hierarchy, yet man, with all his technological know-how is now running around in loin cloths. Righttt.I knew this movie wouldn't be perfect, but even the couple of beers I downed before the movie could get me over that idiotic ending.Okay, Gen Thade somehow got smart enough to get back to Earth before Leo, and change history. But it isn't a new ape-history, it's a parallel Earth history where identical versions of things exist--The Lincoln Memorial with an Ape head, Cop cars with Gorilla cops, society in duplicate form to ours, the only thing changed is apes instead of humans.I give up, maybe it'll be explained in the sequel--but I ain't going to cough up 8 bucks to find out why.",Planet of the Apes

There is no substantial socio-political commentary here, although there are plenty of gentle nods to racism, classism, sexism, religion, and the rest---along with several well placed winks at the original production [including a splendid cameo by Heston].

The second half comes across as though they ran out of time and were not sure which way to take the movie. Because this it becomes farcical! It looks like they panicked, the problem is the original movie is a classic and easily stands the test of time, the end, still a very powerful image. They concentrate of trying to replicate (in a different way) this but it's desperate. If you're going to see this film try to forget about the original and just enjoy it as a different film. This is difficult because they insist on repeating the classic lines from the first movie. I suppose they were trying to be funny, it was funny but for the wrong reasons.

The ape make up is Oscar worthy, though at most times it distracts from the already weak plot and make most dialogue incomprehensible. This film parodies the previous ""Ape"" film with several one-liners. This is not supposed to be a comedy or satire, it is a ""message"" movie on how we treat and behave towards other beings. At least that was what the novel and 1968 version was about. I think another problem was that the director did not know whether to have the apes behave like apes or humans.

His speech, walk, even his eye movements completely transform him into a vicious ape.  Hats off to an actor of his caliber.  Wahlberg is good, as well.  He is the typical 'boy-next door' American whom is smart enough to not ask questions while he secretly plans his escape.  Kristofferson's cameo is nearly non-existant, however. Development of the human tribes and their ways of life would be interesing to learn of, but action wins over plot thickness.  Estella Warren is simply eye-candy, while Bonham Carter is the lead female with a brain to match.The film is fast paced, and at a few moments seemed to be out of control.

877,julieharwood,Planet of the Bad,1,24 August 2001,"This movie was terrible.  I went into it with high expectations, only to get a sneaking suspicion that something had gone terribly awry after the opening credits.  These are some of the elements which made viewing this excruciating:1) The set: it looked like a cross between the Wizard of Oz's flying monkeys, the Ewok Adventure and Willow.  I know we're dealing with Tim Burton here, but I just couldn't take it seriously.  And, it always looked like a SET.2)  The cast:  Mark Wahlberg, whom I normally like, just seemed too flat and not commanding enough of a character to lead any insurrection.  Estella Warren, who plays the 2001 equivalent to the original film's Nova, is so bad it's comic.  Check out the first scene in which she's introduced side by side with the Kris Kristofferson character.  The look on her face is so vacuous, you wonder how she's supposedly survived this long on the run. And speaking of Kris Kristofferson: why is he in this movie at all?  His character is completely wasted.3) Danny Elfman's swollen, distracting score:  I felt like I was watching Batman all over again.4) The character development:  The human characters are not developed at all.  We're supposed to buy that there's chemistry between the Mark Wahlberg character and Daena (Estella)?  One doesn't even really know the human characters' names by the end of the film.  I had to look them up on IMDB. I didn't care about any of the characters, and hoped they were all killed by the time the movie ended.5) The tacked-on, twist ending:  Send this ending back for a rewrite! Let's make some sense here, people.In addition to the points listed above, the dialogue was corny.  There were also numerous plots holes and distractions.  One of the distractions was how Daena got lip gloss and managed to shave her armpits while living such a primitive lifestyle.  It's also a wonder that the enslaved and nomadic humans spoke English so well.Helena Bonham-Carter does what she can with the terrible script.  The make-up effects were mixed.  The look of the female primates was not to be believed.  I assume this was done for Burton's lame satiric elements in the film.  The make-up effect on Tim Roth's Thade was more believable.  Tim Roth's scenes fare better than others, although he goes way over the top at points.Don't waste your time with this movie.  Do yourself a favor and rent the original 1968 classic instead.",Planet of the Apes

879,MagnusN,Guess Tim did what he could...,3,2 August 2001,"As a HUGE Tim Burton fan, I must say I was disappointed. Problem is I think Burton did what he could with a script that probably could fit on infants fingernail. At most, three lines are exchanged between the actors which leads to an almost non-existent dialogue. Some scenes sparkled with magic, but sometimes it felt like the scenes were pasted from Xena, Warrior Princess.This of course, made it difficult for Mark and the rest of the actors to create personalities which actually were interesting. I was however impressed by Tim Roth and the other monke..I mean apes.Time-travel.Always trouble.In this case,big trouble.MAJOR trouble.I didn't understand a thing.At least the ending opened for a sequel and hopefully a better one.

Here we are 5 years later and still no sequel. It's unfortunate, because amidst all of the speculation about the meaning of the ending - it certainly screams SEQUEL! Another observation - a lot of people seem to think the ape planet that Leo crashes on (in beginning of the movie) is Earth. But Tim Burton's ape planet has two moons - it can't be Earth. However, the planet he crashes on in the end of the movie is Earth - it has one moon and the correct continents.",Planet of the Apes
884,darrenc,I'm confused,6,17 August 2001,"With it's excellent effects and direction this film was always going to be a big summer hit and unfortunately that has given them the excuse the forget about the plot. The film starts well enough dropping clues and introducing the main human. It flows along nicely with alot of references to the original film ('Take your hands off me you damned dirty human'). There is a humour and darkness to the film that can only be provided by Tim Burton as well as his trade mark scarecrows. But as with all good things, what was right about this film came to a crashing end and that comes at the end. The initial plot resolution seemed to be an afterthought and then the 'shock' ending was illogical and did not seem to tie in with events in the rest of the film. If anybody has any theories as to how the ending is possible please let me know as we haven't been able to work it out.So for effort, cast (especially Estella Warren), direction and initial plot I give this film 6 out of 10.

The end was a great twist and lent a smile to my face.  You people that hate the end, too bad. There's nothing you can do to change it, so live with it and take it for what it is, Tim Burton's sense of humor shining through. The screen play by William J. Broyles and others was fabulous, and who can say more than ""The Oscar goes too...Rick Baker for Planet Of The Apes""?  Burton delivers his usual chuzpah in his own dark and twisted way, and his long time friend, Danny Elfman delivers one of his best scores ever.

889,lil_Stud_87,One of the Years Best!,8,28 July 2001,"Tim Burton does a spectacular job of re-imagining and re-telling planet of the Apes. In watching Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes you can see the simularity's to the original film, but Burton also manage's to tie in his usuall twists and turns that make him such an amazing and one of a kind Director. When watching this film you tend to forget that there are only people under all that fur and makeup and not real Apes,thanks to Rick Baker.As if all that is not enough the casting for this film couldn't have been much better. Tim Roth Plays Thade the General of the Apes that despieses the humans.Tim Roth Delivers an unbelievably frightning performance that he should be recognized for. Helen Bonham Carter gives an absolutely steller performance as Ari. Ari is an ape that has pity for the humans because she see's how poorly they are treated by the Apes, after she meets Leo Davidson (Mark Whalberg)  she starts to realize that Leo is different from the other humans and she starts to believe in the humans more and more. Mark Whalberg Delivers a good performance but nothing that he will be remembered for.

Cheese ball ape-human love scene with some out-right horrible add-ons, like having the young boy ride out to help and oops, don't you know it, his horse falls. I guess since humans are animals and don't have horses readily available we shouldn't expect them to be doing and jousting are dressage.  Predictable ending that lacked the jaw dropping effect of the original.  Terrible cameo with Heston, ain't it funny the president of the NRA is now dressing up in ape make-up and preaching the evils of technology and guns.  The make-up was beautiful and some performances were actually good, but the real problem is, if you're going to use the same name as the original, it better be as good as the original.

Though the story and the names have changed,Burton's film is exciting to the core.I will not give much away as the movie has yet to be released on Friday,but I will say that there are more than a couple of original POTA quotes thrown in and the ending is a nice twist (as it was in the original).

896,blackgoldenbird,A warped plot line wrapped in incredible acting and makeup.,6,17 August 2001,"The film overall was only mediocre but some performances and all the make up jobs were done so well you might think they were apes.The star of the film in my opinion is Tim Roth. He acts the psychopathic homicidal ape perfectly. Even the walk he seems to have perfected. No wonder Quentin Tarantino hires him so much; he works well with twisted characters and plotlines. (Watch Reservoir Dogs if you don't believe me... Mr. Orange)The love triangle of Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) and the blond chick with a big chest [i think she was called Deana] (Estelle Warren), is hilarious. Some critics have said that they wished that Davidson and Ari had more of a relationship instead of the blond chick with a big chest and Davidson. This is totally crazy! Have they SEEN THE MOVIE??? The only thing that blond chick with big chest did was kiss Davidson once and look exactly like a blond chick with big chest. She is a token piece in this movie.... The relationship with Ari and Davidson not only involves a kiss but he saves her life more than once, and they even TALK! I think that some critics need to cut back on their drinking!Speaking of blond chick/big chest being the token piece, she is only in the movie because people expect her. They screwed up the ending, so why keep her? But yet again the adolescent male attitudes that every guy keeps hidden SOMEWHERE rear their ugly heads. Look at most of the movies these days, find one that doesn't have a token chick with a big chest? It doesn't seem well. Natural.Well then, the makeup jobs. INSANE! Each of the prosthetics that the actors wore was individual created. Unlike the original movie, every ape has a different face, which is highly expressive and flexible, Kudos to the makeup crew:Rick Baker,   Brigitte Bugayong,  Gabriel De Cunto, Toni G, Teressa Hill, Jamie Kelman,  Patricia Miller (II),  Denise Paulson, Alex Proctor, Robin SlaterI was highly impressed.The directing was impressive as well, timing the movements and brining a vision to life was left up to Tim Burton and yet again he brings the screen to life. Every scene in the film was well thought out and well held together, this was an impressive feat for a remake.Forgive me but the ending of this movie sucked. I wont say more but it did....

I couldn't believe how bad this movie was (I'm rambling, I know, but I am really disenchanted). In my opinion, it seemed as though Burton had a vision that did not pan out.

This movie is lifeless and dull for the first hour as apes sit around discussing human rights.The New Planet of the Apes lacks the mystery and intrigue and character the first movie had and only decided to capitalize on the fact that Apes can talk.

I've read other reviews of the film and agree with the general consensus that the score (Elfman) and the makeup/special effects (Baker, etc.) were spectacular. Of course they were! Why shouldn't they be? With the current level of sophistication we enjoy in special effects and advanced makeup/prosthetic applications there is no excuse whatsoever for shabby makeup and crappy effects. What are we left with after the glitz? Stuntmen jumping 20, 30 and 50 feet into the air again and again and again. That particular effect was so overdone throughout the film as to render it completely flaccid by the end of this piece of garbage. Plot? There was none, really.

901,BionicDuke,Roger Ebert missed the main point,9,1 August 2001,"In case you missed Roger Ebert's review, he didn't like Mark Wahlberg's role as a hero, or his lack of heroism in the movie.  He must have been asleep during the part where his character points out to Carter's female ape character, that ""...we are not alike, you care about everybody else but yourself.""  For me, this whole statement defines the movie. He only wants to go home.  He only cares about himself.  And all without the arrogant 'attitude' we're used to seeing in movies.  It's either Look at me I'm cool, or Look at me I'm a hero, Wahlberg's character and final decision in the movie pave the way for turning upside down everything you ever thought you knew about what's really going on.  A perfect sci-fi where the seemingly explainable goes unexplained.The plausibility of the opening year at 2029?  A stretch...only if you believe we're in the same reality, which you will find out becomes one for the X-files.   The original 1968 movie left you with a shock, so you could figure out the timeline and the ape evolution.  This movie doesn't try to shock, as many are thinking it's supposed to.  It's actually supposed to make you THINK who came first, human or ape?  You will realize that you would have never reached this point if Wahlberg walked the path of the true hero.",Planet of the Apes
902,Brock Middlebrook,Damn You 20th Century Fox! Damn you all to hell! (Mild spoiler alert!),1,28 July 2001,"Remember the 1968 original Planet of the Apes?  Now imagine an updated version of that same movie without the creativity, witty social commentary, and entertainment value and that's what you get out of Apes circa 2001. This year has proven to be a wasteland of one bad movie after another, and Apes 2001 will most likely be looked at as a contributor to this wasteland, at least by me.The original and subsequent versions had social commentary that mirrored the current events of those times, such as the Watts riots and the Vietnam War. Apes 2001 was just a lame attempt to make a blockbuster movie by trying to capture lightning in a bottle a second time with name recognition, cliches, and special effects.  I started looking at my watch well before the halfway mark of the movie.The movie insults the intelligence of the moviegoer by having the apes give that annoying, piercing, headache-inducing shriek everytime they get excited, mad, happy, etc.  I suppose that director Tim Burton wanted to drive the point home that they are in fact apes in case we couldn't figure that out from the title of the movie and that they call themselves ""apes"" a lot.  It felt more like being at a zoo than a movie theater.Let's not forget the touch of absurdity too.  Apes teases a love triangle between Capt. Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), a native human woman, and Ari the bleeding heart ape.  Yes, you read it correctly.  Thank goodness it was only a PG-13 movie.Nothing noteworthy about the acting.  Wahlberg struts around as the hero, which is par for the course.  Tim Roth as Gen. Thade came across as more of an annoyance than as ruthless.  Kris Kristofferson contributes little, other than to continue his own streak of being offed in a movie before it's over. Of all the actors here, I felt bad for Michael Clarke Duncan.  After his breakthrough performance in The Green Mile, he was typecasted as a dimwitted giant ape in most other later movies.  I never expected for him to be literally typecasted as that to boot, but Apes 2001 does just that by feeding him the limited role as the stooge/friend of Gen. Thade.The ending - which by the way many will see coming a mile away - leaves the door open for a sequel, and if Apes 2001's undeserving blockbuster numbers hold up, sadly that's what we will get.Stay far, far away from this movie, even if you're a diehard fan of all the original Apes movies, have all the episodes of the TV series and cartoon on tape, have back hair, and crave bananas constantly.

What I am saying is that this movie is so lacking in a compelling story that the truly amazing Ape effects and acting are utterly wasted. The human actors are uniformly wooden and seemingly unaffected by thousands of years of oppression, not to mention that lipstick and hairspray seem to have been developed in the jungle somehow.If you can overlook the glaring plot holes, and somehow completely ignore the, lets face it, ridiculous ending, then you stand a chance of appreciating the truly fantastic apes. If this movie could have been made without the human element, it would be an excellent portrayal in itself, as it is, this film never rises above mildly entertaining.

The plot is very smooth and the film carries along well, which is to be somewhat expected, as it's a re-make, but that shouldn't be taken for granted, because even with little changes, re-makes can be screwed up.The actors and makeup artists did an amazing job creating believable apes. The movements of the actors are astounding - the walking especially.  The makeup is incredible - becoming more rare as cinema progresses because directors and producers want to do things computer generated, because it's quicker and easier, even though makeup is more realistic.  Tim Burton's decision to go with makeup was very shrewd.Planet of The Apes is a fascinating film and provokes much thought, if you are open to it.  I liked it very much.",Planet of the Apes
912,jokis,"Great movie, but doesnt stay true to the originial",8,1 August 2001,"I remember watching the original, with good ole NRA leader, Charleton Heston.  I remember it being meaningful, instead of this new-age ""save the little people"" approach that try to teach us animal rights and how humans are cruel and unpredictable.Let me just get this out in the open, the ending sucked.  Sure it was a surprise, but it made no sense and it forces a sequel to explain it.  I would've enjoyed it better if it was more like the original (and not the book).If you've seen the original, it's nothing like this version.  He lands by himself and is quickly thrown into the conflict.  A minor change (that I wasnt expecting, actually) was that he could talk as soon as he landed, where in the original it took Heston a while to talk.  Dr. Zaius is back, thrown in a comedic role thus losing the serious role he had back in the original.  Again, it's just a matter of taste.  If you want a reved up, updated classic...this is the movie for you.Something has always bothered me.  It was in the original and in this one as well (I dont know if it's the same in the book as well), but why doesnt the main character get that HOT human chick?  He seems more interested in that female monkey!  Sheesh, Estella Warren is very VERY hot, and she's a Canadian as well! ;)  That chick from the original was hot too, but she's like 4 000 years old now... :(The effects were there, the musical score was there...the plot and development of characters was not.  We get a sense of the theme, but neither the main character or his human friends are developed in any way.Overall, it's a very enjoyable movie, however they took a lot from the original that hard-core fans such as myself dont like.",Planet of the Apes
913,dulciecat,"There should be a prequel, not a sequel",10,2 August 2001,"""Planet"" was, until the last 5 minutes of it, a great movie. The apes look very realistic thanks to Rick Baker's make-up design, which definitely is Oscar worthy.  The actors playing the apes were superb, I almost forgot that there were humans under all that make-up, while the human actors almost took away from the movie.  *SPOILER* The time travel story line is what really hooked me onto this movie.  The twist of Leo being indirectly responsible for the apes creation and domination over humans yet also being directly responsible for getting apes and humans to live in peace is genius.  I'm very curious as to how exactly the apes got smarter and stronger.  Instead of a sequel from the absolutely awful ending, I think there should instead be a prequel, something like ""Before the Planet of the Apes"".  I heard the rumor that 5 endings were shot for this film but both why Tim Burton chose this ending makes no sense.",Planet of the Apes

There were looks, but absolutely nothing to believe that he cared even a little about them.  It was a little mind boggling with the crazy ending.

919,SayWhatEh,Comments from a dissapointed viewer,1,5 August 2001,"Well, a typical burton movie some would say. I agree to a certain extent. Burton means a good looking movie with a pretty bad script, but he most often get away with it. Sleepy Hollows is excellent for example.This movie however, has a really really bad script. There are plotholes all over and the ending is terrible. One would think that since he based it on a idea very well covered before that the script would be easy to make into something marvelous. But instead it was predictable and full of plotholes. I will not mention them here since a few of you might not have seen to movie, but trust me on this one.The actors taking the shapes of apes are excellent, and they do a good enough job. Mark Wahlberg is stiff and doesn't really feel like he is in a perilous situation, but that is mostly because of his lack of lines, he says very little, asks almost nothing it doesn't really fit in what a person would do in his situation. You don't really get to know any of the characters.So, pretty good effects, lousy script, a typical burton movie, but in this case, the script is so bad and the effects not good enough to make watching it worthwhile.",Planet of the Apes

921,parsonscjparsons,The biggest diappointment of the millenium.,1,6 August 2001,"It all sounded so good, a ""reimagining"" of Planet of the Apes. Richard Zanuck returned to helm production and Tim Burton was brought on board to direct. We were so optimistic. The original was a landmark film, could they do it justice? The sequels were so juvenile and simplistic surely they had learned, alas it was not to be. This movie is a train wreck. Poorly concieved, poorly written, poorly acted, preposterous in logic and impossible to follow it defies our hopes and dreams. Even without comparison to the original it fails miserably. But we can't view it without remembering. The fundamental mistake I think is that this is more than just a story about Apes. Its about one mans odyssey, his journey through time and space searching for .... well shall we say the perfect world, only to arrive in a nightmare. The remake conveys none of that. Its a chase movie aimed at the 12 to 18 yearolds who dominate the market. All the critics gush about the wonderfull makeup and effects, really? They are all in denial. They assume that because of the technical advances in the last 30 years it must be better. Well its not. The gorillas are pretty good, but we are forced to watch closeups of Helen Bonham Carter who looks ... well looks like she has a mask on. The sets look like ...sets and the Ape village in the original is 10 times more realistic than the graphic in this version. The ending? it defies any and all explanations. I remember after watching the 68 version staggering out of the dark theater with the rest of my stunned human companions, well I staggered out of the theatre again......in disbelief.",Planet of the Apes

925,zeltenmann,"That was a ""shocking"" ending?",6,9 August 2001,"Okay, I generally like the first version of a film and tend to skip the sequels, remakes, and anything else designed to remind me of the first film. Being a child of the 80s, I recognize that some sequels are inherently superior to others (i.e. Star Wars films, Indiana Jones, but not _Temple of Doom_, and others), so I tend to be suckered into repeats.So I purchased my $5 IMAX ticket (thank you, Canada) and was eager to see the newest addition to the _Apes_ saga.  From the first scene the sound and special effects are great.  You get wrapped into this film quickly and intensely.  You are, in fact, held throughout the entire film.Burton, as usual, has created a very, very dark film that seems to offer no hope for salvation.  Characters become aware of their ""sins"" and misconceptions of reality.  The battle seen of ape vs. man shows the reduction of man to his survivalist instinct, and a hope, albeit distant, for reconciliation.Most films would have stopped there.  Kudos to Burton for going further, but where did he think he was going to take us?  A great film was RUINED by the ending.  Too predicable, too ""I need an ending, let's go with this one.""

I'm not interested in the mindless comedy of American Pie 2, or even The Princess Diaries. Even though I walked into the theatre slightly sceptical of ""talking apes"", I walked out completely satisfied. Definately a movie that will leave you thinking even long after it's over.

The script they're forced to use is chockablock with utterances such as ""I'm sick of this human"" which kicks off the key battle scene. And, simply ""Gotta go,"" as Leo (Mark Whalberg) bids adieu to his gorgeous model Daena (Estella Warren).  Maybe the only reason to see it is to try to puzzle through the twisty ending.

The script does just enough to try and explain the main characters actions but a lot more time should have been spent on building relationships between the characters.

The acting was terrible and if we ignore the little facts (like how easily Ari let herself be lead by humans or how Daena has lipstick and a boobjob on this planet), the overall plot made no sense.

But I have decided the majority of the blame should sit on the shoulders of the writers, who obviously just punched the clock and saved their best stuff for something else.  It is impossible to build a good movie without a good script.
I'm sick of seeing movies like this one, that cash in on a big opening weekend before word of mouth can get out that it stinks.  I'm  also sick of seeing movies where it is obvious that the writers ran out of steam and rather than take time to make a good product, just churn out another piece of mediocre crap.

A total rip-off of the original plot, except for the classic ending which had to be different since the ending was so surprising and by now well-known in the original, an un-inspired casting (lets face it; Mark Wahlberg will not be remembered for his great acting skills) and an over-all feeling of ""Oh, I know what's going to happen next"" throughout the movie.

Isn't the fundamental rule for science fiction/drama to create in the audience the willing suspension of disbelief.  POA 2001 creates a plausible beginning, suckering us in, but thereinafter Mr. Burton forgets that his moviegoers have working brains.  The over the top libertarian of Helena Bonham Carter's chimp, the worthlessness of the humans' lockup, the ease of their escape, their extraordinary skills of horsemanship (this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly riding full tilt), the massive and immediate human rebellion all are too unbelievable.  Mark Wahlberg never once projects any sense of real fear, danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down.  Compare to the original, in which Chuck Heston's nakedness metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events.  The uniformed Wahlberg preserves his modesty, but also his apparent sense of management and control in an inherently wacky situation, and we never really wonder about his well being.  Unlike Heston, he seems never to be in real jeopardy.  Tim Burton should have used some of the f/x budget for some competent screenwriting.  In fact, after this inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood's producers ever bothered to settle the screenwriters and directors strike threats. Let them walk.  Trained monkeys could have done as well as they did in Planet of the Apes 2001.  I'll bet the repeat viewings of this effort will be nonexistent.

What is more, you can easily realize, that this is not an own fiction. It is perfectly truth that make-up, special effects, costumes design, mourning atmosphere and its production design are brilliant, but the screenplay as well as the some of the performances are uneven. The movie easily bleeds because of its narrative weakness and its forced final twist. It has also a great rhythm and spectacular action moments, by far the best, however it sinks rapidly not only because the relations between characters are a kind of childish, but also because of its sense of humor.

Thus, it is worth to be seen even by die-hard fans of the original movies.Mark Wahlberg can never match the quality of Charlton Heston, and was probably not a good choice, but the Apes are even more realistic and differentiated than in the old movies, as far as their characters are concerned. The girl which was Nova in the 1968 movie is also much more intelligent and has more to offer than just to look good.All the cruelty of manhood is being shown to as like in a fable on the example of the monkeys - sorry, apes! This content alone makes it really hard to create a bad movie upon it.Planet of the Apes (2001) is really worth the money, it has impressive shots to offer, a smooth storyline, interesting characters and an idea which should make us think about ourselves and our history.Only the end is really poor and doesn't fit the rest of the movie.

Planet of the Apes has gone from a hokey cult movie to an amazing science fiction vision of the future. But it's not only the effects and costuming that are much better. Burton has created a chilling yet realistic version of what apes might evolve to. The way they move, their facial expressions, the behavior. Everything is really well thought out.

Apparently, Burton decided to do this commentary at the very last minute, and, have no doubt, the spontaneous accounts from the fevered mind of Tim Burton are something to behold. It truly gives you an idea of the intricacies that went into crafting each scene of this visual feast.Some highlights from the commentary include Burton talking about what it was like to work with real apes. He said, 'you get this weird vibe from having a relationship with apes. There's a definite connection between humans and apes but its weird, so primal, and so shocking.' Burton's comments reminded me of what Michael Aped, director of Gorilla's in the Mist, had said about working with apes. He said there were many times when he thought there was a real person staring at him and when he turned to see who it was, it had been an ape. He said the experience was eerie, yet fascinating.Burton also talked a lot about this idea of his version of Planet of the Apes being a circular thing. About everything coming back to the beginning or the middle or something. I couldn't quite understand fully what he was talking about, however, it reminded me of Joni Mitchell's Circle of Life song. Oh well,...a creative mind like Tim Burtons is not to be completely understood, only enjoyed.Anyway, the movie is great and Tim Burton's commentary makes the DVD spectacular.",Planet of the Apes

The blond savage was the highlight of this movie with her sequined(I didn't actually notice the sequins, but it was commented by the rest of the excited crowd gagging on the movie), tight-fitting, low-cut cave woman swimsuit, and I can't forget to mention the sexy red lipstick she manages to keep smudge-free throughout the movie. *note:  i just heard ""what a crap movie!"" as i'm typing this review.  For some odd reason, the rest of them are still watching the blockbuster.Don't waste your time!!!",Planet of the Apes

He enters a time warp, finds that he has traveled in time (forwards, backwards -- who knows?) Ends up on a planet dominated by apes that his ship previously planted there -- irresponsible time travel with powerful results over the course of time.Then there is a whole lot of action, climaxing to the insight of the hero. One man has the insight into these phenomenon... and what does he do? when he gets the chance he jumps right back into a time warp and sees the results of his actions as they have spiraled out over time.. He left a peaceful situation on the ape planet only to find that had he stayed, the course of history could have been drastically different. Thought provoking movie wrapped up in a modern day action flick.",Planet of the Apes

But that is just my opinion. The graphics, the story, the whole thing seemed to grab more of my attention than the others did... Now there is no doubt that Charleton Heston did an extrodanary job acting in the others, but Mar Wahlberg isn't bad at all in this one! Mark Wahlberg is honestly a good actor, and just because he is not viewed in the same way that Heston is, doesn't mean that he can't give a good performance!

956,nbjason,Disappointing and confusing,4,2 September 2002,"I have seen and liked the original film, and expected more from a remake than this.GOOD: Effects and makeup are good.  No complaints about the score and visuals, they are adequate, and the performances were okay (Tim Roth was excellent, the other principals were fine, and a handful of the ""supporting supporting actors"" did very well with extremely limited roles).  The action scenes were exciting and fun.BAD: The escape from the ape city was terrible.  The characters are going in circles, then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape.  Plus, what escape route leads through everybody's bedroom?The story was pared down to include as much action as possible.  I like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respect.Finally, the ending was completely nonsensical as presented.

957,senokwane,a nice try,5,30 March 2002,"The revision ""Planet of the Apes"" pretty much lived up to my expectations as a not-too-good nice try. By itself it makes a reasonable action sci-fi but falls far short from the great originals. Although it does try to make a statement of some kind, it is far too obviously and shallowly done. The characters were also a let down, being quite one dimensional.That said, however, should the movie be judged by it's own merits, and not seen in the shadow of the original Planet of the Ape movies, it does deserve some credit as far as entertainment is concerned. It follows a good, exciting and 'non-stagnating' plot, and the viewer remains interested throughout.Overall; a nice try but should not have tried to follow in the foot-steps of the originals.",Planet of the Apes
958,Edgar Verburg,"Lesser drama, a load of action.",7,30 June 2002,"To put this film directly into perspective, I watched the original version of Planet of the Apes (1968). Although I enjoyed the newer version, there are some small disappointments to mention: Minor changes to plot seem to make this movie less mysterious and dramatic.The main character, again an astronaut, doesn't come out of deep hibernation this time. Heroic enough, in an attempt to rescue a monkey during an experiment, he himself loses contact with the space station too.When he - the astronaut named Leo Davidson - is stranded alone on a planet the dialog shifts to the inhabitants. It's a pity he is able to communicate with both apes and humans. In the older version the humans talked apey.Nonetheless, the art direction of this movie is very impressive. The costumes look superb. I question however why there are various ape species chosen. It takes away some of the realism, although it is supposed to be fiction from the start.Due to the dark sounds used, this movie is still somewhat of a thrill. There may be lesser drama, but it contains a load of beautifully captured action. Tim Burton, the director, did a good job, as well as the art direction.",Planet of the Apes
959,Lexus6504,"Although good, could have been much better",8,30 June 2002,"Planet of the Apes while good, could have been much better. The actors, I feel gave great performances and were very convincing as apes, however, the story line was poorly developed. In the original POTA films, there were hundreds of apes that looked exactly alike, so although you knew their names it was hard to distinguish each ape. In 2001 POTA, Rick Baker did a wonderful job of creating a wide variety of apes with very different physical features, however, most were never called by their names. Even the human's name were not mentioned so although you could tell them apart, who were they? I feel that this film is worthy of a sequel, if for no other reason than the performance of Tim Roth as General Thade who needed a female in the worst way. I believe that if a sequel is made, Tim Burton will redeem himself or at least I hope so.",Planet of the Apes

The fact that the humans were not mute was completely un-disturbing, and meant that some terrible dialogue was included. As humans go, the acting was woeful, especially Estella Warren's performance. On the positive side, the special effects were impressive, the soundtrack was flawless and the ending was a welcomed shock, however this less than makes up for the rest of the movie.

962,andy-conroy,Judge It For What It Is,8,1 October 2010,"The trouble with many films is that when they have been remade from an original title is that people expect it to live up to the previous film and also to be based on the original. This is not the case with this film on any of the above points. Tim Burton did an excellent job creating a unique film which is not like the predecessor and also to make use of the acting talents among the cast.The main star of the show of course is Mark Wahlberg takes on the role of Captain Leo Davidson and portrays the role excellently. His interaction with the apes and humans takes on interesting twists as the story progresses but he gives a solid performance and his unusual but interesting relationship with Ari who is played by the very talented Helena Bonham Carter who always gives a very credible performance is very intriguing. Ari who is of a important family ( the daughter of a senator ) is what can be described as an idealist which is a minority within the Ape culture within the film. She reaches out to the humans and in peticular Wahlberg as he is dragged into this conflict which he does not really want to be a part of.The supporting cast within the film are excellent and Tim Roth who plays General Thade does what can only be described as an excellent and versatile performance. Displaying constant anger towards humanity only to be further angered with the predicament of his father. A lot was weighed on Thade within the film due to his family being ancestors of the first ape on the planet ( Seamus ). His trusty friend and deputy Michael Clarke Duncan is very well known for the role he played in the Green Mile showed just how good of an actor he is in this film due to the fact that he had to portray a range of emotions while obviously being made up into an ape costume which would of taken a substantial amount of time. He is his trusted friend but being a devout follower of the faith within the Ape community which in the end gives him a massive decision to make. Estella Warren who plays Daena who is a human 'rebel' in the film has a major part to play in the film and appeals to Wahlbergs human side constantly while obviously having confused feelings for him.Throughout the film apes are closely linked to ourselves and on several occasions their are very clever pieces of writing to alert us to the common links between ourselves and apes. Also I believe the film is used to have a sharp dig at some of the aspects of our society. Also with unique ' Ape' humour and their take on human traditions and games is excellent to see what an ape society could be like if Apes ever evolved.In all this film is not like the original and viewers should not compare it to it. This film in its own right is a solid watchable film which has a bit of everything an all round fan of films would like. Drama, suspense, action, slight romance, comedy and above all putting the thought into our heads of ' What would it really be like if Apes had a society or planet.' Well I asked myself that and it scared the hell out of me.",Planet of the Apes

I might have watched it if it were the original. I have not yet felt inclined to re-watch the remake.Sometimes a remake is better than the original. I have never seen the original ""Maltese Falcon"" with Ricardo Cortez, but the remake with Humphrey Bogart is probably better. Everybody remembers the remake, many not even aware that it is a remake.

Mark Wahlberg surely was not the best choice for the protagonist. Take a look at old Heston in 1968, he did a great job. He's a leader, a strong man with authority. Mark Wahlberg lacks those charisma. Compared to Heston he looks really poor - a half-grown boy trying to command. The rest of the film looks like a more or less solid film.

The only good idea in the film is the casting of Charlton Heston, who starred in the original.The remake's finale is worrisome with its latent opening for a sequel: let's hope it never does come about -- but as the saying goes, monkey see, monkey do.If someone from the film industry actually reads these comments, I would love to hear an explanation of how a scene with four-handed apes outrunning four-hoofed horses makes it through the final editing.

972,Andymanzer0,Real ending explanation,8,23 March 2005,"Tim Burton's rendition of planet of the apes is just an interesting interpretation, not a remake. overall i thought it was well done. i do enjoy the originals quite a bit. after watching almost every original form of POTA, watching the Tim Burton version was fun, but just as long as you see it as his interpretation. the first time i saw the movie, i thought the ending was messed up, but after i saw it again years later, and understanding the time line of events i figured it out. many people have different opinions on what it means, but no one is close. the whole time Leo is on another planet. we know this from the 2 moons. then at the end he jumps into the alpha pod and heads for the electrical storm again, in hopes of going home. after Pericles arrives and just before Leo leaves the apes and humans have a respect for each other and now live in harmony, good job. then he leaves. however, general thade is still left there and being the ape-supremacist he is, is surely nothing less than disgusted. now, in an effort for revenge or even to alter his present, Thade becomes preoccupied with the delta pod. he is still one of a select group that knows about it. he somehow manages to resurrect it and get it to work. more than likely it still has power because A) its run with nuclear energy that ""lasts forever"" or B) just because Leo didn't use that much to get to the ape planet to begin with. Thade then takes off in the delta pod (possibly with another ape but i'm not sure, it is unlikely though) and manges to get into the electrical storm and make his way to earth. and because of the electrical storm he arrives long before Leo does. i think it may even be in the early 1900's. while he is there he, no doubt, wreaks havoc among the humans and through a series of unknown events, procreates and eventually overtakes the human race. and mysteriously history stays basically the same (except of course for the appearance of thade). thus when Leo gets to earth around the same time he left apes have long since ruled earth. we know its thade because if you look at the inscription on the back of the Lincoln memorial its says that it was built ""in memory of general thade"" (and it looks just like him). also, given that we now are back in time to the first present, Leo more than likely will not be able to go into space and have the beginning of the movie happen again and the first ape planet stays uninhabited.",Planet of the Apes

Although I haven't seen the original, this film looks wonderful and dark, and this is surely thanks to Burton's skill as a director. It manages to make the slightly detached characters really work well together, and the acting was great throughout. Very interesting race/ animal rights issues are raised by this film and, although I'm guessing that the original also raised these issues, I suspect it provoked much thought with teenagers who wouldn't dream of watching the original. Of course, you've got to compare it with Burtons other films, and, as far as spooky, Gothic atmospheres go, this doesn't really live up to them. But as an action film it surpasses so many. My favourite character was the Tim Roth evil general. He is the kind of bad guy whose evil has been set so deep within himself that he can no longer control it, and when he kills those gorilla-type creatures it's absolutely amazing. He also emanates pure evil through his wonderfully made facial features. The ending is an issue that raises much debate, but I loved it, the master plan, killing one wave of the enemy with an explosion, was beautifully futile, and the coincidental monkey landing was pleasantly ridiculous. And his return to earth was just really cool. All in all, a great film, watch it. By the way, did anyone else find themselves fancying Helena Bonham Carter in this film. Although, because of the amount of hair and her weird posture, it sounds quite wrong to think that, it just feels so right!",Planet of the Apes
