0,MartinHafer,A slightly more sophisticated vampire than good 'ol Nosferatu!,10,30 March 2006,"This incarnation of Dracula is quite a bit different from the previous Dracula (NOSFERATU). In the previous film, the names were changed in a cheesy attempt to get past copyrights, but Dracula (called ""Orlock"") was much as he was described in Tod Browning's novel--and probably back in 1922 was the scariest version of Dracula to date. This 1931 Dracula isn't nearly as viscerally scary--gone are the rats climbing about his feet, the excessively long and pointy fingernails and the bat-like face. In its place is a pretty sophisticated and cultured Bela Lugosi. While not exactly a ""sex symbol"", but by comparison to Orlock, he was quite the stud! Lugosi's performance, with its heavy Hungarian accent, is wonderful and measured. However, I think the biggest star of the film is the wonderful cinematography--with gauzy filters and a delicate touch when the action moves to Britain. A great horror film sure to please everyone.UPDATE: I just saw the restored version on TCM and was totally shocked at the cinematography. The film was simply gorgeous...one of the best films of the era simply from an artistic standpoint. So gorgeous that it really deserved a 10 (I had originally given it a 9).",Dracula
1,TheLittleSongbird,Excellent,9,29 May 2011,"Dracula(1931) mayn't be the definitive version of the brilliant Bram Stoker novel, but it is still a classic. My only complaints are the abrupt ending and David Manners as John, he tries his best but sometimes his line delivery is awkward and some of his lines are stilted.I did also think that to a lesser extent the first half is better than the second. The opening scene is absolutely brilliant, but while there are still some compelling and well-done scenes the second half is rather talky. That said, there is a lot I loved about Dracula. The costumes, sets, photography and lighting are suitably atmospheric and grandiose, the story is still the timeless story even with the many changes I love and the screenplay apart from the odd stilted line from John is very good.I saw Dracula in two versions, one without background music which added to the genuine atmosphere, and one with a suitably hypnotic and haunting score from minimalist composer Phillip Glass. While I loved Glass' score, I do prefer slightly the one without the scoring, the silence further added to the atmosphere I feel. The whole film is beautifully directed too, and while the film is very short at about an hour and a quarter the pace is just right.The acting is very good, perhaps theatrical in a way but I think it worked. Bela Lugosi has such a magnetic presence in the title role, Edward Van Sloan is perfect as Van Helsing but in a sinister and funny performance Dwight Frye steals the film.In conclusion, excellent film and a classic. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Dracula
2,bkoganbing,Stopping By Dracula's Castle on a Windy Evening,10,5 July 2006,"One kind of film that Universal Studios did better than any other was the Gothic horror story. Carl Laemmle practically took out a patent on those films. The sets were already on the lot, he just kept making Frankenstein, Wolfman, and Dracula films at minimal cost and they made money for Universal. In fact until Deanna Durbin started singing for this studio and Abbott&Costello brought over their vaudeville routines, these horror films were the bread butter of Universal Pictures.Interestingly enough though Bela Lugosi only played the role of Count Dracula twice on film, he became so overwhelmingly identified with the part that Lugosi's whole life was taken over by the undead Count. He was buried in fact in his Dracula costume.Lugosi however did portray the vampire Count on Broadway in a play adapted from the Bram Stoker novel three years before he did the screen version for Universal. It was on Broadway that Lugosi first got acclaim for Dracula. Carl Laemmle bought the screen rights to the play after seeing Lugosi on stage and just in time for sound. Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing and Herbert Bunston as Dr. Seward also came over from the Broadway cast.Although Bela got his career role from this film, Edward Van Sloan as the vampire killer Van Helsing also got the role that people identify him with. Van Sloan practically duplicated his role in The Mummy which also became another series of horror films for Universal.Oddly enough Lugosi himself killed the Universal horror genre by that second appearance as Count Dracula in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. When those mythic horror monsters became comic foils for Bud and Lou, the demand ceased for these kind of films. It only started again when British Hammer films revived the genre by making them far more explicit and bloody.Still with that Hungarian accented voice of cultured menace, Bela Lugosi remains for purists the only real Dracula ever put on screen, Christopher Lee notwithstanding. Like in The Mummy which I've also reviewed good use is made of themes by Tschaikovsky as background music by Director Tod Browning. But it's Bela Lugosi who makes this film a horror picture for the age. Dracula will be still frightening viewers centuries from now. After all vampires are eternal.",Dracula
3,Leofwine_draca,"It tests the patience a bit, but it's still a classic",7,4 July 2016,"Dracula is an important film. Very important. That's because it is the first talkie horror film; that is, the first horror film of the talkies, made after the silent nightmares of the '20s (such as NOSFERATU). Unfortunately, over the 70 or so years since its release, Dracula has dated badly due to the way that the actors act as if they were on stage (and Lugosi was originally on stage, which is why he got the role) and there is a noticeable lack of music, which makes everything seem very studio bound and slow.The special effects, too, are nothing remarkable. Rubber bats fly around propelled by string (a favourite of the later Hammer horrors) and everything happens very slowly, with little action (whenever someone is about to get bitten, the camera cuts away). However, these are only minor quibbles. On the plus side, DRACULAis in very good condition as a film, considerably better than some other prints from around the time (such as the crackly version of THE ISLAND OF LOST SOULS) which is probably because it was remastered in the 1950s.To really enjoy Dracula, you must put yourself in the time when it was made, where audiences had never seen anything like this before. Today, the ending is a total anticlimax, with Dracula being staked offscreen. Totally unforgivable, you might think, but that's only because our expectation of more recent vampire films has shaped our understanding and comprehension of the original classic. Indeed, upon my first viewing of Dracula, I thought it was a totally boring affair with little to commend it, but since then I've read a lot of books and seen a lot of films, and now I appreciate the film for what it is: a flawed, but interesting, classic.The acting is good all round, from David Manners and Helen Chandler as the young couple involved in the nightmares to the smaller role of Seward as a stern doctor. The only misfire is the introduction of a porter, used for totally comic value. Let's just say comedy has changed a lot over the years. There are three actors notable for their roles in this film; Dwight Frye, Edward Van Sloan and of course, Bela Lugosi. Dwight Frye gives the performance of his career as the insane Renfield, and his manic laughter is certainly something to behold. He would re-do this mad image time and time again, most notably as hunchbacked assistant Ygor in that other classic of the genre, FRANKENSTEIN.Edward Van Sloan (FRANKENSTEIN), is also excellent as the strict Doctor Van Helsing, purveyor of good. However the film really does belong to Bela Lugosi, and it would typecast him for the rest of his career. With his sing-song type speech and his pronounced Hungarian accent, striking features and black cape, Lugosi is the 'living epitome of evil' as the undead Count and he is perfect in the role. To make him look even more sinister, two beams of light were shone directly in the actor's eyes to make them glow hypnotically. Rather amusingly, the lights are always somewhat off centre. Although dated, Dracula stands the test of time for true horror fans and contains many elements popular in horror films still to this day, from rubber bats circling in the air to white hands creeping out of coffins. Unmissable for the classic horror fan, although watching it might be a slightly trying process for any modern cinema goer.",Dracula
4,SnoopyStyle,Bela Lugosi hypnotic,7,16 April 2016,"Renfield is a lawyer from England to meet Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi). The locals warn him against it. Renfield is taken by Dracula and made to be his mad thrall. He accompanies Dracula and his three wives in boxes to be delivered to their new home in Carfax Abbey. On the crossing, they massacre the crew. Dracula is free to roam and kill on the streets of London. His new neighbor is Dr. Seward's sanatorium. Seward's daughter Mina's friend Lucy Weston is taken with Dracula and is killed by him. Renfield becomes a patient in Seward's sanatorium and Professor Van Helsing comes in to diagnose him. Dracula feeds on Mina and Van Helsing treats the dying girl.After Nosferatu's lost for plagiarizing Bram Stoker, a Dracula movie was inevitable. The special effects are limited. It's a lot of fog. There is no on-camera transition. The bat is obviously fake with wires. There are many aspects reminiscent of the silent era. This is not particularly scary or thrilling. The one truly outstanding aspect of this version is Bela Lugosi and his hypnotic stare. His face is wonderful. His presence is obvious. He is the star of the show.",Dracula
5,Hitchcoc,The One We Always Think Of,10,3 May 1999,"I have had so much fun with this movie in my lifetime. From knowing virtually every line, to doing very bad impressions of the Bela Lugosi vampire. We all know him. The accent that is always used when we talk about Dracula. The parts of the movie I have learned to love start at the beginning. As Mr. Renfield travels through the ancient town at the foot of the Carpathians, the man with the huge mustache, when hearing of the young lawyer's plans, says with terror ""Drak-oo-la""! Renfield has that puzzlement on his face. He can't understand the fears of the people. I love it when he leans out the carriage window and sees that bat (on the end of a string), flying before the horses. When he is finally dropped off at the Borgo Pass, the suitcases are flung to the ground. This guy should have got a clue, but he doesn't. Then, of course, there are the famous lines as he enters the castle. ""Listen to them, the children of the night."" ""The spider spins his web to catch the unwary fly, eh, Mr. Renfield."" That light is focused on Lugosi's eyes to make them stand out. From that point on, we have a wonderful presentation of atmosphere. The fog, the darkness, the suavity of the Count. There is a sexual undercurrent here that is really provocative. The subplot of Renfield at the asylum, eating the bugs (""flies, flies, why should I eat flies when I could have nice fat juicy spiders). It is such a treat to watch the work of Tod Browning, using almost no soundtrack, still pulling us along. Then there is Professor Van Helsing, who is almost as unsettling as the vampire himself.This was Lugosi's shining hour. It's too bad Hollywood didn't meet him half way. Nevertheless, I feel so fortunate to have this delightful film to watch as often as I wish. It is such a part of our culture; everyone should see this and know why.",Dracula
6,claudio_carvalho,Classic Movie from Universal Studios,10,16 February 2005,"The real estate agent Renfield (Dwight Frye) travels to Transilvania for a business meeting with Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi), who is interested in Carfax Abbey in London. Renfield is converted in a servant of Dracula and prepares his master's ship travel to his new a property. While navigating, Dracula sucks the blood and kills all the crew of the vessel. Once in London, Dracula sucks the blood of Lucy Weston (Frances Dade) and she becomes an undead. He feels also a kind of passion for Mina Seward (Helen Chandler), the daughter of Dr. Jack Seward (Herbert Bunston) and fiancé of Jonathan Harker (David Manners). Dracula sucks her blood, Mina has a weird behavior and health problem, and Dr. Seward calls a specialist, Prof. Abraham Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), to diagnose the mysterious problem with Mina. Although being a scientist, Van Helsing believes in the supernatural, and tries to save Mina from turning into a vampire. ""Dracula"" is a spectacular well-known classic vampire story, with a magnificent transposition of the Bram Stoker's novel to the cinema. Although being a 1931 black and white movie, the photography and the camera work are excellent. There are at least two magnificent scenes: the long traveling of the camera in the sanatorium, from the yard to Remfield's room and the long stairway in the end of the movie to Dracula's tomb. The performances are quite theatrical, as usual in that period, and the film does not show any explicit violent scene. I dare to say that probably it is Bela Lugosi's best performance. ""Universal Studios"" released in Brazil a wonderful box, with the shape of a coffin, called ""Classic Monster Collection"" with eight classic horror movies on DVD. Maybe ""Dracula"" is my favorite one. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Drácula""Note: On 23 November 2013, I saw the Spanish Version of this movie.",Dracula
7,mark.waltz,"Dracula may be dead, but the classic horror genre will live for eternity.",10,23 October 2014,"After almost one hundred years of cinematic macabre nail and neck biting, Dracula still lives on, although his looks have changed enormously over those times. From the monstrous looking thin, bald creature in ""Nosferatu"" with the elf ears to the changing looks of Gary Oldman in Francis Ford Coppola's 1993 masterpiece (which Leslie Nielsen got to spoof in ""Dracula-Dead and Loving It""), Dracula remains an undying un-dead character of fiction, even if there was a real life Vlad the Impaler who was the basis for Bram Stoker's novel of the legend of the vampire.Even with Oldman's unforgettable performance and other Draculas (such as Christopher Lee and Frank Langella), it is Bela Lugosi's performance as the count which remains the visionary for this creature of the night. Even though he lives in a Carpathian mountain castle loaded with cobwebs and strange looking rodents (one obviously an armadillo), he is definitely a creature of class, although his choice of beverage does not include wine and his nightlife, other than one visit to the opera upon his arrival in England, doesn't include going to the theater or ballet. He enjoys another dance, the dance of death, and other than one statement about how glorious it would be to be really dead, he is totally unapologetic of his lustful desire for human plasma.Has there ever been a more haunting carriage ride than Dwight Frye's journey through the Carpathian mountains? The mountain range looks absolutely desolate, in fact absolutely lifeless. It's obviously Lugosi driving the buggy, his eyes piercing in the dark without words as he picks Frye up from the fleeing carriage that is desperate to get out of the area. When Frye arrives at Dracula's castle, it becomes all the more eerie, with Lugosi's friendly greeting obviously plotting something more ominous as he declares, ""I bid you welcome!"". The presence of three obviously dead beauties is quite haunting, and it is obvious that Frye will not come out of this visit as he entered it. Even as Dracula changed looks over the years, his high-born nature never allows Dracula to be as crude as the monstrous creature of ""Nosferatu"". By not giving a backstory to the count's life, he remains a monster, yet one of noble birth, who is destined for evil and a gruesome demise.While the 1992 remake is certainly a superb romantic vision of the creature, this version makes no effort to romanticize him which gives Lugosi an element of mystery in his performance. He has a few scenes in dealing with the London characters he encounters in a social setting, but most of the time, he is brandishing his cape around to trap some unsuspecting victim in his web. The Mina of Helen Chandler is a sweet, rather stereotypical ingénue with little to do other than look petrified as she falls under Dracula's spell. Lugosi is supported with an over-the-top but fun performances by Frye as the psychotic Renfield and Edward Van Sloan as the very determined Van Helsing. David Manners is rather bland as Jonathan Harker. The use of music from ""Swan Lake"" over the opening gives an eerie feeling. Appropriately slow moving in spots, it is almost opera like in the way it is presented. It is just too bad that when this became a Broadway musical, it was done so blandly that I had to refer to it as ""the most bring $100 I've ever spent in my life.""",Dracula
8,kosmasp,Iconic and ahead of its time,9,9 October 2021,"I do have to rewatch Nosferatu, which I think is a bit ... well better than this all things considering. Still the performance of Bela Lugosi as Dracula is as Iconic as anything can get. The very first shot we see him ... his introduction ... what a movement of the camera, what a great shot.The spanish language version shot at the same time opted for a different approach. More on that on the other page - but I understand if some may like the other version more than this one. It is longer and has certain things that may work better than they are here. This has aged quite well all things considered though. They couldn't show violence or nudity - something that some may find essential especially when you think of bloodsucking.Bela did not speak english that well ... but that almost can be a charme when you see and listen to him. A sort of authenticity one may even say. Black and White but with sound - and camera movement. Which elevates this even more ... a classic for more than one reason, but Bela being the main one of course.",Dracula
9,classicsoncall,"""To die, to be really dead, that must be glorious.""",8,2 November 2004,"One of the definitive films of the early horror genre, ""Dracula"" still maintains it's classic appeal. From his first words muttered on screen - ""I am Dracula... I bid you welcome"" - Bela Lugosi sets the brooding, menacing tone that pervades throughout the film, heightened by each sinister close up as he measures his victims. What better way to greet agent Renfield, than to describe the howling of a wolf outside of Castle Dracula - ""Listen to them... children of the night, what music they make"". The Count makes Renfield his first victim, who now swears allegiance to his Master, surviving the ship voyage to England by devouring ants, flies and other small creatures for their blood. Dwight Frye's portrayal of Renfield is accompanied by a diabolical, guttural cackle that portends more misery to come. Upon arrival in London, Dracula makes himself at home at Carfax Abbey, adjoining the grounds of the Seward Sanitarium where Renfield is placed upon his discovery as the lone survivor of the Vesta's ocean voyage. From there, he casts his sinister eye on potential victims. In turn, the Count's presence is signaled by a flying bat or the howl of a wolf, creepily suggesting unspeakable horror.Contemporary fans of modern day horror films may find ""Dracula"" slow moving and even boring, but I find the pacing to be measured and deliberate. Even Lugosi's speech pattern, delivered with over enunciation due to his newness with the language, is perfect in defining the Dracula character. You come to believe it when The Count proclaims - ""There are far worse things awaiting man than death"".",Dracula
10,gavin6942,The Definitive Count Dracula,8,3 October 2010,"Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi) buys Carfax Abbey in London and sets sail, with the real estate agent Renfield (Dwight Frye) now under his control. Upon reaching London, he goes after lovely young Mina (Helen Chandler), while Renfield is confined to an insane asylum and all the ship's crew are dead.Director Tod Browning is a master here and the film has a crisp look well beyond its years. While he may also be known for ""Freaks"", there is no doubt ""Dracula"" is his feature work. Likewise with Bela Lugosi, who defined the look of Dracula forever... making the creature more sensual, less monstrous.The man who deserves a good bit of credit is Dwight Frye, who plays Renfield. I have always felt the Renfield character was one of the best in the book, and often the most impressive on film (see Tom Waits in the Coppola version). Frye sets the bar high for crazy henchman types.""Dracula"" is so ingrained in American pop culture that despite seeing it for the first time only now, there was no scene that did not already seem intimately familiar to me. It is iconic and unforgettable.",Dracula
11,lee_eisenberg,"although the movie itself was kinda silly, you can always ""count"" on Bela Lugosi",6,29 July 2005,"Bela Lugosi sure lived an adventure. Back in his native Hungary, he was involved with Communist leader Bela Kun. When Nicholas Horthy de Nagybanya overthrew Kun, Lugosi fled the country. Making his way to America and speaking little to no English, he eventually got to play the most famous vampire of all time. And I guess that he will forever be associated with this role.That said, the movie was actually sorta silly. They based it more off of a stage play than off of the original novel. But Lugosi had some great lines: ""I am...Dracula."" ""I never drink...vine."" So, ""Dracula"" remains a classic, if only for the one-liners.",Dracula
12,jboothmillard,Dracula,8,14 December 2005,"Based on the story by Bram Stoker, this is probably the most well known of all the film adaptations, from director Tod Browning. Basically Renfield (Dwight Frye) is summoned to the castle of vampire Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi) to finalise the purchase of Carfax Abbey in London, and after which he is turned into an obedient servant. Dracula, in his coffin, travels the sea to London to suck the blood of female victims, including young Lucy Weston (Frances Dade). He then turns his attentions to her friend Mina (Helen Chandler), engaged to John Harker (David Manners) and daughter of Dr. Jack Seward (Herbert Bunston). It is when Mina's health is deteriorating that Seward calls specialist Prof. Abraham Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), who realises Dracula is a vampire, and he takes Jonathan and Seward through measures of dealing with vampires to prevent Mina becoming one of the undead. Lugosi with his strong Hungarian accent is perfect in his debut role as the Count, and being essentially the first sound horror film, it is still considered one of the great classics of cinema. Count Dracula was number 33 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 83 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make.""), it was it was number 90 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, and it was number 85 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!",Dracula
13,ccthemovieman-1,'Educational' More Than 'Exciting',5,31 December 2006,"Younger people who never saw the original here but have seen Dracula movies sometime in the past 30 years will be very disappointed with this original version. I'm not young, and I was disappointed, too, not that it was all bad.The film does have an eerie feel to it in a primitive way, so kudos for that. Bela Lugosi, the first and most famous Dracula of them all, has eyes that penetrate and are unforgettable. Unfortunately, that's about it as the only things unforgettable about this film. I said what I said in the first paragraph because there is no blood, not even one scene of Dracula biting anyone. Come on - this is Dracula!! The ending wasn't very dramatic, either: a most disappointing finish.I did enjoy watching this for the ""historical"" value, however, because having only known Dracula movies since the '50s I learned a few truths from this film. ""Truths,"" meaning that (1) Dracula had to return to the soil when he went to sleep at night, not particularly in a coffin, and Renfield was institutionalized when he arrived in America and stayed there until Dracula killed him in the end. You don't see these things in latter-day Dracula movies or in Dracula spoofs.",Dracula
14,rmax304823,Part of our common cultural iconography.,9,8 January 2007,"A couple of things always occur to me during the opening scenes. One is that Renfield is a moron for ignoring the villagers' pleas for him to stay off the Borgo Pass on Walpurgisnacht. ""Dah CASTLE? Castle DRAH-coo-la????"" Why take chances? Especially when Renfield notices that his carriage has no driver and the horses are being led by a bat. Isn't THAT reason enough to bail out? Then there's the castle itself. I frankly admire the decor and maintenance of the interior. It's got genuine atmosphere, not the fake atmosphere of, say, the Taj Mahal Motel in Los Angeles or the Kansas City Tiki.But the surroundings and the host are spooky enough that when Count Dracula says, ""I am Dracula. I bid you velcome."" And, ""Da spider -- spinnink his vamp faw da unvary fly. Da blood is da LIFE, Meester Renfield,"" that would do the job for most people.But then Renfield is a little peculiar to begin with, if you ask me. An effete wimpy character, shorter than anyone else in the film, ladies included. And offered that drugged wine by Dracula. I feel the same protective way towards him as I do towards Janet Leigh when she's stepping naked into the shower in ""Psycho."" No matter how many times I've seen it I always want to shout out a warning. Janet Leigh was a canny and determined woman, whereas Renfield seems to earn a kind of Darwinian extinction for his wanton trust.What a weird flick. It moves with lethal slowness. I don't mean the pace is slack or that anything lasts too long. I mean that the dialog and the action within scenes seem to take place at almost glacial tempo. The only abrupt motions are when Dracula jerks away from wolf bane or a crucifix or slaps a mirror out of Van Helsing's hands. Now if this were a comedy, or anything other than a horror film, that deliberate pace would be the kiss of death. But it suits ""Dracula."" Things, even the most awful, strike us as taking place in slow motion the way they sometimes do in a dream -- not just a nightmare but an oneiristic catastrophe.I don't think anyone could have handled the part of Dracula as well as Lugosi. There is his cadaverous makeup, for one thing, and his manner -- always polite, always smiling, reeking of moral corruption. And his speech! God, it's exquisite! The rhythm, the pauses, the inflections that inform his lines. In a battle of wills, he points his curled and claw-like fingers towards Van Helsing and says, ""Come here."" When Van Helsing hesitates Lugosi extends his arm, lowers his voice, and commands him, ""Come . . . HER."" (""Her"", not ""here."") I don't know whether these stylistic touches were witting or not on Lugosi's part because, as I understand it, he learned to speak English phonetically for his first performances. At any rate he gives his lines the most curious contours heard on any screen.The whole movie is really an exercise in style because the plot doesn't make any sense. Example. Is Renfield turned into a vampire or no? If not, why does he thirst only for blood, even if it's the blood of flies? If so, why does he run around in the daytime and how does Dracula kill him? Well, as long as we're asking questions, what are armadillos and possums doing in the basement of Dracula's castle in Transylvania? And what did Dracula and his wives eat between visits from English real estate brokers? I wondered the same thing about mosquitoes once when I was in muskeg country in the Yukon, a hundred miles or more from the nearest large warm blooded animal, and found the place was swarming with them.I must add too that I didn't care much for the way Count Dracula managed his menage in Transylvania. There were at least three wives, which is not a bad idea in itself, but he treated them pretty shabbily, shooing them away from Renfield's unconscious body so he could get first dibs. Did he leave them behind? At least one of them because as he says to Renfield, ""I am only taking vit me three, uh -- boxes."" Maybe he did it because one was too tall or unattractive, though still spooky. You wouldn't want to kiss one.""As if awakened, she turns her face to yours; and with a shock, you see yourself, tiny, inside the golden amber of her eyeballs suspended, like a prehistoric fly.""I just watched the DVD with the score by Philip Glass, all strings, and all his usual repetitiveness. Glass may over-score the film a little but it's better than the original, and it's in 5.1.If you haven't seen this yet, you must. And don't get into a battle of wills with me. It's for your own good. ""Dracula"" has become part of our vernacular culture and if you don't know it, you'll miss some great stuff that will crop up in various contexts from time to time. ""I never drink -- vine."" Any person who claims to be cultivated knows where that line comes from.",Dracula
15,ma-cortes,"Vintage version with terrific acting by Bela Lugosi, being directed with drive and great single-mindedness by Tod Browning",7,2 November 2019,"Tod Browning's original but dated terror movie, this is the horrifying and sinister story of a revengeful vampire who must quench his thirst for human blood . A very imitated movie with several sequels, copies and rip-offs. Deservedly considered to be a gruesome classic film, thanks to abundant eerie scenes and the astonishing performance from Bela Lugosi as the vampire who needs human blood for nourishment, giving a definitely intimidating interpretation on the title role . A plush, glossy , but above all, a scary fim with a devastatingly effective climax. A good script and nice cast keep this first version based on Bram Stoker novel very entertaining and creepy. Although short a masterpiece due to slow second half, but adding portentous and brilliant images that are still examples of how to make the flesh creep. Here Lugosi plays his most famous character as a count vampire who terrorizes the countryside and mansions in his search for human blood, while he is immediately killing people for his blood and then turning them into vampires . The settings of the vampire's home in Transylvania and England have only been equalled in Browning's own ""Mark of the Vampire"" five years after, also starred by Bela Lugosi, along with Carol Borland . Shot at the same time to Spanish version 1931 by George Melford with Carlos Villarias, Lupita Tovar, that is thought to be more terrifying and more visually appealing than the English language counterpart. In 1999 it was re-released and re-scored by Philip Glass and performed by Kronos Quarter. It contains a nice support cast such as David Manners playing Jonathan Harker, Helen Chandler as Mina, Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing, Dracula's nemesis . Special mention for Dwight Frye as Renfield-he played the hunchback in James Whale's Frankenstein-, he is over-the-top, as cinema has few scenes to equal the first sight of his madness, standing gibbering on a ship filled with dead people . This Dracula by Tod Browning was very well photographed in black and white full of dark and shades by Karl Freund, who directed The Mummy , being one of the main assets of the film.It is sequelled by Dracula's daughter 1936 by Lambert Hiller, with Gloria Holden, Otto Kruger, Edward Van Sloan .Hammer Films produced various Dracula : Horror of Dracula 1958 by Terence Fisher with Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Melissa Stribling, Michael Gough.

16,BA_Harrison,Listen to them. Armadillos of the night. What snuffling sounds they make.,6,31 March 2010,"Despite bearing little physical resemblance to Bram Stoker's literary character, Bela Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula defined the look and feel of the vampire for decades; from countless black and white horrors, to George Hamilton's bloodsucker in Love At First Bite, to Sesame Street's number loving Count, Lugosi's influence is everywhere.The unfortunate result of such an iconic performance is that Tod Browning's 1931 cinematic adaptation of the book—in which Lugosi played the infamous count— now feels like a work of self parody. This fact, combined with Browning's rather naive direction (cinema was in its infancy, the art of storytelling was still evolving, and some shots are extremely clumsy), plus a noticeable lack of soundtrack, makes Dracula an often embarrassingly dated affair that is hard to take seriously at times.Thank heavens for the superb Gothic atmosphere, impressive set designs, a few classic lines guaranteed to warm the heart of any avid horror geek (""Listen to them.

What music they make.""), and a chilling turn from Dwight Frye as Dracula's loyal slave Renfield, all of which go to ensure that, even though the film isn't the flawless masterpiece many claim it to be, it still offers enough for fans of vintage horror to enjoy.After all, if the cinematography, acting, and direction fail to impress, there's always the rubber bats, vampire wasp (?!?!), clockwork spider and family of Transylvanian armadillos to keep the viewer amused.",Dracula
17,moonspinner55,Lugosi's tour-de-force...,6,4 December 2005,"Bela Lugosi's most famous role, that of Count Dracula, a mesmerizing vampire who travels to London and begins stalking society beauties for their blood. A bit creaky here and there, the film's energy level seems to drop off whenever Dracula is out of sight; however, the film's eerie beauty and chilling atmosphere are well-captured by director Tod Browning. Based on the book by Bram Stoker, the material was first adapted into a successful Broadway play starring Lugosi (despite his triumph on stage, Universal Pictures didn't want him for the part!). A Spanish-language version of the script was filmed simultaneously; starring Carlos Villar and Lupita Tovar, it is considered by film-historians to be the equal of this version in every way (some say superior). Followed by ""Dracula's Daughter"" (without Lugosi) in 1936. **1/2 from ****",Dracula
18,Quinoa1984,Creatures of the night... what music they make,9,26 July 2008,"Tod Browning's Dracula suffers so many decades later for one simple reason, and a second one that's more subjective: first, we all know Dracula, like a quintessential Shakespeare or Jack and the Beanstalk, we all know what Dracula is about because the lore is given to us as kids and it's taken as it is, which leads to a lack of surprise at what will occur in this film (lets face facts, some of us have even watched the Coppola Dracula before this one); second, it is, sadly, dated in some aspects. Luckily, for the latter, what makes it dated doesn't really have a negative impact on enjoying the picture overall- when one sees the bat flying about- or, sorry, swiveling and nearly crashing and breaking against the scenery- it's cheesy and corny and all those things that show it was 1931.But aside from these minor liabilities, Browning's film succeeds because of, to use the oft-repeated and tired description, atmosphere (make no mistake, a chill will run up your spine as fog rolls in and Dracula appears to suck the blood of poor Renfield), and Lugosi's monolithic performance. Has any actor come close with just a deranged look in the eye and Hungarian/double-jointed curl of the fingers to acting this creepy? While Max Schreck and Klaus Kinski, both playing/inhabiting Nosferatu in those film versions, could arguably be considered far more creepy, Lugosi has the aid of sound and a odd control of the English language that adds just that necessary edge on a scene. So many years later, it's the definitive performance of Lugosi's, for better or worse this turned out for him.Back to the atmosphere though, as the only other truly notable and crazy turn among the sturdy cast is Dwight Frye as spider-eating/schitzo Renfield. The sets, the lack thereof a score, and the mesmerizing lighting and gliding camera-work of Karl Freund (who, apparently, directed some parts of the film), not to mention the moments of fog, make up much of the ""classic"" quality of the picture. This side, even so many eons later it seems, hasn't aged too badly, and practically all variations of Dracula or vampire movies only come a hair's edge close to imitating or emulating the Gothic stature of the technique presented here. Even when a scene of dialog might lack some density due to it being mostly pure exposition, it's impossible to take your eyes off what's going on or being less than absorbed in the action. No matter how familiar, Browning's Dracula deserves all its accolades and attention as the first ""Hollywood"" movie on the Count. Whether or not it's the greatest of all time I'm not sure. 9.5/10",Dracula
19,JohnHowardReid,Still popular!,7,18 March 2018,"Copyright Universal A Tod Browning Production, presented by Carl Laemmle. New York opening at 12 February 1931. U.S. release: 14 February 1931. 75 minutes. 
 
NOTES: The stage play opened on Broadway at the Fulton on 5 October 1927 and ran for a smash-hit 265 performances before hitting the road. Lugosi, of course, played Dracula, and Edward Van Sloan was Van Helsing. Others in the cast included Dorothy Peterson, Nedda Harrison and Terrence Neill. Ira Hards directed for producer Horace Liveright.
 Filming began 29 September 1930 and wrapped 15 November 1930. Negative cost: approx. $355,000. COMMENT: At times, this version of Dracula seems very much like a filmed stage play. An engrossing play, but a work of theatre nonetheless. Other than skilful glass work enhancing some sets, there are no special photographic effects to speak of. The bat does not turn into Dracula before our eyes. Instead the inanimate creature dangles around very obviously on wires. Worse, the dialogue-especially in the less capable mouths of Manners and Bunston-tends to be stiff and stilted.  Other critics have rightly objected to the considerable alterations made to Stoker's novel. Only the principal characters and the basic outline of the plot itself (plus of course all the legendary vampire lore) have been retained.  However, production values are otherwise first-class and the movie actually looks much younger than its age. Browning's direction has tremendous drive and force, thanks in part to the powerful performances delivered by Lugosi, Chandler, Van Sloan, Frye and Dade; and thanks also to Freund's frighteningly atmospheric photography and Hall's superlatively moody, gothic sets. Astute film editing helps increase an already sharp pace, and it's a tribute to Browning's concentrated direction (and some forceful sound effects) that the absence of background music is not particularly noticed. AVAILABLE on DVD through Universal. Quality rating: eight out of ten (I thought some of the scenes were printed a bit too dark. It's sometimes hard to see what's going on).",Dracula
20,Coventry,Bela Lugosi...do I need to say more ?,8,23 July 2003,"Normally, I'm not a big fan of vampire movies. In the great genre that is horror, I think vampires are the least interesting characters. But of course there are exceptions. Like the very original vampires in Near Dark and Fright Night and the Dracula legend !! I liked Gary Oldman in the role of the bloodsucking count. I loved Christopher Lee and I WORSHIP Bela Lugosi in the part. Bela Lugosi doesn't play Count Dracula...he is count Dracula. I've never seen a person so appropriate to play a character. His eyes...his body language. Those elements make the entire movie. A legend was born in 1931 with this film. It'll be told many times but never again shall it be so magical with the use of so less material. In fact, there are no effects or make-up ( except the face of Bela ) and this is one of the only movies that doesn't need that. The things that are suggested are frightening enough. It must have been a great thrill to see this movie when it came out back in 1931. I would have loved to be there. I surely wanted to live the feeling of fear when Bela looked you straight in the eyes from the big screen. The story is known by everybody. Count Dracula buys Carfax Abbey and together with Renfield ( who was made to his slave ) he travels to England. He meets Mina, the daughter of the owner of the mental institution which lays next to Carfax Abbey. Dracula is intrigued by her and tries to make her his bride for eternity. Mina's beloved Jonathan Harker fights back and also the very bright Dr. Van Helsing who seems to know a lot about vampires. He's the only one who can beat Dracula but the time to do so is limited since Mina is already under the influence of Count Dracula. This movie is part of the great Universal monster classics. Brought out in the same year as Frankenstein (starring Boris Karloff) this film made a little less impact on me, but still it's an undeniable masterpiece. The atmosphere hanging around it never saw an equal. I didn't knew anything the further life of Bela Lugosi until I saw Tim Burton's film Ed Wood. Bela sure did deserve a more respectful ending to his career. Oh, well...he shall always be immortal for his role here as the father of all vampires.",Dracula
21,michaelRokeefe,Genuine horror classic.,7,30 June 2001,"This movie has thrilled and chilled viewers for generations and also serves as a standard for vampire flicks. This is the role that Bela Lugosi was born to play, Count Dracula. His mannerisms and looks make the character masterful and commanding. Based on Bram Stoker's novel, a vampire terrorizes the English countryside searching for sustenance, human blood.Glorious black and white. The lighting, scenery and mood music should share equal billing with the great direction of Tod Browning. This movie leaves an impression that lasts a lifetime.Wonderful supporting cast includes: David Manners, Edward Van Sloan, Helen Chandler and Dwight Frye.",Dracula
22,Theo Robertson,Has Dated Very Poorly And Left Me Wondering About Its Regard In The First Place,5,9 April 2017,"""I am not afraid"" states Renfield as he takes a coach trip to Castle Dracula. I first saw this for the first time as a child when BBC 2 double billed this with the 1931 version of FRANKENSTEIN and because this broadcast was something of a cultural event my peers and I discussed it on the Monday morning . We all agreed on two things. Firstly that FRANKENSTEIN was scary to an extent, Secondly just like Renfield none of us were scared by Dracula People who love this movie by way of awarding it 10/10 may suggest that schoolboys have little in the way of critical facilities when it comes to watching a movie. I can counteract that theory by stating that I have just seen it again as a middle aged man and it could in all honesty be the greatest comedy I have ever seen. Whatever its qualities as entertainment - and it is entertaining , except not in the way it was meant - it is in no way any sort of horror masterpiece I've never read Stoker's novel but just about every film version I've seen has Johnathan Harker ( Character change in this version ) show the count a photo of his fiancé Mina and Dracula instantly falls in love with the photo, so much so that he embarks on a journey to England and make her his eternal bride. In this version Dracula and Renfield embark to England for no obvious reason that left me thinking an inciting incident had been edited out of the print . The rest of the film continues in the same way where motive and explanation are absent or confusing. The climax to the movie is a ready made cliché of ""An anti-climax"" The acting is uniformally dreadful. Okay they're probably not used to acting on sound stages but some of the cast give such loud performances you'd be able to hear them on Mars , especially Dwight Frye as Renfield while Edward Van Sloan imitates the league of nations as his accent constantly changes usually in mid sentence. Bela Lugosi manages the impossible while being completely stilted and using over emphatic inflexion at the same time. He's even more laughable when he doesn't say anything and the camera holds his unblinking gaze. I suppose the audience aren't supposed to ask why there appears to be a torch shining in to his eyes either ? I can hear enraged fans of Dracula claiming that my criticisms are down to things such as ignorance. Let me tell you I have seen a large number of films in my life including ones from this period and I've commentated on them at this site, James Whale's FRANKENSTEIN was and does remain a classic and Tod Browning;s FREAKS from 1932 remains one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen, so much so that I have trouble believing it was made by the director of this. I could have given Dracula ten out of ten for being a comedy but give a more realistic mark of 5/10 and I'm being generous. In reality it's a movie whose hyperboyle goes before it and a reputation that is clearly underserved",Dracula
23,Scarecrow-88,Dracula,10,26 May 2007,"I know that over the years many do not consider Tod Browning's Dracula film to be as great as reputed to be, but I just continue to love it each and every time I view it. I certainly believe this is a crash course in how to shoot Gothic horror the real way. The opening is just astounding with all the cobwebs, possums, the lady vampires and how they submit to their awakening master, and Lugosi appearing for the first time in all his splendor. His eyes, as the light glistens upon them, wreak of power and lust..whoever faces these eyes have to submit their will to his. Few weak minds, if any, can outlast the power of Count Dracula. Such richly macabre dialogue stands etched in horror lore from, ""I bid you welcome,"" to ""The blood is the life, Renfield""..each line becomes so eerie when rolled off the tongue of Lugosi. Some consider Lugosi's performance hammy, but I just revel in the way he stretches his dialogue..it becomes so quotable. Lugosi was simply born to play this creature of the night and when someone says Dracula, some might think Chris Lee, but most envision Lugosi with his vile stare that penetrates the very soul. His equal, let's just admit it, is Dwight Frye as the crazed Renfield, once quite a sane, intelligent, soft-spoken office type reverted to a blood-thirsty maniac because of Dracula. It's that fiendish, stark-raving madness that is so intensely memorable..no one can match this performance, so why even try? But, it's the way director Browning and cinematographer Karl Freund set up creepy darkened shot after creepy darkened shot of Dracula waiting out in the darkness commanding others to do his bidding that makes this such an endearing horror classic. Some might think Edward Van Sloan might be a bit too theatrical as Van Helsing, but I can't imagine anybody else in that scene where Dracula tries to pull his rival towards him with mind control only to find his adversary's will is too strong even for him.My favorite scenes, to be honest, occur in Transylvania before the film settles in London because the castle and way Lugosi is shot are so burned in my mind. Just the way Dracula looks inside his decrepit abode on the stairwell as he stares at Renfield with that fiendish blood-lust so apparent or where we see an armadillo climbing from a coffin with this skeletal hand peeking ever slightly out. Or, the scene where Renfield receives his ride on the horse carriage as Dracula hides enough under a black cloak to remain anonymous..each Gothic set-up is a hypnotic entrapment for the fan in love with the moody set up of atmospheric horror. I watched this with the Philip Glass score and must say I prefer it..something majestic occurs when we hear the eruption of strings as Dracula appears. The score, for me, takes away the ""creaky"" criticism that so often accompanies one's insult towards it.",Dracula
24,Doylenf,Horror classic has to be judged by today's standards...,6,29 October 2006,"Time changes everything. Once upon a time Dracula, the stage play, was a sensation that starred BELA LUGOSI as the blood-thirsty man in the cape who thrilled theater audiences with his chilling portrayal. He's still chilling in the screen version Tod Browning directed and there's plenty of creepy atmosphere to keep you riveted to the story.But there are also plenty of faults. The opening scenes are a lot more cinematic than what follows once we leave the castle and the story starts dealing with Mina (HELEN CHANDLER) and Jonathan Harker (DAVID MANNERS) at their residence. It then becomes almost completely stagebound, with static movement of story and characters so that you know you're watching a museum piece from the '30s. The horror is so diluted by the stagey slow-talking dialog (sound was new and actors were told to keep their speeches slow so every word could be heard). It's an almost silent acting approach to the whole thing.BELA LUGOSI is very menacing in his huge close-ups but is guilty of stage acting all the way through. DWIGHT FRYE makes a very intense and enjoyable Renfield, although he too is guilty of extravagant overacting by today's standards.The cobweb atmosphere is dark and appropriately scary and the B&W lensing of the story is very impressive. But, as stated above, you have to take it for what it is--a primitive telling of the great story handicapped by its faithfulness to the stage version.It ends rather abruptly as Harker and Mina ascend the stairs and Van Helsing tells them he'll be along soon. Fadeout. The End. Much too abrupt. Modern audiences are bound to feel cheated by the less than thrilling ending.Summing up: Flaws and all, still an interesting experience mainly because Lugosi and Frye keep it watchable.",Dracula
25,preppy-3,"Dull and stagy, but essential viewing",6,6 November 2000,"The film starts off extremely well with a visit to Dracula's castle in Transylvania. Then the movie moves to London and falls apart. For one thing, they changed the characters from the novel--Jonathan Harker went to Castle Dracula not Reinfield and everybody stands around talking about things. EVERYTHING is talked about, never shown. It's like watching a very static stage play. Also, a woman (Lucy) becomes a vampire early on. She's discussed...then ignored. It seems she's still wandering around after the movie ends! Also David Manners is very very good-looking as Harker, but his acting is bad. It's not entirely his fault--he has few lines and they're all pretty bad. Still, it should be seen for three reasons--Bela Lugosi, Dwight Frye and Edward Van Sloan. Lugosi is, of course, Dracula. He gives a great performance (hard to believe he was doing the lines phonetically) and his interpretation defined Dracula. Frye is really creepy (and funny) as Reinfeld--that laugh of his is REAL spooky! And Edward Van Sloan plays Van Helsing perfectly. Only Peter Cushing did a better job in the Hammer films. Also, Helen Chandler has one great moment playing Mina. She's under Dracula's spell and is hungrily looking at her boyfriend's neck! So, if you're a horror fan (like me) this is essential viewing, but expect lots of dull stretches when those three aren't on. Let's go listen to the children of the night...",Dracula
26,LeonLouisRicci,A Time-Stamped Trip,8,29 January 2013,"Creaky, creepy and stodgy. This seminal icon of Popular Culture is a dated curio-so that is an attractive artifact of the early sound era. There is much atmosphere in this beautiful studio bound, very popular film that started the Universal Monster series.Bela Lugosi's forever hammy performance is upstaged by his unearthly handsome face and a voice that mangled the English language and set the tone for the character as a frightening foreigner from the Underworld. The cinematography is static but eerie and essential to this photo-play as are the dark and decorated sets that lend bizarre believability to this fan favorite. The movie does not hold up as well as its early Movie Monster cousins, but has it's own charm and hypnotic romantic appeal.A time stamped trip to celluloid history, this Vampire is a product of a post Victorian era of drippy Gothic and stiff but arresting artifacts of a dress up culture. Those conceits aside, this is a must see for the appearance of it all, but may alienate modern viewers that prefer their Vampires to be overtly sexual and not subtly sensual.",Dracula
27,Bunuel1976,Dracula (1931) - US Version ***1/2; Spanish Version ***,8,9 August 2005,"The Browning/Lugosi 'classic' has always been one of my favorite Universal horror films but, ever since the simultaneously-produced 'rival' Spanish version resurfaced, the 'original' has taken a beating by fans and historians alike - mainly because the latter features superior camera-work! This, however, is the ONLY area where it can lay a claim to be better in when compared to the US version (the fact that leading lady Lupita Tovar had a sexier wardrobe than Helen Chandler shouldn't even be considered, I guess). Still, the fact that on the DVD the opinion that the seminal US version is the inferior one seems to be shared by quite a few people hasn't done it any favors! I remember being impressed by the Spanish version when I first watched it in 2001, singling out for praise the performance of Pablo Alvarez Rubio as Renfield and, of course, George Robinson's cinematography. However, coming back to it now, I felt that Rubio's hysterical rendering of the character (which reminded me of Gene Wilder in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN [1974] of all people!) was nowhere nearly as nuanced as Dwight Frye's unforgettable characterization in the US version. Regarding the ""superior camera-work"", I guess this is true for individual sequences (Dracula's introduction, for instance) but, frankly, I never felt that Karl Freund - a pioneer of the moving camera - had somehow been restrained by Tod Browning, who admittedly wasn't very fond of this technique. Given that of late we've also been faced by the ridiculous assumption that Browning didn't actually direct the film, he couldn't have - since he wasn't even there!! It may be however, that since frequent Browning collaborator Lon Chaney (who had been slated for the title role) died before shooting began, the director sort of lost heart in the project - coupled also with the fact that the script was rather talky, another element with which Browning felt uneasy! Well, whatever went on behind the scenes, for me what's in front remains one of the highlights of the American horror film - from the marvelous dialogue (especially as delivered - each in their own unique way - by Lugosi, Frye and Edward Van Sloan), irreproachable performances (Frye and Van Sloan were at their best, while Lugosi only ever really came close with THE BLACK CAT [1934] and SON OF FRANKENSTEIN [1939]) and memorable individual scenes (the entire first act set in Transylvania, the confrontation scenes between Dracula and his nemesis Professor Van Helsing, Renfield's various ravings). The tame ending may appear anti-climactic to most people but I honestly was never bothered by it! If anything, this was remedied in any number of ways in subsequent outings...Which brings us back to the Spanish Dracula: like I said, the film is an interesting and altogether pleasing 'alternate' to the Lugosi version...but it is fatally compromised by the inadequate leading performance of Carlos Villarias, whose bulging eyes and feral snarls can't hold a candle to Lugosi's definitive screen vampire! This version does go to places where the American doesn't (Browning shies away from the vampire attacks, for instance) and even features 'new' scenes like the aftermath of the vampiric Lucy's demise - but, at 104 minutes (a full half-hour longer than the US version, when considering that they were following the same script!) it's way overlong for its own good. The Browning/Lugosi version is often criticized for its sluggishness but this one actually moves at a snail's pace: take, for instance, the famous scene where Dracula is exposed by the mirror - Lugosi knocks the box down immediately, while Villarias takes forever to do so (even if his resolution is effectively flamboyant nonetheless).A word about the DVD quality: disappointingly, the Spanish version features closed-captions (for the hearing-impaired) rather than proper subtitles. As for the US version, the print utilized for this particular transfer (which differs from that of the original, and more satisfactory, 1999 release) is a bit too dark for my taste and the dialogue sometimes was hard to catch due to the incessant hiss on the soundtrack! It also reverts to the 'original' single groan during Dracula's staking (instead of the elongated variant available on the earlier disc)...but does feature a bit of music at the end of the Opera sequence, which had been missing from the previous edition!! Well, this only means that it's worth keeping both copies of Dracula as neither is really definitive...",Dracula
28,utgard14,"""The blood is the life, Mr. Renfield.""",8,14 February 2014,"Of all the original Universal horrors, Dracula is probably the most divisive. It does creak in places and the stagey elements will turn off a lot of those viewers who don't frequently watch older films. But it's undeniably a classic and I feel it still entertains, despite its flaws. The story, which I'm sure we're all familiar with by now, starts with Renfield (Dwight Frye) traveling to Transylvania to finalize the lease of Carfax Abbey in England to Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi). Once at the Count's castle, Renfield falls under his spell. When the ship they take to England arrives with everybody on board dead and drained of blood, Renfield is held responsible and committed to an asylum. But the real killer is centuries-old vampire Dracula, who now preys on the women of London. When Dracula sets his sights on Mina Seward (Helen Chandler) he arouses the suspicions of the distinguished Professor Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), who knows all about vampires and sets out to stop the evil Count.Classic Universal horror film that, along with Frankenstein, set off the 1930s horror boom as well as cementing the public image of Dracula for decades to come. The script owes as much, if not more, to the stage play than to Bram Stoker's original novel. It's a much more restrained film than you might expect considering it's about vampires. There are no fangs, no blood, and the stake-through-the-heart scene occurs offscreen. Even Renfield's depravities are only alluded to rather than shown. Tod Browning's direction is often stiff and receives a lot of deserved criticism. But there are some iconic scenes and images, helped in large part by the great cinematographer Karl Freund. Unsubstantiated reports are Freund actually directed a good deal of the movie, which may account for why sometimes the camera moves and provides for interesting shots while other times the camera is drearily static. Things are at their stagiest during the setbound scenes in London. Never is it worse than in the scene where David Manners' John Harker tries to shoo away an obviously fake bat (""Look out, he'll get in your hair!""). The scene is suppose to take place on a terrace but it's clearly a set with matte painting walls that poorly resemble the actual outdoors. It's one of the few scenes in the movie that even die-hard fans must chuckle a little over.Career-defining roles for Lugosi, Van Sloan, and Frye. Bela Lugosi's Dracula is the version by which all others are measured. Lugosi played the part on the stage and brings a level of theatricality to the role, hamming it up gloriously. His distinct way of delivering lines -- speaking slowly with his thick Hungarian accent and mid-sentence pauses -- would be often imitated over the years in a similar way to how people imitate William Shatner's line delivery today. Edward Van Sloan is the definitive Van Helsing. As much as I love Peter Cushing in the role, all vampire hunter roads lead to Van Sloan. Dwight Frye, another wonderful ham, is superb as the wild-eyed Renfield. Subtlety was never Frye's strong point and God bless him for it. David Manners and Helen Chandler are the film's weakest links, with overly affected performances that add to the criticisms of staginess.I caution everybody against watching the version with the new music score. Yes the film creaks at times and the lack of a music score doesn't help. But the version released in the '90s with the Phillip Glass score is just awful. The music is overbearing and very noticeably modern. It doesn't fit the movie at all and is more distracting than anything. So avoid that. But you should check out the Spanish language version, filmed at the same time as this one. While this filmed during the day, the Spanish version was filmed at night using the same sets and script, though its runtime is quite a bit longer. That version is often praised as being superior to this one. You can read my review on that film for my thoughts on it.",Dracula

Those eyes will haunt you forever.

30,zardoz-13,The First Classic Hollywood Vampire Thriller!,8,28 May 2010,"Bela Lugosi is the eponymous vampire in ""Dracula."" Many actors have played Dracula since Lugosi originated the role in Tod Browning's landmark horror chiller, but only one has matched Lugosi. Christopher Lee portrayed the immortal fangster seven times for Hammer and a couple of times for other producers. Ironically, Lugosi only played Dracula twice during his disappointing Hollywood film career. Seventeen years later in the twilight of his career, Lugosi donned the cape to play Dracula in ""Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein."" Although Browning's movie introduced one of the most popular horror villains in cinematic history, nothing about ""Dracula"" is remotely scary. First, Universal Studios made the film so as to not incur the wrath of the Hollywood Production Code or offend pious church groups. Second, Dracula never bares his fangs. Furthermore, we never see the infamous vampire feeding off his prey. After all, he couldn't have kept his evening clothes looking pristine if he got blood splashed all over himself from draining a rebellious human of their life essence. Third, when Van Helsing stakes Dracula in his coffin at the end, this important action occurs off screen with only the anguished groans of the Count to let us know that the vampire is dead. Originally, the Production Code Administration had Universal remove these sounds of death. Indeed, ""Metropolis"" lenser Carl Freund photographed ""Dracula,"" and he makes this nonsense look genuinely atmospheric. The close-up shots of an unblinking Lugosi as Dracula with pen lights brightening his lupine stare make this vampire look appropriately intimidating.Initially, the studio sought Lon Chaney, Sr., for the part, but cancer claimed Chaney before the great thespian could make the film. Lugosi landed the role for a minimal $500-a-week and he never topped ""Dracula,"" though he came close with ""White Zombie."" Eventually, he would thrive in Poverty Row studio chillers and comedies and ended his career in director Ed D. Wood's preposterous ""Plan 9 from Outer Space."" Browning went on to make the controversial ""Freaks"" with genuine freaks about intrigue and murder in a small traveling circus. Universal produced ""Dracula"" for about $341-thousand, but curiously enough they neglected to capitalize on their surprise hit until four years later when they produced ""Dracula's Daughter"" with no Lugosi in sight. Granted, Van Helsing had destroyed the Lugosi monster in the first film, but later films dismissed this consolation to realism. Lee's Dracula reconstitutes himself in virtually all the Hammer films. ""Dracula"" opens with a long shot as a real-life, horse-drawn stagecoach threads its way through the Carpathian Mountains. Renfield (Dwight Frye of ""The Doorway to Hell"") is a London real estate agent who has come to Transylvania with a lease for Count Dracula to sign. Renfield is riding with several other passengers when an anxious native explains that they must reach the inn before sunset. ""It is Walpurgis night, the night of evil."" He pauses and then continues, ""Nosferatu. On this night, Madame, the doors-they are barred and to the Virgin we pray."" Meantime, at the inn, the workers are reciting the Lord's Prayer in Hungarian. The coach pulls up at the Inn, but Renfield has no plans to stay. ""I say, porter, don't take my luggage down. I'm going to the Borgo Pass tonight."" The innkeeper struggles to persuade Renfield to remain until sunrise the following day because the coachman is frightened. Renfield explains that a carriage awaits him at midnight at the Borgo Pass. He adds that his destination is Castle Dracula. The innkeeper warns Renfield not to enter Castle Dracula. ""We people of the mountains believe at the castle there are vampires! Dracula and his wives. They take the form of wolves and bats. They leave their coffins at night and they feed on the blood of the living."" Renfield discounts all this hokum. He believes they are all superstitious, something that Renfield isn't. The innkeeper's wife thrusts a crucifix into Renfield's hand. ""If you must go, wear this for your mother's sake. It will protect you."" The crucifix was a standard weapon in any vampire hunter's arsenal. In this 1931 production, the crucifix can stop a vampire. When Universal Studios remade ""Dracula"" in the 1970s with Frank Langella, the crucifix bursts into flames in Dracula's presence. Renfield swaps stagecoaches at Borgo Pass and rides off to Castle Dracula. The coach is making good time when Renfield peers outside and sees a huge bat flapping its wings in front of the horses as if it were leading the steeds. Once they reach the castle, Renfield searches for the coachman who is nowhere in sight. Of course, we know from the instant that we saw the coachmen that he is Dracula and can shape-shift. Renfield enters the imposing but dilapidated Castle Dracula. The count guides his guest through the cob-web infested premises to more comfortable quarters. Dracula scrutinizes the lease to his future home in Carfax Abbey. Afterward, Renfield cuts himself accidentally with a paper clip. Dracula darts forward impulsively at the sight of blood on Renfield's middle finger. Just as he closes in for the kill, Dracula shrinks backwards in revulsion at the sight of the crucifix that topples onto Renfield's bloody hands. Later, Dracula bites Renfield after the head vampire has scared off his three wives. Dracula boards a sailing vessel, the Vesta, for London. He arrives in London and tours the town dressed up in a silk top hat and a cape. He approaches a flower girl and bites her, but we are shown nothing. Dracula introduces himself to Dr. Seward, Jonathan Harker, and Professor Van Helsing at the opera house. Not long afterward Dracula strikes and kills Lucy (Francis Dade of ""Raffles""). The mirror scene where Van Helsing exposes Dracula is good. The count exits the premises as a wolf so nobody will follow him. Later, Van Helsing and Harker track Dracula down and kill him in his coffin. ""Dracula"" qualifies a spooky classic horror thriller.",Dracula
31,Boba_Fett1138,Stylish horror classic.,9,3 December 2003,"Along with ""Alien"" this is the most stylish horror movie I have ever seen.This version of Dracula is different from others since this movie is based on a play. There are still some surprises and interesting elements even if you have seen some of the other many Dracula movies that has been made and in many ways this movie is better then all the other Dracula movies. One of the reasons why is the cast. Bela Lugosi with his crazy accent puts quite some passion in his role and Dwight Frye is simply amazing as Renfield. But the rest of the cast is also more than excellent. The acting is different from other movies made at the time, the acting can be described as timeless and even after more than 70 years it is still not outdated.But there are of course many other things that are outdated. Such as especially the special effects of course.An interesting element in this movie was the gentlemen battle between Dracula and Van Helsing. There was really some chemistry in the scene's between those two and there was a real tension without them both fighting each other.There was a really nice moody atmosphere that was very stylish. The great sets and locations contributed to this. But also the cinematography was wonderful and I especially like the way they filmed the character of count Dracula it was done really well!But of course an old movie like this is far from flawless. At times there are some serious pacing problems and it was a bit weird to see Renfield walk around freely in the house most of the time and there are dozens of more tiny things like this that makes the movie far from perfect. Still there are lot of things that compensate this and make this movie a real horror classic and a must see.Still after many years of movie making the best Dracula movie ever made and the movie leaves no question about it that Bela Lugosi is and always will be the one and only Dracula as much as I love Christopher Lee as Dracula...9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Dracula
32,kevinolzak,12 broadcasts on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater from 1966 to 1982,9,31 May 2019,"Universal founder Carl Laemmle gave his son the title of studio president for his 21st birthday in 1929, after which Junior scored a major triumph with the 1930 Best Picture Academy Award for ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" The notion of doing ""Dracula"" had already been broached, now planned as a sound vehicle for Lon Chaney, who completed his only sound film ""The Unholy Three"" shortly before his untimely death from bronchial cancer at age 47 in August 1930. Having lured director Tod Browning over from MGM, Junior now had to scramble to find a replacement to star, among the contenders Conrad Veidt, Paul Muni, Ian Keith, Chester Morris, Arthur Edmund Carewe, John Wray, Joseph Schildkraut, and William Courtenay (we can safely discount the 24 year old unknown John Carradine, whose screen career totaled but two roles and who would not join Universal until Spring 1931 for ""Heaven on Earth""). Universal had not counted on the persistence of Broadway's Count, Bela Lugosi, so eager to recreate the part on screen that he accepted a weekly salary of only $500, an offer the studio simply could not refuse. Lugosi first donned the immortal cape on October 5, 1927, and immediately scored a hit with his genuine Hungarian accent and unearthly mannerisms, a kind of undead Valentino that women flocked to see. For audiences accustomed to human villainy it was a revelation to see a supernatural denizen of the dark depicted with utmost seriousness, not explained away in the end but a true vampire. The opening two reels remain the film's finest achievement, set in Transylvania among the nosferatu before switching to modern England (automobiles in the streets) for a staid and talkative rendition of John Balderston and Hamilton Deane's stage version. The thick fog laden atmosphere in Transylvania achieves such glorious heights of atmosphere that the switch to London can't possibly top it, but Edward Van Sloan's Van Helsing and Dwight Frye's Renfield supply enough dramatic verve to keep things interesting. Helen Chandler was a popular stage actress accurately described as 'bloodless,' her Hollywood career lasting only a decade, while the part of Harker is totally thankless, due to Renfield making the trip to Castle Dracula. Bela Lugosi never lets the picture down, his slow, unusual enunciation making more of his lines than what is on the written page, his eyes and hand movements able to fully convey the vampire's unholy powers. Issued on February 12, 1931, it became Universal's biggest hit of the year, a $700,000 profit despite the studio's uncertainty in presentation: ""the story of the strangest passion the world has ever known!"" A new audience hungering for more horror found Junior looking for another hot property, intending to use Lugosi as the heir apparent to Lon Chaney as Hollywood's champion of the macabre.",Dracula
33,neil-476,Dated,6,22 November 2012,"If I had been in the audience in 1931, I would have awarded Tod Browning's Dracula, with Bela Lugosi making cinema history by reprising his stage version of the Count, a good nine out of ten - maybe nine and a half. Lugosi does a good cross between suave and creepy, and the story has always been an effective one.But this early sound movie betrays its stage origins and studio staging constantly (and far more so than FW Murnau's silent 1922 Nosferatu). This is a talky adaptation (meaning lots of talking as opposed to an early sound film), with a camera which is almost completely static - it might as well be stuck in the stalls filming the proscenium. Lugosi's performance now comes across as rather hammy, most of the cast are unmemorable (with the single exception of Dwight Frye's splendid Renfield), and Edward Van Sloan's Van Helsing doesn't inspire. There are no special effects to speak of, and even the spotlights intended to make Dracula's eyes look as if they are glowing sometimes miss.There have been better versions since. Value this film for its place in history, and for its impact at the time, and then watch a more modern version.",Dracula
34,evanston_dad,Classic Horror Movie Sorely Disappoints,5,20 October 2006,"I knew Universal Studios excelled at low-budget horror in the 1930s, but I didn't realize just how low budget this movie would be.Tod Browning's ""Dracula"" looks and moves like an Ed Wood movie; you can practically see the crewmen hiding just outside of the frame, holding the strings of the fake bats that come flapping up and down and blowing fake fog on to the screen with a fan. This movie only has one or two creepy scenes; I was sorely disappointed with the rest. Bela Lugosi is effective as the famous Count, but everyone else is terrible, the pacing is sluggish, and the movie just ends, as if the director ran out of film. Did Monty Python direct this? I expected much more from Tod Browning, who did such compelling work, and on no bigger a budget, with ""Freaks"" a year later.Grade: C",Dracula
35,AlsExGal,Based on the Broadway play rather than the novel...,7,4 November 2021,"... and that explains all of the differences, such as Renfield being the person to visit Dracula in Transylvania to seal a real estate deal rather than Jonathan Harker.I imagine this was quite the spectacle in 1931. Visually it still is - sweeping staircases, ruined old castles covered in dust, moonlight illuminating giant spiderwebs, coffins with limbs hanging out of them, rats scurrying about. And Bela Lugosi, who starred in the Broadway play, was dying to play the lead. But director Tod Browning was set on Lon Chaney, a frequent collaborator, playing both Dracula and Van Helsiing.It's not true that everybody is replaceable, but it IS true that eventually an irreplaceable person will no longer be around and a perhaps less than ideal work-around must be found. This was the situation with Chaney - a unique actor who could convince you he was anybody. He died before Dracula was filmed. Lugosi successfully lobbied for the part, although he did so at a cut rate. Today his old world hypnotic presence is synonymous with the role.But I have to admit I have an unpopular opinion. To me Dracula seems very slow and very much ""early talkie"" in personality when compared to the film Frankenstein of just a year later. Also, like many early talking films that were not musicals, there is no score.And I have to wonder about director Tod Browning. Although this was Browning's biggest hit, his other enduring works all starred Lon Chaney. He only directed a few more films and disappeared from the industry for a quarter of a century until his death. He had a disappearing act worthy of Universal Horror.Things to watch for - Armadillos in Transylvania? Probably far too cold for them there. David Manners and Helen Chandler as young lovers Jonathan Harker and Mina - They have all of the chemistry of two cardboard boxes. Why did they keep pairing these two in films? Dwight Frye as Renfield - did Frye EVER get to play a normal person? And why would he want to be sent away? He gets to wander in and out of the lush living quarters of the superintendent f the mental facility. He wouldn't get that freedom anywhere else. And last but not least, Carla Laemmle, unrecognizable as a tourist, reading from a Transylvania tour guide.",Dracula
36,Uriah43,Simply Superb,10,19 October 2012,"For the modern viewer to fully appreciate a classic film like ""Dracula"" they probably need to understand the evolution in horror movies from the 1930's to today. As ""horrorfilmhistory.com"" explains, this was the ""very first talking horror film"". Because of this, nobody at the time of production really knew how the audience would react to it. However, once they realized how successful it was, other movies (featuring various monsters and mad scientists) emerged to meet the demand. So it was this film, more than any other, that created the horror genre we enjoy today. That's quite an accomplishment in and of itself. And while it's true that the special effects were rather primitive in comparison to today's technology, it had some good features which tended to compensate. For example, I found the background scenery of the Carpathian Mountains and the way Dracula's eyes were illuminated to be quite impressive. As far as the acting is concerned, I thought Bela Lugosi was simply superb as ""Count Dracula"". Likewise, Edward Van Sloan (""Van Helsing"") and Dwight Frye (""Renfield"") also perform their roles in an excellent manner. Additionally, Helen Chandler (""Mina"") was quite attractive even if her acting was only adequate. Anyway, while it might seem ""mild"" by today's standards, if a person has never seen it I think they might be pleasantly surprised if they just give it a chance. Especially on a dark night with the lights turned off.",Dracula

38,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Classic film but a little overrated,7,27 October 2015,"After his arrival in London, a group of friends finds the series of accidents to their group are the result of the mysterious stranger from Transylvania feeding on them and try to save their corrupted associated under his spell.This one wasn't too bad but did have a few big flaws to it. This one manages to really get enjoyable with the grand opening here, making great use of the film's Gothic leanings here in a spectacular scene that's quite chilling. The night-time carriage ride is good enough with the mysterious driver and creepy ride, but the real fun here comes from the closed-off scenes found in the crypt of the castle where the four of them come out of their coffins in their graves in absolutely fun scenes that are quite creepy and chilling as the setting adds to the eeriness. Going right into the first meeting, where the absolutely grand Gothic castle that's littered with spider-webs that provide the source of a great visual gag and sets up the fantastic dinner scene and eventual corruption scene that's really fun. This also scores some fine points here in the build-up to his true revelation, getting the fine amount of bedroom stalking and reactions fully showing his intentions from the very beginning that makes for a decent mystery here. Otherwise, there's a lot more flaws here that really lower this one down away from these positives. The biggest issue here is the rather bland, boring pace, which indeed comes from the origins of the film but instead comes off as stiff, dodgy and way too talkative than it really needed to be. There's so little action here due to this rather irritated manner of talking or speaking out everything here rather than showing it as we don't even get the neck-bites or any true signs of vampirism on-screen other than what's told to us. In fact, so little of what happens here is told rather than shown this one could almost be seen as a romantic drama rather than a full-on horror effort, and it's really only the fact that he's a vampire which really causes this one to be reminded of a horror film. The only other issue holding this one back is the fact that all this talking means Van Helsing has to continuously explain things to everyone involved for her protection rather than simply explaining everything at the beginning, especially since he knows not only the means of dealing with a vampire but also where he's hiding out. After he suspects this, it's several days of trying to keep her in check arguing, and his location for the hiding spot isn't a secret so it would've been easier to go into action rather than stay back and talk everything out. These here lower this one quite significantly.Today's Rating/PG: Mild Violence.",Dracula
39,AaronCapenBanner,Bela Lugosi,6,22 October 2013,"Tod Browning directed Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula to major stardom in this loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel.

Only professor Van Helsing(played by Edward Van Sloan) can stop his reign of terror. Lugosi is the whole show here, delivering an indelible performance, though the film itself(despite a promising opening) becomes remarkably slow and talky. Still, Bela and Dwight Frye make the difference here, and film just about succeeds, but with major reservations.",Dracula

41,The_Void,"Classic horror film, based on a classic book and lead by a classic career-best performance",8,5 April 2006,"It is fitting that the first American horror film to feature spoken word was based on what is possibly the most famous, and most important horror novel of all time; Bram Stoker's Dracula! The story, of course, is great; and when combined with Tod Browning's directorial vision, and a career best performance from the great Bela Lugosi, it's hardly surprising that the 1931 version of Dracula is the most enduring version of the classic tale of all time. This is the film that, along with James Whale's Frankenstein of the same year, ensured that Universal studios would always be remembered as one of the major forces in horror cinema, and deservedly so. The classic story starts off with a man named Renfield travelling to Transylvania to finalise the sale of Carfax Abbey to the mysterious Count Dracula. It's not long before Renfield is going insane and looking after Dracula on his sea journey to England. In England, Dracula becomes obsessed with the beautiful Mina, and after sucking her blood, her father calls in the scientist Van Helsing, who discovers the cause of Mina's problem...Even though he only played the role once on screen (not including a role in the comedy Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein), Bela Lugosi managed to get his name forever associated with the character. His Eastern European accent and melodramatic persona ensure that nobody has ever delivered a more memorable performance as the great vampire, and many believe that there has never been a better Dracula than Bela Lugosi (although I've got to admit that I prefer watching Christopher Lee in the role). Tod Browning's direction is assured and perhaps the most striking thing about it is the lack of a score. Browning's lack of music ensures that the film has a slow pace, but this also makes it very eerie; with the only sounds present being the actor's voices and the creatures of the night. When combined with the thick Gothic atmosphere, we have an environment that is perfect for this sort of Gothic horror story. The story of Dracula is incredibly famous, and I wager that there's barely anyone on the planet who doesn't at least know the basics of it. This does harm the film a little, because it means that you always know what's going to happen - but it's a small criticism of an absolute classic horror film. There are some films every horror fan must see, and this is one of them.",Dracula
42,StevePulaski,A classic horror film reduced to a competent genre-piece,8,25 October 2013,"The horror genre didn't begin with Tod Browning's Dracula, but it was greatly revolutionized by its incarnation. Horror had existed as a largely expressionistic medium in countries like Germany for much of the early 1900s, but when Universal Pictures decide to put its hand in the monster-movie pot, horror would never be the same again.1931 saw the beginning of the Great Depression and movie studios began hurting. Dracula's financial performance led to the lengthier viability of Universal Pictures' studio and jump-started several other horror films known as the ""Universal class monster movies."" With that being said, it also placed Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi on the map in addition to furthering the career of filmmaker Tod Browning.Dracula is more than a curious piece of history in the regard that its atmosphere and acting still hold up today, but I think the appeal for viewers will be greatly diminished if they have seen the classic vampire picture Nosferatu from 1922. That film relied more on the sheer ugliness and daunting presence of the monster - with much material taken from the Bram Stoker novel. Dracula, on the contrary, uses the Broadway play as its source, retracting the ugly traits of Dracula to make him dashing rather than daunting. Suave rather than scary. And somewhat attractive rather than a vile monster.Such decisions were completely creative on part of writer Garrett Fort and director Tod Browning (and the uncredited Karl Freund). I can admire and respect their visions but I can't bring myself to prefer it to the 1922 classic. With Nosferatu being the first ""Dracula"" film (not counting the lost films of Russia from 1920 or the other lost film from Hungary called Dracula's Death), it's fair to say that a standard was unintentionally set. And having seen that masterpiece, seeing Dracula was a pleasant but ultimately a somewhat unrewarding experience.The film revolves around the titular count who arrives in Transylvania on business. The residents fear the count and his ominous castle, and fear only continues to brew when he attempts to start a relationship with young Mina (Helen Chandler), the daughter of Dr. Seward (Herbert Bunston) who runs the nearby mental hospital.Is it necessary to go further since the story is so classic? Moreover, Lugosi is brilliant here, with his elegant portrayal of a monster formerly seen as brooding and homely. Subtle movements Lugosi makes in the film feel like bold statements and whenever he speaks, the presence of a shivering echo always exists. Lugosi in addition to Karl Freund's beautiful cinematography that guides us through Dracula's spacious concubine with exceptional clarity and placement.The look of the film - thanks to the professional touch of Freund in this particular film - is what Universal began to rely on with each of their monster films, which will probably get to be a redundant, overused statement as I visit many of these films within the next few days. Browning's Dracula, as a whole, works as competent entertainment, but pails in comparison to its silent film predecessor that proves to be scary even as it approaches its one-hundredth year anniversary. Dracula's effectiveness has been demoted to that of a basic mood-setter, if anything.Starring: Bela Lugosi, Helen Chandler, and Herbert Bunston. Directed by: Tod Browning.",Dracula
43,Smells_Like_Cheese,Bela is king! Great Universal classic!,9,10 January 2004,"Thinking back to 1931, it's hard to imagine what going to the movie theater was like for people. It was something new and exciting; instead of having 6 movies open in one weekend, they were lucky if 6 movies opened in one month. Horror movies were nothing new in 1931, but one's with sound were and Universal Studios cranked out hit after hit after hit, one of the first being was Dracula. Not too many people realize that these films created exactly what we think of the typecast today with the most popular monsters. Dracula, if you've read the book, is nothing like what Bela created: the cape, the accent, the charm, the presence, the looks, etc. This was the first time we ever had a romantic Dracula, the silent film released before called Nosferatu was a monster, Bela created a Dracula that could charm you one second and the next he's draining the life out of you. Dracula is one of the most memorable movies of all time and it's not hard to see why when you watch it.Renfield, a British solicitor, travels to the Carpathian Mountains. He enters a castle welcomed by charming but odd nobleman Count Dracula, who unbeknownst to Renfield, is a vampire. They discuss Dracula's intention to lease Carfax Abbey in London, where he intends to travel the next day. Dracula's three wives suddenly appear and start to move toward Renfield to attack him, but Dracula waves them away, and he attacks Renfield himself. Aboard the Vesta, bound for England, Renfield has now become a raving lunatic slave to Dracula, who is hidden in a coffin and gets out for feeding on the ship's crew. Some nights later at a London theater, Dracula meets Dr. Seward, who introduces his daughter Mina, her fiancé John Harker, and the family friend Lucy Weston. Lucy is fascinated by Count Dracula, and that night, after Lucy has a talk with Mina and falls asleep in bed, Dracula enters her room as a bat and feasts on her blood. She dies in an autopsy theater the next day after a string of transfusions, and two tiny marks on her throat are discovered. Later on Mina has the same bite marks and now the men call on Professor Van Helsing to take on Dracula and save Mina before she meets the same fate as Lucy.Despite the fact that it might not be as terrifying as it was back in the day, you have to consider that this movie made people faint in the theater and gave them nightmares for years to come. The film does have flaws, Lucy dies and that's it, she never comes back which was interesting that Mina was becoming a vampire when bitten, but Lucy doesn't. However, the atmosphere of the film still holds up incredibly well, Dracula's castle has the perfect shadows and isolation that could send shivers down anyone's spine. Makes you wonder how the heck Renfield could stay in that place? I would've camped outside, especially when Dracula comes down and says in that creepy voice ""I bid you welcome""; would you trust someone like that while looking at your neck like it was a Thanksgiving turkey leg? Bela gave a terrific performance that will be remembered for all time. But also much credit to Dwight Frye who plays Renfield and still has one of the most horrific images of all time when they open the door on the ship to see him laughing manically with his eyes wide open. Not to mention his scene with the maid where he's laughing at her, she faints and he crawls towards her. You know what? I lied; this is still a scary movie and I will continue to watch it every Halloween. Bela is king and made Dracula one of the most terrifying monsters in movie history.9/10",Dracula

This picture helped start ""Universal's"" run of horror monster pictures, and it would help shape ""Dracula"" as an iconic figure and lasting cultural part of cinema history. Bela Lugosi was in top form and straight and direct with a memorable look and voice that made the character a legend. The story is pretty simple as ""Count Dracula"" himself travels to London and searches by night for new victims by blood sucking! The camera work is in top form with long and close up looks to give the film more meaning and probably with more viewings one could get more out of the film still for a 1931 take the film does well for it's own pace and suspense and drama like feel as it's still the king and grandfather of the vampire genre.",Dracula

Universal wanted a big budget film, but because of the depression, this one was made on the cheap. The studio head wanted Lon Chaney Sr for the title role. He was not available and almost by accident they found Bela Legosi.Todd Browning did a great job directing the first horror film. Todd could not have liked the fact that at night, the crew shooting the Spanish Version would look at Brownings daily shot and then re-shoot improved versions of their own with their cast.Still, the Spanish version did not have Bela. The rest of the cast around him played the roles real well. The real irony here is that Bela would only do the role one more time, making fun of himself in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein. Legosi is one of the few actors who has the best dramatic performance and the best comedy performance on film for the same role.This original holds up well, including the creepy arrival of the ship of corpses in England. The estate rented by Dracula in England is now actually the same name as a famous web site. Another accident related to this film. Sometimes fate creates a work of art where none is expected.

The first half, in which Jonathan Harker travels to Transylvania to meet the infamous Count, is great. There's loads of atmosphere and elaborate gothic imagery, with Bela Lugosi never better as the nefarious title character. But once events relocate to London, there is no doubt that things do take a turn to the stagey, with too much horror implied rather than shown. Nevertheless, despite all that, this one still retains the benefit of being made in its era, where expressionistic lighting was the order of the day and the primitive sound quality almost has a dreamlike vibe to today's ears too. So, while this is wildly uneven, its worth seeing. I would also recommend watching it with the modern reinterpreted soundtrack by the Kronos Quartet.",Dracula

48,OllieSuave-007,A low-key horror classic.,7,19 October 2015,"This is what I believe the original film version of Bram Stoker's classic novel about the blood-sucking vampire count. It was a fast-paced, to-the-point movie with an eerie atmosphere and a solemn-acting cast of characters.Bela Lugosi gave a very creepy and sinister portrayal of Count Dracula; his stern look and wide, bewitching eyes were enough to frighten a room of spectators. He was indeed the highlight of the movie, but much of the plot suffers from a lack of action, emotion and thrills. The more thrilling scenes like the vampire bite sequences were all off-screen. And, the absence of a musical score made the movie a little on the dull side.However, being a movie that was made in the 1930s and is the first motion picture featuring Dracula, it is still a classic and the actors were truly talented in their own way. It paved the way for many more horror classics to come.Grade B-",Dracula
49,sddavis63,"If You Haven't Seen This, You Haven't Seen Dracula",8,26 March 2008,"This movie might as well be called ""Bela Lugosi."" Count Dracula was the part of a lifetime for Lugosi  one that both made him a star and destroyed his acting career. He ended up being helplessly and hopelessly typecast as a result of the absolutely brilliant performance he offered as the vampire count. The voice, the eyes, the presence  all Lugosi, all Dracula. From 1931 on, whenever anyone sees or hears Bela Lugosi (no matter what part he's playing) they see or hear Dracula, and  even now, over 75 years later  when someone does an imitation of Dracula, it's done in Lugosi's Hungarian accent. The typecasting is a shame, really  because Lugosi was a superb actor. I've seen him in several films and even in the later work of his career, when many of the movies he was in were less than stellar, Lugosi  when given a meaty enough role as opposed to a cameo  could make even a weak movie worth watching. And it basically all started with Dracula.The movie itself has some problems  foremost among them, because of the importance they play in the story  are the bat appearances. Bats don't fly like that, and they certainly can't hover! The ending struck me as rather abrupt, and I found myself thinking that there should have been more, and throughout the movie there are still examples of the transition in acting style required by the transition to ""talkies""  especially what I consider to be deliberate over-acting, necessary in silent movies but sometimes distracting in ""talkies."" Having said that, Lugosi even pulls that off well. His overly dramatic turning away from the wolfbane or cross and cowering behind his cape is in fact overly dramatic, and yet  it's also Dracula. That's just what Dracula does when confronted by wolfbane or a cross, because it's how Lugosi played the part, and coming from Lugosi it seems perfectly natural.The movie isn't especially frightening or suspenseful. Even for someone who had never seen it in 1931, real suspense is lacking. We find out very quickly that Count Dracula is a vampire  just a few minutes in Lugosi pops out of a coffin. The sets are very good though  creating a sense of mystery and fear, even if there's nothing overly frightening about this. Whatever the strengths or weaknesses of the story, though, the movie is made by the performances  Lugosi's obviously, but also Dwight Frye as his hapless victim Renfield, who becomes enamoured of eating flies and spiders and rats as a result of being turned into Dracula's slave. His performance is actually quite funny, and one thing lacking in the movie is any explanation of what happened to Renfield. After Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) ""dispatches"" Dracula does Renfield return to normal, as Mina (Helen Chandler) did, or does he spend the rest of his life in an insane asylum? That was a loose end that wasn't tied up.I've never read Bram Stoker's original novel, so can't comment on how this movie relates to Stoker's work, but I have seen many film versions of Dracula, and this is by far the classic version. Many other actors have played the evil count, but none have pulled it off as perfectly as Bela Lugosi. 8/10.",Dracula

51,bensonmum2,"""This is very old wine. I hope you like it.""",5,13 July 2021,"Is there any reason to do a plot summary for Dracula? Any person with even a passing interest in horror or classic films is aware of the basic story. So instead, I'll start this by saying I understand and fully appreciate Dracula's place in film history. Whether it's the creepy castle, the sense of dread and death in the film's atmosphere, or Lugosi's most iconic role, Dracula is a special film and definitely worth seeing.Having said all that, Dracula has never been a particular favorite of mine. I find much of the film terribly stage-bound, complete with an overly exaggerated and dramatic acting style that doesn't appeal to me. Director Tod Browning's ""plant and shoot"" method of filmmaking doesn't help matters. Things are horribly stagnant. And much of the film moves at a snail's pace. Please note - I realize that most of my complaints are based on the film's age and the technology and filming techniques used at the time. Still, I can't help it if I don't find it as entertaining as other movies from the period (see Frankenstein, M, or even the Spanish language Dracula for examples of films from 1931 that I enjoy). It may be blasphemous to some, but to me, Dracula is one of the best (or worst) examples of a dated film I can think of. As for the Dracula character, I much prefer the noirish sequel Son of Dracula (1943) or Hammer's Horror of Dracula (1958) with the decidedly more animated Christopher Lee in the title role.As I've said a number of times, entertainment is the primary driver behind my ratings. Based on all of the issues I have with Dracula, I can't in all honesty rate it higher than a very average 5/10.5/10.",Dracula
52,ElMaruecan82,Listen to Bela. What Music He Makes...,9,29 March 2018,"What a great year to go to the movie! Indeed, everyone elevates 1939 as the golden year of Golden Age Hollywood but what a glorious start the film industry had with the talkies. In 1931, you had the birth of two Warner Bros gangster icons Jimmy Cagney and Edward G. Robinson that people went to see, see? Silent movies resisted with a final masterpiece from Charlie Chaplin. French cinema saw the birth of Jean Renoir's talent and Marcel Pagnol's Marseilles trilogy brought the first French icon: Raimu, a man with an accent, but the greatest legacy would be owed to Universal and their ""monster"" creatures. I grew up drawing Dracula, Frankenstein and Mummies ignoring that they were all pretty much born the same year... not the myths, but their iconic perception.1931 was a milestone on the field of horror movies, think about it, ""Frankenstein"" and the iconic ""It's alive!"" moment, the Fredric March version of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", that earned the actor one of the first Oscar nomination for playing split personalities. And of course, there's Count Dracula, played by Bela Lugosi, the egomaniac Hungarian who earned Martin Landau an Oscar for his unforgettable performance in ""Ed Wood"". And, If the film doesn't really revolutionize the horror gothic genre because one should give F.W. Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" the credit he deserves, it was still a game-changer in the way It portrayed the iconic villain, I mentioned Robinson, Cagney, Raimu, guess what they all had in common? An accent. And it's all the more fitting that another iconic character would have one, too.One digression about Murnau though, I read that Todd Browning was so distraught by the tragic untimely loss of the director that he didn't put all his heart in ""Dracula"" and left cinematographer Karl Freund lead the show. I don't know if it did really affect the movie but I noticed that as far as directing goes, the film has the right atmosphere but nothing new since ""Nosferatu"" and the best parts seem rather stagey, it isn't surprising since it was based from a play loosely based from Bram Stroker's ""Dracula"". That's just to say, as much as there's no ace card in the directing, there's no particular flaw either. I guess Browning's directing was more tangible in his 1932's classic ""Freaks"" but for ""Dracula"", the key is Bela Lugosi. His performance makes the film.Indeed, it's almost the performance of Lugosi that provides all the eerie atmosphere the film needed, so was Nosferatu but in 1922, his 'presence' was enough, in 1931, the audience was thriving for a performance as well as a presence. And there's something in this Dracula that satisfies whatever needs the talkies created, the villain talks and the way he talks says something about the threats he incarnates. On that level, his speech mannerism is as crucial as Robison or Cagney's street smart slang, his accent and tendency to speak slowly, leaving a bit of suspense between crucial words, this Dracula is even more menacing than a monster because he can catch us off guard.""For one who didn't live a single lifetime... you're a wise man. Van Helsing""
""I never drink.... Wine. ""All the dots mark a long pause, and each pause is enriched by a rich palette of smiles and death glares. These are lines as classic as the ""children of the night"" but they belong to posterity because they're spoken in a context where suavity and vileness weren't as obvious as they are today. There is something suggested even in Lugosi's appearance, the way he stares, the way he walks, indicating an inner nobility and sophistication, notice how the well-spoken Renfield (Dwight Frye) becomes totally devoted to his master, as if he was drawn to him, to his aura. Even the murders look like a sort of emotional fusion, an erotic trance. We just believe such a power can exist because it works on a cinematic level, almost romantic.It's also interesting that the film uses ordinary, if not uncharismatic, actors (except for Edward Von Sloan who also starred in ""Frankenstein"") to be the match to Dracula, no cockiness or arrogance, Dracula is dealt with as real people would do and it's a real departure from the usual theatricality, apart from Dwight Frye who tends to overact a little, almost undermining the film's seriousness. Still, there's a lot of talking and even in Dracula's absence you can feel his presence, even the anticlimactic defeat leaves you doubt about his fate because you can't believe a monster like this could let himself be defeated. We don't root for the villain in the sense that we wish him to survive but he's so grand, so noble and so cinematically appealing that we sort of ""side with him"".Five decades before Hans Gruber, Lugosi invented the charismatic and sophisticated villain with an accent, and what an accent! The same year, Peter Lorre was another seminal ""foreign"" villain in ""M"" but his sordid gargoyle-like look and his crimes couldn't make him appealing, pathetic at best. I said in my review of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", the original, that Lorre was like a precursor of Gruber, but maybe he was inspired by Lugosi's performance in ""Dracula"".Dracula has a sort of divine aura accentuating his scariness. This is a villain that means business and if the film doesn't scare much, there's the performance. I said that ""Nosferatu"" was a presence, but this Dracula is a performance... and a presence as well.",Dracula
53,gbill-74877,Unfortunately doesn't hold up,5,29 November 2017,"One of the problems modern viewers will have with Tod Browning's 1931 'Dracula' (ok, at least this modern viewer), unfair as it may be, is that countless versions of the vampire tale have been told over the decades, so quite a bit of the shock value is lost. This version is told in a 'right down central' type of way, and unlike some of Browning's other seriously creepy movies from this time period which I love, it's hard to imagine anyone being scared or feeling tension which watching it. Browning tries to give us the tinglies with various things like bugs crawling about in the beginning, but too many of his effects seem like comical parodies, such as a rubber bat dangled in the window more than once. Unfortunately, I would also put legendary actor Bela Lugosi's performance in this category. His demeanor and slow cadence with words doesn't produce the intended chills, and he's not helped by Browning's tight shots on him staring into the camera. We can recognize this film as the adaptation of the Bram Stoker novel that influenced so many which would follow and give it credit for that, but it's not such a great movie to pull others together for at, say, Halloween time. You can do better for horror/scary/creepy even in the time period.",Dracula
54,Cineanalyst,Monstrous Beginnings,8,28 November 2017,"The first Hollywood, first talkie and first authorized film adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel, ""Dracula"" is one of the most influential motion pictures ever. Not only did it further popularize its titular character--and an especially iconic version of him as portrayed by Bela Lugosi--as well as vampires in general and the lore surrounding them, it also launched supernatural horror as a regular genre in Hollywood. ""Dracula"" led to a series of Universal monster movies, which kept the studio afloat during the Great Depression, and persuaded other companies to make their own shockers. Consequently, the 1930s especially are considered a golden age for horror.1931 alone featured adaptations of three of the most renowned English-language Gothic horror novels of the 19th Century; Universal followed up Stoker's ""Dracula"" with Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein,"" and Paramount produced Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."" In comparison to those two, ""Dracula"" has a few handicaps. All three novels used the epistolary form--multiple narrators from various documents, such as diaries, letters and newspapers. But, Stoker's book is the most weighed down by its complete reliance on such narration, which is also partly why it's longer than the other two. Unlike the other two adaptations, ""Dracula"" was also preceded by and has since been compared to a much-acclaimed adaptation of the same novel: F.W. Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" (1922). Another handicap is that filmmakers in general learned a lot about making synchronized- sound films in the few months between the production of ""Dracula"" and of ""Frankenstein"" and ""Jekyll and Hyde."" All three stories had also been made into popular plays, but the filmed ""Dracula"" suffers the most from the staginess common of early talkies.Consequently, a novel that featured extensive geographic crisscrossing is largely reduced to inside scenes, many of which are within the small area of Seward's Sanitarium and Dracula's Carfax Abbey next door. These scenes can be plodding, including the near 3-minutes single-shot talkfest around the 50-minutes mark. Cinematographer Karl Freund's mobile camera isn't enough to entirely relieve the cramped theatrics of these sound stages, which would've been better served by more scene dissection, including the shot-reverse-shot technique. Other parts flow well, however, including the Transylvania scenes, which include decent matte painting for glass shots and sets for the Count's castle. The scenes of Dracula prowling the streets of London work well, too, in portraying the menace of a vampire who seamlessly blends into Western society, including attending the theatre. There are many pans, tilts, dolly and crane shots scattered throughout; the first shot of Lugosi as Dracula and the establishing shot of Seward's Sanitarium are especially dynamic.Wisely, the filmed ""Dracula"" significantly condenses Stoker's novel. Some of the characters entirely bite the dust and others are turned into conglomerations. The three suitors of Lucy are gone, although Seward is reassigned to a minor role, including now being Mina's father. It mostly gets rid of the blood transfusion business. The book's suggestive themes of vampirism as sex and venereal disease are consequently toned down, but that was probably also the intent of a studio that had to contest with censors. It's a bit surprising, then, that it retained the three female vampires, especially considering their role is almost sexless here, and their being isn't really explained in either media.I'm less fond of some of the other alterations. The expansion of Renfield's character is at the expense of a diminished role for Harker. The film provides a reason for Renfield's insanity, but largely removes the doubles theme of Dracula replacing Harker. Nevertheless, the overall themes of xenophobia and Christian duality remain. Most unfortunately, Mina's role is reduced entirely to damsel in distress. The novel, while superficially antagonistic of the so-called ""new woman,"" in the end, had Mina emerge as the gang's leader. The film, however, is more regressive and simply reduces everything to a battle of wills between two men, Dracula and Van Helsing.What sets this filmed ""Dracula"" above (at least in part) and apart from the novel and other adaptations is Lugosi's performance. I can't even see other screen translations, let alone read the book, without picturing Lugosi's Dracula in the back of my mind. He's part of our cultural iconography now. He combined moments of eerie, unblinking posturing with sudden theatrical outbursts and wonderfully-inflected line delivery through a thick Hungarian accent. His are the definitive readings of Stoker's dialogue (e.g. ""I bid you welcome"" and the ""children of the night"" line) and the original quip (since frequently adopted by subsequent productions), ""I never drink... wine."" Whereas Stoker's Dracula was grotesque, Lugosi's is even more menacing because he's suave enough to fit in with the West. Yes, he liked his blood with a side of ham, but that's really what the role demanded. It adds a level of campiness entirely lacking from Stoker's moralistic tale. Bela was probably the best actor in the business at realizing such added appeal of monster movies, including in other Universal classics such as ""The Black Cat,"" ""The Raven"" and ""Son of Frankenstein."" James Whale (""Frankenstein,"" ""The Old Dark House,"" ""The Invisible Man"" and ""Bride of Frankenstein"") was probably the best director in the same line. Too bad they didn't make a movie together. Lugosi's performance is also enhanced by the masked highlighting of his eyes, the creaky creepiness of pauses in the film's pacing and its original lack of a score. While some of the other actors are just bad, Dwight Frye as Renfield also gets the tone right, as does Charles Gerrard in an otherwise unnecessary comic-relief role as an asylum guard.Next, see the Spanish-language version of ""Dracula"" (1931). There are some interesting differences between the two films, for better and worse.(Mirror Note: Mirrors are important in ""Dracula,"" of course. The mirror shot of Mina and Lucy is done better in the Spanish film, but Dracula's non-reflection in a cigarette-box mirror is slightly better here.)",Dracula

56,Irishchatter,Alright first Dracula film but the soundtrack was amazing!,8,24 September 2015,"So today in 2015, I have watched a 1931 film which was meant to be the first time that Dracula ever came to cinema. I thought Bela Lugosi was absolutely brilliant with his persona and role as the count Dracula. I loved whenever we are concentrating on his eyes like regardless if it was black or white. He must've enjoyed doing this role since it was only 10 or 20 years that it was the 19th century.I thought Dwight Frye playing as Reinfield was funny like normally Reinfield these days is very serious and clever. It seems like this is the only movie that Reinfield has gone bananas and added so energy to a old horror film. He really acts like Igor then himself to be honest with you.It was too bad that the costumes back then weren't great for the movie or not much Dracula/Mina scene's since he died already in his coffin. However the music didn't put me off, it was the best orchestral music I've heard in a long time actually!",Dracula
57,CuriosityKilledShawn,Interesting though rather unvivid and tame,6,9 February 2005,"Dracula opens very well with lavish sets and a genuine spooky atmosphere as a young lawyer named Reinfield visits the Count's Transylvanian castle to settle some business. But after this, when the story takes us to London, it seems more disjointed and vague.I don't understand what has supposed to have happened to Reinfield, why did he go mad? If Dracula bit him then why didn't he die or become a vampire? And the story is a bit confusing. Did Dracula plan on killing certain women when he came to London or did he just go with the flow? Why did he come to London in the first place? It's never really clarified. Which is a bit odd considering all of the expositional dialogue featured in the movie.Though it sounds incredibly unpurist, I did enjoy this film much more with Philip Glass's new score. The chewed up Swan Lake music at the start just got on my nerves and I feel Glass's music gave the whole film a new sense of consistency and tied it together a little tighter. I would have liked it more if it showed us the gore and killing rather than simply implying it. I know it was the '30s but they still could have made an effort. I see nothing that would shock even a naive '30s audience.And surely I am not the only one who thinks that Dracula looks a uncannily like Steven Seagal.",Dracula

61,tomgillespie2002,The definitive Dracula,9,30 April 2011,"One of the most iconic and popular characters in film history, Dracula has taken many forms, in many genres, and performed to various quality. Although not the first film to feature the character of Count Dracula (a couple of lost silent films and F.W. Murnau's unauthorised version Nosferatu came before), Bela Lugosi's portrayal of the menacing and seductive Count is commonly seen as the definitive.The story is known to most – solicitor Renfield (Dwight Frye) arrives at Count Dracula castle at night, despite prior warnings by the nearby locals. He is greeted by Dracula, who, unknown to Renfield, is a vampire. Upon arrival, he pricks his finger, causing it to bleed which visibly excites Dracula until he spies the crucifix hanging around Renfield's neck. Renfield is drugged by Dracula and the two travel to London the next day by boat. When the ship arrives, only Renfield remains on the boat, now seemingly a lunatic and a slave to the Count. He is hospitalised while Dracula becomes entranced by a woman named Mina (Helen Chandler), who is engaged to John Harker (David Manners). As circumstances grow stranger, Professor Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) becomes convinced that the Count is indeed a vampire, and that he must be destroyed.The film would be the beginning of a long run of successful horror movies made by Universal, which would be hits critically and commercially, and many are nowadays considered classics of the genre. Although falling short of the outright perfection of James Whale's Frankenstein (also 1931) and its sequel Bride Of Frankenstein (1935), Dracula still proves a great adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel. Lugosi's performance is the definitive Dracula, his minimal movements and slow, pronounced dialogue, spoken with his Hungarian accent proves an unnerving Count. I'm not forgetting Max Schrek's Nosferatu, while amazing for its sheer dedication, it was hardly the Dracula of the book.Director Tod Browning, who up to the point of making Dracula had made over 50 feature films, controls the film superbly, and opts for slow, menacing darkness rather than loud jump scenes and special effects. It builds up the mood gradually, and with Lugosi's fantastic central performance, makes for an atmospheric experience. It's a pity that Browning would almost end his career the next year with the commercially disastrous Freaks, which I consider a true great of the horror genre.It's just a shame that the film's final scene is rather soft and anti- climatic, jarring with the brilliance that came before. However, it remains an excellent film overall, and the film that would spawn many memorable films for Universal studious.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Dracula

63,redryan64,The Saga of Bringing the Screen the Story of the World's Biggest Blood Sucker (other than the I.R.S.),10,23 September 2007,"The debate over which films are better, the old or the new will doubtless rage on, perhaps forever. Apologists for either extreme position can express,debate and rehash their cases. We can all listen, but this is the sort of ""feeling"" for particular type of film and the Particular Era that gave rise to them. For the most part any ""debate"" winds up to being a case of ""preaching to the Choir"", with like minds proving to be both ""The Preacher"" and ""The Preachee"" at any gathering or forum of ideas.In our own case, we prefer the ""Old School"" horror film. We enjoy the Black & White Photography, both in the 'Movin' Pichers' as well as in the Movie Stills. The varying tones of grays, whites, silvers and blacks make for the perfect visual accompaniment and underscore to the moods to be conveyed. Also the compatibility of B & W with any sort of Archival Program has made it the favourite choice medium for news files. Black & White cinematography sends subtle, sub-conscious messages which adds a certain perception of being authentic.As for Sound vs. the Silents, we'll leave that debate for another day. Suffice it is to say that the Silent Screen provided us with so much really great and frightening films. We had so many of the German Films, John Barrymore as DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE and so many unique and eerie Characterizations of one Lon Chaney* as examples.As for Dracula (Universal,1931), we have been familiar with this cinematic version of the Brom Stoker tale, ever since 1957. It was in that year that Universal Pictures released its ""SHOCK THEATRE"" package of their Horror Masterpiece(and 'Boobie Prize')Films. This was the moving factor in creating a new Local TV Station Position, that of the 'Late Night Horror Movie Host Personality' This was period of having people made into overnight successes as being the Host/M.C. of the ""SHOCK THEATRE"" films. The most famous being John Zacherle as ""Roland"" who started at WCAU, Philadelphia before moving on to WABC TV, New York. Virtually every market had its own Magnetic Conduit Character/Host, acting like a Lightining Rod in drawing the viewers to their telecasts.In our own local Chicago ""SHOCK THEATRE"" as seen over Local ABC TV Affiliate, WBKB TV(now known by the call letters of WLS TV). Our show was hosted by a bespectacled, dark suited, flat topped character called ""Marvin"". In real life he was one Terry Bennett, a talented Ventriloquist and Comedian.So, we had the old sound films, and in this case, the older the better. And none 'older' nor more frightening than Bela Lugosi as Dracula. The sets, the Transylvannia scenes, the Castle Dracula, and the long periods of silence on the sound track all help to add up to a hauntingly eerie screen presentation. And in Dracula's case, the quiet times added to say, the three Vampire brides of the Good Transylvanian Count, only prolong the horrors and tend to personalize them.Among the fine supporting players who helped make this the classic that it is and always will be, we have to mention Edward Van Sloan (as Van Helsing)who gave us both the wisdom of the older Scientist and Expert on the phenomenon called 'the Nosferatu',the 'undead'.(Yeah, this guy really uses the term in the story!) But of all the rest players we have to give proper praise to is Mr. Dwight Frye(Renfield). He had the proper intensity and off beat insanity to bring the role of the unsuspecting ""servant"". And he possessed the most haunting stare, which when combined with his crazed laugh, provides the most horrifying of experiences.And ironically, Dwight Frye did not initially done these creepy characters in horror films. In fact this scene stealer of Dracula, FRANKENSTEIN(also '31) and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN('35)was not a film actor at all. Mr. Dwight Frye was a Stage Actor. And the Forte of this most notorious 'Professional Creep' was, the same as Sydney Greenstreet's, which was the Musical Comedy! We recently obtained a DVD of the original Universal 1931 Dracula with the newly created original score. We enjoyed the experience. This score is definitely tailored to this Dracula film and this one only. It is lively, moody, highly atmospheric and does underscore the action of the story.And you know what? The original Dracula with no music to speak of beyond the opening Title Theme(an eerie adaptation of ""Swan Lake"" by Tchaikovsky)is much better. I really prefer the creepy, quiet stretches of soundtracks, punctuated by the occasional dialog by Lugosi, Van Sloan or Frye. Even the crackling of the old soundtrack and old equipment was part of the old experience.What's more, I've incorporated the technique into my own Nightmares, shown and dreamed in Black & White, of course!NOTE: * Universal Studios boss, Carl Leamele had planned to make Dracula a project starring as the Transylvanian Count. Mr. Chaney died in 1930, leaving the part to Bela Lugosi, who had essayed the role in the Stage Play of Dracula.",Dracula
64,poe426,Transylvanian terror transposed...,10,15 July 2010,"The name Bela Lugosi has been carved in stone (so to speak) in Hollywood for good reason- and not because Martin Laundau did a very bad imitation of him in ED WOOD. THIS is the movie that put fright films on the map; and to have found a more perfect fit for the lead would've probably been impossible: Lugosi was Hungarian, Count Dracula, Transylvanian (you can't get much closer than that). If a 500 year old vampire count existed, he would almost surely have spoken the way Lugosi speaks in the movie (though in Stoker's book his diction is precise and not noticeably regional). The first half of Dracula is brilliant; it's everything following his arrival in London that brings the movie to a screeching halt. Once it becomes slow and stagey, it loses much of the effectiveness of the early scenes. For this, blame must be laid with director Browning; Lugosi holds up his end of things well enough- it's the man behind the camera who drops the ball. It's interesting to backtrack Stoker and read the stories that in whole or in part seem to have inspired his novel: in THE VAMPYRE (1819), by John Polidori, we come across the line: ""...death, he remembered, had already been mocked."" Sounds more than a little like Van Sloan as Van Helsing, does it not? The finest prose prior to Stoker's novel would have to be found in James Malcolm Rymer's tight, descriptive VARNEY THE VAMPIRE (1845): ""Here suddenly had arisen a something at once terrible and inexplicable."" The unfinished FRAGMENT OF A NOVEL (1816), by Lord Byron, is of interest for two reasons: one, it contains a description of the death of a vampire that would've made a great scene at the end of Dracula (in which The Count's dying moments occur offscreen and are heard but not shown): ""...his countenance in a few minutes became nearly black."" THAT would've been a GREAT way to close the show. The second reason Byron's fragment should be of interest to fright fans is that it was written following the same historic gathering at which Mary Shelly was persuaded to start writing FRANKENSTEIN.",Dracula

Brief Review -A major breakthrough for Hollywood in Horror genre before Trendsetter Count Dracula was ripped out by others. This film had been a major trendsetter in early 30s for horrors genre in Hollywood just before a classic Sci-fi horror Frankenstein released. Dracula 1931 version is something great after Nosferatu and before Dracula was buried alive in jokes. The nostalgic touch to the main character works because Hollywood audience never got to see Dracula speaking on screen. The blood thirst, Henri Cross Sign, Bat, Coffin, Sunrise all those iconic moments were thankfully restored by this film in Quality manners which we never got to see later as in say quality manners. Nosferatu was still little different from the novel as it adds sacrifice things to make emotional connect with the audience which was acceptable and creative too because it was a silent film so it had to score through expressions and emotions, not through sound and visuals. Dracula comes with a shorter runtime hence without losing any moment it gets to the main concept quickly and keeps the pace superfast. Bela Lugosi got to play the Dracula on screen because of his Broadway apperance in the same role and with no doubts he came out as a perfect choice. His slow pauses in between the sentences were irritating though, maybe cause it was just the beginning of horror films in sound era or they wanted to do some experimental stuff, however, it failed. Helen Chandler as Mina gets to do big and wide enough to leave an impact and she did far better than expected. I was expecting Van Helsing's character to be little more daring but whatever Edward Van Sloan did was nothing short of amazing. Tod Browning gave a major breakthrough to Hollywood cinema with this Supernatural Horror tale which has been loved since forever and yet to be matched even after Multiple attempts by many filmmakers. A Classic !RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",Dracula
68,Fella_shibby,Solid atmosphere n amazing screen personality of Lugosi but,8,9 September 2020,"I never found this to be creepy. In fact, Lugosi's face in certain scenes looked as if he is constipated.
I first saw this in the early 90s on a vhs. Revisited it recently. This is my dad's fav Dracula movie but i like the Max Schreck's unofficial version.
I am confused why everyone mentions Lugosi to b the first Dracula n not Max Schreck.The movie starts directly from the scene where the real estate agent reaches the village inn before Borgo Pass. Here the agent aint Jonathan Harker and so ther is no time wasted in bidding farewell to his wife Mina.
Also the agent doesnt waste time in staying at the inn but proceeds his journey inspite of being warned by the villagers.
The iconic Dracula's shadow, his bald head n his scary pointed teeth, nails n creepy face aint present. Instead we have a gentleman Dracula, well combed. But his wide eyeballs does get scary n intimidating.
In this version, Renfield gets a lot of footage n Harker is reduced to a mere spectator.",Dracula
69,Movie_Muse_Reviews,It's all about Lugosi's unforgettable creation,8,30 October 2012,"Universal's 1931 ""Dracula,"" and specifically the count's portrayal by Bela Lugosi has become so completely intertwined with pop culture it's virtually impossible to say anything bad about it. The reason we all imagine Dracula with the cowled cape, widow's peak and pale white face is entirely thanks to this film, and that kind of iconicity should not go under-appreciated.The film itself plays in stark contrast to what you think of when you think old movies. Whereas the Silent Era featured nothing but music, ""Dracula"" — due to certain Hollywood notions at the dawn of the Talkie era — completely avoids the use of any scoring. With nothing to enhance dramatic effect, the film becomes an exercise in creepiness.The gingerly pacing of most of the scenes, namely Dracula's attacks, and their lack of any satisfying conclusion thanks to cutaways forced of course by censorship requirements back in the day, could warrant a good share of criticism. Without the music to build toward these turning points in the film, it's almost awkward, but there's a sense of a deliberate, artistic choice behind each slow creep toward a victim, each shot of Dracula's face and his unforgettable stare. In a two-hour film it might be an unnecessary pain, but at 75 minutes, it has a place. Director Tod Browning gets his credit there to be sure, but he's not the reason we revisit this monster movie.""Dracula"" comes from the stage adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel rather than the novel itself, specifically. In it, we follow Dracula to London as he secures the Carfax Abbey property with his recently converted servant Renfield (Dwight Frye) as he preys on young Lucy Weston (Frances Dade) and then her friend, Mina Seward (Helen Chandler). Mina's father (Herbert Brunson) and fiancé, John Harker (David Manners), turn to the help of Dr. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) to prevent her from turning into a vampire. Lugosi played the role of Dracula on stage, and became known for getting a bit too into the character over the course of his lifetime. He made concessions to do whatever it took to be in the film, and we benefit from it. His stare and his mannerisms create the (at the time) wholly unique image of Count Dracula.It's not textbook suspense, but you can't help but be curious to see what Dracula will do next. He's a magnetic figure and he drives our curiosity to the point that we become wrapped up in the story, no matter how slow it might feel at times.You can't say ""Dracula"" is not a classic with a straight face. You might not identify it as a truly scary movie, or a truly suspenseful one, but its imagery has become so synonymous with the folk depiction of Dracula that it definitely did something very, very right.~Steven CThanks for reading!

70,funkyfry,Tod Browning/Bela Lugosi's collaboration,7,1 November 2009,"The marvelous thing about this classic Universal version of Bram Stoker's novel is the fact that even though it's one of the least faithful or even indeed cohesive versions of the narrative, Bela Lugosi's performance towers above the film and indeed over all film Draculas to this day. It doesn't matter that Stoker's vampire was more of a hairy giant while Lugosi's interpretation is late 19th Century Continental. He brings more to mind the ruined ""White Russian"" princes who populated the hot spots of London and Paris in the early 20th Century than he does any kind of 15th Century Inquisition leftover. It matters not. Lugosi connects with the audience, with his intense eyes and bizarre mesmeric hand motions. His gravity is undeniable, and he's like a dark star twisting and attracting everything else in the movie around him -- much like Dracula himself.Browning's direction is understandably derided, although his film would have benefited from a more extravagant production. The conclusion of the movie in particular seems rushed and inadequate. But it's grossly unfair for so many critics, professional and amateur alike, to claim that the film would be better off without him. Even more ridiculous are the claims that the film was directed by Karl Freund. I've seen most of Freund's directorial films and most of Browning's, and this is absolutely Browning's film and his cinematic vision, take it or leave it. The main positive Browning can be credited with, a sort of vestigial reminder of the great Lon Chaney with whom he had collaborated so many times in the past, is the sense of empathy for the outsider that imbues the film with real poignancy. Not for a moment do any of the ""normal"" characters like Jon Harker or Mina seem like real people; but Browning paradoxically manages to make Lugosi's vampire come alive, as well as Dwight Frye's amusingly disturbed Renfield. It's not right to credit Lugosi with the lion's share of the accolades, as so many do. Take a look at most of his later films, even his higher-budget collaboration with Benjamin Christiansen a year after this film. Lugosi only reached these heights again when, as in the popular ""White Zombie"", he imitated his performance for Browning. Not to mention that Browning's entire filmography, from the Chaney works like ""Unholy Three"" and ""Unknown"" through his subsequent work on the infamous ""Freaks,"" is marked by the same kind of trenchant identification with the most extreme social outcasts imaginable. Browning's Dracula is another extension of the same idea -- Dracula's lust for blood is the only real emotion on display in the entire film, and it would be a giant mistake to assume that was accident or incompetence.Only in the scenes with Renfield, however, does Browning's trademark dark humor really come into play. Otherwise the film is objectionably dry in tone. The weird atmosphere of the Transylvanian scenes is never equaled by the mausoleums of London which look like the cheap sets they are. What's really important though is the image that you're left with after the movie is over, and that's of Lugosi's magnificent performance.",Dracula
71,gwnightscream,"""Definitive Dracula!""",6,26 September 2013,"This 1931 horror classic stars Bela Lugosi, Dwight Frye, Helen Chandler, David Manners, Frances Dade, Herbert Bunston and Edward Van Sloan based on Bram Stoker's novel. I won't give away the film's plot because I think most of us know what it's about. I will say that they don't make them like this anymore, Lugosi makes the film and will always be the definitive version of the legendary vampire, Count Dracula. He's so creepy in the role that he didn't need fangs because his movements and facial expressions are chilling. Frye plays Renfield, Chandler plays Mina, Manners plays her fiancée, Jonathan, Dade plays Mina's friend, Lucy, Bunston plays her father, Dr. Seward and Van Sloan not only plays Dracula's nemesis, Van Helsing, but also appears in other horror classics, ""Frankenstein,"" ""The Mummy"" and ""Dracula's Daughter."" The film gets flack for not staying true to the novel and may have obvious flaws like wire-hanging bats, but it works for the imagination and they did what they could since they didn't have the technology/resources we have now. This classic has a good spooky atmosphere and I recommend it.",Dracula
72,Captain_Couth,Universal Monster Movie Classics: Dracula.,8,19 August 2005,"Dracula (1931) was one of the crown jewels of Universal Studios monster movie releases. Like Frakenstein, this movie was based more upon a stage play than the actual novel. Due to budget restraints, the film makers opted to use the stage play more than the Bram Stoker classic. The real stars of this movie are Bela Lugosi and the brilliant directing from genre master Todd Browning.The movie barely reaches past the seventy minute mark. But the basic parts of the novel can be found in this film. Browning uses the shadows and lighting to his advantage. The phonetic English spoken by Lugosi gives his character Count Dracula a more eerie persona. One of my favorite scenes involves Dracula's ladies as his hypnotic grip that he has over them. Not as great as the first adaptation of Count Dracula (Nosferatu). But if you look at the film from a different view point, you wont be as disappointed. Instead of being a nasty and vile creature, Dracula is more of a mac daddy instead of a disgusting beast.,HIghly recommended.",Dracula
73,bsmith5552,I am Dracula....I Bid You Welcome,10,2 May 2004,"""Dracula"" is a true cinematic classic that still hold up well today more than 70 years after its initial release. Bram Stoker's novel had been filmed before, most notably the 1922 German masterpiece ""Nosferatu"" with Max Schrenk playing the vampire as a monstrous rat like creature with no redeeming qualities. Bela Lugosi rose to instant fame with his portrayal of Dracula, a part he had been playing on stage for several years. Lugosi's interpretation is that of a suave and sophisticated nobleman with a hypnotic stare and a cultured Hungarian accent. This made the character more appealing to the ladies while at the same time terrifying to the audience when we see the monster revealed beneath. The story has the tragic Renfield (Dwight Frye) arriving in Transylvania to complete a transaction with the Count which will allow him to lease a English castle. Before they leave for England by ship, Dracula turns Renfield into a quasi-vampire who obeys his master's every command. Upon arriving in England it is discovered that all of the ship's crew have been murdered and only a raving lunatic of a Renfield remain alive. Renfield is committed to a sanitarium run by Dr. Seward (Herbert Bunston). Dracula seeks him out and discovers Seward's comely daughter Mina (Helen Chandler) and her friend Lucy. Dracula quickly ""kills"" Lucy and sets his sights upon Mina whose fiance Jonathon Harker (David Manners) is baffled by her sudden change in health and personality. Seward consults with a colleague Dr. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) who quickly identifies the source of the problem as a vampire. They soon expose Dracula for what he is and...... The atmospheric sets of this movie set the tone for the story. Dracula's castle is dark, damp and web filled and his cellar is positively scary. So too is his English manor with the classic winding stair case leading to the cellar. The opening theme I found to be equally foreboding and frightening. I wonder how many of those early film goers realized that it was adapted from the classic ballet ""Swan Lake"". Bela Lugosi should have become a major star after this film, but did not. His first mistake was the turning down the role of the monster in ""Frankenstein"" (1931). He did enjoy moderate success in the first half of the 30s playing various mad scientists and criminal masterminds. But he also accepted roles in several ""poverty row"" quickies which did little to advance his career. He had a brief return to glory in 1939 when he played ""Ygor"" in ""The Son of Frankenstein"" and again in 1948 again as Dracula in ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"". With his well documented personal demons, Lugosi wound up his career in cheap ""B' movies ultimately becoming the ""star"" in some of Ed Wood's ""classics"". Oddly enough, though he was forever identified with the Dracula character, he only played him on screen twice, in 1931 and 1948 as noted. He did play ""Dracula like"" characters in MGM's ""Mark of the Vampire"" (1935) and in Columbia's ""Return of the Vampire"" (1943). Dwight Frye almost steals ""Dracula"" from Lugosi with his portrayal of Renfield. He takes him from a young ambitious businessman to a half crazed lunatic and back again. After this and his role of Fritz the hunchback in ""Frankenstein"", this great character actor never again achieved such heights. A real tragedy. Oddly enough, Stoker's book portrays Renfield as a minor character and it is Jonathon Harker who makes the unfortunate trip to Transylvania. Also filmed in a Spanish language version.",Dracula
74,lugonian,"Tall, Dark and Gruesome",9,16 June 2001,"""Dracula"" (Universal, 1931), directed by Tod Browning, from the novel by Bram Stoker, is the ultimate horror film of the sound era that began the cycle of others to come. Starring Bela Lugosi who reprized his 1927 stage performance, up to then, with some movies to his credit, he was basically an obscure actor until ""Dracula"" hit the theater screens. It should be noted, however, that for Lugosi's sixth billed supporting role performance as a police inspector in Tod Browning's THE THIRTEENTH CHAIR (MGM, 1929), starring Conrad Nagel, comes close to being the major lead. Two years later, ""Dracula"" has Lugosi's name heading the cast for the first time, making him an overnight sensation and a new master of horror. Like some subsequent Universal horror films of the early 1930s, Dracula opens its main titles with the underscoring of ""Swan Lake.""The familiar plot features Count Dracula, a vampire from Transylvania, who rises from his grave at night to seek victims from whom he can suck out blood from their necks, and rest in his coffin by day. The first twenty minutes of the story, in which Mr. Renfield (Dwight Frye) comes to Castle Dracula via horse and carriage, to discuss some real estate property in England, and becoming Drac's first on screen victim, is horror film making at best - wolves howling, atmospheric background, with the count seen slowly rising from his coffin, accompanied by his three vampire wives, surrounded in gigantic spider webs, rats and other unrecognizable creatures crawling about which add to the mood and creepiness. After Dracula puts Renfield under his spell to use him as his ""slave,"" they come to England where Renfield is later placed in an asylum, and Dracula places his coffin with Transylvanian soil in a mansion next door to Doctor Seward (Herbert Bunston) and his daughter, Mina (Helen Chandler), a young girl engaged to John Harker (David Manners). Of course Dracula has his eyes on Mina and intends on making her his next vampire wife by putting her under his evil spell. Then there's Professor Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), knowing about the vampire legend, who must find a way to save Mina's immortal soul and destroy Dracula.At the time ""Dracula"" was released, Universal produced a Spanish language version starring Carlos Villarias. While there were some added bonuses in the Spanish version, which runs about a half hour longer than the English version, Lugosi's performance with glassy eyes and deadly stare make it more appealing to the avid horror movie lover. Lacking background music during most of the proceedings, Dracula was presented with a new under scoring in 1999. After viewing the ""scored"" Dracula, the best thing that can be said about it is to ""leave well enough alone."" Thank goodness ""Dracula"" did not have the misfortune of being colorized. However, the Spanish language version with English subtitles is highly recommended, All the versions mentioned are available on video cassette (later DVD) and formerly shown on both the Sci-Fi Channel and American Movie Classics (1991-92) before shifting over to Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: October 10, 1998).Bela Lugosi would play vampires in future film roles, but reprized his Count Dracula role only once, in ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN (1948) starring the comedy team of Bud and Lou. Sadly it would become Lugosi's last decent movie role of his career. Sequel: DRACULA'S DAUGHTER (1936), in spite the absence of Lugosi, is another one worth seeing.(*** bats)",Dracula
75,Stevieboy666,"""With Blea Lugosi - the master of horror as the Undead Fiend!""",9,10 June 2021,"And so proclaims the original trailer. I fell in love with horror at a very young age but I am also somewhat ashamed to admit that when the BBC screened ""Dracula"" (1931) back in the early 1980's I gave up on it, thinking it rather lame. However several decades and a view viewings later I can now review it as the Universal horror classic that it is. The opening credits are accompanied with the classical tune ""Swan Lake"", a fantastic start! It only takes about six minutes until Dracula, along with his vampire females, appear, then Bela Lugosi speaks the immortal words ""I am Dracula"". It's not long before he boards a boat called The Vesta, bound for England.The movie is incredibly atmospheric, rich in fog, night time scenes and Gothic architecture. Great camerawork helps. Lugosi, with his strong East European accent, is simply perfect for the part (bearing in mind that this is more of a stage adaptation as opposed to Bram Stoker's novel), a role that he obviously relished (unlike Christopher Lee, though I have to admit that I prefer Hammer's 1958 version by a whisker). Dwight Frye as the crazed Renfield is also a delight to watch. Dracula starts off wonderfully but I found the second half to be slightly weaker, and Dracula's inevitable demise could have been better. We also get a few very unconvincing English accents from the cast, almost to the point of being unintentionally comical. The 1930's was a fabulous decade for horror movies, this being one of the most famous of the classics and essential viewing to all serious fans of the genre.",Dracula
76,ackstasis,"""There are far worse things awaiting man than death""",6,29 October 2008,"I was hoping that 'Dracula (1931)' would be more like 'Frankenstein (1931)' than the other Universal horrors I'd watched to date. Whereas James Whale's film shows a mastery of both cinema's visual and auditory elements, most of the horror directors of the early sound era seem to have little command of dialogue or music. They resort to extended sequences of silence between words, accompanied by a muffled din of background noise, which are presumably intended to heighten the suspense; instead, it makes a 70 minute story somehow feel much longer. Unfortunately, Tod Browning's film  considered the definitive version of Bram Stoker's novel  is more akin in style to 'The Black Cat (1934)' and 'The Raven (1935).' This isn't necessarily a bad thing: Karl Freund's Expressionistic cinematography is frequently impressive, and Bela Lugosi's hammy theatrics, however ludicrous they might seem today, nonetheless keep you watching the screen. But I must confess an overwhelming preference towards Murnau's previous unauthorised Dracula tale, 'Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922).'In the darkened hills of Transylvania (cue the thunderclap), a young lawyer (Dwight Frye) travels through the night to deliver legal papers to Count Dracula (Lugosi), despite the warnings of the locals. Drugged, imprisoned and driven insane by the scheming Count, he later returns to England, bringing along his new vampire master, who then proceeds to wreak havoc on the pretty young women of London. A scientist named Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan; I find it amusing that, over seventy years, this old professor would somehow evolve into Hugh Jackman) comes to believe that a vampire is loose on the streets, and sets about capturing the enigmatic monster before it claims the life of the beautiful, virginal Mina Harker (Helen Chandler). This simple plot unfolds in a rather clumsy, stilted manner. Browning, an experienced director of silent films, appears unsure of how to use music in a sound picture, and so he omits it almost entirely. The gaping auditory void left by this absence emphasises the stage-bound roots of the material, a realisation that restricts the horror that one might otherwise feel.The performances are better than anybody experienced in Universal horror has any right to expect. Lugosi's role as the sinister Count justly made him famous, and, though he would only reprise the role once more for an Abbot & Costello comedy, strains of this portrayal are clearly evident in the likes of 'Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932)' and 'The Raven (1935).' Lugosi's Dracula wasn't as classy as I'd been expecting (the promotional photos somehow suggested a suave, charming aristocrat), and his fragmented line delivery and brazen mugging often brought a few chuckles, but the performance is nonetheless likable in its cheesiness. The beautifully-photographed sequences of Dracula majestically emerging from his coffin are well-orchestrated, and certainly one of the areas where the lack of music contributes to the chill-factor. Dwight Frye overplays frenziedly to try and steal scenes from his Hungarian co-star, largely to no avail, but it's always good to see such energy in an actor's work. While 'Dracula' may not be the masterpiece of which I'd heard, no horror fan can afford to miss it.",Dracula

On the big silver screen Plus, I got an exclusive tour of the Universal Studios back-lot!This film is so much better than I remember from my youth. This is only my second viewing first being in 7th grade at Halloween sleepover not sure if I even watched the whole movie back than fall of 1978 give or take !Lugosi was very cool in his appearance.The original Dracula, starring Bela Lugosi, launched the Hollywood horror genre and defined the iconic look and frightening character of the famed vampire.

79,parry_na,The first talking vampire ...,7,18 January 2016,"This first 'sound' horror film opens with some stunning graphics. For years, silent films only had visuals to tell their story, so already the art of matte painting used as backgrounds had been implemented successfully. So as Renfield (Dwight Frye) makes his way by carriage through the Universal films backlot, it is transformed, very impressively, into Transylvania! The first words spoken are from Carla Laemmle, niece of studio founder Carl Laemmle (she died as recently as 2014 aged 104).After local murmurings of vampires and Walpurgis Night, the camera allows us inside the dusty basement of Castle Dracula, where small animals scamper away as a selection of coffins betray their supernatural hosts. Three somnambulistic women and one man are revealed in near silence. These are beautiful, classic horror scenes. Dracula moves but rarely speaks. When he does, it is to welcome Renfield and then glides up a colossal stairway leaving his somewhat fey guest scrabbling through outsized spider's webs.Bela Lugosi had been playing Dracula on stage for some years and by 1931 made the role his own on film. It was a sensation. For a few months, he was an undisputed movie superstar, a horror icon. This story – which he described as a blessing and a curse – would be mentioned in virtually every interview and article about him until his death. He is magnificent, alien and captivating in these opening moments. The first time you see him, you notice how theatrical he is. When you watch him again, he is never quite as theatrical as you remember. He moves slowly, like a hungry lizard and is at one with the thick, macabre, frightening atmosphere – when he is removed from that, however, his performance takes on an anachronistic aspect.After an opening that is as near perfect as any in horror, Renfield loses his mind and is presided over by Martin, a warder at the sanatorium, (a truly grotesque, comedy-mock-cockney character who refers to his client as a 'loonie') and the horror is restricted almost entirely to Dracula's persona (on the rare occasions he is on screen) because the action is placed very much in the (then) present day. From here, it seems very much that we are watching a filmed theatre production, a drawing room drama. The camera barely moves, performances are very crisp and clear and static. The heroine Mina (Helen Chandler) is a meek, fragile, bloodless thing (perhaps The Count prefers subordinate females to Frances Dade's feistier Lucy) and her beau (David Manners) is even wetter. Of course, it is easy to note the difference in filmic styles from over 80 years ago – but 'Dracula' has dated less well in this respect than other films made during this era.As The Count is staked by Edward Van Sloan's Van Helsing, it is off-screen. We hear a groan (trimmed on the insistence of the censor) and it is rather anti-climactic. One would have hoped that any sequel would give Lugosi's Dracula a more memorable send-off. What a shame it was with Abbott and Costello, 17 years later.Horror was a largely unknown genre in 1931, so Universal's trepidation was understandable. Whilst Lugosi approached his role with full-blooded confidence, it's a pity the studio didn't do the same.",Dracula
80,iquine,Everything About It Is Impressive,9,1 November 2017,"(Flash Review)After watching this I clearly understand why Bela Lugosi is still famous today as all of his mannerisms, appearance, voice and speech rate have become the template for spookiness over many generations. The plot is not easily to quickly summarize but Count Dracula lives in a mammoth castle on a dangerous mountain pass with an interior covered in cobwebs, dirt and bugs along with a huge staircase. Dracula arrives in London and begins to seek out blood to suck. At a social gathering, Van Helsing meets Dracula and proves a growing suspicion that he is a vampire by not seeing Dracula's reflection in a mirror. Will The Count be able to suck enough blood to sustain his existence or will he truly be found out and captured? This is an excellent classic that does not use much music and lets the acting, scenery, facial expressions and Lugiso take center stage. This film still holds up over time and amazingly a plethora of current pop culture Halloween references can be traced back to Dracula.",Dracula
81,pixrox1,Not as much of a slog as the 1931 moonlighting version . . .,8,12 July 2013,". . . shot on the Universal back lot in Spanish at night with a Hispanic cast, but directed by an English-speaking dude who habla non Espanol. Either it takes 20% longer to say things in Madrid than it does to convey the same message in Peoria, or it is not smart to have diverse mono-lingual people mismatched together on a major project. At any rate, the American version of Dracula benefits from its foreign-born star taking the time to learn the language du jour when he came to the U.S. and, eventually, Hollywood. (Though this would seem to make common sense, about half of today's major league baseball players choose not to follow Lugosi's path to success in America, which probably is why they seem prone to ingest so many outlawed substances with labels they may not be able to decipher.) There's an expression that begins ""When in Rome . . . "" and it certainly applies to the United States even more so. Though this version of Dracula is filmed in black and white and seems to leave out many of the vampire movie bells and whistles today's TWILIGHT crowd has come to expect, the special effects are less cheesy here than Jacob and his friends turning into wolves every 10 minutes. Plus the lack of spurting blood in Lugosi's Dracula makes this more suitable for the younger crowd than TWILIGHT, with its emphasis on sex and gore.",Dracula
82,jimbo-53-186511,Didn't really set my blood flowing...,5,15 May 2020,"Bloodthirsty Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi) heads to England to find his next victim, but he didn't count on a crack pair of scientists cottoning on to his game, but with a wide-eyed protégé in his arsenal has this all come too late?Dracula is a film that I both love and loathe; the good and bad stuff lies with Bela Lugosi's performance; he's creepy and menacing, but some of the long stills where he stares into the camera add nothing and for the most part I felt Lugosi was over-directed and found his performance a tad theatrical. Dwight Frye is quite good as Dracula's unwitting first foil, but again at times his performance is over-the-top and silly.The story itself is reasonable, but there just isn't much on offer here that really sets the blood flowing. I didn't find the film to be all that suspenseful (barring the odd scene here and there) and many scenes that existed presumably for scares never really achieve that effect (as I've mentioned Lugosi's continual long stares into the camera come across as more funny than scary now).Director Todd Browning does keep things moving well and with it only being a short film it never really becomes dull. However, as I've said I just didn't find the film all that suspenseful or scary and I'm not really sure why so many people seem to praise it to the high heavens. To me its appeal is limited and I'd only recommend it to hardcore cinema buffs.SIDE NOTE; Did anyone else think that Charles K Gerrard who portrayed Martin bore an uncanny resemblance to Paul Anderson (AKA Arthur Shelby from Peaky Blinders).

83,yusufpiskin,"""Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make""",10,28 July 2020,"Dracula is considered the best universal monster movie yes it is a short movie and yes the film ends very abruptly however most future movies based on the Bram Stocker's story have either re made this classic tale with Bela Lugosi's portrayal of the title character in mind or actually used his strong accent and charismatic charm as starting point for different Dracula's throughout the years. Yes a lot of vampire movies tend to have a slight romance to them and even our original Drac had his eyes set on miss mina whether it was lust or hunger for her but no one had ever portrayed a vampire like he did with his mesmerising eyes and his tempered rage.Another great character brought to like straight from the book was Renfield played by Dwight Frye who scared me nearly as much as the count did growing up especially in the scene where he is found on the boat full of dead sailors. He has his wide eyes and crazed bug eating ways which was quite opposite to his character at the beginning of the movie being a smartly dressed real estate agent who really wanted to make that sale ignoring all the townfolkes warnings about castle Dracula. He survives a coach ride with no driver just to been plundered into terror.
The best part of the movie has to be when Dracula meets the Harkers, Mina and of course Van Helsing and Johnathan questions 'What could of caused this?'

I confess I was such a hater for a while, feeling the film was dull and stagey compared to later Universal horrors like FRANKENSTEIN and THE BLACK CAT. However, I always kept coming back to it-- there is something hypnotic about DRACULA, creaky as it is in some respects... and I think much of what is called ""stagey"" or ""primitive"" by critics is actually deliberate on the part of Tod Browning.Visually, DRACULA resembles a silent film. One could easily imagine title cards replacing the spoken dialogue. The slow pace, odd dialogue delivery, and gothic visuals all add to a sense of dread and decay. I particularly marveled at Dracula's first scene in my most recent viewing: the whole scene is silent and Lugosi conveys such power in his posture and aloof facial expression alone, that no words or spooky music are needed whatsoever.It is true that some parts of the movie will appear campy by modern standards, but I find there are too many great moments to discard this one to the dust bin. About my biggest issue with the movie is that it feels like scenes were cut or that certain plot developments are not elaborated on enough. For example, Renfield is enamored of Mina and wishes Dracula to do her no harm, but we never get a single scene of the two interacting, so it feels random. The subplot with Lucy is never given proper resolution. Even the ending seems abrupt-- but still, there is something mesmerizing about the movie: Lugosi's commanding performance, Renfield's madness and terror, even the little touches in Helen Chandler's performance which play up her guilty, repressed desire for the count.It may not be the best of the Universal horror movies, but it remains in our collective psyche, influencing the many cinematic nightmares to come from James Whale's FRANKENSTEIN to Coppola's own excursion into the vampire mythos.",Dracula
85,AAdaSC,Children of the night,6,20 April 2019,"Dwight Frye (Renfield) has an appointment with Bela Lugosi (Dracula). He is to meet him at Dracula's Castle in Transylvania at midnight. Is he insane?! The answer turns out to be yes he is, especially after the meeting. Bela travels over to England with his new assistant Dwight and lives the life of a vampire. He needs human blood to survive and that means victims.The film is a bit creaky but it's a classic so worth watching. It still contains creepy sequences and there is plenty of unintentional humour to enjoy. Shame it ends so easily. They could have made much more out of this with some extra twists. I have read that the director didn't care much for making this so maybe that has something to do with it.Bats, howling wolves, vampire wives, mirrors with no reflections - the only thing missing was garlic. I guess the whole garlic thing is a later invention. Along with having to ask permission to enter a house if you are a vampire. Bela doesn't bother with that formality. I now understand why there is a yearly UK Gothic Festival held at Whitby. It's the location of Dracula's UK residence. I think I'll attend and check it out.",Dracula
86,JoeKarlosi,Dracula (1931) ***,7,28 October 2004,"This classic early horror talkie has gotten some hard knocks in recent decades, and in all fairness it's not entirely hard to understand why. For especially when screened these days, ""Dracula"" feels slow and indifferently directed by an uninspired Tod Browning, and it is somewhat of a missed opportunity in so many ways. But it's got one overpowering ingredient that still manages to make it a good - though not excellent - cinematic experience: and that's Bela Lugosi - who still remains the definitive version of Count Dracula for all time. As Dracula, Lugosi is methodically sinister and eccentric, speaking deliberately with bizarre intonations and slithering about with an other-worldly gleam in his eye. Though many new viewers tend to find his performance campy or humorous, I'll tell you one thing ... he's suitably creepy. If I ever met this weirdo on a castle stairway, I'd bolt out the door so fast your head would spin! The first 20 minutes are near perfect, even the most vocal detractors tend to acknowledge that. They're completely dripping with a sense of dread and horrific atmosphere. But as the movie progresses, the events indeed become more ponderous, talky and stagy - and it's not always easy to maintain full interest. ""Dracula"" was adapted straight from the 1920's stage play (which also starred Lugosi) and it often feels like you're a spectator sitting in the fifth or sixth row. I've seen the film many times myself and there have been times where the leisurely pace has actually worked for me as a deliberate and calculated aura of evil (it was great when I saw it at a revival on the big screen); other times, I am as bored as anyone else. It usually depends on my mood. When Lugosi is on screen, it's pure magic; he ""becomes"" Dracula. Dwight Frye is also good as the maniacal Renfield, driven mad by his undead master. Edward Van Sloan makes a fine Professor Van Helsing, and two of the highlights of the later parts of the picture involve the confrontations between Lugosi and Van Helsing meeting face to face. Unfortunately, David Manners and Helen Chandler are not very intriguing as the leads. Though ""Dracula"" was a huge success in 1931, today it's not as engrossing as other great horror films which followed the year it was released, like the superior FRANKENSTEIN or DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE; but thanks in large part to the mystique and allure of Bela Lugosi in the title role it's still well worth watching.",Dracula
87,kairingler,Vlad the Impaler,10,10 July 2013,"this is one of my all time favorite classics,, first off Bela Lugosi did a great job,, possibly his top 5 material you have to love the Renfield character that guy was just so lovable the whole movie,, I love the use of sexuality in this movie also, all of the undertones. the movie was very suspenseful, creepy, I just love the story of how our main character, besides Dracula, Jonathan Harker has to go and visit the count,, here we go thru the Bulgar Pass. hope I spelled that right. I love how the townspeople harass him and tell him he's crazy ,the horses are up on two legs,, they want no part of it either, the castle itself is a character in the movie,, it's so old and dank, and dreary,, pefect for me, I actually have visited many castles in Germany along the Rhine, so I can appreciate a good castle when I see one.. you have to also love all of Dracula's minions in the movie,, how the serve him without question. I love the Mina character a lot as well,, and you have Van Helsing,, and a host of others I can't remember because it's been over a year since I've watched this so time again to be taken far off to the land of Transylvania..

89,slokes,Winging It,5,17 April 2011,"Some old movies age like vintage wine. Others turn more vinegary. ""Dracula"" contains a clever idea, a noteworthy central performance, and introduced sound to the horror film. It's just the execution that's lacking.There's a new tenant at Carfax Abbey in rural England, one Count Dracula (Béla Lugosi) who wears a dinner jacket and cape at all times and opts to leave his new home a dark, shambling ruin. As a nobleman, no one seems to think adversely of this stranger, even as people in his wake are found dead with marks on their throats, a madman named Renfield (Dwight Frye) hints of Dracula's darker purpose, and the Count introduces himself to a couple of young ladies with rather morbid banter.""To die, to be really dead, that must be glorious!"" he intones in that often-imitated Hungarian accent of his. ""There are far worse things awaiting man than death...""""Dracula"" isn't worse than death, just deathly dull. For a film that runs under 75 minutes, there's a lot of slow stretches. Lugosi's surrounded by a cast seemingly determined to act more undead than he. Love interests Mina and John are played by actors as stiff as boards, while Herbert Bunston, the actor playing Mina's father Dr. Seward, declaims every line as if giving the Gettysburg Address. Frye is up and down in his manic characterization, while Edward Van Sloan's Professor Van Helsing is entirely too smug.Worse is the direction, or lack thereof, by Tod Browning. The first 20 minutes of Renfield's meeting Dracula at his castle in Transylvania sets a properly grim mood, but after that it's like this film is sailing as much without a captain as the poor, doomed Vesta. Scene after scene is shot in a flat, static manner. Dracula's confrontations with other characters are drained of any menace. Lame comic relief from a warder who wisecracks about his ""loony"" charge Renfield feels trowelled on, because it is.Lugosi gave better performances in other films, like his underrated turn as Ygor in ""Son Of Frankenstein."" Here, though, he gives ""Dracula"" its one undeniable dynamic, and a badly needed star presence. His urbanity hints with gentle suspense at the fiend within, while many of his line deliveries hint at a kind of pathos that almost pulls us to his side. His silent staring at the camera are still chilling however they have been sent up comedically in later decades.But there are so many holes in this scattershot adaptation of the Bram Stoker novel that the contempt begins to drip off the screen. Why is Renfield kept around by the Count? What finally happens to Mina's tragic friend Lucy? How come the finale is so abrupt and easy, after we have been told of Dracula's great power?Browning apparently didn't care. History tells us he was so busy brooding about the actor he couldn't use in this film (Lon Chaney had died the year before) that he couldn't be bothered to work with the very formidable actor who arrived in his place. The end result was a movie that should have been great, but wound up just being very, very famous.",Dracula
90,dworldeater,Classic,9,2 November 2015,"Director Tod Browning's 1931 classic Dracula is one that put Hollywood horror on the map and made Dracula a household name. The film adaptation borrowed more from the play then the novel, but provided a solid blueprint for others to follow. The black and white works in favor of this production, amping up the gloomy Gothic ambiance. The tone and atmosphere of the film is very eeire and ominous. As far as I am concerned Bela Lugosi gave an incredible performance as Count Dracula. He had immense screen presence and old world charm. Bela Lugosi had a unique persona and had the ability to be creepy and charming simultaneously. No other actor embodies the essence of Dracula like Lugosi has done here. In this timeless classic, Mr. Lugosi really brings Dracula to life and sets a standard as well. The Spanish language version of the film was shot in the same time frame, using the same sets and script is a great companion piece to this film. For the most part its Spanish counterpart is a better made film. However, the Spanish version does not have Bela Lugosi, who in my opinion is a key element for the film to perform as well as it does. Dwight Frye also is very impressive here as Renfield as he delivered a very complex and insane performance. As a fan of the genre I enjoy and recommend both this version and the Spanish version. They are a bit old fashioned now, but hold up really well against many of the other Dracula adaptations that came out through the years.",Dracula
91,Witchfinder-General-666,"""I Am Dracula. I Bid You Welcome.""",9,28 June 2008,"There are great films, there are masterpieces, and then there are these classics that every film fan has to see at least once. The great Tod Browning's ""Dracula"" of 1931 belongs to all three categories. Generally speaking, this is neither Browning's best film (that honor goes to ""Freaks"" of 1932), nor is it the best adaptation of Bram Stoker's great novel. The most ingenious film about the Dracula legend is still F.W. Murnau's silent masterpiece ""Nosferatu - Eine Symphonie Des Grauens"" of 1922 , the most entertaining is the Hammer Studio's ""Horror Of Dracula"" (1958) with Horror dream-team Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. However, this most famous version of 1931 is absolutely essential for one reason - the great Bela Lugosi. The immortal icon Lugosi delivers one of the most remarkable performances ever in a Horror film as the bloodsucking count. Lugosi does not only play Dracula, he becomes Count Dracula. From the first moment of his appearance, Lugosi immediately dominates the film, and he does not cease to do so whenever he is seen. Other than ""brilliant"", ""breathtaking"" and ""unforgettable"", here are hardly any appropriate words to describe such a wonderful performance - performances like this have to be seen! I don't find it necessary to deliver a plot description, as I assume that everybody knows the ""Dracula"" story. Bram Stoker's brilliant novel has been filmed on various occasions, some of the adaptations (such as Nosferatu, Horror Of Dracula, or this one) were excellent, others (such as ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" of 1992) were quite lame, and all of them differed from each other quite immensely. There is little action in this interpretation of the story. What makes this film tense is the overwhelming presence of Bela Lugosi, as well as a wonderful black and white photography, eerie sceneries, and a gloomy and menacing general mood. There is hardly any music, just the eerie and unforgettable tune in the beginning. The film's one small weakness is a middle part in which little happens. This tiny fault, however is easily made up for by the film's eerie atmosphere and the brilliantly haunting Bela Lugosi. What makes the difference between a great actor and an icon? To me, what makes an icon is the predestination for certain roles, which no one else would be even imaginable to play. This is definitely the case with Bela Lugosi in the 1932 Dracula. In Short: This is essential cinema. An absolute must-see and a classic that no film fan could possibly afford to miss.",Dracula
92,caspian1978,More of a Silent film than Nosferatu,7,8 January 2004,"I was surprised at all the silence Dracula has. Filmed in 1931, this was done to please the present audience that was use to watching silent pictures. Still, Bela Lugosi steals the show. Every time he is on camera, it is worth watching. For today's audience, Dracula is only appreciated by its die hard fans of horror. Most will take its long and tired some scenes and missing moments of ""action"" a drag. No blood and gore, no sex and nudity. Most will appreciate the style of acting and not forget that this was filmed over 70 years ago. Moments of having a plastic bat hanging off a tiny screen is funny, but back in 1931, it was considered true horror. The character of Renfield is just as interesting as Dracula. It remains a classic because of Renfield and Bela Lugosi. Bela's performance has been the gold standard of ""Dracula"" for the past 70 years of vampire movies.",Dracula
93,Jonny_Numb,"outdated and outdone, but not without interest...",6,13 September 2005,"In the elaborate, cobweb-strewn, tapestry-like sets, in the manic madness of the performers (particularly Dwight Frye as Renfield and Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing), and the oozing atmosphere (love that fog!) created by director Tod Browning, there is no denying that ""Dracula"" is a strong film in its own right. In spite of this, it suffers from awkwardly jerky plot shifts (including a gap between Renfield's sanity loss, and an ending that leaves MUCH to be desired), scenes of draggy exposition, special effects that seem laughable by today's standards (the pin-light shining when Lugosi gives 'the evil eye' is distracting to no end), and coy neck-bites. That being said, the sheer beauty of this film and the skill with which it's executed IS periodically hypnotizing, and Lugosi is relatively good as the undead Count. Since eclipsed by the Hammer renditions of the tale (with the legendary pairing of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing), ""Dracula"" is still worth a look after all these years.",Dracula
94,adamjohns-42575,Please make a good Dracula film somebody?,1,7 November 2021,"Considering the time that it was made and the censors of that era, it is a good film. It's not what we would call brilliant today, but nevertheless it is interesting to see where the stereotypical ""Vampire"" came from. At one point I expected Mr Lugosi to start counting and was convinced that he must be a purple Muppet, he was that similar to his 'Sesame Street' counterpart.It stands to reason that it is better than the more recent 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' featuring Gary Oldman and Keanu Reeves, because quite frankly I think that is Gary's worst ever film (The jury is still out for Keanu) and it's partly to do with the original story. I'm sure that Stoker never intended it to be so slow and in places quite dull, I would imagine that the tension builds in the book and has somehow been lost in the versions we have seen on screen. In fact I have to say that this is probably the best Dracula I have seen. It's about time that somebody got it right actually.This one is definitely creepy and you can see how audiences of the time might have found it terrifying. Crude by today's standards, the special effects aren't brilliant either, but the light on his eyes is very clever as it gives him something that the others don't have and automatically lets you know that he is in charge.I would question the use of the 'Swan Lake' tune to open and close the film with, although the drama in it is obvious.It is a much milder story than we're used to as the heathens and hellions of the 21st century that we are, but it does stand the tests of time in a lot of ways.143.85/1000.",Dracula

Dracula is played by Bela Lugosi and even if you haven't seen this movie you will probably see Dracula as this man. He simply is Dracula.There is hardly a soundtrack, only parts of Tchaichovksy's ""Swan Lake"" are used. The acting is nice but has its flaws, even though Lugosi's performance is a landmark in the cinema. It has been copied and mocked, both with their own pleasures. The first official adaptation of Bram Stoker's story for me still is the one I enjoy the most. F.W. Murnau's unofficial 1922 version 'Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens' is probably better, but a modern audience will not find much joy in watching it.",Dracula

While the story is pretty decent, the slow pacing, lack of soundtrack, and direction by Tod Browning just makes this film feel mediocre. It's a fine film from the earlier days of cinema, but it's certainly not great. Browning's Dracula isn't nearly as memorable as the James Whale Universal entries (""Frankenstein"", ""Bride of Frankenstein"", ""The Invisible Man"", The Old Dark House). Having watched Bram Stoker's Dracula and this version recently, I think the only reason I'd choose to watch this version over the other is the shorter runtime.

97,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Great Performances but Lacking Story,8,4 January 2021,"This film I originally sought out right after college. It was a blind-spot for me and I rented the box set from local library. I decided that I was going to seek out all of the Universal classical and this was one of the first. I've now seen it 3 times, with the second in the theater on a 35mm print and now a third as part of my Odyssey through the Ones. The synopsis here is after a naïve real estate agent succumbs to the will of Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi), the two head to London where the vampire sleeps in his coffin by day and searches for potential victims by night.We start in the back of a horse drawn carriage going down a country road. We learn that we are in Romania. The people inside want the driver to slow down, but he is afraid to be out after the sun has gone down. They make it to a little village. One of the men is Renfield (Dwight Frye). He tells the driver and the members of the village that he is going to see Count Dracula and needs to continue on. This upsets everyone who listens as they warn him of the vampire. It is to no avail though as they cannot sway him. A rosary is given for his protection.Renfield is dropped at Dorgo pass where there is another carriage waiting. This one's driver is Lugosi. He is hiding his face from his passenger as he takes his luggage and Renfield gets inside. They start this next part of the journey. Renfield looks out the window toward where the driver should be to see there's no one there, but a bat is flying by the horses. They arrive at the castle and the bat is gone as well as the driver.He goes inside and we officially learn that Lugosi is Count Dracula. They go about their business upstairs and we learn Dracula has purchased Carfax Abbey in England. A ship has been prepared to take them the following night. We then see that Dracula has three wives living in the castle with him. Renfield is turned into a servant of the count.Renfield is cursed to drink the blood of insects and small animals. During the day he watches over his master's coffin and by night, Dracula feeds on the crew. When they arrive in England, Renfield is found and thought to be mad. The ship is thought to be cursed since everyone onboard aside from is dead. Renfield is taken to a sanitarium ran by a Dr. Seward (Herbert Bunston).Count Dracula is enjoying his time in England already. We see him feed on a young flower girl before arriving at the opera house. It is there he meets his neighbor of Dr. Seward along with his daughter, Mina (Helen Chandler), her fiancé John Harker (David Manners) and her friend of Lucy Weston (Frances Dade).That night the count attacks Lucy. In charge of the autopsy is a world renowned doctor of Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). He notices the marks on her neck match those of the deceased flower girl. He suspects it could be a vampire, but they're living in a modern world so it couldn't be possible. Mina then becomes the object of Dracula's desires and the men in her life do what they can to protect her.To get into my thoughts here, I'll preface once more that this is my third viewing of the film. I can also say that it is quite the experience. It is interesting to me since this one isn't based on the novel, but a play that was adapted from the novel. This is also one of the first actual on film appearance of Dracula under the correct name as well.What I found interesting is that in the first 5 minutes, we're establishing most of the basic lore of the vampire. We learn that they're nocturnal and weak to sunlight. We know that religious icons protect you and later we will see about vampires not casting a reflection in the mirror. Something else that I really liked here is that we have a man of science with Van Helsing believing that there is a vampire that is attacking London. His colleagues and those around him don't believe though and I don't blame them. John is really bad even though the love of his life is dying before his eyes. I really like the blending of old lore with a modern approach like we got here.Something that is interesting about this adaptation is that it is not using the novel, but the play. The reason there is probably due to the fact that it was easier since it was already on the stage. What doesn't necessarily work for me are all of the changes a lot of to the characters. I don't mind making Dr. Seward as Mina's father. It does completely remove the character of Quincy Morris and Arthur Holmwood as well. There's something else that is removed that I will delve into next.My major problem would be there isn't much of a mystery or investigation. Something I tend to run into when it comes to these Universal films is a basic story and lack of a subplot. A lot of this could be that they are early cinema. This version of the story completely cuts of Van Helsing taking the suitors of Lucy to her coffin to prove and destroy her as a vampire. This does hurt the movie for me and how it ends was a bit too abrupt as well. They never do travel back to Transylvania which also is a misstep. I shouldn't harp too much as this is a variation on the story, but there are other movies out there that do the story more justice in my opinion.For a positive though, acting though is really good. Lugosi kills it as the iconic character. When you look and hear him speak, I think that he is a Dracula. He is the second best Dracula of all time just behind Lee in my opinion, which is saying a lot for the amount of versions there are of this story. I do enjoy the gentleman take on the role for sure. The best acting performance in the film for me though was Frye. He was amazing as Renfield and I was blown away by his performance. He comes off as crazy and it was highly believable, but there are moments where he gains clarity as well. It just works for me. Aside from that, I'd say that Chandler, Manners, Van Sloan, Bunston as well as the rest of the cast rounds out the film well for what they needed.Being that this film is from 1931, the effects were done practical and don't always look great. I actually don't mind it though due to the era this film was made and what technology they had to work with. The bats clearly don't fly as they would in real life, but they aren't much better than you'd see in films from like the 1970s or CGI ones you see now. There also a spider that was bad, but there's a bit of charm there. I do like that they focus in on Lugosi's eyes, highlighting them with a light. It shows us that he has the power to entice and I liked that. The editing is fine. The film has a low running time. It does build some tension, but not enough. I think part of the problem here is things are just revealed instead of more investigation.Now with that said, this film is a classic. It helped kick off the Universal Monster films, back when the horror genre was taken from great literature. I enjoy this film, but feel the story could have benefited from a subplot or two to help bolster the story or even just including some more aspects from the book. The acting was really good. The effects aren't great, but I have a soft spot for them being the era they were from. The editing does build tension, but the issue with the basic story affects the tension. The score is solid as well. I do have to warn you that this film is in black and white as well as being from the 30s. If that is an issue, then I would avoid this, but if that's not a problem I would recommend a viewing. It is a classic and a good film.",Dracula
98,Movie-ManDan,"The Best ""Dracula""",9,12 February 2020,"Whenever someone dresses up as a vampire for Halloween, all they are doing is duplicating Bela Lugosi in Tod Browning's 1931 adaptation of a stage play which is, in turn, based upon Bram Stoker's horror masterpiece. The book became the benchmark for all horror and this interpretation of the titular character has become the benchmark for all vampires. Sadly, we now have the ""Twilight"" series that seemingly ruined the genre, but there are still people out there that know where it all began.Bela Lugosi was a Hungarian actor who was rumoured to not have spoken much English when he was cast. In reality, he spoke English very well. He played Dracula on stage in the United States before the film. Frankly, this is the role he was born to play. His wide eyes never blink which creates an insane nature in the character. No person has played Dracula better and no one will ever play Dracula better.I am not sure how closely this film follows the book, but I like what I saw. It starts off with Renfield going to talk to the Count about some real estate, despite warnings of evil. Upon meeting Dracula, Renfield gets attacked and and mentally destroyed in an instant, becoming the Count's insane slave. They embark from Transylvania to London where their reign of terror continues. Renfield gets locked in an asylum where he tries to combat his new dark mentality while Dracula looks to add two women named Lucy and Mena to his collection of fellow bloodsuckers (and marry the latter). The deal with Dracula targeting the girls seems random. In Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 version, it states that she bears a striking resemblance to his late wife. I like that version more than this take of randomness. One other thing I was against was how easily Dracula gets killed. The climax does not reach its full potential like it should have. I know this was in 1931, but movie even before this had better highs. It is because of this that I do not think this movie reaches the highest regard as a whole. Lugosi reaches the highest level, but the movie falls short.Back in 1931, talkies were still fresh. Director Tod Browning chose to have as little sound as possible and no music to distinguish it from the old types of films. Sound is too crucial in film to mess with. It was not until 1999 that music was added. The lack of foley and ambience is ridiculous and the complete lack of music makes the movie lifeless. In the version with music, so much is added! The movie was clearly inspired by German expressionism, but the sound give it the hard extra push it needed to be on par with it related film, ""Nosferatu."" This is an excellent example of the need for music and sound in film.3.5/4",Dracula
99,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Dracula: Stiff and Cold,4,14 May 2018,"Like so many early talkies, Dracula plays like a stiff amateur stage play that happens to get captured on film. The more movies I see from the early talkie years the more I'm amazed Hollywood survived. It certainly went about 12 steps backward from the height of the silent era, in terms of camera movement, photography and even acting. 
Lugosi's goofy stare is creepy at first, but each time Browning trots it out it gets closer and closer to camp. Henfield over-acting his craziness, Harkar immediately grating on my nerves, the dames being indistinguishable from one another.

100,alexanderdavies-99382,"The beginning of ""Universal's"" horror cycle.",7,18 May 2017,"This version of ""Dracula"" needs no introduction: it began a horror film cycle that began at ""Universal"" studios and then was preceded by the likes of ""Paramount,"" ""Warner Bros."" and ""R.K.O.""In addition, ""Dracula"" launched the career of Bela Lugosi - even though playing the undead Count was a career move that would haunt the actor somewhat.For all the films legacy, I don't enjoy ""Dracula"" as much as ""Frankenstein"" or ""The Invisible Man.""The problem is, is that the above film is rather amateurish and tedious. A lot of the action takes place in script form rather than visually and this robs the film of any cinematic impact it might otherwise have made. The little direction that Tod Browning provides is uninspired and lazy. It was rumoured that the director was suffering from depression after suddenly losing his biggest moneymaker and silent actor, Lon Chaney.The opening 15 minutes and final 10 minutes are great but in between, it is rather difficult to watch.The acting honours go to Bela Lugosi and Dwight Frye. For better or for worse, Lugosi remains one of the best on-screen Draculas. He has the right aura of mystery, menace and a sense of eerieness. Dwight Frye, like Lugosi, found himself typecast in horror films and usually as these rather jittery, eccentric characters. His rendition of Renfield is a class act - the actor realised he had to play the character as being larger-than-life and he sure does! He is by turns, insane, melancholic and conniving. However, he is still a sympathetic character who had no idea at the beginning of the film that he would become a crazed fly-eater. The rest of the cast I rate as follows: David Manners and Helen Chandlers are both as dull as they come - she went around with her head in the clouds, thinking she was going to be the next Lillian Gish but it never happened. Helen Chandler was LONG forgotten when she died in the 1960s. Edward Van Solan is OK as Van Helsing but the way he feels he has to keep using various hand moments, becomes irksome after a while.The actual filming of ""Dracula"" was described as being totally disorganised and that most of the cast weren't taking any of it seriously - except Bela Lugosi.A landmark in horror cinema but not definitive by any means.",Dracula
101,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Lugosi *is* Dracula,7,31 October 2015,"I just rewatched this in the cinema (my first time seeing it in years, and first time ever on the big screen) and loved the set design in the castle scenes: high contrast b/w photography; over-sized fireplaces and Gothic arches and doorways made the two men seem tiny, and candelabra placed near camera (forced perspective) only reinforces this. Lugosi's first appearance is still chilling: 6'1"" tall, clad in jet black cape, slicked back black hair, slowly walking to stairs, complete silence before ""I am Dracula "" The complete silence in many scenes was awkward, yet extremely effective. The complete silence, devoid of even any ambient noise. has us waiting for sound, any kind of sound to come along, we're almost searching for it, and when it does, in the form of Lugosi's ""I am Dracula"" it is almost deafening, shocking, because of the lack of any ambient sounds. Lugosi's delivery is calm and confident, charming, yet chilling; calling, yet foreboding. Great turns from the leads, great sets and photography and audio track, but film does have a few lulls in action, and a couple of the bat-on-a-string effects have aged quite poorly.",Dracula
102,mike48128,The Original but Really not the Best Version!,7,25 April 2014,"Purists will not agree, but I prefer several other versions of the story of Dracula, including Frank Langella's in 1979, and ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". Some of the Hammer productions are quite good, also. How can the original not be the best? Well, it drags. Unless you opt for the ""new music"" in the 1999 DVD release, there is not one bit of music throughout it. No gore of any kind is shown. Barely any blood, fangs, bites or bite marks! The restoration is terrible. So grainy that I bet that some 16mm prints were used as a last resort for restoring missing scenes. (The shipwreck and fog scenes are terrible.) The obvious puppet bat is very well performed. I didn't see any wires at all! Still fun to watch, as poor Bella Lugosi get hopelessly typecast in his lifelong role! That look of his was enhanced by his ""alleged"" drug habit, they say. The Spanish version on this DVD is actually somewhat better, but without old Bella as Drac, it just isn't the same!",Dracula

Dracula and his eccentric assistant then head for London after killing most of the ship's crew they were travelling on by drinking their blood. Dracula heads for Carfax Abbey, his home in the dungeons below this. It isn't long before killings start, all with two marks on their neck. Van Helsing tracks the Count down and then stakes him at the end...We get to see the other unfriendly residents of Draculas's castle too and these include spiders, bats, rats and other creepy crawlies, complete with plenty of foggy scenes.Joining Bela in the cast are several stars who went on to appear in other horror movies: Edward Van Sloan (Dracula's Daughter, Before I Hang), David Manners (The Death Kiss, The Mummy), Dwight Frye (The Vampire Bat) and Helen Chandler.

104,dunmore_ego,Evil's Fruity Face,6,8 May 2008,"Dracula is a mediocre 1931 movie, but the concept of the undead, blood-craving supernatural demon is so mythically instilled in the planet's  ahem - bloodstream that this movie's ongoing mighty aura is more due to the CONCEPT of the vampire entrenched in society's psyche than any movie-making quality the film-makers might have aspired to. It was not THIS particular movie which launched the vampire legends, although being only the second film to deal with this theme (the first being Murnau's NOSFERATU, 1922), it surely warrants blame for savagely promulgating the myth. Bram Stoker's 1897 novel was fleshed out (and diluted) for the silver screen by writer/director Tod Browning and a host of other writers. The passage of time and innumerable bastardizations of the story have eroded Stoker's truly disturbing tale, making it inconsequential to the character at its center  so though our memories composite Christopher Lee's Dracula debacles and Anne Rice's vampires and blaxploitation's BLACULA and Scott Bakula  the original story should be remembered for its composting of ancient legends into a compelling original tale.Purely for the iPod-ders, the plot: a young British solicitor, Jonathan Harker, travels to the Carpathian Mountains (in Transylvania  yes, say it with the accent) to offer real estate advice to Count Dracula, who wishes to move to London. He discovers the Count to be a blood-sucking denizen of the night, who can shape shift into a bat or wolf at will, whose reflection cannot be seen in mirrors and whose incisors were badly in need of filing down. All the better to bite the neck and drink the blood of his victims, turning them into ""undead"" vampires like himself. Dracula travels to London and cultivates Harker's fiancée, Mina and her busty clubbing buddy, Lucy, with love bites and blood infusions via carotid. Dr. Van Helsing is called in to examine Mina and Lucy's strange anemic sickness and knows enough about vampires to eventually kill Dracula by severing his head and driving a stake through his heart while he sleeps in his coffin. Even the basic gist of the tale opens up so many dark avenues of discussion (possession, psychosis of blood-drinking, perverse sexuality, bizarre murders, sleeping in COFFINS?!) that it would be impossible to explore in a thousand rants.Hungarian stage star, Bela Lugosi, shot to fame as the eeevil Count Dracula; if it weren't for his ""presentational"" stage training, he would never have come up with that ""crippled hand thingy"" which Christopher Lee borrowed to such great effect not only as Dracula himself, but also Fu Manchu, Saruman and Count Dooky Del Rio in *Star Wars Episode Poo.* And Lugosi never actually says, ""I vont to zuck yor blud!"" File it in the ""Play it again, Sam"" bin  merely misquoted Legend. Dwight Frye plays Dracula's horror movie sidekick, Renfield  brainwashed by Dracula into subservience and psychosis, eating bugs and walking with a stoop like a horror movie sidekick; immortalized as the ""Igor-type"" when he accepted an identical role on Frankenstein (Nov 1931) as Fritz; further immortalized on Alice Cooper's 1971 album *Love It To Death* in *The Ballad of Dwight Fry.*Though the novel Dracula (written when Stoker was 50) is still a scorching read (the brooding words cascade off the page like that liquid nitrogen smoke all these movies use to blanket the ground in graveyards - coincidentally used to great effect on KISS and Alice Cooper stages), the movie is unfortunately made for another time, a bygone age; when people who hadn't yet touched each other called themselves ""lovers""; when each question was presaged with, ""Why,"" as in, ""Why  what's the matter, darling?""; when the Hero ran like a girl and never appeared anywhere without a three-piece suit and his hat; when the simplest of gestures was a melodramatic flourish because that's the only way stage actors knew how to ""act""; when interminable gaping holes of no audio have actually become ""dramatic silences"" in retrospect; when nakedness meant knees To quote the great Gary Oldman as The Count in *BRAM STOKER'S Dracula (1992), ""I have crossed oceans of time"" This movie has crossed those oceans  and it shows. Even movies from ten years ago look dated - think about a film nearly 80 years old!And only the great Gary Oldman could truly instill the mind-blanking terror that a blood-drinking maniac should evoke. When we see him as the continental Count or the leather-skinned bat-man, it is a disturbing experience, worthy of a modern incarnation of the aged legend. Lugosi must have been frightful in his day, but nowadays just looks fruity; Christopher Lee's menace has dated embarrassingly; Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt were just too, too beautiful to be taken seriously and if anyone even mentions Mamuwalde I might have to put on mah mah mah mah boogie shoes.",Dracula
105,KUAlum26,Iconic at the every least,8,10 December 2007,"While the special effects,editing and sound really FEEL like they're over seventy-five years old,the movie itself still has a good,slow,eerie feel to it. I have yet to read Stoker's novel,but I'm quite familiar with the assortment of characters(the Count,VAn Helsing,Mina,JOhn/JOnathan HArker,Renfield,Lucy,Dr.Seward,the sanitarium staff,etc.) Probably more shocking when it was originally released(one story tells of a fainting at a screening of the film),director Tod Browning's movie would be considered quaint by most standards,it still holds up in imagery and in character,with Bela Lugosi able to inject plenty into mere glances and steadily,deliberate movement. The tale of the charismatic,mysterious nobleman from Transylvania who crashes ashore off a shipwrecked cargo vessel onto England,moving into an abandoned estate in sub-urban London's Carfax Abbey feels as common and comfortable as an old slipper. The acting isn't all that exceptional,save Lugosi,Dwight Frye(as the doomed,bug-eating lackey Renfield,whose back-story seems somewhat different than I recall from other versions of the story)and perhaps Edward Van Sloan(As the fiercely incorruptible Van Helsing),but that doesn't hinder this film's message or its mood. It works on a very basic premise,that being that this Dracula sort is one effective and lethal operator. I think that one who appreciates film legend and lore needs to take a look at this offering,for the sights and sounds are as true and necessary to the progression of film horror and melodrama as any from the ""Golden age of film"".",Dracula

Of course, the fact that I watched the superior (but not by much I'm afraid) Spanish version right afterwards doesn't help I'm afraid because it makes the gaps in the film even wider.

109,TheUnknown837-1,this is one of the finest horror movies ever made,10,25 October 2009,"A friend of mine once said that there are three types of movie vampires. There are the ""scary vampires"", such as Count Orlok from ""Nosferatu"", there's ""sparkly vampires"" like from ""Twilight"", and there's the ""cool vampires"" and under that category, there's only one name that comes to mind: Bela Lugosi.Lugosi may have tragically ended his career making some of the worst, most laughably bad productions of all time under deservedly infamous names such as Ed Wood, but for a while, he stood in the golden arches of Hollywood and nowhere else is this more evident than his iconic portrayal of Bram Stoker's famous vampire Dracula in this 1931 masterpiece of the same name. Who can forget Lugosi walking down the great steps of a rundown Transylvanian castle, hair sleeked back, clad in dark robes, a candle in one hand, a pale face, grinning, and announcing himself with deliberate hesitations and exaggerated pronunciation: ""I amDracula."" Or maybe: ""I never drinkwine."" Evidently, nobody can forget since basically every conception of a vampire, whether on stage or film or simply in the imagination mirrors Lugosi's performance in ""Dracula."" This is one of the most influential and popular horror movies of all time. Now does it still terrify audience members as its advertisements claimed? No. No, Lugosi is not scary and I'm not quite sure he ever was. But if there is one thing that he is and most certainly always was, that is awesome. He's a spiffy, cool, groovy vampire who does not come across as unintentionally funny. He won't terrify you, he won't make you laugh unless he wants to, but he will keep you entertained because he's such a terrific screen presence.In short, yes, Lugosi is the primer behind ""Dracula"", but the movie's reasons for sheer entertainment do not stop there. ""Dracula"" works so well and has aged so well simply because it is a great movie. The only regret I have about the movie is that it's only seventy-five minutes long, a common running time for films its age. And during that brief length of time, one finds the most terrific levels of absorbing entertainment. The screenplay is very well-written, the acting by the supporting cast especially by Edward Van Sloan as Professor Van Helsing is terrific, the camera-work is eye candy, the editing is absolutely fabulous. The special effects are a mixed bag. Sometimes you can tell the bats are nothing more than props on strings as they bobble up and down while hovering, but since this consumes only a few seconds of screen time, it's hardly a detractor.""Dracula"" is so well made that to add a music score to its fabulous images really seems distracting. During its age, soundtracks were mostly prohibited since the invention of sound was brand new in the film industry. Looking back on the old films, there are some that seem in desperate need of an imposed musical score. A score was recently composed for ""Dracula"" and provided for as an option of the DVD release, but to put it over seems to detract from the movie, not strengthen it. Because the movie is nearly impeccable on its own with its acting, cinematography, dialogue, and sheer entertainment. This is one of the finest horror movies ever made.",Dracula
110,Stephen_A_Abell,Lugosi Is Dracula And Still Watchable Today.,7,17 December 2019,"TheSTORY-1.5This is still one of the better-abridged versions of the Bram Stoker Novel. Hamilton Deane, John Balderston, & Garrett Fort take the major elements of the story and intertwine them into a tale that is still enjoyable today. Though there's not much difference between the characters it's the supporting cast that adds power and interest. The Renfield character is especially well crafted. As is the Porter who watches over the asylum.theDIRECTION-1.75This has to be one of the better-constructed horror films I've watched. Tod Browning and Karl Freund are masters of composition. Each shot appears to be thought out perfectly. The opening sequence in the horse-drawn coach through the mountains. Though these are painted, they still have an overbearing and ominous feel. Then when we enter the dilapidated Castle Dracula the long shot shows how large it is and how dark. Even in the scene where Mina has been transformed and is talking to her fiance John Harkness, even though it's a basic shot and angle it's composed so you can see the hunger and lust in her eyes when John turns his head.The best scenes though are the iconic light bar across Dracula's hypnotic gaze and Renfield, laughing maniacally, at the bottom of the steps of the ships hold, surrounded by coffins and darkness.theTEMPO-1This is the letdown of the film as everything is filmed at a steady stroll. Though the lighting and scenery build the atmosphere and the acting drives the tension, especially Lugosi's, a change in pace could have added so much more.theACTING-1.25Though, not the best there are some nice parts. The scene with Mina and John would not have been so good if Helen Chandler could not have pulled off the look she gives John's naked neck. And though people have said Lugosi is wooden I actually like his portrayal. The scene where Dracula and Van Helsing face-off is very well acted. If Lugosi stared at me in this fashion I would probably do whatever he asked... or run a mile - even if it meant going Looney-Tunes through a wall. But Van Helsing meets the stare and wins, Edward Van Sloan throws in a couple of nice touches. You can palpably feel the angst on his face and then he adds a tremble and a rocking motion before taking a hesitant step forward... then centres himself and steps back. These little things only add to the movie, the character, and the story.theGRATIFICATION-1.25Though this is a highly enjoyable film and every horror fan should watch it at least once in their lifetime, be warned that the ending is weak. I won't tell you why because you shouldn't miss this treat just because of the ending. The horror channel has just played this one and I have to admit I forgot how good it is. I remember watching it on BBC2 on their Friday night horror slot back in the mid-eighties.

111,telegonus,Beware the Borgo Pass!,8,28 October 2001,"The 1931 Tod Browning Dracula is a mess of an early talkie, with some very fine and some dreadfully awful things in it. It's probably unfair to judge it by today's standards, but it's slow going even for a film of its time, and more interesting as a sort of Rorschach for filmgoers, by which I mean if one can sit through and enjoy this film one will probably like old movies; if not, not.As the picture that launched the horror cycle of the thirties, and made a mega-star out of Bela Lugosi, the film does not disappoint in its first twenty minutes or so. The scenes set in Transylvania are obviously back-lot recreations, and rather crude in the bargain, yet for this very reason evocative and creepy, their very stiffness and formality suggest an alernate nightmare reality of the sort young film-makers really ought to study, as no amount of high-tech CGI stuff can do this. It takes real real talent and ingenuity, not tricks, to make a scary movie.Once Renfield travels beyond the Borgo Pass, to Dracula's castle, the movie starts to hum, as the castle's dank and cobwebbed interior is exceedingly uninviting, and one wonders why poor Renfield stays there at all. The quick cutting, from the castle to ship at sea to the arrival in England, is both jarring and surprisingly effective. Once on dry land, though, things get bogged down. The last part of the picture is, alas, the worst, bogged down in melodrama and some very stiff acting.For all this, and the film's genteel conclusion, Dracula is well worth seeing. Lugosi's performance as the Count suggests at times someone in a night school class struggling with an English as a second language course, which is not necessarily wrong for the character, as Dracula is indeed a stranger in a strange land. Helen Chandler's zombie-like and fragile performance suggests that she was in a kind of trance before she met the Count, but no matter, as perhaps this is what appeals to him about her. Dwight Frye's playing of the cackling and vermin-eating Renfield is a triumph, and saves the film's second half from boredom, as the screen catches fire whenever he in on board. Hardly thrilling by today's standards, Dracula none the less has charm to spare; as its slow, ritualized unfolding give various of its key scenes the eerie effect of tableaux, wholly appropriate to the film's intentions.",Dracula
112,Richie-67-485852,Keep the Count,10,4 October 2017,"Yes to this movie, Count Dracula and the beginning of Universals entry into the monster movie genre. Well done first and foremost to all involved and a special mention to Bela Lugosi who left his ""mark"" (pun) in the Dracula world never to be dismissed or surpassed for its time. Vampires are not stupid. The Count here benefits from being alive longer than most men therefore he is experienced about what he does and how to exert his will over others. I suppose it gets easier over time too. He is a focused fellow i.e. making friends and then drinking their blood and he is very good at it. One guy stumbles on him, his world and his weakness and becomes his nemesis. They both acknowledge this and it is game-on. The dead versus the living is played out well here with both having a high confidence level to win. Enjoy the simplicity of this movie and the story of which I highly recommend you read. BTW...the surrounding countryside people-folk are not fooled about what is going on but neither do they have the courage to do anything about it except pray, seek garlic and wolf bane and of course don't go out at night. Good movie to eat a sandwich but watch the drink choice if you get my drift. Stay with clear liquids here.",Dracula
113,Beta_Gallinger,A severely disappointing Dracula movie,5,22 December 2007,"Prior to seeing this 1931 adaptation of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", I had seen the 1922 adaptation of the story, F.W. Murnau's ""Nosferatu"", as well as the 1931 adaptation of ""Frankenstein"", both of which did not fail to please. It seems this version of ""Dracula"" was the first popular one after ""Nosferatu"", and came out the same year as the first full-length adaptation of ""Frankenstein"", so it's hard not to compare this horror film to those two, and sadly, this one cannot compete.Renfield, a real estate agent, travels through the Carpathian mountains to the castle of Count Dracula to complete the Count's purchase of a home in London, England, despite warnings about the dangers of going to the Borgo Pass any time between dusk and dawn! What Renfield doesn't know is that Count Dracula is a vampire! While at the castle, the real estate agent is drugged by the vampire and becomes his slave! After Dracula arrives in London, he soon sucks the blood of Lucy Weston and successfully turns her into a vampire! After this, his next victim is Mina Seward! Technology has obviously come a long way in the past 76 years, and I realize that horror films from the early 1930s can seem very tame compared to more contemporary films of the genre. However, seeing 1931's ""Frankenstein"" and 1933's ""The Invisible Man"", I also realize that they could do better than this at the time. This 1931 adaptation of ""Dracula"" is almost painfully listless, and sometimes mildly suspenseful, but rarely. It also has pretty much no musical score whatsoever, apart from during the opening and closing of the film, the acting is fairly weak (at least early on in the film), and the way some of the characters talk slowly is ridiculous! Horror films from around the time this one was released are obviously not the same to today's viewers as they were to their original audiences, but even with that in mind, this early movie adaptation of ""Dracula"" is disappointing. I had fairly high expectations when I rented it, but they were far from reached! Compared to the likes of other horror films from the '20s and '30s that I've seen, this one seems awfully amateurish. In conclusion, if you haven't seen this film, then even if you are a fan of old horror cinema in general, don't be surprised if you find this particular film disappointing!",Dracula
114,gftbiloxi,The Jewel In The Crown of Classic Universal Horror DVDs,10,21 April 2005,"This DVD is the ""Jewel in the Crown"" of the classic Universal horror films released in that format. It includes a quality print of the Bella Lugosi Dracula, with options to play the film with Philip Glass' recent soundtrack; the so-called ""Spanish"" Dracula starring Carlos Villarias; and a fascinating documentary hosted by Carla Laemmle, who has a bit role in the Lugosi Dracula and who was niece to Universal studio head Carl Laemmle. There is also an audio track by David J. Skal, production notes, and the like.The Lugosi Dracula is somewhat problematic. Dracula had been previously (and illegally) filmed as the silent NOSFERATU, and a later stage adaptation proved a staple of the British theatre. When the stage play at last arrived in New York, the title role fell to Bela Lugosi. Although Universal optioned the material, studio head Carl Laemmle was not enthusiastic about it; although European films were comfortable with the supernatural, American films were not, and Laemmle did not believe the public would accept such an irrational story. Nor was Laemmle interested in Lugosi; if Dracula was to be filmed, it would be filmed with Lon Chaney.When Chaney died the screen role went to Lugosi by default, but there were further issues. Originally planned as a big-budget production, the deepening Great Depression made the film's box office possibilities seem even slighter than before and its budget was cut to the bone. And Todd Browning, who had been such a successful director of the macabre in the silent era, proved clumsy with sound. The resulting film was more than a little clunky--but it had two things going for it: a superior first thirty minutes and Lugosi. Although Lugosi's performance may seem excessively mannered by today's standards, audiences of the 1930s found it terrifying--and even today, when the character of Dracula comes to mind, we are more likely to think of Lugosi than other actor that later played the role.For a brief time after the advent of sound, several studios made foreign language versions of their productions. The ""Spanish"" Dracula was one such film, and when the English language company wrapped for the day the Spanish speaking cast arrived and filmed through the night using the same sets. This gave the Spanish company the benefit of hindsight: they were perfectly aware of what the English language company was doing, and they deliberately set out to best it. The result is a somewhat longer, more cohesive film with some of the most arresting visuals and camera work of the early sound era. But unfortunately, star Carlos Villarias was no Bella Lugosi: although much of his performance was more subtle than Lugosi's, it was also less intimidating, and where today Lugosi seems mannered, Villarias seems unfortunately comic. In a perfect world, we would be able to insert the Lugosi performance into the ""Spanish"" Dracula. As it is, we are left with two deeply flawed but nonetheless fascinating films.In their own ways, both films proved incredibly influential, and it is difficult to imagine the evolution of the classic-style horror film without reference to both the Lugosi and the ""Spanish"" Dracula. The Lugosi film is not perfectly restored, but the print is very, very good, easily the best I have seen. The ""Spanish"" Dracula has more problematic elements, partly due the fact that the film borrowed some scenic footage from the Lugosi version and snips of footage from earlier films (there even appears to be a brief clip of the ballet from the silent PHANTOM OF THE OPERA in the film); the film is sometimes dark, sometimes very spotted, but short of a cgi restoration this is probably as good as it gets.The Philip Glass soundtrack, which is optional, tends to divide viewers. The Lugosi Dracula had virtually nothing in the way of soundtrack; the ""Spanish"" Dracula used music to a greater degree, but even so that degree is comparative. The Glass score is often quite interesting, but it is also as often intrusive as it is effective. Some feel it adds quite a bit to the film; others find it distracts. Whatever one's reaction to the film, either English or Spanish language, or with or without the Glass score, this is a remarkable DVD package, and fans of classic horror will find it an almost inexhaustible pleasure. I cannot recommend it too strongly.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Dracula
115,johno-21,Creepy classic,9,27 April 2006,"I've seen this many times throughout the years and also have the version with the music score that was added in 1999 by film composer Phillip Glass and I do like the music he added to it. Based on the Braqm Stoker this film version was adapted from the 1927-1928 Broadway play. Bela Lugosi reprises his role from the stage play written by Hamilton Dean and John L. Balderson as Dracula in this film version and Herbert Bunston reprises his role to film of Dr. Steward from the same play. Director Tod Browning was successful in a number of films he directed in the horror genre in the Devil Doll and Mark of the Vampire. He also directed the unusual film about circus freak show performers called Freaks. Browning got his directing start in the early days of silent film and was also a successful writer and had written the story The Hypnotist that he adapted to the Lon Chaney film London After Midnight. Chaney was to star as Dracula in this film but he died before the film began and Browning turned to the original Broadway star of the play, Lugosi to star in the film. the role of course made Lugosi a household name but typecast him in the role and similar vampire roles for the rest of his career. Austrian-born cinematographer Karl Friend who had a long career as a cinematographer, director and producer photographed this film. He had come from the German Expressionist movement of film-making and had photographed Fritz Lang's Metropolis among many others. his career would include such films as The Good Earth, Camille, conquest, Key Largo and The Pride and the Prejudice and he received several Academy Award nominations and also went on to be an innovator in television film. As a director Freund directed the classic The Mummy. Among the cast are Helen chandler, David Manners, Dwight Frye and Francis Dade. This is a creepy classic and a trend setter in sophisticated horror and did much to re energize the Dracula story and I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.",Dracula
116,rupie,does not age well,5,5 September 2016,"This movie is of course a classic, and it provided us with the deathless image of Bela Lugosi as the eternal archetype of Dracula. I saw it as a child on a double feature with Frankenstein and couldn't sleep that night. However, I had a chance to see it again on TCM after many years of not having seen it, and it just doesn't stand up well. There are of course the classic Lugosi lines - ""this is very old wine"", ""children of the night"", ""I never drink ..... wine"", etc. etc. - as well as Dwight Frye's memorable portrayal of Renfield, and Edward van Sloan's as Van Helsing. But the acting styles - remember, this was 1931 - put one in mind of Victorian melodrama, with its stylized gestures and delivery. There is also, as others have mentioned, the cheap props and the poor editing, as well as the deviations from the novel (where's Lucy Westenra?). I would add also the out-of-place attempts at humor (e.g., the bee leaving miniature casket - what's that about?). There also the biggest flub of all. We are asked to believe a ship ""drifts into port"" - huh? - with the entire crew dead and the pilot lashed to the wheel, and the three ""boxes"" aboard are delivered to the addressee without any examination of the contents?? Puh-leez. Oh well. The best part of the flick is that without it we wouldn't have Mel Brook's wonderful parody ""Dracula; dead and loving it.""",Dracula

It's more than a little dated of course, so there's no blood/biting or on-screen death or murder, plus the acting is very theatrical at times, and there's quite a few long drawn-out sections of total silence that highlight exactly how old and pioneering it is.With that said, all horror fans should watch this at least once, as it does make a great late-night Halloween movie that will live on - just like the old count himself - forever.",Dracula

119,jluis1984,Horror enters gloriously into the sound era...,9,30 August 2006,"In 1928, Laemmle, Sr. made his son, Carl, Jr. head of Universal City Studios as a 21st birthday present. While this was undoubtedly an act of nepotism, it started the modernization of the Studio and just as the sound films was becoming the norm rather than the rule, Laemmle Jr. began the production of a horror film based on one of the most important horror novels of all times: Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"". Directed by Tod Browning, ""Dracula"" would be the beginning of the Universal Horror era, and the film that would make Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi an immortal icon of the genre.While the film was the first official ""Dracula"" in film (F. W. Murnau was unable to obtain the rights to the story for his 1922 silent horror ""Nosferatu, Eine Symphonie Des Grauens""), several financial problems and the Great Depression truncated Laemmle's dreams of making a faithful adaptation, so writer Garret Fort adapted the ""Dracula"" play written by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston, which already had been a success in Broadway. The play was less faithful to the novel, but the core story was still there, Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi) is an ancient Transylvanian vampire who, aided by his new servant Renfield (Dwight Frye), moves to London looking for young blood. There he'll meet Prof. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), a man of science who is decided to stop Dracula.An experienced director of silent films, Tod Browning was already known for his taste for macabre and irreverent stories. Along with actor Lon Chaney he had directed horror classics like ""London After Midnight"", ""The Unknown"" and ""The Unholy Three"" so the genre was not new to him. ""Dracula"" shows Browning going for a more mature and serious Gothic horror (it's for the most part void of comedy), showing a Count Dracula that is at the same time charming and terrifying. Just like his Count, the imagery he crafts is beautifully haunting, with the static shots and the lack of musical score enhancing this unnatural feeling of being stuck in time, pretty much like vampires do.Personally, the adaptation of the play version is not a favorite of mine (as it omits interesting supporting characters and situations), but considering the film's budget and the time the film was done it's quite fitting. The main problem I saw was that other than Van Sloan's Van Helsing, the ""heroes"" are very weak, and underdeveloped, with John Harker (David Manners) being the most damaged character. Still, the plot is quite well written and the essence of Dracula is still there.Three actors in this film have become legendary, and not without a reason, as Lugosi, Van Sloan and Frye completely own the film. Bela Lugosi is fantastic in the role that would become his own personal curse, portraying the Count with the dignity required for an ancient nobleman and the savage sex appeal of a vampire predator. Van Sloan is equally effective, as the scientist that represents the good values and moral of Victorian society. Finally, Dwight Frye gives the best performance of the film as the deranged Renfield, easily stealing every scene he is in. The rest of the cast is a mixed bag, ranging from OK to bad, although a lot of it can be blamed on the script that focuses entirely in Dracula's fight against Van Helsing.Tod Browning's ""Dracula"" is a classic without a doubt, but it's far from flawless. The static look of the film at times feel too stagy, and Browning is definitely not entirely familiar with the sound era (he would overcome this in the superior ""Freaks""). The poor acting of some members of the cast is another little flaw, although in the end Lugosi and Frye make up for it. Honestly, the big turn off is not exactly related to the film itself, the main problem is that nowadays there have been countless versions of Dracula that this one may look dated to modern fans of the genre.While not the first ""Dracula"" (Murnau's film can claim that title), this film opened the gates to a new era of horror, and brought it to a wider audience that finally accepted it. Flawed and maybe dated by now, ""Dracula"" still holds up a certain unnatural magic that lures audiences worldwide, surrendered to the Count's charm and willing to do his bid. A very recommended classic. 9/10",Dracula
120,The_Movie_Cat,"""There are far worse things awaiting man than death.""",6,15 May 2001,"Yeah, and this film is one of them. Is this really the original vampire classic, the one against which all others are judged? Well I guess it must have been good at the time.
WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERSIn fairness the version I got to see was one where a music score by Philip Glass was added. The modern strings jar badly with the creaky old picture, subconsciously distancing you from the action. In fact, they go together like Keanu Reeves and a decent acting performance.Continuing the Universal tradition of an abrupt set-up, meandering middle and uncertain end, the opening rushes through a plethora of folktales and crucifixes. Maybe it was subtle at the time, but poor old Renfield (Dwight Frye) can't walk an inch without someone telling him the owners of the Count's castle are vampires. Much of this is due to its age, a factor for which it cannot be criticised. So I won't mention the obvious studio backdrops for exterior locations, the rubbish ""shaking carriages"" and pathetic bats on string. There, that's that settled then.The direction is staid and rigidly blocked, and it's generally acknowledged that the simultaneously recorded Spanish version is technically far superior. However, the saving grace of this picture is said to be Bela Lugosi in the titular role. With a performance clearly indebted to the silent era (we even get an on-screen caption seventeen minutes in) Lugosi creeps about like Max Schreck, possessing all the insidious menace of Julian Clary. Anyway, turns out old Drac can't go anywhere without someone shining a spotlight in his eyes, a fact which drives him to drink the blood of all and sundry. (Though to the film's credit, the only blood you see is a cut thumb, the rest is all implied). Look out for the scene where he glares balefully at Lucy in the royal box - doesn't he look like he's suffering from constipation? Dracula is eventually defeated by a stake through the heart. Steak? I would've thought ham was more appropriate...It's the sort of thing that could have been superb under the reins of James Whale, his direction moulding it into the camp classic it cries out to be. As it is, it seems to be one long exercise in melodrama, with Charles Gerrard chucking in a cod Cockney to Frye's wild-eyed vamp victim.There are some brilliant moments though. Like when Lugosi (Despite the campness, superbly charming) is seen, or rather not seen, through a mirror. And while not standing up with the best of the studio's output, its iconography puts it well above the usual conveyor belt fare. Ending sees Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) staying behind in the crypt with a (""Aren't you coming?"") ""Not yet. Presently."" Why does he stay behind? What does he have to do that the others cannot see? It's not implied or resolved, causing the conclusion to feel less like an ending, more the film grinding to a premature halt. 6/10.",Dracula

122,jem132,Blood Lust,8,9 July 2006,"One of the true greats in the horror genre, Browning's 1931 version of 'Dracula' is now showing it's age horribly, yet the atmosphere of the production and Lugosi's chilling performance make it work for a modern audience.This was the role Lugosi would never break free of (and he seemed to revel in his notoriety - he was buried in a black cape!), and he is infinitely memorable as the blood-lusting Count Dracula. Lugosi's stilted, Hungarian accent delivers the film's best lines, such as 'I am Dracula...I bid you welcome', and 'I never drink...wine'. It is a creaky, theatrical performance, but a startlingly effective one just the same. Two pencil-spot-lights were aimed at Lugosi's eyes to increase the intensity of his hypnotic stare, and it is a lethal one indeed.Lugosi's performance is also slightly seductive- there is something strangely sexy about those swishing capes and thirst for blood. I believe Stoker intended the character to have that effect in his 1897 novel, and Browning and Lugosi convey the attraction here. After all, isn't Dracula representative of what we all supposedly lust after- eternal life? Religious imagery abounds in this production, with Lugosi's 'seduction' of Frye revolving around an offering of bread and wine. Lugosi also shirks away at the sight of a cross. It is interesting to note that Lugosi's 'taking' of Frye's character almost didn't make it to the screen. Censors considered it too openly suggestive and homo-erotic, yet the scene remains intact today despite many clumsy edits being applied to the film.Dwight Frye, best known for his role as the dim-witted Fritz in Frankenstein (1931) plays another sidekick here as Renfield, and, like Lugosi, it is a role he was born to play. The pair provide most of the film's classic moments (and a homo-erotic subtext), along with Edward Van Sloan as Dracula's nemesis, Van Helsing. Chandler and Manners are attractive as the young lovers, yet their wooden performances rival the stake plunged through Dracula's heart.The mood and tone achieved by Browning makes the film a classic- the visuals are superb. Shadowy lighting, swirling fog, crawling possums (Yes, not rats-possums! Censors considered rats a no-no), cobwebs and passages of sinister silence where things are seen and not heard build this to an intensity rarely seen in modern horror films.Dracula's Transylvanian castle and 'undead' brides provide one of the most memorable moments in film- the zombie-like females walking (or is it floating?) to a collapsed Renfield, only to be gestured away by their master.The Universal Special Edition DVD is a treat to watch, as we learn of some fascinating trivia. One wonders, after hearing the commentary, about supposed'horror genius' Browning's overall contribution to the product. There are some strange, stilted scenes that appear to have no direction. Most notably, Lugosi is photographed terribly (he looks more like a midget than an imposing vampire) in one particular shot, a piece of cardboard barely obscures a light, and Manners seems to be standing around waiting for something to happen in many a scene. The footage of a ship flailing wildly at sea was actually taken from a silent film, so that accounts for the jerkiness in one shot.It's said that the Spanish version is technically superior, but that may well be because censorship didn't apply to non-domestic product from Universal. An important chapter in film history, and an entertaining one, too.",Dracula

Lugosi lacks some of the scary physical properties of other actors such as the 'unofficial' silent film version actor Max Schrek, even Christopher Lee's later incarnation of the character many years later.The 'new' sound technology allows Lugosi's broken English 'Cheeldren of the naight...' being a classic example.Nosefaratu cinematographer Karl Freund brings some of his experience of German Expressionist shadows to the film.The sets are shadowy.

127,elvircorhodzic,"""I am...Dracula."" ""I bid You...welcome.""",7,27 March 2016,"Dracula (1931) is a film that offers a little bit of everything, but at the end of a lot of things missing. The film is empty in a strange way. The film abounds with metaphysics at the expense of physics. I can not imagine such a horror in today's conditions. I think the director is not particularly bothered. Sound and special effects are beautifully evoked, but not innovative at all. But he created a classic that is not a bad movie.The first part of the film is quite interesting. The phenomenon of Dracula is amazing. Counts castle looks really creepy, but the real horror is missing. The camera is slow and framing are not very good.The second part of the film goes into slow play situations, which every now and then interrupted some horror moment. All material Production and costume design, elements of metamorphosis, disgust of the Cross, invisible in the mirror wrapped in a dark appearance of the character of Count Dracula in the chamber atmosphere from which he emerges from his coffin; all this was raised to the top level by omitting the use of music and Gothic sounds, creaking, rustling, twisting wind and the howling of wolves. Everything that develops, runs silent, the cold conversation that alternate with the image darkness and dense social flirting and compliments.Bela Lugosi (Count Dracula) is such a great character. However, his acting is quite questionable. The appearance is amazing, but what comes after that is pretty empty. I am one of the few who considered his performance as average. I wonder how he felt Lugosi because he did not excel in the role of life.Dwight Frye (Reinfield) is disgusting, sycophant and loyal subordinate toddler who eats flies and vermin. Frye saved movie. Its performance is considered as excessive. I think that his performance is excellent. Watching this film is really tempting. The film will not appeal to everyone, especially not to a wide audience.

128,artzau,Goood Evvenning. I'm...Drracoola.,9,30 October 2004,"Hey, it's still the best of the lot. Lugosi who was Hungarian, hailed from Lugos which is a Hungarian enclave in, yep, Transylvania. Much ink has washed over the Dracula myth, much of it pure crap. But, Lugosi, always a great actor, brought the suave, urbane character to the Count, which was a radical departure from Stoker's book. The seemingly hokey lines and over-dramatized presentation in the film reflects the stylized performance Lugosi brought to the film from his stage role. Now, the opera cape, the tux and evil leer are part and parcel of the Dracula image which has become indelibly stamped in everyone's mind. Lugosi's accent, so prominent in this film, was so pronounced as he was only partially conversant in English at the time. There's no question that this film has legs. It still has the creepy Gothic effect on me and I've watched it dozens of times, since my first viewing of it as a kid in the early 40s. Hey, it was old then!

129,Prichards12345,The first supernatural sound horror film made in Hollywood,9,8 August 2017,"The term ""horror film"" believe it or not, wasn't invented until Dracula, a huge box office hit, forced Universal Studios into an announcement from their publicity department that they were making ""another horror film"" to follow it. This, of course, would be Frankenstein.86 years on the impact Dracula had upon its first audiences is difficult to understand - we live, after all, in an age of blood, gore and sadistic horror. What would 1931 viewers have made of Hostel? Dracula remains the Grandaddy of all US horror films, earlier movies like Phantom Of The Opera lack the crucial element of supernaturalism that so intrigued viewers upon first release - Dracula really WAS a vampire, not some police inspector dressing up as in London After Midnight. Its opening reels are eerily magnificent, as we accompany innocent traveller Renfield (Dwight Frye) through the Transylvanian countryside, arriving at Castle Dracula in his bat-driven coach to deliver the deeds to Carfax, an old abbey in England, to the most infamous Hungarian nobleman of all time. We know what's in store for poor Dwight, as we have already glided softly through the castle to alight at Dracula's coffin as he emerges, brides in tow, to prepare for the arrival of his guest.In the opening twenty minutes the template for the horror film is laid out for all to see - the moody atmosphere, supernaturalism alive and well in our world, and the superstitious villagers' mounting dread as they discover Renfield's destination. It's a superb beginning, from the stately camera-work of Karl Freund to the man in black pacing regally down the stairs of his castle to greet his visitor; and his chilling opening line: ""I am...Dracula. I bid you welcome!"" Bela Lugosi has become for millions around the globe the definitive vampire. The role he was born to play: he makes the most of it, all leering smiles,looming presence, penetrating stares and his old European cadence used to disturbing effect. Lugosi is more suggestive of evil than a thousand modern psycho-slashers. And many of the lines he is given are horror film classics.It's a great shame that the rest of the movie does not live up to this opening, which adapts the American stage play rather than Stoker's book. Once the action moves to Dr. Seward's asylum the film becomes static and talky, with shots held for far too long on several occasions. Tod Browning, the director, reportedly lost interest a few weeks into the production and turned over many chores to Freund. Yet Dracula's drawing room confrontation with Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) holds the interest, and you simply can't take your eyes of Bela.I viewed this film again recently after a gap of about 7 years, and in spite of its creakiness I found myself thoroughly absorbed.Ignore the dim playing of David Manners and Helen Chandler in the romantic parts and just enjoy Dwight Frye's OTT yet strangely effective Renfield, and Lugosi, still working his hypnotism with fine aplomb. Watch it late at night, with the lights out, let its strange pacing and macabre atmosphere take grip, and it will still hold you in thrall. Horror fans owe it so much. It was the first of many Universal horrors, and we owe it a great deal.",Dracula
130,Hayden-86055,Constantly grim black and white classic,7,14 January 2021,"A good adaption of Bram Stoker's novel, Lugosi is definitely the best part of the film and outshines every other actor by far. The script takes some liberties with the novel, such as changing Renfield's role and minimising Jonathan Harker's as well as changing the ending omitting a lot of scenes in the castle. This is done for pacing reasons presumably, although I found some scenes such as the opera scene unnecessary and others badly handled, there's actually very little in the film of Dracula being evil.Cinematography wise it is quite good, some shots I feel go on for too long and do not focus on their target, but old films often do this and there are very few scenes which I felt were badly produced. I don't think the film is amazing by any means, but it's certainly well developed and a strong classic.7/10: Worth a watch for Bela Lugosi alone",Dracula
131,vostf,Too bad...,2,3 February 2002,Today people laugh at that Dracula. Bela Lugosi is a joke of a vampire and every close-up on his stiff-glared face echoes ridiculous.The movie itself is a harsh end-to-end editing of key scenes from the novel. That's why there's no inner breath hampering boredom. Eventually it's the worst Dracula I have ever seen.

132,DarthVoorhees,"""Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make!""",10,22 September 2011,"""Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make!"" so said Bela Lugosi in what was to be the role that cemented him as a pop culture icon of American film. To see director Todd Browning's original 1931 adaptation of Dracula is to see the American horror film at its finest. Dracula is the vampire formula at its purest before it could be diluted by the telling and the retelling. Dracula is a surreal experience as Browning takes us with him on a journey into our fear of death, but also our fear of the filthiness of sex. It is a film that has aged like a good wine which Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula swore to never drink.If one were to try and dissect Todd Browning's Dracula to find a sole element of success the search would lead us time and time again to Bela Lugosi. Dracula simply is not Dracula without Lugosi's portrayal of the Count. So much credit has to be given to Lugosi and his portrayal of the titular character. It is doubtful this film would have the staying power, or the atmosphere that it has if another actor was portraying Count Dracula. Lugosi's performance and how it succeeds is the marriage of so many factors, but arguably Lugosi's greatest asset to his performance would have to be his rich Hungarian accent. Lugosi surprisingly doesn't get much dialogue in the film as much of the exposition comes from the protagonist Professor Van Helsing played by Edward Van Sloan, and Dracula's slave Renfield played by Dwight Frye. The lines Lugosi does deliver are often extremely concise. It is not the lines themselves, but rather the way Lugosi delivers them that creates this character. How Lugosi delivers the lines offers more insight into this character than any detailed dissection of the character could. Lugosi's lines are read almost phonetically, each word one by one, each little nuance of the language stressed in Lugosi's thick Hungarian dialect. The resulting effect is hypnotic, poetic, frightening, and in many ways very sad. Lugosi's introduction is in my humble opinion one of the strongest scenes in motion picture history almost solely based on the delivery of the line ""I am... Dracula"". The scene follows Renfield, a solicitor whom Dracula will drive mad, as he ventures through Dracula's dilapidated castle searching for the Count. Dracula appears out of the shadows sucking in whatever air Renfield could muster in these catacombs of death by merely saying ""I amDracula."" Lugosi's delivery is as much a part of the aging castle trapped in time as the cobwebs are. Lugosi was so suave and mysterious as Dracula that the audience became attracted to the vampire. Dracula is not merely Lugosi's picture though. The film has a strong supporting cast highlighted by actor Edward Van Sloan, and Dwight Frye. One thing that can be said of Dracula's entire cast is that despite the extreme material no one even comes close to going over the top with their role. The amount of sincerity and the absence of any tongue in cheek aspect of performance are to be admired. Sloan and Frye's characters both had the potential to skate towards over the top territory, but both performances are firmly grounded in reality and are very effective in complimenting Lugosi's Dracula.Dwight Frye is very strong as Renfield. The role is as complex as that of the Count. Renfield is a bipolar madman enslaved to do Dracula's bidding. Frye is asked to exhibit behaviors on all forms of the spectrum. This character and the characterization are unpredictable to the extreme. One constant about Renfield is that he is the predator, and he represents the fear of sexuality within the vampire mythos. Frye's facial expressions are other worldly especially when we see the extent of Renfield's madness. There is a scene where Renfield crawls with vulture eyes towards a housemaid who has fainted by the sight of his very appearance. Frye too is asked to deliver insight into a character despite the fact that the lines don't explicitly offer character exposition or development. Renfield's dialogue mainly consists of nonsensical lunatic ravings. The way Frye delivers the lines and how he builds the intensity is really powerful though. It is these build up of the madness that keeps this character effective.Technically Dracula isn't all that impressive a picture from a cinematographer's standpoint, but does it really need to be? Browning is very cautious about what he wants to do with his camera. Much of the film is very static and offers little to no movement of the camera. What Browning captures in his shots though are really powerful images. The amount of attention given to the detail of each shot truly is amazing. The fact is there is not one shot of Bela Lugosi blinking in the entire film; that shows an incredible commitment. Browning is more of a still photographer than he is a cinematographer, but the power of the images is unmistakably there. This static dream-like world is perfect for the subject material.It may hurt the pacing a tad, but an argument can be made that the audience are much better able to appreciate Bela Lugosi, and even Dwight Frye's performance due to the way Browning stages his picture. Browning's appreciation for the hypnotic quality of images is one of the strengths of the film, not one of the weaknesses.Dracula is a masterpiece of film making. The film still offers a hypnotic experience almost 80 years after Bela Lugosi first uttered ""I amDracula"". It is a film that has only gotten better with age. Todd Browning and Bela Lugosi succeeded in creating a surreal picture where vampires do exist.",Dracula
133,Darkside-Reviewer,"""Goodnight!... Mr Renfield""",8,28 March 2021,"There's little to be said about the 1931 classic, Dracula that hasn't already been said countless times before, throughout various reviews and documentaries over the past ninety years.I always loved watching films with a gothic style to them and none could ever truly compare to the classic Universal monster movies. I was in awe of these fascinating stories of Vampire's and Werewolfs creatures that walked in the moonlight, harnessing powers beyond man. While growing up I watched all the monster movies I could get my hands on which wasn't always easy in the late 80s and 90s. Today these films can be viewed anywhere in the world online but for a kid growing up at the height of home video VHS you're only hope was finding them at your local video rental store.Dracula was the first vampire movie I ever saw it forever changed the way I looked at other horror films and Vampire's in general. Count Dracula is played to perfection by Bella Lugosi who will always be the definitive and original Count Dracula. Lugosi's unique and timeless performance as Dracula influenced the way people played other such supernatural creatures in future horror films. Today films can be easily edited and glossed over using CGI even things like voices and music can be added, edited and removed at the click of a button. Classic movies like Dracula may look and sound very dated when compared to modern day films but I urge anyone who hasn't already seen this classic film to take an hour out of your day and enjoy a film that helped pave the way for future gothic horror films and novels that you enjoy today.Dracula has become so synonymous in the world of horror that the name Dracula is the first thing most people think of after hearing the word Vampire. Over the past ninety years Vampire's in movies have changed significantly particularly over the last twenty years with movie's like Blade and Underworld. The definition of what makes a vampire, well a vampire is open to interpretation but most people agree on the basic rules on what makes a vampire, a vampire. These are of course sunlight burns and kills vampires, holy water and crosses repel and harm a vampire, a vampire casts no reflection and of course a Vampire must drink blood to sustain their immortal life. There will always be different interpretations of any popular fictional creature from Vampire's to Demons. However one thing is certainly clear to everyone and that's Vampires don't shine like a stripper who's over done it with the body glitter when in direct sunlight!.",Dracula
134,alice liddell,The first twenty minutes are absolutely stunning; the rest is largely a big snooze.,6,17 September 1999,"This is the film that began the Universal horror cycle in the 1930s that bestowed on us such gems as WHITE ZOMBIE, THE MUMMY, and, of course, the sublime-masterpieces-in-any-genre-full-stop of James Whale, so for that alone we should be grateful, as the studio may not have pursued this direction if DRACULA had not been a success.  However, there is a received opinion about the film's quality, and, as usual, the received opinion is correct.  DRACULA begins with twenty minutes of astonishing cinema, and degenerates into talky, stagy, stilted tedium.Well, when I say 'correct', I must qualify that.  There ARE great things in the second half: a deranged performance by Dwight Frye as Renfield, by far the film's most interesting character, whose plight verges on the genuinely tragic; the consistently eerie cinematography of Murnau cameraman Karl Freund, who would later direct that unaccountable miniature, MAD LOVE; a remarkable, haunting play with mirrors; a splendid finale, which forswears conventional action and thrills, in favour of beauty, poetry and chills; and especially the astonishing sequence opening with a view of Seward's Sanitorium's lawns - this placid, classical garden is suddenly disrupted by the cries of Renfield, and the camera's smooth gliding jerks into an alarming mimicing of the insect the madman is trying to catch, utterly shattering the calm of a scene which, being set in a glorified madhouse, was always waiting to be rent.Overall, however, the second half is rather dull (maybe this is a comment on the England it deals with?).  You see, the film is not based on Stoker's novel, which is amazingly cinematic, rattling along at a hurtling speed, offering a profusion of characters and scenes in disparate locales, and providing plenty of colour and frisson, as well as using proto-cinematic techniques like cross-cutting and ellipsis; but a play based on the novel, a rigid, respectable, dead thing.  The book's primary motor is sex - Dracula is not simply an Other: his desire for Mina is mirrored in the trio of her admirers; the latter's staking of Lucy Westenra is described as a horrifying gangrape rather than a righteous exorcism; the rampant homoeroticism of the book is also denied.  Instead we get one planklike lover; Seward becomes Mina's stiff father, (which, if you've read the book, does add a frisson of its own); and a rather asexual Count.The novel's tension between spanking modernity and technology, and submerged, Old World Gothic terror is ignored in DRACULA in favour of a vague Victorian fug.  The acting is almost universally (!) execrable, and, in the 'play' scenes, Browning unsurprisingly seems to lose interest.  What does remain from the book, and is actually intensified, is the link between the powers of Dracula and Van Helsing, both steeped in superstition, anti-modern lore, slightly complicating the battle between good and evil.All this is not to put you off.  Those first twenty minutes are treasurable, and unmatched in early talkie cinema, until FRANKENSTEIN at least.  Unlike Whale's awesome parodies, the opening is genuinely chilling, a terrifying trip into the unknown.  The journey to Dracula's castle is even scarier and more beautifully rendered than the otherwise superior NOSFERATU, filmed with a mixture of starkness and folk tale.  In these twenty minutes the spare, knowing, suggestive direction; the discomfiting lack of music; the evocative use of sound effects; the extraordinary set-design, dripping foreboding and evil; Lugosi's otherworldly face; the haunting and poetic use of ghostly imagery; the strange, oneiric permutations of the characters; all combine to created a dreamlike, horror masterpiece.",Dracula
135,Bababooe,"Great beginning with the villagers, castle and ship. The rest was boring.",5,26 March 2017,"Great beginning with the villagers, castle and ship. The rest was boring.Beginning with the villagers and the castle was great and the landing of the ship in England with the mad Renfield. The rest of the movie was unfortunately boring. A few scenes with Lugosi/Dracula was good, but still not great. Go watch White Zombie for a great movie with great acting and atmosphere. Storywise they represented the book in the best possible way they could. But very little atmosphere here beyond the castle scenes.Now, the Coppola Dracula 1992 was a pile of crap. That movie had a great opening scene, and music, and Gary Oldman was awesome. But the story, was and acting by all else was a pile of candy Hollywood crap.The Chris Lee Dracula was even worse than the Coppola. Lee's acting is garbage here. His first lines in the movie is about categorizing is library, not interesting, not cool, not nothing. Garbage movie.I need to review Nosferatu. I do remember it had tons of atmosphere. Without atmosphere we are left with a technical film making. Not very entertaining. There's been tons of Dracula movies. So, far we are left with Lugosi/Dracula as the best. However, it is lacking.We need a proper Dracula, non Hollywood, perhaps a 70's style Italian production, with real atmosphere, acting, blood, terror/horror.My rating is a C, or 5.",Dracula
136,TalesfromTheCryptfan,The king of all vampire movies!,10,8 November 2007,"A man named Renfield heads to Transylvania where he meets the fiendish Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi) at his castle where he the count drugs him as he's actually a vampire and turns Renfield into a slave. Later they set sail to London where Dracula strikes at night to pray upon innocent people especially a lovely girl named Lucy (Frances Dade) and seeks the blood of a woman Mina (Helen Chandler), for only her fiancée Dr. Jack Steward(Herbert Bunston) and professional hunter Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) to protect her from the count.A true masterpiece of horror! while ""Nosferatu"" (1922) is the queen of vampire movies, this happens to be the king of every vampire movie there ever was and the greatest Dracula movie ever. While some other adaptations of Bram Stoker's classic horror tale are good on film, nothing can beat this classic. Lugosi is still the best actor to play Dracula besides Christopher Lee, Frank Langella and Gary Oldman but Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula blows them all away with his charm and was born to play the character.It's an important film of the horror genre that will never grow old and be a film that will remain timeless.",Dracula
137,dr_foreman,thin-blooded,5,20 July 2004,"""Dracula"" is often hailed as a red-blooded horror classic, when in point of fact it's dull as dishwater. The opening segments work pretty well; the castle sets are gorgeous, and Lugosi's performance is suitably mesmerizing. But even during these strong scenes, Browning's flat direction often diminishes the film's impact (the rigidly shot appearance of Dracula's brides is one of many lame moments). And you can just forget it when the action shifts to - and remains too long in - Seward's sanitarium. It's unfortunate that the plot is based on the stage play and not the book, as the film's pacing is consequently quite slow and the action is too confined. I've also never been a fan of Edward Van Sloan's Van Helsing, who lacks both the warmth of Stoker's character and the energy of actors who played the part in subsequent films - most notably Peter Cushing, who was nothing like the character as written either, but who was at least charismatic and cool. The Spanish version, shot simultaneously, is better directed, but the actor playing Dracula in that film is rather too hammy. Shame, really...there isn't a definitive version of Dracula yet, despite the fact that directors are endlessly trying to churn one out.",Dracula

140,nickenchuggets,I am... Dracula,10,14 April 2021,"This horror classic retains much of its power and influence after over 90 years of praise and acclaim. Lugosi was the best Dracula ever, bar none. Old movies like this have a special quality that simply can't be put into words, but it's a kind of cozy, warm feeling that is radiated from the black and white film being projected onto the screen combined with the crackling of the actual film reel in the background. It makes the movie feel more enticing, knowing real human beings were behind it, even if some of them are playing supernatural characters. The movie is about someone named Renfield who is warned by villagers not to go to this castle owned by Count Dracula, of whom everyone is afraid. Renfield goes to the castle one day, which is predictably deserted, and Dracula reveals himself. Renfield is not yet aware that he's a vampire, but Dracula uses some kind of black magic on him that turns him into a slave and he is later found feeding on the crew of a ship. Later on, Dracula goes into the bedroom of a girl named Mina and bites her. Renfield starts to behave more and more strangely after being exposed to Dracula's influence, and Van Helsing concludes that Dracula is the vampire responsible for all the bad things happening. Later on, Mina is outside in the nighttime and tells her lover that she's now a vampire after the Count paid her a visit. At the end, Van Helsing stabs Dracula with an oak stake, killing him and freeing Mina from his vampiric slavery. There are some things to nitpick like the infamous bat on a string and the hilariously bad spider, but no matter how many years go by, this movie has and will continue to look great.",Dracula

It might not be scary exactly, but it's mesmerizing, haunting and beautiful(in that gothic way).

Having recently bought the Universal box set of 'Monsters' blu rays, I sat down to watch and.... found it dull. Yes the print restoration is incredible, but the film itself.., well now I'm older, I can see the ham from a mile off.Not taking anything away from it, it was a horror milestone, and it must have made an incredible impression in 1931, but as a film these days? No thanks. I also took a quick look at the Spanish version as Mark Gattis said it was more stylish, well the print looked even better (except the concert hall section for some reason), but no it wasn't any better and the guy playing Dracula was laughable.It'll be the 1970's BBC version I'll stick with in future.",Dracula

It was faithful, had solid characters and a strong presence of Bela Lugosi to carry the way. What I liked about this Universal Picture was that it was fast paced and never really had any dull moments. Classic movies sometimes drag and don't hold my interest entirely but I never really seemed to hit pause. I was glued from the get go from the starting opening scene in Transylvania. Renfield, played by Dwight Frye was very sufficient and creepy. The characters of Van Helsing, Dr. Seward and Mina were terrific and casted perfectly. Bela Lugosi as Dracula was of course the star of the film and spawned a long list of Universal movies for himself. The role of John Harker was annoying at times and didn't have the best dialog written for him. It's obviously a classic that all horror fans have to watch.

145,cgvsluis,Bela Legosi at his finest!,4,19 October 2020,"This film was the start of Universal Studios run of successful horror films. Apparently, Bela Legosi enjoyed playing this role so much that he is actually buried in his Dracula costume.
The film very loosely follows Bram Stoker's book, and more closely follows the play based on it that Bela Legosi had been playing in.
This Dracula is cool, refined and sophisticated. The sets are lush and over the top, and the costuming is beautiful and dramatic.
There are some lovely and haunting scenes like when the camera is behind the three brides as they walk slowly and in unison towards their potential victim, Renfield...and the scene where Dracula descends down the long staircase into the Abbey with Mina in her long flowing white dress.
The biggest drama really comes from the scary and slightly over the top portrayal of Renfield.
The one miss in this must see classic horror film is the killings by the white lady...that part of the story could have been expanded and I don't know if it was censored or not, but they never showed the killing of Lucy.
Wether you are a horror film buff, a classic film buff or just a fan of Hollywood...you should watch this film at least once.",Dracula

With this gem Universal would rule over the horror film genre for nearly twenty years, and with the possible exception of ""Frankenstein,"" ""The Wolfman"" and ""The Mummy"" never equal this first grand effort.Taken from the Hamilton Dean stage production of Bram Stoker's book the play actually was a vehicle for Dean to star as Van Helsing, the actual lead character in the play. The Broadway production brought together the two talented stars of this film who went on to bring it to the screen, Bela Lugosi (Born Bela Blasco from Lugosi in Rumania) and Edward Van Sloan (the only Dutch Actor to date who has played the Dutch professor Van Helsing.) To round out the superb performances of the cast is Dwight Frye as the tortured and maniacal ""Renfield,"" reduced to being Dracula's creature.In 1999 this wonderful horror classic was re-released with an all new music score by composer Philip Glass performed by the Chronos String Quartet, which adds to the tension of the film.

149,jldmp1,Bloodless,3,5 November 2006,"The central problem with this is not that it isn't creepy (sure, I suppose it is), or that Lugosi doesn't play the lead well (he does). The problem is how this utterly fails as a visual story...Not to be too cute with the metaphors, but instead of coming to cinematic life, this staggers about in an undead state. Not even Lugosi's uninterrupted passage through the spider webs shows much visual imagination. There were plenty of film techniques available at the time that could have broken this free from the bonds of the written word.Of all the vampire movies ever made, I would have to say the most clever one is ""The Lost Boys"". It's effective at the visual game it plays with the viewer, at how it toys with our preconceived notions and how it manages to be both dark and tongue-in-cheek. Browning's treatment is not even close to what we would call 'entertainment' today. Not all classics matter.",Dracula
150,tcchelsey,THE BEGINNING OF UNIVERSAL'S HORROR CYCLE,10,12 September 2021,"Credit director Tod Browning, after a long professional relationship with the master of horror Lon Chaney, for bringing DRACULA to the wide screen. Browning, considered the Edgar Alan Poe of movies, pitched Bram Stoker's gothic novel to producers at Universal, and naturally with the uncanny master of makeup in the lead. All was set to go until Chaney fell ill to throat cancer, and one wonders to this day how DRACULA would have been received with an American playing the very European count! The role eventually went to Bela Lugosi, who had starred in the Broadway production, but not because of this, rather, he had agreed to take a pay cut! Remarkable, to say the least! Universal actually had in mind other established Hollywood names, such as Chester Morris, but Lugosi seemed destined to play the iconic count. The second most intriguing footnote is that Lugosi was not too impressed with his role, believing it would typecast him for the rest of his career. He was right. Additionally, co-stars Helen Chandler and Edward Van Sloan thought the film was more publicity than substance, and did not think much of their roles, either! To tell you the truth, the film is slowly paced, and stagey, lets admit it, however Lugosi made the most of his portrayal (reportedly walking around the set pretending to be Dracula off camera), coupled with Browning's amazingly eerie camera angles and shots. The opening scenes with the carriage ride to Transylvania and subsequent journey to Dracula's castle are knockouts, not to mention his cobwebbed mansion (and with his assorted wives leaving their respective coffins, no less!). Let us also not forget that Browning was a top silent film director, and the scenes where there is no sound(!), are the most genuinely atmospheric, and for that matter, influential to film buffs and historians. This iconic motion picture definitely influenced a new generation of horror films to come, and defined ""vampire"", if not Count Dracula. There is a fine line to be walked here, but make no mistake that the original DRACULA (with its wrinkles!) has found a special place in cinematic history and remains recommended viewing among completists. Still one of the BEST late night views, and for all of us grown up kids at heart.",Dracula

After our blood sucking boy moves to London, however, Todd Browning's film becomes slow and creaky, yet those qualities are somehow appropriate for this story of the undead.  Whereas ""Frankenstein"" cries out for a musical score, the deathly silence throughout much of ""Dracula"" adds to its eerie ambiance.  Lugosi is simply magnificent, and Dwight Frye is almost his equal as the maniacal Renfield.  A true classic.",Dracula
152,jamesjustice-92,I am Dracula,10,14 February 2021,"Every human being had thought of immortality but not everyone considered consequences that eventually come with being immortal: what's the price to be paid for such a treasured gift as neverending life? How will it affect us and what will we become in the end? I know there are people who don't deserve even a single lifetime let alone a few - what's really important here is what we do with it and where we lead this life, to the light or towards becoming eternal children of the night. And the music they make ain't pretty, I tell you.Tod Browning's ""Dracula"" premiered 90 years ago and it was the first Universal horror flick that spawned the new wave of the genre, becoming an instant classic, successfully bringing so many other monster movies for the studio to life and making Bela Lugosi a prisoner of this one role, just like his count Dracula was a prisoner of his own coffin.Dracula has known probably way too many adaptations over the last century but this 1931 motion picture is without a doubt one of the best. Karl Freund's masterful cinematography with his slowly creeping camera, close-ups and the use of light made him the name long before this movie premiered but the possibility of working as a director, although uncredited, has allowed him to gain more experience and shine even brighter with ""The mummy"" which was his directorial debut the next year.Almost complete lack of musical score makes the viewing of ""Dracula"" a very unnerving but an unforgettable experience; it makes you feel present, listen carefully to all of the sounds and noises, all of the lines of dialogue as if you desperately grasp onto dear life yourself with your heart missing beats while you're at it.Bela Lugosi's Dracula is menacing, especially when he's silent; when he speaks he really expresses himself, pauses at just the right places and his eyes - the way they shine, not because of light added to them but the emotions, power, lust and anger - you see it all in them. Bela has done a tremendous job and made his version of count Dracula a standard that so many actors after him looked up to in amazement, with adoration and respect he wholeheartedly deserved.",Dracula
153,HenryHextonEsq,A most palatable film!,8,15 May 2001,"Yes, after the ""first two reels"", this film is less effectively baroque, but it's still heartily enjoyable stuff, even if the finale is poorly handled. Bela Lugosi's performance as the good Count is so wonderfully definitive that it seems remarkable how many other actors have subsequently donned the cape. I've not seen any of the other versions, but I suspect few could match Lugosi's hypnotic display of acting. From the wonderfully eerie, sublimely photographed Transylvania scenes to the scenes in a London theatre, Lugosi is spellbinding. While he dominates the film, others make their mark. Helen Chandler is quite good as the unfortunate Mina Seward, Dwight Frye is wonderfully mad as Renfield and Edward Van Sloan is towering as Van Helsing. Certainly, there is a contrast in tone between the two parts of the film; the first nightmarish, eerie, mesmerising and very cinematic, the second more akin to a stage play, and rather more melodramatic, but it does come together in my view, as a most effective, likeable whole. It is all immensely helped by a quite wonderfully Philip Glass score, that perfectly complements and embellishes the images. In many ways it is typical Glass, and that is no bad thing, but the atmosphere the Kronos Quartet create is just right. Rating:- ****/*****.",Dracula

Lugosi not only growls and snarls but also delivers the succulent seductive power of both evil itself and immortality--no matter what devastating consequences that immortal life may truly mean.Essential for both horror fanatics and fans of early (up to and including the 30's) cinema to own on the highest-possible quality, and regular re-watches. It's simply THAT GOOD.The fact that its American release date was Valentine's Day (its New York City premiere was two days earlier) only further hits home the fact that its immortality is due to the fact that it isn't simply a cornerstone of Gothic horror but with a vibrant love story at its very heart.",Dracula

The story is very, very good but not amazing it has its holes but is nearly perfect. The screenplay has good dialogue and characters but the best thing about it is that it understands two things, things that most horror films forget. 1. We are scared more by what we don't see. 2. Silence is often scarier than a lot of screaming and dialogue about scary stuff. The acting is horrible by most of the cast but Bela Lugosi as the infamous Count Dracula himself is amazing.

156,HelloTexas11,timelessly odd,8,12 March 2009,"Watching the 1931 version of 'Dracula' now is like watching a silent movie with occasional bits of dialogue. It is creaky, like nearly all early sound movies, and there's not even a music score (one was added nearly 70 years later.) People move slowly, there are long gaps between lines which seem unnatural. At times, the entire movie seems to be playing in slow-motion. It's hard to imagine a teenager of today sitting still long enough to watch it, much less enjoy it. But to a film buff, there is still much to enjoy and the main thing this 'Dracula' has going for it is its own peculiar, unique sense of weirdness. Bela Lugosi's vampire seems to affect the other characters without ever biting their necks. They move about as if in a daze and speak in a halting, confused manner... including Edward Van Sloane's Professor Van Helsing, who's supposed to know what's going on. Perhaps stranger than Lugosi is Dwight Frye as Renfield, with his lunatic laughter (if one could call it that). Renfield pops up in scene after scene, even after he's supposedly locked away in his room at the sanitarium. The sets are every bit as odd. The lower chambers of Dracula's castle and later Carfax Abbey are as barren as the surface of a dead planet, just dirt and pillars and a few coffins. They truly look like places no human should go, places only for rats and wolves and bats. It's hard to believe Bela Lugosi was already 49 years old when he made 'Dracula.' He looks much younger. And though he doesn't have a great deal of dialogue, his most famous lines are all here. ""I never drink... wine."" ""The children of the night... what music they make!"" ""Now that you have learned what you have learned."" Harder still to believe that Universal only had him play Dracula once more, 17 years later, in 'Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein.' As stagy and slow-moving as it is, 'Dracula' earns its reputation as an original with its many indelible images and sparse, stark dialogue. It truly is one of a small group of films that everyone should see at least once.",Dracula

160,coolantic,Deference,5,26 November 2019,"The problem with this movie is that it is impossible to watch without thinking of Mel Brookes' merciless send-up Dracula , Dead And Loving It.
Practically every scene is reproduced and played for laughs in that film. Add to this the fact that the 1931 version is based on a stage play and helmed by a man more used to directing silent films. Further, there are no oceans of blood or voluptuous maidens in diaphanous gowns. Thus the end result is unlikely to have much of an impact with modern audiences. However, for cinema audiences in the thirties Bela Lugosi really hit the mark with his charming yet sinister portrayal of a vampire. So different from the hideous freak in Nosferatu. That disturbing, unblinking stare into the camera might easily give the impression that he could hypnotise you if he wished, reducing you to a compliant automaton like Lucy or, a gibbering, servile lackey like Renfield. No wonder Lugosi is the definitive vampire! The movie must be watched with the limitations of censorship and technical expertise of the time in mind. We never see Dracula sinking his teeth into a victim's neck. He simply moves towards the camera menacingly. The bats are obviously rubber and on wires. CGI hadn't been invented. The acting is slow and stilted, with long silences. A throwback to stage and silent film acting. Remember, sound films had only been around for about three years at this time and most of the actors would have started their careers in the silent era. So, we end up with what may now be regarded as a curiosity and wonder what all the fuss and adulation is about. But, for breaking new ground (and apparently giving Carl Laemmle the heebie jeebies) it must be considered a classic of the horror genre.",Dracula
161,PCC0921,Bela Achieves Iconic Status In This Film,8,9 January 2021,"I have seen Dracula (1931), over the years, maybe 10 times. Back in the 70s/early 80s I had ten minutes of this film on Super-8 film. My parents bought me a Bell & Howell Super-8 Sound Movie Projector back in 1978. In that version of the film they managed to put together a pretty good story with 10 mins of shots and scenes to make it work for the pre-VCR era of 1970s home theater market. You have a little bit of the beginning, when Renfield (Frye) and Dracula (Lugosi) meet and then the film jumps to London. Dracula meets Mina (Chandler) and Van Helsing (Van Sloan), and it ended with Van Helsing and John Harker (David Manners), hunting down Dracula and attempting to save Mina. The 10 minute Super-8 film was a nicely, tightly wrapped package that was fun to watch on the garage wall outside at home when I was growing up.Since those days of Super-8 movies I probably saw the full length version of Dracula multiple times on VHS and DVD. I've even seen it on my 90-inch projection screen. So, yeah I've seen this movie a lot and still don't get tired of it. Despite the non-existent soundtrack, the film still holds up. So, for this most recent viewing it was interesting to watch this film in a new version with a new experimental soundtrack that was composed back in 1998. I always felt the silence of Dracula worked, because it enhanced the creepiness, which is a Tod Browning staple, but in some spots in the film the silence is too much. So, I thought it would be cool to see Dracula with a generous attempt at a soundtrack. One thing I did miss by watching the 1998 Philip Glass version was the classic original Dracula theme (Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake), was missing from the film.It was interesting to find out that Tod Browning wasn't a happy camper during the filming of this movie. I even read things that said he was barely on the set and the Director of Photography, Karl Freund, ended up Directing most of the scenes. Browning seemed disinterested and became even more angry when the Universal executives felt the Spanish-Language version of Dracula was much better than Browning's version.Back in the early days of the Talkies Hollywood hadn't quite figured out that all they had to do for foreign distribution was to dub the foreign language right over the film, so, in this case, they hired a second cast and crew, used the same sets, costumes and script and re-shot the entire film in Spanish at night time, while Browning, Freund and Lugosi shot the American version during the day. They did this with most movies, however, most of these Spanish version films are lost to the decaying force known as time, but fortunately, the Spanish Dracula was found in a closet somewhere and we can enjoy both versions today and compare.For the research I did for this film (and the Spanish version), a lot of critics and fans, mostly from 1931, said that they felt the Spanish version of this film was better and bolder than the original English version and in my opinion, I can't agree with that. I think most of these critics were either Browning haters or Lugosi haters or just plain suffered from Dracula-Bela fatigue and embraced the Spanish version, because it was a new fresh look at the Dracula (1931), film. The Spanish language version had been lost for nearly 50 years, so other than those who saw it in 1931, no one had really seen it again until it was released on VHS in the 80s and DVD in 2004. I actually never heard of this, so, of course, I couldn't wait to see it. True, Director George Melford, did do some interesting camera pans and some cool camera trucking moves that framed some of the shots rather nicely, but it doesn't compare to the mood, lighting and atmosphere that Browning/Freund captured, plus there are plenty of amazing shots and panning moves in the English version too.In my opinion, the original English-Language version of Dracula still holds up. There are slow points to the film hindered by a lack of a soundtrack. Bela Lugosi, whatever the critics say, was the driving force through the film, so much in fact that he was type-casted for the rest of his life, but to that credit it solidified him as the iconic face of the Lord of the Undead and his likeness, along with Karloff as the Frankenstein Monster, is enshrined in the pop-culture conscience for all eternity. Classic irony at it's best. His portrayal of Dracula could come off as being overacted or cheesy to some today too, but it worked for 1931 and having eternity as a bi-product of that isn't a bad deal at all. His facial expressions, the way he got his hand gestures to move with his creepy fingers and that Hungarian tongue all made for a perfect recipe and it helped a lot that the ladies liked his dark, tall look. But, for me the true gem of this film is Edward Van Sloan's Van Helsing. Sloan is the one character in the film who knows everything that is going on. He is the one that helps the less uneducated viewers (when it comes to the the topic of vampiric characteristics), understand what is going on in detail. He is the one who becomes Dracula's most-hated enemy, an elderly man, who has the will and the strength to even fight the King of the Undead. Sloan gives a great performance and is the hero of the film who, fortunately, overshadows and drowns out the less exciting leading man and often annoying, poorly directed, David Manners, who plays John Harker. Dwight Frye is good as Renfield, but I think he is much better as Fritz in Frankenstein (1931).This is still a true masterpiece of classic film-making whether you give the credit to Browning or Freund. The sets, the lighting, the silence, the mood, all work to give a dark, scary depiction of what the collective conscience of pre-WWII audiences thought of this vampire phenomenon. Watch Dracula (1931) and see what true art really is.8.2 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",Dracula
162,Chance2000esl,A Groundbreaking Film Better Than Ever After 76 Years!,8,15 October 2007,"When I was young I thought this film was flat, except for Bela Lugosi's not on screen enough presence. After spending years watching and ploughing through the history of silent films, 'Dracula' now comes on like a mind boggling ground breaking wonder! How it must have terrified audiences in 1931!Of course, we know the minuses: it doesn't follow the book, there's too much off stage action, Tod Browning's 'direction' is weak, the male lead is feeble, the acting is too stagy (especially by Van Helsing), and there's not enough Lugosi, etc. But consider the pluses: they get better with every viewing! Even after 76 years! The first sound version of a 'grotesque and horrible theme' (=the undead drinking blood to survive); the pioneering way of presenting it-- laying the groundwork for countless versions to follow (including the vast, bleak, decrepit castle); the eerie, creepy, atmospheric use of silence (the lack of music was not unusual for films of 1931); the scary, creepy editing; the amusing Charles K. ""They're all cry-zy"" Martin; the amazing work of Dwight Frye (including his floor crawl towards the maid), who would have stolen the film if it hadn't been for Bela's imposing presence; and most of all, the manner, movements, voice, dialog and delivery of Bela Lugosi himself. Whew!The Universal Legacy collection's David Skal informs us that the depression caused Carl Laemmle to scrap plans to film the book in favor of the popular play. In the book (published in 1897), Jonathan Harker is the solicitor dispatched to Castle Dracula, where he becomes trapped by Dracula, whom he sees turn into a lizard, and whom he also tries to kill before Dracula leaves Transylvania disguised as Harker; Renfield is already a patient in the sanitarium; and Lucy is beheaded in her tomb by Van Helsing and her lover, after her many nightly kills as the ""Woman in White"" (this latter part being mentioned in the film). Too bad we didn't get any of it in the film!In fact, while the fate of Lucy as a vampire is left out of the Lugosi version, it is present in the Spanish language one (included in the Universal Legacy Collection), in its more exciting climax. Speaking of that version, produced at the same time and on the same sets with the same costumes, and mostly the same script, it comes off as a wonderful, more detailed, variation of the English version, with additional scenes, dialog, and a really great Renfield. A fuller version visually and story wise, but... no voice of Lugosi.I haven't seen all of Lugosi's films but my favorites are clearly, 'Dracula'(1931); 'White Zombie'(1932); Lugosi amazing as Ygor in 'Son of Frankenstein'(1939); as the romantic hero and star of the serial 'The Return of Chandu' (1934); and his speeches (""Pull the String!"") in Ed Wood's 'Citizen Kane':'Glen or Glenda' (1953).As Skal points out, in no future Dracula movies did 'The Count' try to imitate Bela Lugosi, but as viewers we would always hear his voice, see his mannerisms, and measure the current actor against Bela's being conspicuous by his absence. So finally, watching this film takes you back to a genteel, drawing room world, where the gruesome theme is treated with skeptical normalcy and decency (not the horrific silliness and unbelievability so prevalent in modern horror films). When Renfield opens the door of Dracula's castle and introduces us to the world of evil we now know all too familiarly in our own time on and off screen, it's a ground breaking moment in the history of cinema. For all the pluses in it, this film just gets better and better!",Dracula
163,freaky_dave,The original film that made the Vampire famous.,7,3 October 2006,"Back in 1931, this little movie starring Bela Lugosi in a role that would forever typecast him, made waves in the theaters much like The Exorcist did in 1973. It started a whole genre of horror movies including Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, and The Creature From The Black Lagoon. All these movies became major horror films which created original monsters that would be copied for generations in different movies.In this day and age Dracula is a movie that doesn't hold up well. The special effects were pretty weak, but of course you didn't have the technology that you have nowadays, so directors back in 1931 had to rely more on directing, script, characters, and atmosphere to make a great movie.Dracula has a great character in Bela Lugosi, and the man acted his chops off in this film. Renfield, as played by Dwight Frye, was also very convincing, but most of the others actors weren't as strong. The story begins on a carriage ride to Transylvania, and it is during this period at Dracula's castle and in Transylvania where this movie contains its best scenes. Once we leave the castle though the film slowly starts to fall apart. There were still a few scenes worth mentioning outside of Castle Dracula, like the scene with Dracula appearing in Mina's room, and the scene at the opera, but other than that nothing much more. It even ends very prematurely and we are left to wonder exactly what it was that happened, since we never see Dracula killed. We here a short shout, but nothing more. Still this movie had an impact on a generation and continued on through following generations, so it deserves some kudos.Other horror movies may come and go, but nobody ever forgets The Frankenstein monster, The Wolf Man, the Gill Man, and of course Dracula.",Dracula
164,Johan_Wondering_on_Waves,Better than expected,7,5 April 2015,"I'm not a fan of vampire movies. The only vampire movie that I truly enjoyed so far is ""Let the Right one in"". However with my desire to watch older horror in black and white I thought it would be interesting to watch the original Dracula movie. I have seen remakes, the one from the nineties for sure and other versions but most are too long ago now to remember. OK the plot is really simple and this is more about atmosphere than anything else. The Gothic atmosphere is translated well to the screen by means of the dark castle of the count in the beginning, the bat, the coffins and of course the appearance and gaze of Dracula masterfully given a face by Bela Lugosi. Kudos also to Dwight Frye who plays Renfield going from a serious guy to a crazy nut. I'm not an expert but everything you need to know about vampires is in this movie except for the gruesome teeth. In my opinion not really needed as Dracula's stare and the way he moves is terrifying enough for any of his preys.",Dracula
165,foxtografo,Amazing photography,7,26 July 2019,"I loved the cinematography, the photography and the camera work seem so ahead of its time! Just great!
The story is entertaining and it doesn't stretch too much, so I enjoyed.
Nowadays it doesn't feel like horror to me, also Dracula's personality is a bit of a big contrast against the previous version of the character. I didn't think it's bad, it's really interesting, but the smiley attitude seemed a bit out of character at times.
The acting in general was quite good. It's a solid movie, with some silly and funny (of course not intentional) moments, product of the ageing, but having in mind it's such an old movie, I appreciate the production is very good.
In my humble opinion, quite superior, even if it's different, to Nosferatu 1922.",Dracula

""Dracula"" still has a lot under the coffin to examine. Most of all its personal fascination with confusing love for control. If you can look deep, you will find something truly sad, but bewildering to the human soul. This makes the story feel timely, but also reassuring of it's themes.",Dracula
167,bayardhiler,The One That Started It All,10,25 October 2014,"In 1897 Irish author Bram Stoker wrote what would become the most famous vampire story of all, ""Dracula"". Despite it becoming a world wide sensation, it would not be until 1931 when Bram Stoker's ultimate example of Victorian Gothic would become a feature film. Starring legendary Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi, the plot is something that almost everyone knows by heart now. Ancient vampire Count Dracula desires for something more than the surroundings of his decrypt castle and decides to make way to England so he can continue his blood sucking ways there. Naturally the people of Britain don't take too kindly to this and from there it's a race against the clock before Dracula can kill again.Film audiences today might find Universal's version campy and more of a comedy than horror. But let's not forgot this was when filmmaking was still in infancy and funny or not, this is the film that laid the foundation for what vampires are supposed to be in our mind. Prior to this, Bela Lugosi was making a nice living on Broadway as the caped fiend when Universal approached him for this role and as a result of that decision, he was launched into the stratosphere of stardom. With his iconic cape, heavy accent, and ice, cold eyes, Lugosi set the standard that all other actors in the role would be measured against and because of that, even in this age of ""Twilight""(Blah), is still the epitome of all vampires. Watch as he stalks the streets of Victorian London and try to tell yourself that he's not spooky or even just a little bit cool. Director Todd Browning masterfully adapted Stoker's work by incorporating all the Gothic elements that made the novel a classic, from the decrypted old castle of Dracula to the black and white shots of cemeteries and crypts. Rounding out the cast is Dwight Frye as the naïve real estate agent turned insanely devoted servant of Dracula (Frye's maniac look and laugh through out the film should have earned him an Oscar or at least a nomination) Edward Van Sloan as Dracula's chief nemesis Van Helsing, Helen Chandler as Mina, David Manners as John Harker, plus many more small time actors who make the film that much more memorable. You can laugh at the bat on string all you want but the image of Lugosi stalking someone in their bedroom in the dead of night has haunted a many young child's dreams and truth be told, still kind of does. And on that note, don't let this classic pass you by and while I'm at it, don't forget to keep your crucifix and garlic close when you turn off that light!",Dracula
168,LanceBrave,These images are the base upon which all horror films are built,9,23 November 2013,"I've probably written about these films more then any other yet I notice something new every time I watch. This time, I realized ""Dracula"" is set in the modern day. During the flower girl scene, you hear a car horn and see modern street lamps. Another question I ask for the first time: Why did Dracula disguise himself as the carriage driver? Why hide his face? Despite this question, it is one of the most atmospheric scenes in a film built primarily on atmosphere.Modern critiques tend to say Lugosi is the sole graceful factor in a stagy film. True but don't undersell. Karl Freund's camera is not stationary. A pan around Renfield's shoulder, a slow move up steps, a panorama of Seward's sanatorium. Renfield leering from the ship or the shadow of the captain lashed to the wheel are just two chilling scenes. The use of shadows is toned down from Universal's silents and it's generally agreed that Freund's artistry was held back by Todd Browning. Wither Browning had trouble adapting to sound or was still grieving for Lon Chaney (and the version of ""Dracula"" they had planned on making) is debated.Either way, you can't deny the power of these images. The early shots of Dracula's castle, the brides awaking in the catacombs, the illogical armadillos, beetles in tiny coffins, Lugosi's glaring eyes. These images are the base upon which all American horror films are built. They still send chills up a viewer's spine seventy years later. The set design is incredible, particularly the dusty staircase of Castle Dracula or the ruins of Carfax Abbey. Supporting the sets are fantastic glass painted backgrounds.I won't waste words on why Lugosi is the iconic Dracula. He exudes an authority over everyone simply with his body language. Shots of him doing nothing but standing in shadow-swept doorways manage to be creepy.Given Dracula's sway over the opposite sex, it's easy to understand while the vampire is a fantasized character for men. But why is the vampire a sex symbol for women? The film is split on the issue. The scene of Dracula cornering the flower girl brings to mind nothing but sexual assault. I believe Dracula leaning over the sleeping bodies of his prey aren't meant to be provocative but rather to invoke classical nightmare imagery. We are all vulnerable when we sleep and many horror films prey on that innate vulnerably. (Yep, I just traced a line from Dracula to Freddy.) Dracula is feared by his female victims, yet still oddly attractive. Lucy doesn't seem totally asleep when Dracula comes for her. A later scene, where Mina walks into the count's arms, his cape wrapped around her, blending in with the shadows, is undoubtedly romantic. The vampire is a man with complete control over his females, psychic and sexual. Why women would desire such a mate is a topic unsuited for this blog. The seductive female vampire is a horror concept not yet solidified. Mina, once turned, seems less like a willing seductress and more like a drug addict, uncontrollably forced to attack her beloved husband.The movie is flawed, no doubt. Who the heck is the main character? The count is unknowable. Harker or Seward don't do anything besides wring their hands. Van Helsing comes in too late, Lucy exits too early, while Mina is a damsel in distress. Nope, it's gotta' be Renfield. We follow him from the beginning and he features in most of the scenes. A book must exists that explores his character more. There's a lot of untapped potential there. Dwight Fry had enough range to play a straight-laced businessman perfectly, even if his unhinged insanity is what we remember. When his spider is thrown away, you almost feel for the guy. His monologue about Dracula presenting him with a feast of rats is great and I wonder why no other adaptation has gone into more detail about that. Why does Dracula even keep the guy around? He doesn't serve him much and is even responsible for revealing the count's hiding place.The pacing drags in the latter half, as the staged qualities take over. There's a number of narrative question marks. Lucy's story arc is oddly abbreviated. We hear about her escapades as the Woman in White but Van Helsing disposes of her off-screen. Why does Dracula have Mina just hanging around the abbey at the very end? What purpose did that serve? Renfield preys on the unconscious maid in one scene but we never find out why. The guy sure gets out of his cell easy. Dr. Seward should probably hire a new staff. Dracula's final confrontation with Van Helsing is anticlimactic. Even the weaker second half of the film has its moments, such as Dracula making eye-contact with Mina's maid or smashing the mirror out of Van Helsing's hand.I'm not begrudgingly calling it a great movie. It remains the best adaptation of Stoker's novel in many ways and is the most important of the Universal Monster cycle in countless ways.",Dracula

The early days of motion pictures brought on a bevy of horror films which would fascinate all American movie viewers for basically all of eternity!!! (In the movie world perspective anyway!!) Bela Lugosi is tremendous in this movie, and the whole eerie genre of frightful horror which made this film a classic has been marked a a legend in the silver screen!! I love watching this movie!! Black and white movies spark a nostalgic familiarity with me!! By the time I was born, almost everything was in color, but, black and white television still had maybe 25% of everything that people watched. As a result, my generation identifies with black and white television and movies, and down and outright prefers it when viewing a horror film or a 1930's gangster flick!!

This marvelously atmospheric early talkie based on a stage play of 1924 has a rather theatrical composition with minimal dialogue, long soundless sections, but a terrific gothic presence all the better for being in black and white, with two fantastic performances from Bela Lugosi as Dracula the vampire and his nemesis brilliantly played by Edward Van Sloan as a elderly but active Van Helsing the vampire hunter. The plot you know most Dracula movies tend to follow the same premise so no surprises await, however this Dracula movie never wastes a line or a scene and in the careful hands of experienced silent film director Tod Browning this is a near perfect 85 minutes.

171,Shostakovich343,Dracula,5,20 February 2021,"Tod Browning's ""Dracula"" boasts one single aspect deserving preservation: Bela Lugosi's hypnotic performance as the titular vampire. Neither Max Schreck's genuine horror, nor Christopher Lee's indulgent camp, nor Gary Oldman's sultry pathos, nor Klaus Kinski's existential anguish have come close to replacing his image as the ultimate vampire lord. But besides his gothic presence ""Dracula"" is a lousy film; a piece of stiff, cheaply made 1930s hackwork that Browning reportedly cared little about. And don't be lured into using the film's age as an excuse for its torpor. Murnau's shattering ""Faust"" predates ""Dracula"" by five years, not to mention ""Nosferatu"". More timeless than the image of Lugosi on a staircase is the aftertaste of studio cynicism.",Dracula
172,simeon_flake,Universal's monster genesis...,9,10 February 2005,"Universal's first ""talkie"" horror production with Bela Lugosi in his landmark role as Count Dracula, a very suave and almost charming figure totally removed from the rat-like visage of Max Shreck (Nosferatu). Full of the always excellent atmosphere found in the Universal pictures, the lack of musical accompaniment doesn't seem to hinder this film much. If anything, the silence adds to the eeriness of the whole affair.Edward Van Sloan lends his usual professionalism as Professor Van Helsing, the nemesis of the undead Count. His face-offs with Lugosi, in the mirror scene & the ""test of wills"" are just a few of my favorite moments from the movie.Dwight Frye (in his defining role) is excellent as the crazed, pitiable Renfield. Fans always make mention of his crazed laughter, but is there a better manic scream in all of cinema than the one Frye cuts loose with when Van Helsing shows him the wolfbane (You know too much to live Van Helsing). Another favorite Renfield/Van Helsing scene comes later when Renfield goes ""Dracula! {shakes uncontrollably}.....Why I never even heard the name"".Dracula is not without its faults, though. The ending sequence with the demise of Dracula & the photogenic pair of David Manners and Helen Chandler walking up the stairs with the abrupt cut to the closing ""The End"" is totally flat. The entire scene feels like Tod Browning was on cruise control before he decided to mash down hard on the brakes & leave you with that feeling of ""Huh, that's it? Shouldn't there be more""? And what was the deal with the camera panning away as Lugosi rose from his coffin. You'd hear a creak, then the camera just pans over to a wall then back to Bela standing upright. Did some higher-up at Universal think 1931 audiences couldn't handle seeing a man rising out of his casket?!?Overall, the film is still great viewing and the image of Lugosi's glowing eyes will live on through the ages.",Dracula
173,jed-estes,Classic Bela before the Ed Wood years.,10,30 August 2006,"This film is beautiful. I love how it has so little dialog but yet says so much. And there's Bela, one of the best actors of his time. Bela could give anyone working today a run for there money. Tod Brownings direction is wondrous as well. How he manged to do what he did when he did it will always amaze me. The matte paintings look so real and detailed that you almost feel like your there. They will always beat out CGI. You have to go no further than the 1992 remake to see that. Look how horrible that film is. These two films should be shown side by side for film students to show how much better it is to show so little. In this Bela gives his career performance and you can see that he has not degenerated to his lowest points that would later consume him. Even though the Ed Wood films that Bela would partake in later are good movies you can see that he has lost his spirit in those films. Not so with this movie, his integrity is intact all through this film. Watch this film as it will probably not scare you, but it will show you that there is a better way to make films.",Dracula

Bela Lugosi is the quintessential Dracula that even in this day and age of CGI, can't be topped. The way he moves, talks and the lighting cast on him whenever he hypnotizes his victims still brings the chills. Speaking of Lighting, that's another area that shines to generate a spooky environment. The intro sets on the right foot with Tchiakovsky's Swan Lake which is just perfect for setting up the scares. Who says you need blood and gore for scares? The direction here is fantastic in delivering the shriek moments that have stood the test of time.",Dracula

When someone says the word ""Dracula"", they automatically think of Bela Lugosi and his thick, Hungarian accent. I also liked the roles played by Dwight Frye as Renfield and Edward Van Sloan as Dr.Van Helsing. The settings, especially of Dracula's castle, are awesome! The direction is top-notch and the rest of the cast shines through. Although today's films rely on special effects, this is another example of a film carrying itself by the actors.

With deeply immersive sound and atmosphere, coupled with the dominating screen presence of the legendary Bela Lugosi as the sinister Count himself, Dracula is an exercise in suspense and terror which lays the groundwork for an entire history of great horror movies. While 1922's Nosferatu presented the vampire as a monstrous abomination, Lugosi's Dracula has an other-worldly atmosphere around his performance which lures audiences into the cold embrace of his dark stare, the haunting allure of his deep accent and the inhuman rigidness of his stance.

Some might also object to the many departures from the original plot. But for me the one and only reason to watch this film is the alternate Philip Glass score. I'm a fan of his music anyway but what he has accomplished here is to put it simply, outstanding. He has imbued a film that by modern standards is rather simplistic and at times even laughable with freshness and magic. The dialog and the plot are almost irrelevant.

I'm afraid no. People who produced Dracula perhaps did not know how to make good movies or perhaps the people in the old days were so much different than people today. This may sound silly, but it is really difficult to tell people of today why the first Dracula film is a classic. All elements what Dracula includes are known even before people get to see this film. The reason is that the story of Dracula has become an essential part of cultural history and that's why this film deserves all the attention it has.Spoilers for the film lay everywhere outside the DVD package. Worst spoilers are found within everyday life in America: the Halloween and probably even the Simpsons TV-series. People can encounter Dracula today even in children's programs, though in much more humorous context, and Dracula for grown-ups is represented with special effects and masses of blood and scream and perhaps sex. In the gloomy castle where the original Dracula (by Bela Lugosi) lived, now lives the over-produced Dracula and his stupid brother, who stars in parodies.Sad to say, but the old Dracula film offers only the basic clichés of a horror movie and of course himself, Bela Lugosi the 'real' Dracula.

181,Incalculacable,The Movie That Started It All,8,3 June 2006,"""I am Dracula....I Bid You Welcome."" Although perhaps not the first vampire film - many regard Nosferatu (1922) (which, by the way, was a more horrific interpretation of a vampire) as the first - it is clearly the most popular. When one thinks of Dracula, you think pale face, black cape, eerie, spooky settings, mist, the thirst for blood, Trannsylvainia - and that's exactly what you get in this magnificent version of the classic tale of Dracula (a role that Bela Lugisi was born to play).The plot is simple and well known... Dracula is a vampire and thirsts for blood. He travels to England with his newly transformed sidekick Renfield (Dwight Frye) and sets his eyes on Mina, an engaged young woman.In my opinion, no one plays the part better of Dracula like Hungarian born Bela Lugosi, who acted in the stage version. Strangely, he was not the first choice for the film role, but he won it eventually. I believe he was the perfect choice and brings the essential strange, chilling element. His ominous, eerie presence... his long, thirsting, desiring stares and generally his intriguing and often sexy performance as Dracula. His unforgettable articulation and his mysterious entrancing tone of voice are just perfect. Imagine anyone else saying ""I am Dracula....I Bid You Welcome""! The best thing about this movie is how wonderfully it created the dark, chilling atmosphere unparalleled by any other movie on such a tiny budget. A great example of this is at the start where Dracula's brides slowly creep out. Their emotion is truly haunting. This doesn't have the now typical 'boo!' moments of modern horror flicks but I would not miss the hypnotizing performance of Dracula and the eerie settings. This is the movie that set off a whole generation of vampire movies, but I believe this is the greatest of them all. It makes others pale in comparison. Great to own on DVD.",Dracula

Let me preface my opinion with the fact that I adore old horror movies, Bela Lugosi, and the Dracula story itself. However, I can think of many many examples utilizing each of those three qualities that are light years ahead of this comedic mess. There are so many things wrong with the film - Dwight Frye's annoying pantomimical performance, the convoluted mish-mash of a story, the mood-killing comic segments. Really, other than the iconic images, of which most people are familiar, there really isn't much to champion about this rendition. Bela Lugosi is excellent and intense, which only adds to the frustration of everything around him being sloppy and farcical. ""The Vampire Bat"", a poverty-row production also from 1931 and featuring Frye, is known for its minuscule budget and even with its many flaws, I found it to be much more enjoyable than ""Dracula"". For a truly creepy and entertaining story of The Count, I recommend Hammer's ""Horror Of Dracula"" - which perfectly captures the Gothic mood and style while channeling it through a far superior story and cast.",Dracula

Apparently, if we keep getting ten million times where you see someone's eyes, it's considered scary. I think not. The movie is also very inaccurate to the book, which makes the movie even worse. Not even a five year old can call this a horror. Unless you want to watch someone staring at everyone for an hour, I recommend you don't watch this unless you love black and white movies! I like some black and white movies (Phsyco, Nosferatu,The Mummy) but this, I dislike! Don't go watching this, expecting people to walk at the right pace! Because these people take the whole half of the movie to walk! This movie should be called Attack Of The Horrifically Long Walking, then it can actually be called a horror! 3.7/10!",Dracula
184,RomanJamesHoffman,"Bela Logosi: although not the first, and certainly not the last, nevertheless the quintessential screen Dracula.",7,26 August 2013,"The vampire mythos has been a part of folklore for centuries. Originally the reanimated corpses of peasants who stank and looked grotesque, in the Romantic era of the 19th century the vampire was re-imagined as a sauve, aristocratic, and above-all hypnotically charismatic creature who is able to fascinate with a curious erotic allure. This archetype would then blossom and achieve literary immortality in Bram Stoker's 1897 Gothic novel. Moving to the silver screen, in 1922 German Expressionist director F.W. Murnau made 'Nosferatu', an unauthorised version of Stoker's novel which ran into legal trouble and thought destroyed for many years. Thankfully, copies of the film survived and it remains a striking film in its own right but nevertheless doesn't have the pop-culture punch that Tod Browning's 1931 film has enjoyed since its release. The reason, wellMax Schreck's portrayal of Count Orlock is of a grotesque monster, closer to the smelly peasants of the original vampire myth. Hardly erotically alluring. Whereas, in contrast, Bela Lugosi's portrayal of the Count is closer to Stoker's image of aristocratic grandeur and exquisite Gothic decaywhich is, well, much more alluring.However, despite the high point of Lugosi's definitive performance of the Count, the film is not perfect and should be approached with caution due to the risk of disappointment. Although cinema had been around for a while by the 1930s and many incredible films had been produced (i.e. in Germany with the likes of 'Nosferatu' (1922) and 'The Cabinet of Dr' Caligari', and also in the US with the likes Universal's own 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (1923) and 'The Phantom of the Opera' (1925)) many films, especially from Hollywood, produced in this era are shot and paced much like theatre as the inherent potential of cinema as a unique art-form was still being established. This seems especially the case in 'Dracula' as it was based on a Broadway adaptation of the novel (taking a few liberties with the original plot along the way) and when the action is taking place anywhere but Dracula's lavish yet crumbling castle, I can see how it would be difficult for many to suspend one's disbelief. Also, it must be said, the bat is absolutely laughable which also sadly distracts from the air of menace the film goes to great lengths to create. Consequently, as a result of such weaknesses, the film has lost a lot of the bite it may have had back in the day (pun intended).So while, as a whole film, 'Dracula' certainly has its weak points and doesn't really stand up to the magnificence of, say, James Whale's 'Frankenstein' released the same year, or Browning's own 'Freaks' released the following year (which promptly destroyed his career and was forgotten for decades until it was rediscovered in the 1960s for the masterpiece it is). However, 'Dracula' was a commercial smash at the time, made possible the Hollywood monster boom of the 1930s, rightly made a star of Lugosi, and served up the definitive cinematic presentation of the Count. No small featand while the film may not scare the modern viewer, it still has a certain power to seduce.",Dracula
185,Sunsphxsuns,1931's DRACULA - IT ALL BEGAN HERE,10,19 September 2018,"Over the years much has been written about 1931's Dracula. The film has been unduly criticized in contemporary forums, even though fans of the horror genre (and Bela Lugosi) continue to praise it in the most adoring terms. Admittedly, I am one of those fans who believe this is one of the most beloved and perfect movies ever filmed, even with its obvious technical flaws like a large piece of cardboard in front of a night table lamp, or a modern office building unsuccessfully hiding behind a large cross (see trivia and goofs section for details).Lugosi's portrayal of Count Dracula is by all accounts and reviews, the most riveting performance of his film career. Lugosi was born to play Dracula, not only in film, but on the Broadway stage as well. To date, no other actor has been able to match or recreate Lugosi's unique ability to define the loneliness and reserved aggression necessary to be a successful Vampire. It's a solemn existence when one is a creature of the night, AKA, the ""undead."" Lugosi rises to the occasion in every beautiful scene. Now and forever, when we think of Dracula, we will automatically associate the name with the preternatural image of Lugosi. Bela's darkly handsome image, combined with his distinctive Hungarian accent, is arguably the prototype of all Vampires to come. ""I never drink . . . Wine,"" he smiles. And at that precise moment, we know ""exactly"" what he means.As the film opens, Tchaikovsky's beautiful ""Swan Lake"" is playing. It is some of the only music heard throughout the movie because at the time ""sound"" was new, and movie producers were mistakenly concerned that audiences would not buy into background music being played without a corresponding source. Next, we see the image of a dark, crumbling castle high up in the Carpathian mountains, bats hovering around the broken battlements, wolves howling in the distance, and at the castle's entrance, a moaning, creaking door. In short, practically every cliche' and stereotype we associate with Gothic horror today began with 1931's Dracula.The supporting cast is exceptional, with each actor expanding their role far beyond their script. The theater stage's notable Dwight Frye (forever immortalized not only in this film but also in a song by Alice Cooper) delivers an exceptional and heartbreaking performance as the babbling, insane Renfield, Dracula's unwitting slave. Edward Van Sloan, who also played Van Helsing in the 1927 Broadway production of ""Dracula,"" easily transitions the role of the wise European doctor from stage to screen. David Manners and Helen Chandler take up the majority of the love scenes very convincingly, although off camera it was said that neither actually believed Dracula would ever become a worthy film. Ironically, Dracula was the only movie to make money for Universal pictures in 1931, even though its star, Bela Lugosi, would be paid a mere $500 a week, a total of $3,500 for his seven week contractual agreement. Universal executives realized Lugosi would work for hardly any compensation as he was desperate to play the role of the Immortal Count. Through his own lack of negotiating and desire to stay employed, and the movie studio's collective greed, Lugosi would continue to earn a meager income throughout his career, considerably lower than many of his contemporaries such as Boris Karloff (Frankenstein) or Lon Chaney Jr. (The Wolf Man).For 1931's Dracula to have been made at all, some credit must go to Carl Laemmle Jr.,the son of Papa Carl Laemmle (founder of Universal Pictures). Against Papa Laemmle's scathing admonitions to his son not to pursue Dracula, Laemmle Jr. Ignored his mentor's advice. Instead, ""Junior"" (as he was fondly called) actively championed not only Dracula, but an entire horror genre for Universal. He was particularly interested in ""updating"" German filmmaker F. W Murnau's 1922 silent film, Nosferatu, based on Bram Stoker's classic novel, Dracula, and the making of Dracula would be his starting point. Moreover, Laemmle Jr's remarkable instinct for good material would eventually evolve into a richly rewarding film franchise genre for Universal Pictures, an investment that today (2021) continues to boast large scale profits from rebooted and redesigned motion pictures (Dracula Untold 2014, The Mummy 2017). And although Laemmle Jr. May be remembered for All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), Frankenstein (1931), The Mummy (1932), Bride of Frankenstein (1935), it is 1931's production of Dracula that actually solidified his place in Legendary Hollywood.My advice to first time viewers of this terrific film is to first read ""The Immortal Count: The Life and Films of Bela Lugosi,"" by Arthur Lennig. As a young boy, Lennig was fortunate to have met Lugosi who was then on the decline in his acting career. Perhaps touched by the adolescent's enthusiastic knowledge of the actor's work, Lugosi befriended the boy, even arriving on one occasion with his wife (she did all the driving) at Lennig's home so he could introduce them to his bewildered parents. Through several subsequent meetings, Lennig got to know a side of Bela Lugosi that most people would never get to see - a humble, lonely, working class man who felt his role as Count Dracula both benefited and hampered his career.1931's Dracula is the quintessential Vampire masterpiece, setting the stage for all Vampire films and books to follow. Most certainly, you will find this film as engaging and timeless as Count Dracula himself.",Dracula
186,boscofl,"""This . . . is very old . . . wine. I hope you will like it.""",8,14 September 2021,"Universal's 1931 classic Dracula kicked off the Laemmle Era of talkie horror films and its place as a cinematic milestone is permanently etched in history. While not being the most faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's famous novel the movie presents the definitive interpretation of the character in the form of Bela Lugosi. Every subsequent attempt to resurrect Count Dracula brings the inevitable comparison to Lugosi; it is a testament to his memorable performance that most of those following in his wake have disappeared from memory. While it has become fashionable over the decades to shred Bela's performance there is no denying the actor has become as immortal as the character he so vividly brought to life.The film has endured so much scrutiny over its 90 years from critics and fans alike. The faults - funereal pacing, unimaginative staging, and dated, theatrical performances by the cast - are legitimate gripes. By comparison the Spanish Dracula, shot concurrently on the same sets, is a much better cinematic experience and ruthlessly exploits the technically lackluster job by director Tod Browning. That being said his version established all of the tropes and vampiric lore that pop culture would subsequently emulate; most significantly presenting the Count as a charismatic sexual predator. Bela was an absolute sensation in his day making women swoon while weaving an unbroken tapestry of evil to boot. It is quite an accomplishment to project both sex appeal and complete malevolence in one performance but Lugosi flawlessly pulls it off.I first watched Dracula in the mid 1970s as an impressionable child and have been under its spell ever since. There is no question I view this film through the rose colored glasses of nostalgia and enjoy it to this day for both its faults and merits. It is nearly impossible to evaluate this movie objectively as almost all of it has been lampooned and will doubtlessly come off as cheesy and ridiculously melodramatic to the uninitiated. However, in the context of cinema history, Dracula is a landmark achievement for which so many mediums of macabre entertainment owe a debt of gratitude. Furthermore, in addition to saving Universal Studios from ruin, it proved to be the cornerstone of the legendary Monsters Universe that would be built off its success. And lastly it gave us the immortal Bela Lugosi in his most famous role wherein performer and character are permanently entwined.",Dracula
187,mcca-62051,My favorite Dracula,8,2 November 2020,"Those iconic eyes glaring. The voice. In my opinion is one of the best Universal Monsters of the group. I am a fan of this form of Dracula and its story. The image of this Dracula is the vision of vampires I enjoy more.

Worth watching them over and over again.",Dracula
188,jcaraway3,If not for Lugosi...,4,27 March 2010,"This must sound like sacrilege to all fans of classic horror, but I am not a fan of this film. This is probably the weakest adaptation of the Bram Stoker novel I have ever seen. Lugosi gives an engaging and unforgettable performance as ,(who else?) Count Dracula, and Dwight Frye gives a delightfully loony performance as Renfield, Dracula's slave, but this movie shows it's age in many, many ways. First of all, there was no musical score, (unless you see the version with the irritating Philip Glass score), which made an already dull film even more boring. Then the effects of the bats and spiders are obviously fake and attached to strings. I know it was 1931 and all, but I think they could have done better than that. Next, all of the performances other than Lugosi's and Frye's are very poor, since sound in film was somewhat of a novelty, and the actors were acting as if they were in a silent picture. If it didn't have Lugosi and Frye, and the fairly chilling atmosphere of the set, it would be a total loss. So, the good points: Good atmosphere and performances by Bela Lugosi and Dwight Frye. The bad points: Sloppy editing, bad special effects, bad audio, and bad performances by everyone else. Besides, I'm a ""Frankenstein"" man myself anyway.",Dracula

190,ALauff,The brood,8,18 October 2006,"One measure of a great film is how well it transcends the limitations of its era's technology. Filmmakers in the early sound period amplified the imperfection of new aural recording by writing staid, dialogue-heavy scripts, thereby spotlighting the mechanism and not the work for which it labored. Seen today, it's amazing how well Dracula manages to avoid this temptation. Karl Freund, the great visionary DP of Metropolis, creates a timelessly redolent atmosphere of macabre details ambiguously glimpsed in the Count's shadowy, crumbling lair, like the rodents of uncertain breeding skulking in and around his coffin or the somnambulistic walk of his brides as they seem to evaporate in the densely cobwebbed cellar. As we are gradually drawn in by such ephemerae, the plunge into the unrealities of this ethereal world is realized through sly staging, tricks of shadow and light, and the conviction of Lugosi's formidable glowing stare. Due credit must be shared with Charles D. Hall and his design of the castle and the matte-painted, Transylvania countryside, all jagged craters and mountainous peaks which threaten to consume the curious envoys that venture there. I dare say this prologue comprises one of the more strangely poetic passages in all of classic Hollywood cinema.Unfortunately, the farther the aesthetic focus drifts from these foreign haunts, the nearer the film approaches banality. The Count's initial arrival to London maintains the spell of eerie suggestion—in one memorable sequence, he bites a young woman beneath a gaslight in plain sight of a throng of exiting opera patrons, who blithely dismiss the spectacle as youthful infatuation—but with the introduction of Van Helsing, ornate parlor rooms become the dominant setting for a series of conversations about the vampire mythos with explication firmly supplanting evocation. This jarring aesthetic disparity accounts for Dracula falling short of the tragic heights of Frankenstein, or the dedicated strangeness of the earlier, brazenly expressionistic Caligari. Yet there is one significant element that remains consistent throughout: Dwight Frye's manic, pop-eyed performance as the tragic Renfield. Half-vampire/half-mortal, Frye remains recognizably human even when raving about the nourishing properties of the bugs in his sanitarium cell, never more touching than in his final attempt at redemption. His performance, oft-parodied but never duplicated, is the poignant strand that binds the picture's disproportionate halves.",Dracula
191,michaelgarykelley1994,"I Kind Of Wish I Could've Been There, The Day This Was Released",8,2 November 2018,"""Dracula"" was the first of the Universal Monster films I ever saw, back in high school. The film has such a strong atmosphere, but I don't know if I would call it creepy, for the most part. There ARE some terrifying elements to it, though, that I can't wait to mention.For the record, before we get too much into reviewing this film, I will say this: I HATE 90% of Bram Stoker's original novel. I think the book sucks. There are many adaptations in the world, today, of Stoker's novel, and I'm not fond of them, either. Most people seem to love ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (the film), but I don't even find myself liking that one. I'm a vampire guy, when it's done right, but ""Dracula"" adaptations tend to be about as bad as the book. This film adaptation is-without a doubt-my favorite one. I prefer the changes in this film to anything the source material had set-up, thirty-some-odd years before this was released.Let's talk about the acting a bit. Everything American culture knows about traditional vampires came from this film. The jokes we make in a Count Dracula costume, to this very day in 2018, tend to be given in Bela's eerie and charming accent. The guy made this role iconic. I love Bela, as an actor, and think he's even BETTER in the couple of ""Frankenstein"" flicks he appeared in, as the hunchback fellow who had been hanged, but did not die. Bela steals the show in ""Dracula"". But one element to this film that no one had told me about-nor prepared me for-was Renfield. Renfield is TERRIFYING. The laughing. The crying. The moaning. He's terrifying. There's a scene on a ship, where rescuers hear laughing from the basement, and, when they've opened the door to the basement, Renfield is standing at the bottom, grinning, and laughing. He would've made an AMAZING Joker, if ever given the chance. My ultimate dream would be for the dad from ""The Brady Bunch"" to play Batman (due to his voice), fighting this man, playing the Joker. It would be amazing casting, for sure. The rest of the cast is fine. Just fine. I liked the good guys, but found myself more interested in the bad guys.I love the eerieness to this movie, but I wish there were more of a score to it. Even ""Frankenstein"" had more of a score. I think it could've made the film way more engaging-especially all these years later.The sets are amazing, for ""Dracula"". The Count's castle is so beautiful-inside and out. This is the ultimate type of movie to watch at Halloweentime. I think films like this-with the decorations of the sets alone-define the word ""spooky"".The film is not perfect, as I've sort of mentioned. I don't love it, but I absolutely dig it. I really hope the Lord God will bless me with children, someday, so I can raise them on stuff like this. I hope they'll like it. It would be so nice to have kids in the 2020s that would appreciate something nearly a hundred years old.But I digress.If you're a fan of horror, you owe it to yourself to try this one out, sometime. If you're a fan of Stoker's book, you might not be too interested in this film, but I still would recommend you give it a shot. If you don't even like horror, I'd recommend it! There's just so much to appreciate about this film, it'd be a massive shame for anyone to miss out on ""Dracula"". Definitely a classic, if you ask me.",Dracula

This movie is dripping with Gothic atmosphere. Bela Lugosi set the standard for movie menace in an era when even the villains had class. Helen Chandler was mesmerizing in what would turn out to be her career role. Dwight Frye was so perfectly demented as the bug eater, Renfield, that people are copying his performance to this day.

193,jadedalex,The real Dracula....,7,8 June 2010,"The classic Bram Stoker novel has been filmed many times, and the count has undergone various transformations. But when all is said and done, there is only one Dracula, and that is Bela Lugosi. His ""Dracula"" portrayal is classic.Dracula, after all, is one of the ""undead"", and the pasty look of Lugosi, coupled with his theatricality (one might say ""hamminess""), pretty much defines the character.""Dracula"" has its moments. The brief scene with his brides (it's a shame they didn't get a little sexier here. This was after all, pre-code Hollywood). Dwight Frye as the pathetic Reinfeld gives an inspired demented performance.Unfortunately, for all of its visual style, this original ""Dracula"" bores me. But there's been something wrong with just about every version of ""Dracula"" ever made.Possibly delivering the horror (and the sexual theme) most adroitly is Hammer Film's ""Horror of Dracula"" in 1958. Christoper Lee makes a terrifying count. But, for one who is ""undead"", Lee's Dracula is a creature of immense strength and powerful libido. In short, he's a far cry from anyone looking ""undead"".Frank Langella's virile Dracula features a vampire with a George Hamilton tan. There are some eerie moments in this ""Dracula"", but Frank is simply too ""studly"" to be believed as one of the undead.Gary Oldham's 1992 take in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" was amusing to me. Forget any of the legends of the vampire, Gary's count can walk around in daylight, but only if he wears his Foster Grants.I recall Jack Palance doing a television performance of the count. Frankly, I can't really remember it very well.The vampire myth is wonderfully spooky. I remember when I was a kid, I wanted to be a rock star. Nowadays, kids want to grow up to be vampires. The myth has a powerful hold on our subconscious that no other monster has. A vampire is pretty much sex and death in one fell swoop.The story has been done to death and the many vampire movies are for the most part silly. I have too much respect for the original book (which, by the way, is even more boring than Lugosi's movie) to see the classic story done comically and with so much license taken with the ""real"" legend.I must confess a liking for ""Nosferatu the Vampire"" with Klaus Kinski. This has Kinski looking quite like the original ""Nosferatu"". There is much humor, which for me works.I have the restored version of the original ""Nosferatu"" on tape but I have not viewed it as yet. Even the edited version of this silent seems spookier than Lugosi's.But as I am a purist, and an ancient one at that, my first glimpse of the character of Count Dracula was at a young age when the TV networks would slip in a horror movie before the six o'clock news. And it was the face of Lugosi that was indelibly imprinted in my mind as ""Dracula"". Too bad that every time I watch it, I do get dulled by the movie's talkiness.",Dracula
194,Gerardrobertson61,Classic Horror,8,31 May 2014,"For Xmas last year I got the Universal Monsters box set containing 8 of Universals horror movies from the 30's and 40's. I started watching this set with Dracula, a movie that I watched back in the 80's, so I haven't seen it in 30 years, It's still a chilling and frightening movie when you put it into the context of when it was released. Bela Lugosi's movements when he attacks and the light across his eyes must have really scared the daylights out of the 1930's audience, today it's almost humorous. But the movie is regarded as a classic movie from that period. It was the start of the horror movie genre, Classic Lugiso lines including ""cheeldren of the naight"", ""I nevair dreenk vine"" and ""I am Count Draculaaa"", and no doesn't say, ""I vant to dreenk your vlodd"". The scene where Dracula meets Van Helsing is a classic, especially when Van Helsing asks what sort of creature makes marks on a neck, and the maid introduces Count Dracula. This scene is quickly followed up by the lack of Dracula reflection in the mirror. Dwight Frye's Renfield is excellent, his creepy laugh and the expression on his face when he is not given his insects is memorable. Bela Lugosi epitomizes the perfect Dracula, no other actor has ever matched Lugosi's Dracula. Combined with Dwight Fryes Renfield, they were the perfect pair for this movie. Interesting that nurses were stationed in the lobbies of theatres when the movie was released to attend anyone who was scared by the movie. I love this box series and I am really enjoying watching Dracula, one of my favourite classic horror movies.",Dracula

The script was adapted from a play and it was well written plus the acting was outstanding along with the special effects but the cinematography had some mistakes but overall it was excellent.

198,Blazehgehg,Legendary? Iconic? Absolutely. No question.,4,1 November 2020,"Hard to watch because of its age? Unfortunately also true. This is a movie made before they figured out... well, just about everything about how films are put together.The plot is dead simple, yet still somehow feels hard to follow. There are huge leaps where things just don't get explained very well. Renfield passes out, Dracula descends on him, and it's like there's a scene missing because suddenly Renfield has been insane for weeks at Dracula's side. It's hard to convey just how jarring it feels, and it's not the only hard jump the movie makes like that. At times it feels less like a complete narrative, and more like a collection of unrelated scenes simply featuring Dracula.Special effects are so primitive as to be a joke. There are ""old special effects,"" and then there is the 1931 presentation of Dracula, where they dangle rubber bats on strings, and the wolves howling at the moon are just people standing just off camera yelling in to a paper megaphone.And, at least in the version I saw, there's not even any music. That's how old this movie is. Everything is presented in a kind of unearthly silence, sometimes with what feels like several minutes passing without any sound at all. Dracula predates any sort of sound mixing technology whatsoever, so whatever was available on set during filming is all you get. That can have its own spooky energy, but I found it to be distracting.I don't say these things to dunk on the movie. It's a landmark of cinema. Bela Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula is definitive. There's no question about this movie's place in the history books. But you know what else is in the history books? Cave paintings made by neanderthals.That's a lot like Dracula, nowadays: vitally important to the medium, the origin of so many foundational ideas, a relic to be studied, but not very enjoyable when stacked up against modern cinema. Dated doesn't even begin to describe it. Normally I'm good at putting myself in a head space to appreciate old movies, but this proved a bridge too far for me.At the very least, it's mercifully short, at just under an hour and 15 minutes. Watch it just to say that you did and never look back.",Dracula
199,myboigie,Dracula: A Study in Atmosphere and Sound,8,22 August 2006,"Tod Browning was a director who could almost do-no-wrong. Warner had the Gangsters, Universal had the monsters, and movies made in the backlots were pretty good from the Great War-on. The onetime carny-barker was one of Hollywood's best directors in a period that is now legend. What is so remarkable about Dracula's staying-power is that this film isn't really scary, but is very forward-looking in its use of atmosphere and silence.Browning did the majority of his movies during the silent-era (seven with Lon Chaney), and it is known that he was one of the many directors in that transition from silent-to-sound who was afraid of the new technology. Dracula is a 75-year-old film, and it looks and sounds great for being made in 1931. And a surprise: the Spanish-Language version is even more visually-innovative! The other crew that shot this version at-night saw the rushes of Browning's, and decided to outdo- them, and they did in many areas of their version. Most DVD-versions contain this version, and from some excellent-prints.Like the others, he feared that there would be a deemphasis on image, and this did happen with a lot of early ""talkies"". The reason they were called talkies is because they weren't good, and all the attention was on how much dialog you could fit-in. Many movies became like filmed-plays, and a lot of hard-won work in creating a visual-language got lost for a time. Dracula doesn't suffer from this fate, however, because of Browning's fear of sound in films. This is why we still find Dracula watchable today, it isn't too-chatty and talky with too-much dialog that plagues many of the early-talkies (many-of-which are now forgotten and even lost).Utilizing the German-cinematographer, Karl Freund, the film has that touch of Expressionism. Freund worked with both Fritz Lang and F.W. Murnau, and Dracula is a visual-feast because of this. Karl Freund was DP on many of the greatest German Expressionist films, such as Murnau's ""The Last Laugh"" (1924), Lang's ""Metropolis"" (1927), and even ""Der Golem"" (1920). We have stunning dolly and tracking-shots that were uncommon in early sound-features, and like Lang's ""M"", Browning's use of sound is sparse but effective. The absence-of-sound and the timing of where sound should be is very clever here, much like in Lang's M. Silence in both-films is often the prelude to something horrible--something Americans understood all-too-well in the heart of the Great Depression. A fear of war was also high, and isolationism and anti-immigrant sentiments were everywhere. Lugosi perfectly-embodies the American-fear of being overrun by immigration, and the actor was the very-thing! The character of Renfield is also interesting, being a fear of human-bondage to forces we do not understand.1931 was a bad year for Americans, so you have to consider this when you encounter the stories that women fainted and audiences screamed and yelled at screenings of this film. It was the worst year of the Great Depression, and to many, the world seemed to be ending. In a way, they were right, the world was going to change forever in a few-years. Some of it was good (the New Deal), and a lot of it was bad (the rise of Fascism and totalitarianism in Europe and Russia). From the Great Crash in the Fall of 1929, to the bitterest-year of 1931, Republican President Herbert Hoover did almost nothing to alleviate the suffering of Americans hit-hardest by the Depression. For this, he was overwhelmingly voted out-of-office, and his name has been a curse on the lips of the WWII-generation into our time.So angered were Americans by the Republican Party's decade-of-corruption, that they elected FDR three-times to the office of President, and the Democratic Party generally controlled Congress for over forty-years. No other American political-party can claim such a sustained-loss of legitimacy. Indeed, people were starving-to-death, and Hoover did nothing, these were uncertain-times. Nothing seemed to be what it seemed, and all assumptions about modern life were upturned. Horror and anxiety were everywhere as the Western world economy collapsed. Fear reigned, and Dracula was released into this storm of angst and anger. The timing couldn't have been more-perfect, and this is why the film doesn't resonate with us as much--it is a film of its time, very-much so. H.P. Lovecraft hated it, but when he wrote this to a friend, he was basically a white-supremacist, an anti-Semite, and a snobby, effete, intellectual-snob. He was also conservative at this time, but he had changed at the end of his life for-the-better.And so, horror is about the experience of generations. If you search-out what the other generations went-through, these films can be appreciated better. But, on a basic-level, Dracula is still a solid atmospheric-horror that was innovative. Its camera-work is innovative, as is its use of sound. And now, we have the good-fortune to have it restored with a new score commissioned by Univesal Pictures by American composer, Phillip Glass. If you truly want to enjoy this film, and to feel it more-deeply, it must be viewed with this score. Universal deserves credit for the new-score, it was a wonderful idea that works so well in-practice.Amazingly, Glass's score makes Dracula seem very modern and more-relevant to our times. The original had no real working-score (a few motifs), which is probably one of the few strikes against-it. Expertly-performed by the Kronos Quartet, Dracula shines as-never-before for our eyes and our ears. The restoration is incredible. After years of watching inferior 16mm television-prints, it is a revelation, this is a gem. At one time, it was hard to even see a lot of the movie, as it was murky and clouded, unstable. Watching it today, we can marvel at how good high-end film-making really was.",Dracula

This is probably the best though. Yes, it hasn't aged perfectly and that is the reason it's an 8/10 instead of 10/10. But it is truly a work of art. The sets and costume designs blend with the black and white picture to create a classic work of Vampire horror. I recommend watching this during halloween.",Dracula
201,ironcraftleague,A potential masterpiece?,8,30 January 2019,"This is hands down a horror movie classic. However, there are issues with this film that I cannot ignore. There is a lack of clarity, a lack of explanation, and scenes that don't make sense at times. The pacing also isn't the best. What makes this movie is however when the atmosphere gets creepy, when Dracula REALLY shines. Whenever he gives that gaze I still feel intimidated. The characters can be fun. The acting is pretty good. The castle scenes are hands down my favorite scenes in the entire movie. Dracula's wives are almost as creepy as Dracula himself and it's great whenever they're on screen. So, overall this was a good horror movie classic it just doesn't hold up that well when looking back at it. 8/10.",Dracula

It held me from the start to the end, and every time Bela Lugosi's Dracula was on screen, when he wasn't looking directly into the camera with his creepy glances, he really seemed to be having fun with the role. His conversations with other people (in trying to hide the fact that he was who he was) was even silly at times, because he seemed ages ahead of where they were at. The whole movie circled around his role, and he performed it fantastically, giving many generations the best Dracula of them all, without even showing fangs, or biting anyone. No, there is no ""I vant too sock yer blawd"" line, either. This movie is right on par with the rest of the monster films of the day and no, I'm not surprised that it'd scare people like mad when it came out. The only strange part is that there is no soundtrack on the film at all. Not that it put any strain on the movie, but when this movie was released, some audiences found music strange in a scene because it had no explanation for being there. I wonder what movies would be like now if they followed this, we probably would not be seeing them in theaters with THX.",Dracula
203,BruceCorneil,Strictly for fans of old time horror,5,30 August 2003,"This is yet another of those dreary classic films which people desperately WANT to love for purely sentimental reasons. Certainly, it cannot be denied its place in Hollywood history. But it needs to be evaluated for what it is - a fairly unprepossessing example of the genre.It's a sad comment on any sound movie to say that it compares unfavorably to an earlier silent version but that's the undeniable truth in this case.In 1922 director F.W. Marnau filmed the first screen adaption of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" in Bavaria under the title of ""Nosferatu"". With this landmark production Marnau created an extremely chilling piece of cinema which contained some genuinely spooky images. Nine years later Hollywood sanitized the whole concept and came out with Lugosi's painfully slow and almost comical remake.Today, this sleepy clunker is, in all honesty, only of interest as an historical curiosity. It moves along with all the pace of a funeral procession (appropriately enough). The dialogue regularly stops for long periods and with nothing much happening on the screen to fill the void you'll find yourself glancing over at the video shelf to consider other options.The almost total lack of incidental music throughout the picture also doesn't help the situation. Bela pulls his usual collection of rather idiotic facial expressions most of which will lead you to believe that he's just spotted something nasty on the carpet.As far as being a viable source of entertainment is concerned, it's unlikely that this movie will hold much appeal for anyone other than the most perservering of old time horror fans .",Dracula
204,jhigginbotham151,Bela Lugosi is Dracula,8,3 May 2014,"Dracula was the film that not only turned Lugosi into one of Horrors classic actors, but also the film that kick-started the Universal Horror Series, including Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Wolf Man, The Invisible Man and more. Dracula is a horror classic more than 83 years after its release and has stood the test of time where many a film has faded into obscurity. Lugosi is Dracula, pure and simple, you ask someone to act like Dracula, they act like Lugosi. The accent, the endless stare, the hand gestures, it's all considered standard for the Dracula character and it was Lugosi who made the character he is today.Just like all the classic monster movies, the rest of the cast is just as memorable. Dwight Fry is a fantastic Renfield, perfectly capturing a man torn between obedience and insanity. David Manners is good in the sadly diminished role of of John Harker (most of Harkers lines where given to Renfield instead). Herbert Bunston has to be my favorite as Dr. Seward. The music is classic. Capturing the elegance of the time and of Draculas appearance to the outside world, as an elegant, well spoken man. The sets are just as beautiful, while the use of shadow and fog shroud the film in an unmistakable darkness.The film may not be as memorable as something like James Whales Frankenstein, where every scene is memorable. But its still a classic, with great sets, performances, a chilling yet beautiful musical score and Bela Lugosi as the one, the only and the best, Dracula.",Dracula
205,andrew-huggett,Atmospheric and lavish looking classic but marred by poor editing,8,21 August 2016,"This film is very atmospheric but stagey (it is based on the play not the Bram Stoker book), slowish (despite the short running time) and dated. There are also problems with continuity and jump cuts due to a re-edit (apparently the Spanish language version is more faithful to the original sequenced script). The standout performance is actually from Dwight Frye as 'Renfield' whose lapses into insanity and wild eyed-grinning are very chilling indeed. Bela Lugosi is good in a kind of theatrical way and his accent and line '. the children of the night ' is superbly delivered. I also enjoyed some of the cinematography – the way in which the coffin is shown then the camera panning away and then back to show Dracula standing outside the coffin is very interesting. The sets of the castle and Carfax Abbey are very impressive (much more so than in the later Hammer films) and atmospheric although the staircases sound wooden. There are some disappointing flying bats and a large plastic spider. At one point it is made explicitly clear that Dracula can change into a wolf as well as a bat he is also repelled by Wolfsbane here (rather than garlic) as well as crucifixes. There's a great sequence when Van Helsing realises Dracula casts no reflection. A classic but flawed film.",Dracula
206,puttputtk,best Dracula but not best Universal Monster,7,30 May 2010,"Dracula (1931)5 word summaryMost famous vampire attacks EnglandWhen it comes to all the Universal Monsters all of them are classics and influential, and Dracula is no exception. However, I don't feel Dracula is the best of them. Personally I prefer Frankenstein, the Bride of Frankenstein, and the Wolfman, but its still a classic.Bela Lugosi plays Dracula fantastically. He's so dark and ominous and pulls of the lines and actions better than anyone else I've seen play Dracula. Tod Browning also caught the darkness needed to help with the Gothic feeling of the movie, however I think Coppola also did that well his 1992 version. The 1931 Dracula I feel is defiantly the best, at least out of the ones I have seen (which isn't that much.) The 1992 Coppola version was too long that it got too boring. Its not the most exciting horror/ suspense film out there so I feel stretching it to over 2 hours was a mistake. Then on the other hand Nosferatu (1922) I also found a little boring and that one wasn't long at all. This version wasn't necessarily better told but somehow was slightly less boring, though it still wasn't highly entertaining. If you want to see old horror movies obliviously I would suggest this because regardless it is a classic. However I'd first go with Frankenstein or the Wolfman, or even King Kong.",Dracula
207,don2507,"""I Never Drink........Wine""",8,7 December 2015,"I recently reread Bram Stoker's Dracula and subsequently decided to catch up on an old favorite, the 1931 version of Dracula with Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula. For my money, Lugosi's stilted Hungarian accent, stiff and slow movements, and bright, piercing eyes make him the best film Dracula of them all. Edward Van Sloan's performance as Van Helsing makes him a worthy adversary of the Count who exclaims, memorably: ""For one who has not lived even a single lifetime, you are a wise man, Van Helsing."" The film does reflect 1931 production values and does not have a particularly vivid ending; moreover, the almost silly performances of the actors portraying Mina and John Harker plus a couple of other elements in the film can place it, at times, in the ""camp"" class. But who can forget the mad Renfield groveling before his ""Master"" in between dining on flies and spiders. Lugosi shows Dracula's dominating presence and his powerful use of his hands in commanding ""come here"" to the weaker-willed characters in this film; they obey him and go to their destruction. But Van Helsing's will is equally strong and together with Dr. Seward and Harker and Van Helsing's knowledge of vampire lore, they ultimately prevent Mina from becoming, in another memorable phrase, this time from Van Helsing, ""a foul thing of the night.""This Dracula is well worth watching every 5 to 10 years.",Dracula

211,kriitikko,"The most famous Dracula film, thanks to Bela Lugosi",7,17 May 2008,"An English solicitor Mr. Renfield (Dwight Frye) travels to Transylvania to sell an old abbey from England to an ancient vampire Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi). Not one to waste much time Dracula quickly makes Renfield his slave and travels to England, killing an entire ship's crew on the way. In London he settles to his new home that is next to an asylum run by Dr. Seward (Herbert Bunston). Dracula quickly becomes interested in Seward's daughter Mina (Helen Chandler) and her friend Lucy Weston (Frances Dade). It doesn't take long when Seward and Mina's fiancé John Harker (David Manners) notice that some strange illness has taken the girls. Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) is summoned and the fight against centuries old evil begins.This is the Dracula movie most people remember and that has most influenced later anything even remotely linked to Dracula. Made in 1931 this film started the Universal Studio's production of horror movies that lasted over a decade and produced such films as Frankenstein (1931), The Mummy (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), Bride of Frankenstein (1935), The Wolf Man (1941) and remake of Phantom of the Opera (1943).Although the film is probably most famous adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel, it's not exactly based on book itself, but on a successful theater adaptation of the book by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston. The play was first run in London and was later brought to Broadway. In this lies one of the film's biggest flaws. Since it's very accurately based on a play, there are many scenes that are shot in the same sets with same people, without that anything would actually happen. The biggest difference between play and movie is the first 15 minutes that are set in Transylvania. The beautiful sets of Carpathian Mountains and Count's old castle with huge cobwebs and coffins, combined with cameraman Karl Freund's moving camera-work, are alone worth to see. However, very sadly, the moment the film moves to London the magic is gone. Film becomes suddenly slow, almost dragging, and especially the ending is very anticlimactic. The film only has its moments again whenever Dracula appears, most notably the scene where Van Helsing reveals Dracula's true nature with a help of a mirror.The biggest and possibly the main reason why the film is still considered classic is the impressive (and immortal) performance as Dracula by Bela Lugosi. Originally the part in the film was meant for Lon Chaney, who had done numerous silent films with Dracula's director Tod Browning in the 1920's. Chaney however died before the production was even started and the part was given to Lugosi, an Austrian-Hungarian actor who had starred as Dracula in the Broadway play. Many people still consider Lugosi to be the Dracula and I can't blame them much. His theatrical gestures, slow movements, hypnotic stare and an accent (that was his own and not acted) make him seem like he is from another era totally. Many actors who have later played Dracula, like Gary Oldman and Richard Roxburgh, have named Lugosi as the Dracula who most influenced them. Also the most stereotypical image of Dracula, with black hair, pale face, tuxedo and cape are all from Bela Lugosi.Beside of Lugosi the most memorable actor in the film is Dwight Frye, whose insane giggling has later been copied by other Renfields, mostly in Dracula comedies like Love at First Bite (1979) and Dracula- Dead and Loving It (1995). Edward Van Sloan also delivers a decent performance as Van Helsing, while the rest of the cast is trying to get used to the idea they're not making a silent film anymore and should speak to the microphone. Harker's player David Manners is especially bad in the film.So, Tod Browning's film version of Dracula may not be the best version ever made and certainly not the most entertaining of the Universal's 1930's horror classics. Yet it still holds its place as the most famous of many Dracula films made, and should be viewed at least once. The biggest credits goes to Bela Lugosi, who is most popular Dracula but whose other performances are not remembered that much. As Lugosi himself later said: ""Dracula is a blessing and a curse, and he will never die"".",Dracula
212,ctrout,A Universal Horror Classic,10,6 September 2005,"This great adaptation of the excellent Bram Stoker novel gets better each time you see it. Not many films can start out as one of the best ever made and just keep getting better like that, so this one is definitely special.It tells the story of the vampire Dracula's rise back into power after a visit from Renfield at his Transylvania estate. When Renfield becomes a servant to the Count, they're off to London where the vampire hunts down a beautiful woman.After the woman becomes ill, her friend brings in Prof. Van Helsing to find out what's wrong. Even Dr. Seward, the man who now has Renfield in an institution, comes to check on the poor woman.Finally, Van Helsing and his band of counterparts realize what they are up against and decide to finish off Count Dracula once and for all.Bela Lugosi delivers the performance of his career as the ferocious Count. He'll always be remembered for the role and it's no wonder why. He's definitely the best villain of these old Horror movies and he's probably the most memorable.I do have to mention Dwight Frye as Renfield though. In my opinion, he's the best part of the film. He's the only Renfield that I've seen that really brought the character to life and he really delivers a fantastic performance. If only there was a supporting category back in '31.The only thing that Stoker would be mad about is the deleting and switching of characters. In the book, it's Jonathan Harker, not Renfield, that goes to Transylvania in the beginning of the story. His character is much more developed and Renfield is pushed into the background. For a true adaptation, see the 1992 version, but for the best adaptation, see this.",Dracula

214,TheFinalAlias,It doesn't suck but it won't make you rise from your coffin either....,6,15 October 2009,"OK, time to cut to the chase. In prelude to my coming trip to 'The Land beyond the Hills'(Romania for you less poetically inclined)I have been reviewing genre films set there while carefully skirting those that feature it's most (in)famous (fictional)resident. The list of films set in Romania without Dracula was surprisingly extensive(and there are still several I haven't seen)and also surprisingly good. But now it's time to review film's featuring his excellency the Count, and where better to start off than with the version that is the most firmly implanted in the public's consciousness?In my now infamous review of the 1931 James Whale 'Frankenstein'(which still garnishes hate-mail on a weekly basis from enraged Branagh fans just as effectively as the original version I posted on my old account back in 2002 did)I emphasized just what a polarizing film it can be. In contrast, Tod Browning's less-highly regarded Dracula isn't so much a film with multiple opinions regarding it so much as it is a film whose reviewers are invariably split into two camps: 1)Those who regard it as an important but unwatchable curio and 2)Those who love it unconditionally whose only complaints(if any) are that it's pacing slows down after the early scenes in Romania.But films, as with life, are too complex to be summed up that easily. So the truth is that while it has a number of strengths and weaknesses, they aren't nearly as strong OR weak as they are made out. The consensus is that the film goes to hell as soon as it leaves Transylvania; and while it's true that nothing else in the film quite measures up to those scenes in becoming iconic, the film actually has several of it's most effective sequences right after wards: The scenes of the 'Vesta' being found with the entire crew dead except a raving Renfield still provides a real jolt, the scenes of Dracula seducing and then coming upon Lucy are still creepy enough to make you occasionally open an eye after you've gone to bed as well, but only if the atmosphere is JUST right.While it is true that a lack of a musical score mars the film, it also manages to give several scenes an eerie feel that makes it seem as if time itself has stopped to allow the Count to do his deadly handiwork. Everything feels dead, with only Dracula himself moving about. They don't call midnight(when Dracula apparently strikes)the 'Dead of Night' for nothing. The oft-criticized scenes where things are kept off camera actually work FOR the film rather than against it, and likely are sparing us some scenes that would otherwise be embarrassing. There's no denying that 'Dracula' is slow and dull, and that this pacing technique(not helped by static camera-work) fails more often than it succeeds; but compared to some other glacially-paced horrors of this era that I've had the misfortune to witness, it's nothing to gripe about.The acting is quite different from most people's reviews too. The consensus is that Lugosi is the only competent actor on board and everyone else stinks. The truth is, in fact, the opposite. Lugosi has an undeniable screen-presence, the most hypnotic eyes I have ever seen in a human being who was not a woman, and he created a character that will be remembered when the dust of my bones is gone; but the truth is that he's so hammy he's embarrassing, and his delivery(""We'll be lee--avink, to-MORRRRROW--eve-enink"")is the subject of too many parodies too count that it was probably old-hat to mock it before the year was out. This is no slam on Lugosi, I've sat through too many bad films just to see him in minor roles for me NOT to be a fan, but he's done better than this, even in comedies like 'Abbott & Costello meet Frankenstein'.The unfairly reviled supporting cast is actually quite good all things considered. Herbert Bunston gives a credible, if one-dimensional portrayal of Dr. Seward. Frances Dade is very natural as Lucy but sadly has too little screen time to develop the character. Helen Chandler is incredibly dull as Mina and deserves most of the barbs she gets, BUT; she does have one great moment where she attempts to bite Jonathan Harker(David Manners, who IS every bit as bad as critics have said)with this evil little gleam in her eye. It could be made into a shirt featuring the 7 deadly sins and 'Lust' would apply perfectly to it. Still, it would have been better if her role was reversed with Lucy's. Most of the film is carried by Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing. He seems to be just an old man, but his sheer stoicism and drive is astonishing. He may not be a quasi-superhero like Peter Cushing or Hugh Jackman, but you really believe in everything he says. He may seem unassuming, but rarely has Dracula had such a worthy foe.But the real standout is Dwight Frye as Renfield. His transformation from an unassuming everyman hero, to mad slave, to fiend, to martyr is absolutely incredible. He's both charming and likable in his naiveté in the early scenes, horrifyingly deranged when he goes mad(his laugh is the scariest thing about the film), hilariously funny(he provides more real comedy than any of the comedy relief maids and guards)and ultimately, a very tragic character. One could argue that he is the true hero of the film. His death at Dracula's hands is genuinely heartbreaking. The fact that Frye was never nominated for something shows just how meaningless industry awards really are.So no, 'Dracula' is not a masterpiece, nor is it an overrated misfire only important for historic reasons with only one good performance. It still remains essential viewing for every horror fan worth his salt and should be seen at least once by any self-respecting film fan.Just try not to expect a classic in league with 'Frankenstein'.~",Dracula

The acting is very ""wooden"" and stiff, much as the entire cast is acting out a stage play, only on film. The storyline itself is very good, scary and creepy enough, and the theme music ""Death of of the Swans"" from the Swan Lake Ballet, gives it need period class, I still enjoy watching Dracula for its historical outlook. But The Spanish version is much more fluid, the story moves smoothly, not in fits and jerks, as the English version.

Frye goes from fey to intense as Renfield, Dracula's deranged ""slave.""Apart from ""Swan Lake,"" the film incorporates the end of Wagner's Overture to ""Die Meistersinger"" - this is the number the orchestra is playing when Dracula first introduces himself to his new neighbors, in the theater box.",Dracula
217,pitsburghfuzz,Dracula+ Bela Lugosi=Timeless Classic,10,29 August 2009,"Many people do not realize that Lugosi played Dracula only twice on screen, once in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein(his last appearance for a major studio) and Tod Browning's Dracula, even though he played the stage Dracula many times before. He wasn't even the first to be considered for the role, in fact, he had to fight for the role and received very little pay for it. The story begins with Renfield(Dwight Frye) going to see Dracula after he purchased a home in England, but Transylvanian villager warn him about Dracula and he does not listen to the people of Transylvania, and becomes a servant of Dracula. They then sail for England and Dracula kills the entire crew of the ship and Renfield is taken to a mental home. Dracula then attends a show, in which the head of the mental ward, Dr. Seward(Herbert Bunston) attends where he takes a family friend, Lucy(Frances Dande), his daughter Mina(Helen Chandler) and her fiancé John Harker(David Manners). Dracula kills Lucy in her sleep and making her a fowl creature of the night like himself, and then makes numerous attempts to lure Mina into his control. Along the way, Dr. Van Helsing(Edward Van Sloan) discovers Dracula is a vampire even though the other characters do not believe him. The highlights of this movie are Dracula, Renfield, and Van Helsing. Lugosi plays a very hypnotic seductive Dracula. Frye plays a man who is striving for his own sanity, and Van Sloan plays a wise, Van Helsing. The ending is not the best, but to be honest, this film makes up for that. Dracula has many scenes that have complete silence, and they work beautifully, but were also used because directors like Tod Browning, were afraid to deal with dialog and Dracula was the first talking supernatural-thriller. Thanks to Lugosi, Dracula has become immortal and is one of the greatest characters even made in history. 10/10",Dracula
218,nEoFILM,Where it all began...,6,5 May 2011,"The year was 1931: Two years after the success of The Jazz Singer and the final introduction of sound movies into the mainstream, sound was still revolutionising the industry. But in 1931, a bit like 3D now, there was still much confusion over to how make films, with directors, producers and actors alike, were still moving over from the suddenly dated silent era, with varying success.Tod Browning was a man who would unfortunately find little success in the sound era, but not necessarily because he couldn't move with the times, but because his career was derailed a couple of years later by his disturbing horror pic, Freaks.Dracula was shot THREE times. One, this one, was the conventional sound version that we all know. An other was shot at night and in Spanish for the benefit of that audience, which the studio supposedly preferred. This was quite common at this time, but little known nowadays. And the third was a straight forward silent version for the many theatres still un-equipped to handle sound.But the styles of the silent era are all over this film. From the long silent reactions shots and the over acting, especially by Bela Lagosi in the titular role. This was also the adaptation of the stage adaptation of Bram Stoker's chiller, and was faithfully adapted from that source, hence the lack of more complex special effects, with bats on strings and fog machines, over more cinematic effects.The transformation scenes for example, where the Count morphs from a bat to the undead human occur off-screen, rather than some form of cross fade etc. Is this a choice driven by lack of money? Lack of cinematic ambition of a choice to stick to the stage material? To be honest, I have too little knowledge or experience of Tod Browning's work to suggest a reason, but when all's said and done, it did work.Let's be honest, this is 80 years old and is not the least bit scary and it is hard not to laugh, but in context, I'm sure it worked well at the time and the story is well conveyed. Lagosi's undead performance is hammy by today's standards but he was somewhat likable. He was very deliberate, slow and the silent era has certainly left its scars, as the subtly of sound performing was yet to take hold.But this is the sort of film were silent melodramatic acting still worked. This is of course a piece Gothic Horror, the home of melodrama if ever there was one. This is surly a product of its time, both as the industry went through one of it's most dramatic changes, which ended so many careers as well a created so many new ones, but it's also, let's not forget, the first direct adaptation of Bram Stoker's book, besides the 1922 German version, Nosferatu, which changes a fair few details to try to get around the copyright, failing to do so mind, resulting in failed bid to have every copy of the film destroyed.This is the film that ingrained the image of the Dracula that we know today into popular culture. This was were the Universal horror franchise began. For whatever faults it has by today's standards, it did something right.",Dracula
219,shominy-491-652355,The Greatest Dracula Movie Ever!,10,30 March 2013,"Bela Lugosi is so underrated as an actor - we've never seen any of his films that he wasn't great in. His absolutely amazing portrayal of Count Dracula set a precedent so high that no one can possibly outshine his performance - ever. CGI was not needed in those days because talented actors like Bela ""became"" the character, down to his soul, and turned in a genius (and scary) performance! Bela's facial expressions, graceful mannerisms, and underlying evilness create a powerful character that you can't take your eyes off. (Not to mention, his accent is perfect to a ""T"" for the worldly and mysterious Count!) I saw this movie when I was in grade school and Bela scared me so much that I couldn't watch it again for years. Presently, I still find it the scariest horror movie ever made but now I appreciate all the incredible talent involved to create this masterpiece! The chilling music and sets and truly spooky ambiance of this movie cannot be understated! The highlight of visiting any wax museum is finding Bela Lugosi as Dracula! He was a one-of-a-kind, amazing actor that deserves more honor and respect than he has received. Just like Adam West is the only real Batman, Bela Lugosi is the only real Dracula.",Dracula
220,Jamie-58,Chilling,8,22 April 2000,"I know I'm not alone in finding Tod Browning's film of ""Dracula"" heavy going. It has never had a particularly high critical reputation; most scholars find it a laboured and static attempt at Grand Guignol which bypasses the more gothic elements of Bram Stoker's novel in favour of winding sheet melodrama. One doesn't have to accept that verdict to see that they have a point. ""Dracula"" survives better as a museum piece than as a horror film. Bearing in mind that it was this film which gave the horror film mass acceptance in the English speaking world, it has a certain significance. But one can sense Tod Browning treading lightly, as if uncertain about what sort of film he wanted to make.My main concern about the film is its lack of pace. Their is little flow to it. Individual scenes stand out as set pieces, but they rarely seem to relate to each other. It is not really the fault of the actors, who even at their hammiest deliver surprisingly strong and committed performances. Lugosi is a standout of course, but equally good are Helen Chandler as Mina and Dwight Frye as Renfield. Karl Freund's cinematography is miraculous, if erratic.The new Phillip Glass score is a matter of controversy judging by other reviews, but I for one found it to be the missing link that restores ""Dracula"" to its full powers. Glass picks up the pace in a film that badly needs it. He underlines the characterisations in a fashion that is perceptive and compelling. The mournful yet sinister motif that accompanies Lugosi adds a whole new dimension; Renfield's pizzicato motif likewise delineates the character.Since I am no great fan of Maestro Glass, nobody is more surprised than myself at this assessment.  I frankly approached this newly scored version with a certain amount of dread. But I watched the film in one sitting this afternoon, something that I have never been able to do before, and for the first time found it to be rivetting cinema throughout, and not just in snatches.",Dracula
221,gullwing592003,A disappointing classic horror masterpiece.,6,26 December 2012,"I know ""Dracula"" is the classic iconic horror film that ""started it all"" & paved the way for all the other great horror classics at Universal. Such as ""Frankenstein"", ""The Mummy"" & ""The Invisible Man"" etc. But the truth is ""Dracula"" is a disappointing classic. It starts out excellent & strikingly atmospheric & visually creative for the first 30 minutes or so. Renfield's (Dwight Frye) visit to Count Dracula's Castle is amazingly dreamlike, surreal & chilling & scary & at first he's rational & sane as he encounters the vampire. Bela Lugosi is absolutely mesmerizing & chilling as Dracula.But as soon as the story shifts from Dracula's Castle in Transylvania to London, England the film deteriorates & falls apart & never really recovers from the excellent Transylvanian scenes. It becomes too theatrical & resembles a stage play with too much talking & not enough action. And too much of the film focuses on Renfield now under Dracula's hypnotic control & is reduced to a raving mad lunatic slave. Dwight Frye overacts too much & it gets old fast. The young couple John Harker & Mina (David Manners & Helen Chandler) are very wooden & boring.Professor Van Helsing (Everett Van Sloan) was a more interesting character who confronts & exposes Dracula. But even he is given too much screen time & there's only fleeting moments of Bela Lugosi. Tod Browning's direction lacks consistency & is uninspiring after the first 30 minutes & shows lack of interest & seems unsure where to go with it or maybe he just didn't care. As soon as the story moves to London the film just didn't seem to have a clear direction & just plods & drags on aimlessly with no conviction. It might've been better if Dracula after being exposed by the Professor returned to his Castle in Transylvania.And what was Dracula's reason & motive for sailing to London in the first place ? When he already has a Castle in Transylvania it doesn't make any sense at all. Oh that's right he purchased Carfax Abbey in London but why ?? & where would Dracula get the money ?? As soon as Dracula moves to London the film becomes a dull & boring stage play & it struggles a bit to sustain your interest & is hard to sit through. But the first 30 minutes are fantastic !! After that it's downhill & a disappointment but still worth seeing as Bela Lugosi was & is the definitive Dracula. It's just too bad Tod Browning fell asleep when Dracula moved to London.",Dracula

Artful for It's Time, but Not Entirely Satisfying.",4,26 October 2019,"I've never read the book 'Dracula' or seen any other movie adaptation, so this was my first experience with the classic. A local venue was hosting a showing as a Halloween event, so I attended.The film itself is a bit dull, especially if you don't have much patience. It is even more tedious than movies from the 1950's or 60's. The story is actually pretty simple, so there's not a whole lot to convey. There is virtually no soundtrack, which can make the experience seem slower, but also keeps it from being too cheesy. Sometimes what really ruins an old horror picture is the over-dramatic score. The performances aren't too bad, considering most acting at the time was done in a more theatrical, hammier way.But there's plenty of laughs to go around, whether they're on purpose or not. One of my favorite recurring gags is whenever a bat appears on a balcony, a character waves his arms around frantically, as if shooing away a gnat.If you're a fan of classic films, 'Dracula' isn't all bad. But if you're short on patience or prefer a faster pace, perhaps you should choose something else for your Halloween viewing.",Dracula

I first saw Dracula at the age of five and it scared me with fear, especially those eyes. Bela Lugosi's best movie of his career and really brought out the monster in his character. Edward Von Sloan also did a superb job as Van Helsing, the hunter sent to kill the dreaded Dracula. Dwight Frye also did a wonderful job as the demented Renfield, Dracula's faithful servant. Universal hit it on the nail by making this movie and an entire collection involving the Dracula character. Though tame by today's standards in horror movies, Dracula remains as one of the best horror movies of all time and I agree one bit with that comment. A true masterpiece that will forever fright moviegoers young and old.",Dracula
224,GoldenBlunderbuss,A bit campy by today's standards but it's importance shines through,9,25 July 2018,"How do you review a film which is not only over 85 years old but is widely regarded as an utter masterpiece of early Hollywood cinema? I guess you should start at the beginning ...
Chances are if you were to do an impression of the Count, you'd be inadvertently mimicking Lugosi's shining role as the vampire in pursuit of fresh blood while playing a cat-and-mouse game with vampire hunter Van Helsing.This was, of course, not the first film to be based on Bram Stoker's novel - Nosferatu (1922) and the lost Russian film Drakula (1920) borrowed plot points and the vampirical villain, but neither were could use the copyrighted contents of the book. The 1931 film was, however, the first talking Dracula film, meaning that Bela Lugosi (originally from modern-day Romania) invented the Count's accent everyone copies today.Lugosi's successful, if ultimately tragic, career in horror (alongside the likes of Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney Jr) can be traced back to the original Broadway adaptation and subsequent film held in such high regard today. Even when Dracula is uncentered in the shot as one of five characters on a balcony at an opera, he still commands the screen (as you can imagine he surely would've done on stage four years before).Dwight Frye also gives an intense performance as solicitor-turned-slave Renfield. His descent into submissive madness might be considered a bit campy these days, but that laugh on the ship gives me goose bumps every single time I hear it.Interestingly, there's no music in the film with the exception of the classic Swan Lake opening titles. When it's meant silent in Lucy or Mina's pitch black bed chamber, it's totally silent and much tenser than it might've been with a soundtrack. A version was released in 1998 with an orchestral score written by Philip Glass - the music in this version of the film (now the most viewed) is subtle and does its job admirably without too much distraction from the original directorial intentions.While the film is not scary anymore (in 1931, it surely would've been) it's worth a watch for the technical advancements it shows (including a simple tracking shot which was revolutionary at a time of static cameras) and its significance to film and the horror genre. No-one can deny its impact.Many of the film's lines have passed into folklore, Dracula's voice is rarely altered, and his slicked-back appearance became the standard for vampires since. It's not just part of our pop culture; it might just be the earliest inclusion in pop culture full-stop ... and it's still relevant nearly a century later.

225,csdietrich,The Definitive DRACULA of the Ages!,10,25 February 2001,"Everything imaginable has been said about this film which set the standard forever for every classic vampire portrayal. The suave, continental Hungarian Lugosi is unequalled in his role of a lifetime. Helen Chandler is fetching and supremely lovely as the blonde Mina, his lead victim. Dwight Frye goes deleriously mad in his signature performance as Renfield. The sets are magnificent and the photography (and possibly much of the direction) by Karl Freund is toweringly classic. Detractors are quick to call it static and stagy but its mesmerizing power continues to this day. The tragedy of its DVD release is that the print is ungodly dark & murky and MUST be remastered! Are you listening, Universal? Also accompanied by the Spanish version of this film which is visually and cinematically brilliant. The DVD cover features the breathtaking one-sheet poster for the film. But please, somebody at Universal, please clean up the sound and deliver us a lighter, clearer version of this film.

226,km_dickson,Lame,2,31 August 2005,"Absolutely Lame. The fact that this movie came out in 1931 is no excuse for how bad it is. Frankenstein and Svengali are two prime examples of what other filmmakers were able to do with the horror genre that same year. Dracula is simply a poorly written, poorly directed and poorly acted film. There is no imagination or style to it at all. It might have been enjoyable just for the spectacle, but there was none of that either. We never get to see Dracula come out of his coffin, change form, go for someone's neck or even flash a pair of fangs. Even for 1931 this had to be a low budget. The rubber spiders and bats on string are just plain laughable. Bela Lugosi makes a good Dracula, and Edward Van Sloan is a decent Van Helsing, but their limited talents go to waste here. Dwight Frye also gives a pretty good, though somewhat over the top, performance as the crazed Renfield. Not worth seeing.",Dracula
227,ACitizenCalledKane,Bela Lugosi in the role he was born to play!,7,4 January 2005,"While Tod Browning's Dracula is not the definitive take on the most famous vampire of all time, it is possibly the most memorable one. This is not due to Browning's technical achievements or directorial wizardry, by ANY means. It is due to Bela Lugosi's career-defining portrayal of the title character. Born in what is now Lugoj, Romania, Lugosi brings to the part the flavor of his homeland, making him more believable as Dracula. This other-worldly aesthetic helped to make his performance what many consider the ultimate incarnation of Stoker's Dracula. Having played the Count in Hamilton Deane's Broadway version of Dracula, which started in 1927, Bela Lugosi was more than prepared for the role when it was time to commit it to film. Still struggling with the English language, however, he had to learn his lines phonetically. European accent in tact, he was able to deliver such memorable lines as, ""I bid you welcome,"" ""Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make,"" and, of course, ""I am Dracula."" His performance alone is reason enough to watch this monster movie classic. If only the rest of the film was as spectacular as Lugosi. Dwight Frye's Renfield, while perhaps a little too over-the-top, is still another highlight to the film, and even Edward Van Sloan's Van Helsing is enough to challenge the might of Count Dracula. The rest of the film is rather flat to me. Now, I know it was made in 1931, and that, at the time, it horrified audiences, but I still stand by my opinion that the overall movie pales in comparison to Bela Lugosi's performance. Everyone else just seemed to be going through the motions, and it seems especially evident while Helen Chandler and David Manners are on screen. They just aren't convincing. I'm not saying that their performances ruin the film. It is still a classic, and certainly worth a viewing, but if you are in the mood for a vampire movie that is worthy of Bram Stoker's name, look no further than F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu. It is much more convincing and even scarier than Tod Browning's Dracula, despite being nine years older and silent. All in all, though, one cannot overlook the stellar performance of Bela Lugosi in the role he was born to play!",Dracula
228,bjhadse,Lugosi Adds His Seductive Charisma to the Otherworldly Count,6,16 September 2011,"This canonical adaptation of Stoker's 1897 novel owes surprisingly little to its antecedent. Its primary source of inspiration was a 1924 stage play loosely based on the novel. Renfield (Dwight Frye) finds himself Transylvania to finalize the sale of Carfax Abby to Count Dracula, who the locals believe (correctly) is a vampire. Despite their desperate warnings, Renfield continues on to Castle Dracula, where he is enslaved and made insane by the vampiric count. They make their way to England, where Dracula sets his appetite on Mina (Helen Chandler). It's up to her fiancé (David Manners), her father (Herbert Bunston) and the illustrious Professor Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan).Produced in 1931 - shortly after the advent of sound (1927) - this early talkie bears the marks of its technological limitations. Non-diagetic sound (such as background music) is entirely absent from the film (save for the excerpt from ""Swan Lake"" that's played over the opening credits). While this sets the grave tone of the film, it leaves something missing to the contemporary viewer (which is why I would recommend the version of the film that features an astounding score by Philip Glass).Likewise, the acting is non-stylistically stiff; actors tend to not move around very much while speaking (due to the difficulty in capturing their dialog at the time). While this might add to the effect of the count being an upper-class gentleman, it mostly just prevents the actors from getting too into their roles.That said, however, the film features the finest early-sound acting I've yet to see. Bela Lugosi is absolutely hypnotic as Dracula, adding a romantic charm to the character that Max Shreck (Count Orlok in 1922's Nosferatu) could never give to the role. He presents a suave, sophisticated killer that, unlike Orlok, can blend into a society (both attending the theater and earning social invitations). As such, Lugosi's Dracula is a much more covert threat than his cinematic predecessor. Edward Van Sloan gives a terse performance as the stoic Professor Van Helsing, foiling Dracula's seductive charisma with reserved tones and jilting movement. The scene in which both characters square off against one another is the most memorable in the film.Dwight Frye positively scene-stealing as Renfield. He is able to articulate the proper young Victorian gent while also expressing his deepest levels of insanity later in the film. His wild-eyed stares (set against his maddening laughter) surpasses even Lugosi's own hypnotic close-ups. Despite playing the third-banana character, Frye gives the film's most unsettling and memorable performance.Enough cannot be set for the film's art direction as, aside from ""Frankenstein"" (1931), it gives us the most singularly enchanting settings of the decade. Castle Dracula is filled with vivid Gothic detail and lush extravagance. The stone stairwell where Dracula greets Renfield is haunting, even by today's standards. Standing in stark contrast to the decrepit ruins of the castle is the manor of Dr. Seward (Mina's father), which is clean, bright and modern (standing as the cultural foil of Dracula's Old World origins).While contemporary viewers might find the action a bit tame and the lack of background music a little frustrating, this canonical film deserves its status in the popular mindset. Fans of classic horror (1931-1941), vampires and the incredible creative talents that worked on this feature will find little to dislike with ""Dracula.""",Dracula
229,coy_dog0,Nosferatu is far superior.,7,16 September 2004,"Despite its usual *four star* rating, this movie is poorly directed and has only adequate acting and a flimsy script. The fact that it was filmed in 1931 does not excuse it. Film editing and directing was already advanced at the time of its production (Nosferatu--the German version of Bram Stoker's novel--is a far superior film), so the only explanation can be that, despite our fond memories, this film is a flop. Like the play that inspired it, action often takes place off-screen, with the characters offering expository to tell us what they're seeing. The story is hard to follow and director Tod Browning positions his camera like he's filming a staged play. Legosi's performance is classic, but the ridiculous close-ups with off-target eye-lights ruin any atmosphere established in the opening scenes. 6/10",Dracula
230,loveballet12,Definitely a different time period,4,26 June 2012,"Date: 26 June, 2012 -First Time Watch- I would have never picked out this movie by myself. Yet, I was forced to watch it since it was my sister's night to pick a movie for the family to see. Being a big vampire-werewolf fan she picked this movie, which would be alright for me since I'm a huge old Hollywood fan and I enjoy watching old movies. Well, I enjoy watching old movies just not this one. To begin, I found it interesting that while the story takes place in the 1800s, the people all wore 1930s clothing, making them look out of place with the setting. Different idea (one that upset my sister might I add) but not terrible. Then we go to Dracula's castle. I have to say, I couldn't stand Dracula's accent. It was to apparent and it seemed like Bela Lugosi was trying to hard. Then again, actors back in the 1930s did overact most of the time. Renfield, the poor guy who visits Dracula, then walks through a spider web. Dracula says he has a small spider going around. Small!? That web was huge! Looks like the spider who made it could eat a small dog! Dracula then took Renfield to his room for the night, which Dracula gives a long and awkward speech about. He then takes Renfield's suitcases and goes to another room. The door opens by itself! If I was Renfield, I would be scared. What door opens by itself? By the end of the night, Renfield becomes Dracula's slave so it really doesn't matter. Dracula and Renfield go to England aboard a ship and Renfield is found and put into a mental institution. Not a good one might I add. Renfield escapes like ten times! A bunch of other weird things happen throughout the movie, might I add but I don't feel like adding them. However, I will mention the funniest part. When Mina is visited by the bat, you can see the string the fake bat is on! Come on! And it doesn't even move! What the heck? After watching the movie, I was relieved. But, here's the thing about old movies that I've learned. You can't judge it on the year you're watching it in, but on the year it came out. And I guess for the year it came out in, 1931, it was good. I mean, brilliant since I read afterwords that when people first saw it, some fainted in horror. I almost did too. But, in a different way.4/10",Dracula
231,theblackscythe,One of the most important and influential horror films ever.,7,16 October 2014,"(Halloween Horror Reviews #7)Tod Browning's Dracula is a landmark. Not simply among horror films, but a landmark for all of cinema. It played a vital role in moving the horror genre into the sound era, and setting the blueprints for the various other 'monster' films that followed throughout the 30's and 40's. It also cemented the Universal brand as being the chief mass entertainers of the age, with their brand of Gothic horror leaving a gigantic mark on film history. However, outside of this titanic influence, does the film still hold up after 83 years?Firstly the acting. Bela Lugosi's Dracula is truly immortal and has not aged a day. It still holds as a perfect example of actor and character becoming one, and there is a reason that Lugosi stands as the iconic Dracula, despite innumerable other renditions of the character. Dwight Frye is also wonderful as Renfield, bringing chilling creepiness to every scene he inhabits. He also carries a sympathetic weight and tragedy throughout adding layers to the role. Between these two, the acting is already a treat regardless of the other performances. Edward Van Sloan is the only other performance of note, filled with the authoritative dignity the man was renown for. However despite these great stars in the leading roles, the supporting cast is a massive letdown. Average at best, distressingly bland and wooden at worst. Many scenes begin to slump together as a result of these limp performances. Overall however the acting does stand strong due to the leads, but suffers from uneven support.The set design and imagery is stunning. One of the most iconic Gothic mansion ever put to film features in the opening, a true treat for a fan. However the visuals do dip slightly upon arrival in England, where more generic period sets feature. Some nice lighting and creepy highlights (a sequence featuring live rats running around in a coffin filled basement in particular) do keep the momentum of the opening go throughout however, so overall the sets and imagery do hold up well. The cinematography is far more dated, it is often stiff and doesn't take full advantage of the locations. This fault was fixed in the alternate Spanish version of the film, with far more haunting camera movements.The lacking score is a dividing point for many. Some view it as creepy and ambient, where's other feel it is awkward and an example of the holdover elements from silent cinema. I personally agree more with the later, however it does work at times (the rat sequence once again springs to mind).Overall the film is still strong. However when compared to the work's of contemporaneous director 'James Whale' (who also made monster films for Universal), it is clear that it is severely lacking in polish and shows its age far more than it really should. There is enough immortal material here to warrant its continuous status as a classic. However many elements hold it back, not least of which is an almost laughably anti-climatic climax and ending which leave an oddly sour taste in the mouth.",Dracula
232,Dorkboss,The Legendary Dracula,8,3 October 2019,"One of the most well-known films of the Universal Horror, the epitome of classic horror, and the definition icon of the popular vampire, DraculaThe plot tells that a man named Renfield who is traveling to Transylvania to have a business meeting with Count Dracula in his castle. The villagers try to stop him, but he refused to listen, Dracula welcomes Renfield to the castle as they discuss Dracula's intention to lease Carfax Abbey in London. After hypnotizing Renfield to become his mindless slave, they travel to London on the ship and now Dracula has come to seek out fresh living blood in the streets of London.While it not the very first Dracula film in the theater (if anyone is familiar with either Dracula's Death 1921 & Nosferatu); but it is the first film to gain popularity from the public and main actor himself Bela Lugosi who started the folklore of the character that will become the best Dracula of all time, Lugosi has that evil presence whenever he starts to stare at you, giving you both a chill and terror that made him steal the show whenever he's on-screen. Dwight Frye as Renfield is also gives a good performance as Dracula's slave. The movie also has a slow and creepy dreamlike atmosphere to it; since this was the first sound horror movie, they didn't add any music to the film (not counting the opening) and because of that, when there's no dialogue in the scene, theirs hardly any audio to it, but that does help to add to the creepy atmosphere which makes this film the definitive chiller and the best Dracula movie.There are only two downsides that I can give to the movie that is personally my opinion. The first one is that the actress Helen Chandler playing as Mina Seward, I felt like her performance was stiff and the second downside is that while Lucy has become a vampire as it being read and told from a newspaper, her character is now gone from the film and never explained what happened to her, because in the book, Van Helsing was suppose to drive a wooden stake to her heart to free her soul.Overall: Dracula is a wonderful classic with its good writing, good performance (especially with Bela Lugosi) great atmosphere that makes this movie a beloved classic by all horror fans including myself.",Dracula

Lugosi is still the best Dracula, but the Spanish version is much better directed.  More use is made of the sets, effects are spookier and the ladies aren't buttoned up to their chins.And Renfield gets a lovely scene, cut in the English version, where he leaves off talking sanely and politely to Van Helsing in order to stalk a fly.  Pablo Álvarez Rubio and Dwight Frye give completely individual touches to Renfield.  Rubio is slightly more three-dimensional.  Frye is eerier and more memorable.As for the Phillip Glass score that has been added to the English version: It should be background music for Teletubbies.  It is the blandest, most repetitive music I've ever heard.  It's the scoring equivalent of ""99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall.""At least, as my wife has suggested, if Randy Newman had been hired there would have been a hit song...

234,Evil_Magus,"Classic, Sure, But it Could Have Been Better.",7,27 July 2006,"Made in the very early years of ""talkies"", Dracula remains to this day a classic of cinema, and for good reason. However, this film is not without it's flaws. In fact, they're quite numerous. But an excellent set design and Bela Lugosi's performance are really what make this film what it is.The acting in this movie hits a very wide spectrum, and ranges from brilliant to terrible, although mostly staying within the realm of average. Bela Lugosi, who plays Dracula, gives and absolutely classic performance in this movie. His accent is perfect, and his slow, steady and very deliberate deliverance of his lines are flawless. He captures the essence of Dracula, the very core of evil.Dwight Frye, however, was terrible. He gives, easily, one of the worst and over-acted performances that has ever been captured on film. Everything he does is so over-the-top that it ruins the character. He so obviously tries to act crazy that he just comes off as laughable on screen.The rest of the acting was rather average. Edward van Sloan, who plays Van Helsing, gives the only other memorable above-average performance in this movie. He knows his character, and portrays him as he should be, a little underacted while still giving off a commanding presence.The direction of this film is atrocious. The shots that are meant to be serious are comical, the ones that should be horrific barely manage to touch the viewer. A ridiculous amount of time is devoted to Lugosi's eyebrows, and seriously subtracts from this film. If James Whale, instead of Tod Browning, had directed this movie I have no doubt that it would rank at least a full point higher. As it stands, though, the direction does nothing but get into the film's way.The set designs are simply superb. Count Dracula's castle is powerful and atmospheric. While it's not as the book describes it, it does much to add to the film's tone and charm. The Harker's home has a wonderful classic touch to it, and looks just as one would expect a Victorian estate to look; impeccable, proper and richly decorated.Except for the beginning, there is no musical score in the entire movie. I'm inclined to think that this might be, perhaps, due to it being 1931 (only four years since the first sound motion picture, The jazz Singer). After watching Frankenstein (1931), I'm even more sure of this. But this is still one of the film's greatest downfalls. The utter silence throughout the entire film brings focus to every excruciating little detail throughout, and brings out every flaw and every imperfection. Every moment stretches exponentially, and every minor defect is exaggerated more than it should be. If you get the opportunity, watch this movie with Philip Glass' modern score rendition for this movie. It smooths the entire film over and raises it to a new level.This is a movie that every horror fan and fan of classic movies should watch. In fact, this is one of the movies that I feel that has become so ingrained into our culture, that has become such a pillar of film-making, everybody should see it at least once in their lifetime.",Dracula

But I wonder what might have been if, in the late 1920s, Universal's top director Paul Leni had directed Conrad Veidt in the role of the Count. I have heard that Papa Laemmle wanted Veidt and Laemmle Jr. wanted Lon Chaney. Whether or not this is true, German director Leni and German actor Veidt had developed a rapport, teaming twice before in the the German film ""Waxworks"" and in ""The Man Who Laughs"" for Universal. If you want to know how much better the performances and camera-work would have been, watch these films.It was obvious in 1931 that Tod Browning, without his old pal Chaney, could not get excited by the project. Some in the cast gave German émigré cinematographer Karl Freund credit for directing much of the film.But in spite of the troubled production ""Dracula"" was a box office smash. Critics, however, focused their praise on Freund's eerily atmospheric photography in the Transylvania sequence, commenting on the film's stiffness when the action shifts to London. Unsure of Lugosi's appeal, Universal hadn't risked any more than absolutely necessary on production, and Browning's lack of interest made the budget limitations even more obvious.You hear excuses for ""Dracula's"" staginess, but you only have to see the Spanish version to realize sound equipment didn't necessarily immobilize the camera. And it isn't enough to blame depression-era production cuts. The limits of a sound stage didn't limit James Whale's creativity on ""The Old Dark House."" The film may have come alive if it had been made as a silent a few years earlier. In non-talking film you have to show the horrors; you can't convey horror through dialog as was attempted in 1931. Too much dialog makes any film static. Lon Chaney might have changed that. While his acting may not have matched Veidt's, his make-up would surely have been a revelation, and most likely would have followed Bram Stoker's description of the Count, his pallid ""aquiline"" face, his ""peculiarly arched nostrils,"" ""hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere,"" his ""massive eyebrows almost meeting over the nose,"" with a ""heavy mustache,"" and ""sharp white teeth"" protruding over his lip. ""For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed.""However, B-list directors seemed to have a knack for this kind of material. They never felt the subject matter was beneath them. Therefore George Melford, director of the Spanish version, was challenged by the project in a way Tod Browning was not. Later Browning, as if to prove he could match Melford, directed ""Mark of the Vampire,"" a remake of his own silent ""London After Midnight,"" with a flair that Dracula lacked, and followed it up with another stylish horror flick, ""The Devil Doll."" Alas, Leni died of blood poisoning, Chaney died of cancer, and Veidt returned to Germany in part because he believed his German accent was too strong to appeal to American audiences. Irony of ironies, Universal cast Lugosi whose struggles with English are well documented. Lugosi quickly, and deservedly, faded into obscurity, and what might have been a cinematic achievement is nothing more than a cult classic.",Dracula
236,dreammaster4,The Bible of Vampire movie!,10,18 July 2000,This is THE best vampire movie of all time.Bela Lugosi made a terrific job at playing Count dracula.The script and the way they made this movie is very unique.It's one of those movies that once you've seen it you will never forget it.Fantastic!,Dracula
237,dgeer80,One of the best,10,4 May 2004,"Only this film and Nosferatu have achieved what a true vampire film should achieve. I can't put my finger on it, but I guess that it's because of the fact that rather showing everything, they suggest it - like when Dracula goes for his victims. It always fades out or happens out of the view of the camera.Also, this film captures an atmosphere that has only been captured during this time period. Young Frankenstein got close to being a perfect representation of this atmosphere, but that was a comedy.
I don't think it would work that well with young audiences today that haven't been exposed to these old horror classics. Usually when they are exposed to movies like Dracula, they're unable look at them in their historical context, therefore not enjoying them. They may be cheesy and not really scary now. But for the time period they were released in, this was incredibly creepy and scary.So I rate this film a 10, simply because it was top notch horror for the day, and you can't change it to make it to today's standards unless you remake the film. And hey, Bela Lugosi still freaks ME out!",Dracula
238,hr-boege-546-170392,a must see,10,18 February 2013,"this is the best horror movie i have ever seen. without all the effects, modern horror movies are full of, it makes you fear the character of Dracula. the well written story and the performance of Lugosi, will bound you to the TV. the best thing about this movie in my opinion, is the performances of Lugosi and the actor playing renfield. there is no doubt that Lugosi is Dracula, and created the classic image of Dracula. the actor playing the insane renfield also does a great job. if you are a horror fan i will highly recommend this movie. it is a good break from all the slashing and special effects, that fills modern horror movies. i will also recommend it for not horror fans, because the story is so good, and the acting is a delight.",Dracula
239,plato-11,"The original ""Nosferatu"" doesn't even come close to this one.",10,29 December 1999,"I love this movie. Bela Lugosi as Dracula and Dwight Frye as Renfield are especially good. The German ""Nosferatu"" isn't even half as good, and the vampire in that one doesn't even have the redeeming social graces that Lugosi's Dracula did. The movie has all of the unfortunate limitations of early talkies, and therefore is quite creaky to today's audiences. David Manners' romantic lead is a one note role, which is unfortunate because these are the types of roles for which he is best remembered. This movie was released a year after his stunning performance in James Whale's ""Journey's End"", in which his role was much meatier.",Dracula
240,martinr,Underwhelming,5,15 October 2001,"After reading the book, I must say that I am quite underwhelmed by this film.  The acting all around is some of the most wooden I have ever seen - the characters were utterly without any interest whatsoever.  The storyline was simplified and distilled down to the point of being ""Dracula for Dummies"".  The sets were very nice, and Bela Lugosi and the special effects for the movie were fun in a campy sort of way.  However, the movie on the whole was just boring.  It didn't have any of the intensity of the book. The 1992 version of Dracula is much better, although it has its own problems.  If you want a good horror movie from the 30's, I would recommend The Old Dark House instead, which is great fun to watch.",Dracula
241,b-gallagher2,Dracula,8,16 February 2011,"This film, the original Dracula is just outstanding. The film is unbelievably eerie and spooky. This is a true classic horror film that horror fanatics must see. The film being made in 1931 demonstrates what a real horror movie is. In most modern contemporary horror films are intelligence is insulted by most directors lack of ability to allow us to imagine and fill in the blanks of the suspense. They do this by simply revealing to much information and showing to much of the action and drama. (when you see a movie with so much gore, blood and violence). This modern style of conventional horror films is just to revealing and quite honestly just disturbing. It transforms the movie from being scary, eerie and/or spooky to just down right disturbing, gross and revealing. In doing that, we as the audience have no room to imagine or re-create the plot and story. But the wonderful genre of horror was not always like that, classic horror films can be some of the scariest movies ever made because they keep the ""horror"" aspect of the movie very hidden so by the climax it can completely unexpectedly surprise you. That's what makes a good horror, it's what you don't see that is truly frightening. Dracula is a perfect example, this movie was not to revealing and that's what made it so spooky. (Plus Bela Lugosi's classic stare of death is just one of the scariest images in cinema). Everyone knows the story of count Dracula, but the fact that the film's dramatic events stayed somewhat hidden is what allowed us to imagine the movie ourselves and really fill in the Verisimilitude.",Dracula
242,ChristophCinema,Bats all folks!,8,5 October 2012,"Just like ""Frankenstein"" (1931), Tod Browning's ""Dracula"" from 1931 is often criticized for not being faithful to the book. And just like ""Frankenstein"", fans could care less. Once again, this is a movie that is so classic, and so iconic, that it doesn't matter if it does justice to the book or not. Just like how Boris Karloff set the popular image of Frankenstein's monster, Bela Lugosi set the popular image of Dracula. His clothing, his haunting stare, his rhythmic voice, Bela Lugosi is Dracula. This movie also has one of my favorite movie quotes of all time: ""Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make"". Now since this movie was the first sound horror movie (well technically it was ""The Cat Creeps"", but that film is lost), there isn't much sound other than dialogue. The lack of a soundtrack may bother people, but to me, that just makes the movie much more haunting. Even though I love this movie, I still know it has its fair share of flaws. A lot of the side characters aren't very memorable, and the ending is kind of rushed, but those flaws don't really bother me. For the first sound horror movie, it's still great. I love the over the top acting. I love the fake bats. I love the Gothic sets. I love classic monster movies like this. This movie may not be for everyone, and I would have to admit that there are better vampire movies out there (""Nosferatu"", ""Let the Right One In"", the Hammer ""Dracula"" series, and ""Spanish Dracula""), but this is a must see for any classic horror buff. Bela Lugosi and Dwight Frye steal the show with their haunting and over the top performances, but the rest of the cast is still very good. I don't think this movie is a good as ""Frankenstein"" (1931), but it is still one of the most iconic and most innovative horror flicks of all time. It may be flawed, but that's OK with me. I understand the time it was made and how there were limits on what they could do with their budget, so I think it should not be overlooked. There may be vampires in it, but this film definitely does not suck!",Dracula
243,thepartyoftea,"Dracula, the film that started it all",8,20 August 2006,"Dracula (1931) Dracula, the film that started it all. Dracula is the first film to feature the dark lord of the undead and the character has been in over 700 films since, only being toppled by Sherlock Holmes. The film is based on the play version of the book by Bram Stoker. The book was inspired by Slain Castle, Whitby (where the count lives while in England), and Cruden Bay in Scotland and the history of Tepes Valad, a warlord. While in Cruden Bay, Bram's friends and relatives were afraid of him while he planned out the book. He would sit in front of the typewriter for hours on end. Despite rumors, Bram Stoker had never been to Transylvania. Dracula, the book, did not take off until after the author's death, but quickly became a must read after the movie. Due to the Depression the movie had a limited budget and is a lot different then the epic book, Bram Stoker's Dracula(1992) is the closest to the book movie to date.The strength of Dracula is the main character played by Bella Lugosi. His haunting portrayal of the title character is legendary. Bella didn't know much English and had to pronounce each syllable separately. Due to his poor English skills, he did not mingle with the rest of the crew, rumors also have it that he wanted to stay in character, but the cast and crew were impressed by him. As one of his few demands, Bella also did his own make up for his role. Bella's portrayal of Dracula was so good that it caused him to be type-casted for the rest of his career. Bella was even buried wearing one of the capes he wore in the in a stage version. Bauhaus, legendary goth rockers' first single was a song called ""Bella Lugosi's Dead"", it made references to Dracula and if Bella really was a vampire. Bella's performance went on to scare people to the point of fainting in the movie theater and providing hunting's on TV starting in 1957 and been giving kids nightmares ever since. Rumour also has it that the infamous Hannibal Lector's slurping sound in Silence of the Lambs was inspired by when Dracula sees Renfield's blood.Unlike vampire movies to come, Dracula in this film did not have fangs, Dracula is killed off stand and there were armadillos in Dracula's castle. Armadillos are not native to Europe or England. However, because Dracula was the first film with the title character, it became the staple of Dracula films including: Starting in Transylvania with Renfield as the real estate agent instead of Jonathan Harker, cutting several characters, including an American who's knife eventually kills the count, Dracula being staked in England and several things are changed from the book. In Stoker's book vampires don't sleep in coffins, vampires don't cast shadows either and the no reflection in a mirror was invented by Stoker.The movie's special effects may appear to be cheesy by today's standards. But the fake flapping bat, the piecing gaze of Dracula, the walk through the spider web and Dracula coming out of his coffin has frightened people to nightmares. The overwhelming performance of then unknown actor Bella Lugosi sealed the movie as one of the scariest and influential roles in movie history.",Dracula

The only one who can stop the vampire is Prof. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan).thoughts: In my opinion, this is not the best ""Dracula"" adaptation. To me, NOSFERATU (1922) and Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 version were a lot better. But this still holds up as one of the greatest horror classics of all time.The one thing this adaptation holds above the rest is the amazing performance of Bela Lugosi as the Count. He was charming, creepy and even a bit sexy (and I'm a guy). I also loved Edward Van Sloan, who was great as Van Helsing.Two more things that made this a classic were the creepy and atmospheric directing with Tod Browning behind the camera, and also the creepy score. I'll also give a special mention to the version with Phillip Glass' beautiful score, although it sometimes distracts you from the dialog.",Dracula
245,Steamcarrot,I never drink......wine,6,23 November 2006,"The daddy of all Dracula movies and I'm not forgetting Nosferatu. Quite how Dracula impersonations would be these days without this film is hard to think. This film was responsible for the Universal series of horror films, which in turn gave the impetus for Hammer and so on and so forth, but how does the film stand up today? Well it's a mixed bag. On one side you have glorious sets, magnificent atmosphere and great helmsmanship from Tod Browning. On the other hand you have hammy acting, incredibly stilted scenes and some lackadaisical helmsmanship from Tod Browning. The early scenes in Transylvania alone make this film a must see. The atmosphere is lead-heavy with foreboding and Lugosi's first words are electric. However when we move to Britain pace all but disappears as Browning seems to be doing his job while asleep. It becomes very apparent that this is a version of a stage play rather than an adaptation of Stoker's novel and we get too much talk. It's not all bad though, and Browning wakes up occasionally to give a nice set piece or two and the ending is particularly good. To be fair to Tod Browning, talkies were relatively new and they were still struggling to master the new medium. Out of this comes one of my favourite things about this film-the almost total lack of score. This, for me, help a lot with building what suspense there was; rather than the music trying to direct your thoughts, you are left free in the silence to scare yourself (or not, it's your choice!). In fact there are a lot of long silences, which are probably a remnant from the silent days. On the whole a film that must be seen because of its' importance and a very enjoyable one, but maybe not the classic it's remembered to be.",Dracula

It simply did not sit well with me, as I was also reading the book when I watched this. On the whole, it is dull, disconcerting and mediocre.The acting was much too stiff and awkward, particularly in the beginning scenes. Some lines seem forced, and several actors appear to be having trouble ""acting naturally"". Edward Van Sloan's portrayal of Dr. Van Helsing is closer to the character written by Stoker than Peter Cushing's later performance, though it is Cushing that I prefer in the role.The movie bears little to no resemblance to the book, and just would have been better without the artistic license.",Dracula

I saw the 1991 Dracula before I saw this one so maybe thats why I like it better than Frankenstein. Personally I like the newer movies better compared to the older ones and part of that is my fault because i grew up watching the new ones, and never took advantage of the older movies. I never learned to appreciate what the old movies meant to people and how far they have come until i took this class.

Let me start off by saying it blows my mind that this movie was released only 34 years after Dracula was created by Bram Stoker in 1897.This movie is grand, and ambitious for the time. There are large sets and some great shots. That being said this movie does have be graded based on it's time. Being released in 1931 it came out only 4 years after the first ""talkie"" or movie with audio was released. That is an amazing achievement.However watching now the acting is clunky, Dracula's feeding and ""attacks"" are slow and funny and there are some pretty severe limitations based on the knowledge and talent of film makers.I am excited to dig into the rest of the box set and see how Dracula compares to others like Frankenstein, Wolf Man and the Mummy.",Dracula
249,steelcorpfilms,A classic vampire movie.,8,3 September 2001,"It's been so long since I saw this movie that it was almost like seeing it for the first time.  Although I've known the story of Dracula pretty well for quite some time, I still think that this film was very well done.  The acting, in my opinion, was superb, especially Lugosi, who's mere presence was eerie.  The writing and dialogue was very good, making a good balance of drama, horror, and even a little comedy relief.I watched the remastered DVD version of this movie, which gave me the option of hearing new music by Philip Glass and performed by the Chronos Quartet. I must say the new music was great.  It added to the general atmosphere terrifically and set the mood.  The music alone was generally haunting and mixed with the movie fit like a glove.  The print on the DVD was very good quality, considering that the film is from 1931 and the sound quality is excellent.Even as good as it was, there were still flaws, as there are with any movie. The special effects were definitely cheesy.  The bats and spiders were obviously puppets on strings, but again, the fact that it was made in 1931 means that that could be forgiven.  The major problem I had was the ending, which seemed rushed and left a lot hanging.  It left plot elements hanging wide open and it just felt like the movie should have gone on for a few minutes more to tie everything up.Dracula is definitely an awesome movie well worth all of its praise and lives up to expectations even 70 years later.

Using his vampire powers and gentleman charm he travels off to find his mate. Bela Jugos played the role of Count Dracula perfectly.

I feel that this movie had a disadvantage as being the first film adaptation of the Dracula story, the later adaptations had a better grip on how to make Dracula his scariest. Movies during this time didn't use much realistic violence, but I feel that the film could have used more gore. The lighting is definitely unique throughout the film and sets the dreary mood for Castle Dracula as well as the boat trip and other scenes.

This isn't the type of movie that will scare you nowadays, back in the 1930's it may have though. The photography is excellent and the picture is very clear throughout the movie. My main complaint is the acting. The movie is very drawn out and slow, instead of Dracula being dominant and being a scary blood sucking vampire he instead moves very slowly and gives the victim time to simple run away; but -- unrealistically the victims always seem to stand and scream and allow Dracula to bite their neck instead of simply running away while he is slow lowering his face to their neck. I'm guessing that this is the way it is because of the ratings board and censorship back in the 1930s. Today there are obviously much scarier movies and because of that this movie just didn't seem to frighten me whatsoever.Overall I rated the movie a 7 because the sound and photography are excellent; and it's one of the earlier horror movies. Truth is, without movies like the original Dracula; today's horror movies would be much different.",Dracula

The opening of the film is amazing and excites the viewer for whats to come. The composition of the film is great and the sets/props are well-made and authentic . For a film that was released in 1931 it is beyond it's time. Though it is not entirely accurate to Bram strokers original novel, it comes closer than any other renditions that have been made.

Dracula seemed to be more of a stalker in a cape then a vicious vampire ready to suck your blood. I think that John Harker was an interesting character, I think that Harker would've been a really awesome character if character development had been better. I thought the affects were funny.

Bela Lugosi makes it hard to forget his name with his cold and stoic expressions, as well as his wonderfully accented one-liners. He did a phenomenal job.However, I found the story to be very slow. The beginning started off at a good pace, but then it slowed until the end. The end actually seemed a bit rushed-Blink and you could've missed a very important part of the story. At times it also got very boring and I found myself losing focus on the film at multiple times. I did like the use of depth throughout the film. I liked it a lot actually. For example, in many of the castle scenes, the camera was set so you could see many different layers of a shot. I don't know if this was intentional, but they also has the ghosts of the women placed in different spots, really making the castle seem like a huge, deep place. I just really liked how they utilized the spaces throughout the entire film. Also, the use of lighting, especially over Dracula's eyes, I thought was really great.

The superb cinematography alone is reason enough to watch it. The mise-en-scene that Browning creates is truly incredible when thinking about the time that this movie was made in (1931.) The attention to detail is so fine you would swear that it all actually happened. One of what is perhaps the most impressive scene in the movie takes place in Dracula's manor and when you see these giant cobwebs and the sweeping way the camera travels up the staircase you're so captivated you'd swear the movie was created in this century, not 40 years ago. Bela Lugosi also portrays what is probably the most incredible Dracula to date so with the cinematography and all too impressive acting, this film is not one to be missed.",Dracula

The first fifteen minutes are wonderful. The photography and set design are outstanding and capture the eerie atmosphere of Bram Stoker's novel. These opening scenes are the only ones taken from the book; after that the movie becomes merely a photographed record of a tedious stage play. As has been mentioned previously Universal originally planned to film Dracula as a ""super-production"" based entirely on the book and starring Conrad Veidt. Had the depression not killed those plans this might well have been the definitive version of the Stoker novel. Veidt was (to my mind) a better actor than Lugosi and physically better suited to the role, and as I said the first fifteen minutes show what a superb job Universal could do when basing the material on the book and not the play. As it is this Dracula is pretty tough to sit through. Hammer's version with Christopher Lee still captures the spirit of the source better than any other I've seen.",Dracula
258,jul-kinnear,This movie will continue to cement the Count's immortality for generations to come.,10,28 October 2014,"Universal Studio's 1931 production of Dracula is loosely based on Bram Stoker's Victorian novel of the same name. I say ""loosely"" because the majority of the film is the work of film director Todd Browning and bears little resemblance to Stoker's literary masterpiece. Don't be fooled, though, because the film is just as powerful and as engaging as Stoker's original story.Bela Lugosi won the role of the Count (again) after Universal's first choice, Lon Chaney, passed away prematurely from throat cancer. So, in this respect, the passing of a silent horror star made way for the birth of a new, talking horror star. Lugosi electrified movie audiences with his eerie portrayal of a man hungry for blood. The film begins as Renfield (Dwight Frye) makes his way to the Count's mountaintop abode in Transylvania. He is meeting the mysterious Hungarian aristocrat in order to finalize the lease on a dilapidated structure called Carfax Abbey, which is situated in London, England, and which the Count has recently purchased. Not long after meeting Dracula, Renfield is rendered insane and is committed to Doctor Seward's (Herbert Bunston) psychiatric asylum located just steps away from Dracula's recent acquisition, Carfax Abbey.ow that Count Dracula and Renfield are both ensconced in London, England, all havoc breaks loose — from innocent flower girls dropping dead in the streets to performances of the Royal Ballet's Swan Lake being infiltrated by an evil Hungarian bloodsucker on the prowl. Soon, the women in this film are dropping like flies. First, the love-struck Lucy (Frances Dade) is brought down, and then her best friend — and Jonathan Harker's (David Manners) fiancée — Mina (Helen Chandler) is pursued. Clearly, Dracula has an insatiable appetite for women of the meek and blonde variety.Thankfully Mina's demise is stalled by the ever-alert Abraham Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), who clashes with Dracula from the very start. Van Helsing is an expert on mysterious ailments and mythical creatures of the night. He identifies the Count as the girls' assailant almost immediately. Van Helsing's will is strong and he is able to battle Dracula better than anybody else. It is truly a battle of brains and brawn between these two formidable characters, and watching them go head to head is a real treat! As we previously mentioned, Van Sloan and Lugosi had worked together before on the 1927 stage version of Dracula, and their on screen chemistry is just fantastic.Lugosi is an absolute delight to watch — well, aside from the fact that he can't seem to stop preying upon defenceless young women. Simply speaking, Lugosi was born to play the role of Count Dracula. Even if you have never seen this film before and are unfamiliar with Lugosi, his image is still the first one you picture when someone mentions the ubiquitous Transylvanian count. He was handsome, rather than grotesque, and that is one of the biggest reasons why his variation of the Count was considered so dangerous. He embodies Count Dracula from the top of his head through to his long claw-like hands, down to his expertly shined shoes. His long cape flutters behind him, almost dancing along as he hunts down innocent females to feed upon.If you are new to this film, one of the first things you will notice is that there is no musical soundtrack. Some may view that as a negative, but upon closer inspection, the silence that ensues in the most frightening scenes actually adds to the story's intense atmosphere. Together with the lack of mood music, the cinematography and camera-work in Dracula are quite impressive, considering the film's age and how new this medium still was back in the early 1930s. The close-ups of the Count are chill inducing and the images that were captured on film really stay with you for hours and even days afterwards! It will be a long while before I sleep with my window open ever again; that is for sure.The set design and decoration is typical of most 1930s era films (heavily influenced by the Art Deco movement), especially the scenes set in Carfax Abbey. Just one glimpse of that humongous twisting stone staircase sets my heart on fire! Though Count Dracula is a wealthy aristocrat, his living spaces are primitive and decrepit and they beautifully illustrate his very nature as a monster. On the other end of the spectrum, Doctor Seward's living and working quarters are very robust and welcoming, warm and inviting, ostentatious yet practical for a man who studies medicine and psychiatry.Dracula has left an indelible mark on movie audiences since its premiere in 1931. It is widely considered a cult horror classic unrivalled by many of today's modern horror fare. Mention it to anyone who has seen it before and their eyes will inevitably light up as they begin offering you tales of the first time they sat down to watch the movie. It is a film that will continue to live on well past our lifetimes, cementing the Count's immortality for generations to come.http://juliekinnear.com/blogs/movies-realtors-Dracula",Dracula
259,joedebritz,First Vampire Film,7,11 February 2015,"It seems as though today, films rely completely on special effects to instill fear in the viewer. The true measure of a horror film is one that is inherently scary without using the crutch of modern film tricks. Dracula absolutely embodies that concept. The acting is spectacular. Dracula is creepy in a way that can really affect you. The acting is extremely well executed. Count Dracula is as believable of a vampire as I have ever seem. Not to mention this film basically pioneered the genre of horror. Hard to believe in a world where t is so omnipresent. The dark sets, along with the eerily silent nature of the film really adds to the effect of horror. At the time this came out, I can imagine it was utterly terrifying.",Dracula
260,ctladybird,A dark and beautiful film.,8,14 March 2014,"The film I watched had music composed by Phillip Glass in 2000. It is beautiful and truly sets the mood. muddy greys and enveloping blacks with stark whites peeking out from the sea of black. Sharp music that punctuates each scene. Everything about this film is meant to set the mood. The film itself is a work of art in the monster film madness. I can see where many future film makers got their inspiration. You could easily say that Bela Lugosi's Dracula was the start of the ""Sexy vampire"" trend (albeit his Dracula is equal parts beautiful and dangerous, unlike twilight vampires). I recommend this film to anyone looking to get into the origins of monster movies.",Dracula
261,thecole777,Sweet.,7,15 December 2011,"I love all the old monster movies like Frankenstein and The Wolf Man and of course Dracula too. I love all the dark lighting throughout the movie and the spot of light right on Dracula's eyes when he does his trance thing on the guy near the beginning. The whole setting was awesome and I loved the architecture of Dracula's castle, it really added to the mood of the movie. And Bela Lugosi's performance was great as well of course. His voice made Dracula. I have not seen the Spanish version so I can't compare it but I really like this version so it would have to be pretty good to out-do it. Dracula should've survived in the end just because he's so awesome. Thankfully he comes back in the sequels.",Dracula
262,b-kelly13,"""To die, to really be dead, must be glorious."" -Count Dracula",9,20 October 2010,"""Dracula"" was a tremendous movie. It is a great horror movie for the time in which it was made. It is not so scary that it will keep you up at night, but it definitely gives you chills and gets your mind thinking and questioning. I loved the setting of Count Dracula's castle. It really sets the scene for the movie and gets your mind right into the castle. It was a big old stone castle, with spider webs up and down the walls; you hear wolves howling in the background, and a dark lit set. Count Dracula's accent makes him all the mysterious and eerie. The story of the film was also great, a mysterious man who needs blood to live. The actor played the role of Dracula perfectly.The only negatives of this film were the special effects. For example the flying bats were very unrealistic. They were massive rubber bats on a string, and the wings would barely flap, which made for a good laugh. Another negative in my opinion is that I wished they actually showed when Dracula actually bit his ""victims."" It always seemed to move on to the next scene right when he was about to bite! The ending was also very questionable, it leaves you hanging. Was Mina actually a vampire or not?",Dracula
263,jrippz,A whole lot of blood sucking family fun?!,10,18 October 2010,"What was the hit feel-good comedy of the 1931? Why, good sir or madame, it was of course Dracula. The family will laugh out loud at Dracula as he attempts to be a cool dude. I watched in disbelief as he charmed the men and the ladies. He turned Renfield into an idiot, and he may do the same to you. Like Superman, Dracula seems to be in possession of unrelated powers that suck, like a make believe wolf transformation(which he tricks everyone into believing he has(watch out: He may do the same to you!), and a dangerous transformation into a Party Warehouse bat(the top offender). My favorite scene was where John was gracefully swatting away the bat from Mina, while muttering concerns about it getting in her hair. God, that really hit home. I mean, who the heck wants bats in their hair?! I sure as heck don't. And the director's camera and editor seems have a fetish with Bella Legosi close up shots! This movie just reeks of hit comedy. David Letterman even went back in time under the name of Edward Van Sloan to make a cameo appearance as Van Helsing. In the words of Renfield: Stupid, stupid, stupid!",Dracula

Back in the 30s this was considered a wonderful movie, not only for it's wonderful locations and film work, but for the story itself. The black and white gave it a sense of spookiness that old horror movies have and cannot be recreated with the movies today even though today it is better color and recreations.The movie seemed to skip around a lot and at times was hard to follow and there were some facts that you did not understand until a scene or two later. It also seemed to be moving too quickly because they tried to fit everything into the movie which made it seemed rushed. However even with its flaws, I enjoyed the movie very much.",Dracula
265,alexv1208,Review of Dracula (1931),6,18 October 2010,"Dracula, similar to Frankenstein helped shaped the horror film genre. Although Dracula was released not long before Frankenstein, it seemed to have more flaws in terms of it's camera-work and acting. Some scenes are not up to the standard I had for the film. Overall the acting just wasn't convincing enough. There wasn't enough emphasis and expression of emotion to draw in the viewer, with the exception of when Dracula bites Mina's neck; that instance is a trademark for the film, and it provides a sense of fear, but really the only moment when things are slightly scary. Although Dracula is considered a horror film, there isn't much about it that's really frightening. The camera-work was great in some scenes, such as when the camera followed the horse-drawn carriage, as Dracula made his first appearance in the film. However, there were often too many static shots; the camera didn't provide enough movement in the film, to really draw the viewers eye, and give a feel of verisimilitude.",Dracula
266,topeka_brooks,75th Anniversary edition ... a historical treat,10,17 January 2017,"Dracula (1931) starring Bela Lugosi - born Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó - is a classic. This review is of the 75th Anniversary Edition with 2 discs.To fully enjoy the film, one must turn back the clock, and understand the artists labored under incredible pressure not to produce the work we see on the screen.Much is made of unfair, official censorship, but Dracula faced enormous pressure from the filmmaking industry's prejudices too. They were not interested in supernatural horror, and its prejudiced view of its audience - they thought the audience would not accept the supernatural elements despite the critical dependence on our cultural heritage. Sound familiar? The film was a first in so many categories, it's hard to hit them all. And the film was an escapist fairy-tale of good and evil dropped into a world where good and evil were literally fighting on the streets. The Great Depression was in full swing, and though WW2 was ten years away for Americans, many nations were already gearing up for the war.The 75th Anniversary edition (75th) offers a digitally remastered version of Browning's 1931 classic. This means fans like me - I've seen the movie a dozen times - get a chance to see the film largely restored. (To quibble: The gray scale saturation restoration could be better, but hey - I'm not complaining - just warning you that it is not as good as e.g. the Sherlock Holmes restoration done as the auspices of the UCLA film school. If you only know the film from poor quality re-runs, you will be very impressed.) But that's not all. The 75th has two excellent commentaries: One by film historian David Skal, and one by screenwriter Steve Haberman. (Haberman was co-author of Dead and Loving it) The first disc also offer a short documentary about the making of Dracula - featuring Carla Laemmle. Carla is the niece of Carl Laemelle, founder of Universal Studios. She delivers the opening lines in Dracula: She is the young girl riding in the carriage with Renfield. She is thrown into Renfield's lap.The second disc has a cool documentary about early Universal horror films narrated by Kenneth Branagh. One guest in particular - Ray Bradbury - was especially welcome.My daughter gave this set to me for Christmas, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. More - even she got into watching the documentaries about the movie.",Dracula
267,j-ruff1,Horror in Subtlety,8,16 February 2011,"Unlike most movies of the vampire genre in today's society, this one, the original, is truly frightening. There is no color, almost no romance, and the sets are a tad dull, but the audience will be more terrified by the effects of this movie than anything, which is what a movie should be able to do. The lighting was superb whenever the camera was on Bela Lugosi. The light in and around his eyes and nothing else gave the audience the sense of true and pure evil. The movie created an oxymoron in the light. Light is supposed to represent goodness and safety, but with the light on Dracula's eyes, the audience felt no such security. While lights helped to magnify the horror of the of the movie, the way Reinfeld stared became just as unnerving. There is something about insanity and craziness to an audience that frightens them even more. Perhaps it is not being able to understand what is going through their mind, but as audience members, we knew exactly what was going through Reinfeld's mind. Truly a subtly horrifying movie.",Dracula
268,ben_jm89,Review for History of Cinema,6,2 March 2011,"this was the first Dracula film for me. I have seen many modern vampire movies always portraying a savage like beast so it was a surprise when Dracula was practically a gentlemen in his approach. The acting is superb, Bela Lugosi does a wonderful job instilling a strange uneasiness within the audience. His slow movements and creepy wide eyed stare definitely had me on edge. Also Dwight Frye as Renfield was amazing to watch, he put a different kind of spin on crazy; it reminded me a bit of Hannibal Lecter.the use of sound, or lack of sound really enhances the creepiness, although it also becomes a bit dull. the addition of music could improve the film in some areas.",Dracula
269,E-reilly3,Horror,4,11 May 2011,"I have never been a fan of horror films, scary or not, but i really didn't enjoy Dracula. I think that the acting was very over done most likely due to the recent switch to the sound films from the silent. I felt that it was somewhat unrealistic in that aspect. Although the story line was pretty good, the props that were used really took away from what the movie could be. Had they used real bats for example instead of the fake ones, I think the movie would have felt more realistic and probably at the time much scarier. Now a days you can't have a horror movie with out gruesome deaths and beyond creepy killers so I guess that this movie was very far from what I am accustomed to.",Dracula
270,danburyn,Not a great film..,6,22 February 2012,"This was the first monster movie for American cinema. Again the movie does not really follow the book but does a pretty good job getting the overall view. To start Dracula was quite the corny movie. Bela Lugosi did do a great job portraying Dracula, the way he walked, talked, and interact with the other characters was very funny at times but also creepy. The film itself was put together pretty good, there are a couple of spots where you can see they over lapped the film and also the camera angles were not great. They either zoomed in on Dracula's face or had a wide shot. Though overall I also have respect for this movie because it was the first monster film and it paved the way for all monster films.",Dracula
271,alwaysdubbin91,i see why it's a classic,9,31 October 2012,"this is by far the best Dracula movie out there. it is certainly an American classic. it is a genuinely creepy movie, i wont say i was scare or horrified, but it does have it's ere moments. the character Renfield played by Dwight Frye seems legitimately insane, the way he looks, moves, and speaks just seems completely mental. Bela Legosi is also the perfect Count Dracula, he exaggerates the role just enough without making it seem cheesy. the story just sucks you right in and does not let you go until the very end. it's a very good story involving love, death, and obviously vampires. i'm not even sure if a remake could ever do this movie justice just because our style of movie making is so different than i was in 1931.",Dracula
272,stephypoo912,Old School Dracula,5,13 March 2013,"Now I definitely understand where all the reference to Dracula come from. I see that now, but to discuss the film, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who knows a lot about it. It was a boring film. But had good qualities and attributes that came along with it. I usually like music in a film, only because it HELPS with the mood that's supposed to be set. This film, didn't have any. Kinda disappointing. But the angles of the film were amazing. Even without the music, I could tell what was supposed to be important and what wasn't. Such as close-ups on Count Dracula and certain angles that the characters withheld. Other things that were meant to be important was the long camera pause of the bat. Very Interesting, but boring as well.",Dracula
273,Taffyta,More funny than scary.,8,8 February 2013,"Being the second classic horror film I've seen after Frankenstein (1931), I enjoyed this one much more. However, after seeing a bit of the opening for the Spanish version and then the English version... I almost feel like the English one is ""cheesier"". I'd like to see the other version in full with English subtitles.Perhaps I'm bad at following movies, because I couldn't quite catch all the information on the characters in the beginning. The movie seems to just start right in the middle of something that the characters have already been planning. So that was strange. But I really liked Bela Lugosi, he was quite funny. Which was probably very unintentional, but I'm watching this as a young person of 2013. So my reaction is probably very different than of those when this movie was new. But that at least made it more enjoyable to watch and kept my interest. I feel it's worth watching again in the future, to pick up on what small parts confused me. It would be good to watch on something other than my laptop, as the sound track is kind of hard to hear at times, even at my laptops loudest.",Dracula
274,Dollardave86,Dracula = Horror,6,30 March 2014,"Beside the film Frankenstein, Dracula was also a monumental horror flick. The thing that sets Dracula from the other horrors, were the aspect of the vampire count biting necks for blood. Even though this is a horror film, people these days most likely would not find this film scary. Dracula rise back to power after a visit from Renfield at his Transylvania home.The dark hair and the widows peak is classic and gave him that creepy look he needed. One of the things I didn't like to much were the special effects, for example the scene where the bats were flying it looked so unrealistic. The bats looked like they were made of rubber and held up by a string, which I found funny.",Dracula
275,gcappadona,Dracula 1931 Review,6,19 September 2014,"I loved the beginning part of the movie! I think Dracula has a great personality about him. He is very laid back yet has an unnerving creepiness about him. The scene when Renfield goes into Count Dracula's castle is just great! First off I liked how when he walked inside the castle everything is so much bigger in proportion to him. This creates a very creepy feeling. I also love when he is walking up the stairs after Dracula; Dracula goes through the cobwebs and doesn't break them. When it is Renfield's turn he has to use his cane to break through the huge cobweb, just as a massive spider crawls by. I also loved the animals that were throughout the film. I think the armadillos, rats, and possums added to the creepiness factor. One thing that I didn't like about the movie, which also made it really slow and boring to watch, was the fact that there was no music. During the passing scenes, or when no one was talking there was just the sound of the film running in the background. This gave a veryyyyy boring feel to the movie. I did not like aspect of the film at all.",Dracula
276,MC_Barton,"Sheer Lugosi, My Darling",6,15 February 2015,"Dracula is one of those movies, that suffer from not really being an outstanding movie, as it is portrayed to be. Bela Lugosi and his fantastic acting is what gives the movie its charm. Bela Lugosi is known for being a mysterious person, which quite suitably fits the role of Count Dracula. Lugosi comes off as being a delightful mixture of suave and creepy, but the movie just didn't age very well. Even at the time most aspects of the movie were dated, from cinematography to acting. Set pieces were masterful and fit really well with the setting that the movie was determined to build. However, movies around the same time such as Frankenstein would triumph as Garret Fort's screenplay just wasn't adapted well enough.",Dracula
277,hagen2357,Dracula Review,7,10 February 2015,"Dracula is a figure that is known by virtually all and can be credited in large part to this 1931 classic. Bela Lugosi who plays Count Dracula is horrifyingly creepy and finding a better Dracula would be nearly impossible. From the first encounter between Renfield and Dracula to the closing scene, the audience is on the edge of their seats and don't know what to expect, which is an essential part of most horror movies. I was a big fan of this film not only because it is an American classic but because it is a true horror film. In my opinion, too often in horror films today, the story itself isn't scary at all. The experience of going to the movie theatre with a huge screen and incredibly loud speakers help scare audiences by having things pop out when you are least expecting it. I believe that anyone can make a movie like that and is completely insignificant. The story behind Dracula is truly creepy and horrifying. A great story like this makes this one of the most significant horror films in history.",Dracula
278,CriticalViewing,Dark-Intense-Art-Still Highly Influential Today,9,6 April 2016,"Dracula is a dark dramatic classic, it is the film that birthed ""The Vampire"", which it introduced to the world in 1931. ""The Vampire"" has kept his place in society as a large phenomena that has remained omnipresent in media outlets. In recent years, we've had Twlight split a nation between Team Jacob and Team Edward (the vampire), tweens and their mothers alike. We have the Vampire Diaries keeping a steady following over the past 7 years, spawning a spin off, the Originals, that has also retained outstanding ratings over the past 3 years. Along with countless remakes and direct references to the man, the myth, the legend, the Vampire himself, Dracula; and his scientific adversary Van Helsing 85 years later. Tod Browning's black and white film left room for powerful use of light, photography, and sound helped the film be taken in the way that it was, causing it's overwhelming success. At some parts, the light is so low key that the shot is nearly black, only having a pair of eye's illuminated, This added to Dracula's looming presence, being more impactive on the viewer, they feel they are being watched themselves. The photography is key, frequently; it shows reaction of the characters to what is occurring or in front of them in a quick jump cut or reverse shot. And because of the mis-en-scene that is created, the diegetic sounds that are heard are all the more jarring and can be felt in one's core.",Dracula
279,RecceR,A must-see horror classic!,8,12 October 2012,"An ancient vampire, Count Dracula, makes his way to London in a bloody mess. After arriving, he turns Lucy into a vampire and then preys upon Mina. It is up to Mina's fiancé, John Harker, and Van Helsing to prevent Dracula's plan to make Mina one of the undead. The classic Bella Lugosi film has stood the test of time and has remained one of the most memorable movies in the world. I always enjoy watching it and appreciate it for paving the way for all of the other Universal Monsters. Bela Lugosi is eerie and creepy in his role as the notorious Count. It's a shame that Lugosi never got the recognition he deserved. I don't find it ""scary,"" but I do find it very creepy, especially the Renfield character. The sets are well done for an older movie and you really get that dark-Gothic vibe. There are definitely several differences between the Bram Stoker novel, but it would not be the first movie to ever change its source material. If you love classic horror movies then I highly recommend you watch the 1931 Dracula.",Dracula
280,JamesDean1955,Landmark in Horror Films,6,17 December 2010,"This film certainly is unique. This roll of the dice on behalf of the director, turned out in his favor. This first of its kind stands to create a whole new genre of films in and itself. The concept of "" horror "" is well displayed in the movie. The main actor does an excellent job in playing his character. He brings about a style that is completely of his own, and the lasting effect can still be seen today in modern day Halloween costumes, or horror related hoopla. The shots are done wonderfully, they are dark and scary, giving the audience a true sense of horror. I think that its important to pay attention to minor details such as sound and lighting in a film such as this. Those little details bring together the whole picture for the audience, and create a true sense of what is trying to be portrayed. This film certainly gambled with its special effects and paved the way for many many years of horror movies to be made its its image. People enjoy being scared, they enjoy the excitement that comes along with it. A lot of time and dedication and attention to detail has to all come together on behalf of the crew and actors to create the magic. I have seen a ton of "" horror "" movies that were completely laughable, mainly because the lack of creativity, and the ability to take the extra step to make scenes more believable. For 1931, Dracula does well and spreads its influence throughout the generations.",Dracula
281,Marcyph3r,Legendary,8,25 March 2020,"It is so easy to harp on the lesser parts of this movie - the silliness, the slowness, the lack of music for a lot of it, and the fact that for a modern audience the movie perhaps is more funny than scary (mileage may vary).But does that even matter? Bela Lugosi plays such a legendary role, in such a magnificent way, it has to be seen at least once. The way he stares, the way he talks, so many may have copied or parodied it, but none have done it quite like he did.The sets and Dwight Frye's role always delight as well.Delicious.",Dracula
282,kendraocon,Good Movie,7,19 October 2012,"I think that this movie was pretty good. The low lighting used in the movie makes it more creepy and eerie. The greeting scene for example,it seems to be bare with just stairs and large windows, but i think it adds to the mood and emphasizes it. When both Dracula and the man are walking up the steps the camera angles are switched a couple of times, it goes back and forth. It shows Dracula's back going up steps, then it shows the front of the man going up showing his frightened and concerned looks.It shows off a different atmosphere of Dracula, moody and creepy. When the reflection of the woman is in the mirror of the jewelry box, she and Dracula are unaware of the men looking at them across the room. You notice that you cannot see Dracula in the mirror at the same time that the men notice that. I noticed that the camera angle did not change when Dracula knocks out the jewelry box of the mans hand, it just zooms in a little bit. When the woman is coming out of the coffin it is almost like slow motion.",Dracula
283,dfiscaletti8,Review for Dracula,5,2 October 2012,"Dracula being an all-time classic film did not meet my expectations and actually left me with a feeling of disappointment. I anticipated something spooky that would leave with an eerie feeling when quite honestly I feel asleep three times while trying to watch this film and had to continually re-start it. The movie started off good and indeed grabbed my attention, but shortly into the movie I was lost. They went from being in Transylvania to being on a ship then being in Europe or something I am not even sure. I did not see the point of this at all and it is where I started to drift off. I was ready for blood sucking excitement, not doctors and a scientist discussing what was taking place while a random victim here and there was murdered by Dracula. Another thing I found very confusing was Renfield, he was very distracting and somewhat annoying and I found him purposeless in the film. On a positive note Helen Chandler's acting was phenomenal as Mena; she played every aspect of her role to a T. The movie did have a few scenes that I enjoyed, but overall I'd have to say it was a mediocre film with a poor plot and average acting (besides Helen Chandler). The film was not necessarily bad, but it isn't something I would really suggest to anyone who is looking for an interesting all-time classic film.",Dracula
284,yilmazomar,"""I am....Drac-u-la. I bid you velcome.""",10,19 October 2012,"Two things really stood out to me in this one. First Bela Lugosi and his hilariously phenomenal acting, his version has been immortalized, we can thank sesame street for being a part of that. His gazes, his manner of speaking, his eyes everything about him just emanates pure evil-mystery and a sick feeling of dread. I wasn't expecting it to be so effective, I thought because it's so old and a tired victim of cliché that it would be silly and ridiculous. But boy was I wrong, I honest to god got the creeps when the white arm slowly crawled out of the coffin it was so beautiful, at the shots of the castle and the surrounding country, the shadows were weird, something about them was paranormal there was a tone to it all that I really absorbed and felt as my bones ached and my fingers went cold. Sure it's all fantasy but you have to forget that, the sets are perfect, the contrast of pale white and grey-black, shadows where you could almost see what they contained, eerie eerie stuff, the camera did a nice job with tone. Suspend all disbelief as you watch this one and just get lost in a world of nefarious cinematography, the images will linger in your mind and perhaps who knows haunt you!",Dracula
285,LizNaylor,Dracula,7,13 February 2013,"This movie was definitely eerie. The recurring face that Lugosi made throughout the film was enough to scare a person. Not to mention that creepy laugh and look on Frye's face that happened on occasion during this film. Many other things were creepy about this movie as well, such as the castle in Transylvania, the fact that Dracula could walk through that giant spider web, and many more things. The acting was all around superb in ""Dracula"". The pace moved kind of slow though, and the movie seemed to drag on a bit. The fact that there was no music in this film to accompany the acting made the movie seem slower. This movie is a classic however, meaning it is loved by most. This movie just seemed a little boring though.",Dracula
286,v-colarusso,I Bid You Welcome,8,6 April 2013,"I have seen many portrayals of the tale of Dracula, and this one, despite being made close to a century ago, definitely creeped me out the most. The slow-moving, ominous vibe this film puts out from the very beginning to the very end permeates whatever rationale against the story you may have. The story of Dracula is obviously a monster story. These are sometimes the hardest stories to make to cause the audience to feel the targeted emotion: fear. A truly successful horror film pries open the imagination of its audience and engulfs them in the terror of this alternate reality. Dracula does an excellent job doing this for its audience. Most of the credit of this film is due to Bela Lugosi. His depiction was perfect and, despite the numerous other versions of this story, remains the icon for the character Dracula.",Dracula
287,launsbachc,Stage Setting Horror Film,9,11 March 2014,"Dracula is undoubtedly a very well scripted and in my opinion well acted horror film. I find it far fetched from your average monster movie because Dracula is immensely different from a character like Frankenstein. In this film we see a monster with what seems to be a conscious and personality. We can tell by his murderous and sometimes hostile actions that Count Dracula is not a regular human, in fact his evil doings are what make him monstrous. However, as a viewer we can see the obvious human characteristics he posses. The way Dracula lures victims in, such as Renfield, by appearing to be harmless makes the film a lot more interesting and exciting to watch. I have been a fan of horror films and works for as long as I can remember. From being a kid watching Goosebumps to now enjoying TV shows like true blood I have always enjoyed the horror genera. As I watch the 1931 version of Dracula the overbearing sense of similarity is definitely prevalent. The idea that the most dangerous characters can initially seem harmless is used in Dracula and countless other horror films.",Dracula
288,anthonydavid-25706,Dracula Review,8,18 December 2015,"Another classic horror film, Dracula is one of the first of its kind in the genre of horror. It is the classic story of a vampire living up in a creepy castle. The cinematography and lighting are quite well done. Many of the scenes are gloomy and dark, especially those that emphasize Dracula's presence. Some of the scenes may have been a little too dark for my taste. However, the over all feeling of the movie stays true to what you would want and expect. The music matches up nicely, keeping the creepy dark vibe alive through out. I would recommend this film to any fan of the horror genre, and really anyone who appreciates well filmed movies. Not as good or groundbreaking as Frankenstein, but still a solid flick.",Dracula
289,m-meehan-28239,Dracula,4,9 March 2016,Once again there is something about horror that is extremely difficult to translate over time. I found it to be better than Frankenstein but to me that isn't saying much. I appreciate that this helps to spark later versions of this story and I bet for the time it was very important. Today vampires are very popular and that might not be possible without this film. The sets where Dracula lives are incredible. The idea of this film just seems better than the actual movie itself. Today that accent and the cape just seems corny. There was no music which I feel is really crucial in this genre it guides the audiences feelings and makes situations infinitely more eerie. Without this I feel the film suffered. The best things done were with the setting and the lighting because the shadowy shots really add to the feel that one is supposed to have when watching a movie like this.,Dracula

The opening scenes, set in Dracula's castle, are grave, stately, and severe. But the film becomes unbearably static once the action moves to England. Despite the static nature of the final scenes, Dracula is a classic among horror films, with Bela Lugosi giving the performance of a lifetime as the erudite Count. The film is a pure influence on popular culture by the characteristics of coal pillar at that time. To look at this film with the eyes of someone who has grown up with horror films that had the advantage of hitting more nerves than others at the same time. Above all, this is a successful horror movie in the history, also, i love it and maybe i will see this movie again.",Dracula

Bela Lugosi, he was Dracula; from his accent, to his eyes; these attributes regarded him as being the best to portray the vampire from Bram Stoker's novel today. Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of the Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing versions of the Dracula Firms. Each actor, has their own style; that intrigues viewers to this day.Some people, may say that this version, is not all that good; because it is putting a play into film, but I see the movie; from the eyes of one whom is hopeful to produce or direct film in the near future. The cast, from Renfield to Dracula himself; this was a good choice of talent for the times. Other than Peter Cushing, nobody else to this day but the actor Edward Van Sloan; would come even close to portraying Stokers' visual of who was meant to be Vanhelsing.1931 Dracula, is the first; and I believe still one of the best. to this day, I cannot recall on a bad Dracula movie; ever to be filmed. Bram Stoker's character, will stand the time of many a passing year, and will continue to entertain us on to new eras of horror film.",Dracula

It is very slow moving with most of the sets so dark that the viewer has a difficult time making out the players and scenery.

294,Tduma91,The Original and Still the Best,8,27 April 2011,"Bela Lugosi nailed this one. He's by far the best part of this movie as his interpretation of Bram Stoker's Dracula is quite obviously the best that's ever been put on film. The movie is unfortunately dated (just look at the over acting, bats on strings and incredibly convenient timing of dialogue) but it's legacy isn't. When you think of Dracula and what he should look like according to your experiences with the character, chances are you think of the role assumed by Lugosi. He turned Bram Stoker's idea of Dracula into a cultural icon and 80 years later we're still relating the character Dracula to the vision of Lugosi. I'm sure at the time this movie was much better than what it is perceived to be by people of my generation but it's a classic in terms of launching a global vision of a particular character and that's what makes it so great.",Dracula
295,armycrazy,A wonderful horror film,9,21 February 2012,"Dracula is an absolutely wonderful horror film that does a great job of unnerving the viewer. Dracula acts in a strange enough manner around others to let most people find him odd, and even after the viewer learns that he is a vampire and he has killed several people, his behavior around other people continues to kind of weird the viewer out. One of the only complaints I would have about this movie was that I thought one of the shots was overused. A close up of Dracula's face with the only light being shone on his eyes. While this does a great job of unnerving the viewer, it is used many different times throughout the film, and it does begin to lose it's luster after a while. That aside, however, I really enjoyed watching this movie.",Dracula

It's great use of tonality to create so much difference with the light and dark aspects of such a dark movie, in black and white it was so much more than (my opinion) what it would have been in color, so much creepier. And the cinematography id a great job with making the sets seem real and spooky, even though it was shot in the studio, Lugosi did a wonderful job with portraying Dracula as a terrifying monster who took on a charming human guise to catch his victims. The story was okay for me, but the setup all around it was what brought the movie together for me.Its was very dramatic and that's what made it interesting.",Dracula

It did create a early genre that is loved by many but the early horror films just don't do it for me. Not to mention the sub-par acting throughout this movie. The special effects were cheesy and easy to tell how they were done.Some shots in the movie did catch my fancy. The shots and lighting on his eyes did create an erie setting throughout the movie.

The chilling atmosphere and gorgeous gothic visuals are amazing, and something that only the Golden Age of Horror could pull off.

Even though the movie doesn't top some of the other scary movies I have seen there is a lot of suspense and eerieness. Everyone's opinion of whether or not it was one of the scariest movies will differ. Some of the things that caught my eye and made the movie more ""creepy"" then ""scary"" was the sounds, music and zooming in of characters. It gave you some chills. There are some scenes in the movie where it was not as polished and not as realistic however the overall movie was definitely one for the books. It also gives a insight to how far we have come with horror films. As one of the first few horror films I thought that the film itself was very good.",Dracula
300,zthaleb,Classic,7,10 May 2013,"This classic horror movie kept me interested through out the whole movie. The acting especially from Bela Lugosi, who played Count Dracula, was amazing. The other actors in the movie like Helen Chandler and David Manners were also really good, but Bela Lugosi really stood out. He really got into his character and actually made him feel realistic. Something that really stood out to me in this movie was the amazing set. The set towered over the actors giving it a real castle feel. The detail of it was so breathtaking and the whole thing was extravagant. The story is a classic, I had never seen it before but I had heard all the stereotypical ""Dracula"" voices. I am glad that I finally got to see the original.",Dracula
301,LaserLemon,Being classic isn't always a good thing.,3,12 March 2013,"This was a movie that I had really looked forward to as a classic horror movie, the original Dracula. I was sadly disappointed when I finally did get around to watching it. The best way to describe the film as a whole is cheesy. Rubber bats, lightning, spider webs, and crypts are common throughout the movie. There is also some sort of strange mythology mix up in the middle as Dracula becomes some sort of wolf and is repelled by wolfsbane, the classic way to deal with werewolves. The only real savior is Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula, which I found particularly moving. His voice, which represents most of the film's memorable sound, is simply captivating in the way a vampire's voice should be. Lugosi is the only thing I would keep in this film.",Dracula
302,m-visker,Dracula,7,12 March 2014,"This movie isn't what I expected, not in a bad way. I just have seen so many remakes and spin offs. And of course there was the vampire fad with Twilight, Vampire Dairies, True Blood, just to name a few. So watching the original Dracula was fun, I liked to see all of the vampire stereotypes where they happened for the first time, the Transylvania accent, pale skin, charming personality, coffin sleeping, bats etc. Although I didn't find the movie very scary it did have some moments that were spooky, to me the the character that brought the most spook was the hopelessly devoted Renfield. His bulging eyes and lunatic behavior really made for some eerie scenes, one that immediately comes to mind is when the ship arrives to Europe and what they found is the whole ship crew dead and the unstable Renfield all by himself laughing. The movie also used shadows in great ways, many times the shot would be a close up on Dracula's face but casting a shadow over his entire face expect his eyes. This making the shot that more intense, this was done when Dracula was hypnotizing his victims. One negative thing I have to say about the movie was the ending. Through out the movie there was a lot of suspense and build up but it was so anti-climatic. There was a lot of action when chasing Dracula but before you knew it they found his coffin and the shot goes off to Mina and we hear Dracula off die of screen. The end. Over all the movie was good I just wish they carried the excitement all the way to the end of the movie.",Dracula
303,Bcrosier1674,The Best Horror Film Made,10,8 May 2014,"I must admit that I am biased about this film. It was Bela Lugosi's performance that made me think of trying acting in the first place. All of the energy and emotion and the passion he shows throughout the movie blew me away. I was actually able to play the role of Dracula in a melodrama, but I knew immediately where to influence my performance. I am not the only one to draw inspiration from this, however. Countless horror films have been made, all trying to become the next Dracula, but none have been able to dethrone the undead king of horrors. To me, this is the finest horror film ever created, and it is as simple as that. The mystique that this film created around the character of Dracula has surpassed what the novel was ever able to do. When I think of a horror movie, this is it. The peak of the mountain. Do you understand now? I may be sounding like Renfield, but this is THE horror film to watch.",Dracula
304,connorsalisbury18,The Immortal Cultural Icon.,8,8 May 2014,"Dracula (1931) directed by Tod Browning is an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula. The film differs from earlier adaptations as it creates the Dracula we know today, and our modern take on vampires. Nosferatu (1922) sticks closer to the source material, but the character Count Orlok is an ugly and vile looking creature. Dracula on the other hand looks handsome, and is well dressed. He is able to charm the ladies and he has the iconic look that most people think of when they envision Dracula. Bela Lugosi deserves props for his performance as the Count, as he is able to be scary whilst still being charming. The fact that he is able to combine these two things is simply gratifying. The film is great, as well. The tale is scary, and definitely goes down as one of the most influential Universal monster films of all time. Overall, Dracula (1931) deserves an 8 out of 10.",Dracula

The way the lighting accentuates Dracula's eyes almost every time you see a close-up really hones in on the eeriness of his character. Not to mention, it really adds to Lugosi's intimidation factor. Only thing about this movie that I wasn't too happy with were just minuscule things. Such as the floating bat, or the spider who slid up the wall without moving any of its eight legs. And most importantly, the lack of color. If they were to re-release this movie with some color, I think even today, it would leave the audience with some serious goosebumps.",Dracula

This film was good at telling that story with the acting and the cinematography in it. The actors were magnificent in acting how they were supposed to act; either crazy, scared, menacing, or acting possessed. The actor of Dracula, Bela Lugosi, was awesome at doing the minimum but still effective in showing how powerful and menacing Dracula could really be. The actor of Reinfeld, Dwight Frye, who also played in Frankenstein as Fritz, was awesome in acting crazy and acting like a devoted follower of Dracula. I like the little laugh he does as it adds to the creepiness of his character. I would recommend this film to anyone; it's a good watch and it's great movie about a classic monster.",Dracula
307,deamond9,I'm gonna be accused of blasphemy for this,4,21 December 2006,"I know this is ""The Classic"" version of Dracula. I know it was made decades ago. I'm well aware I'm gonna be accursed of blasphemy for this. I know people were easier to scare then. Oh well, might as well get on with it.The Bela Lugosi version of Dracula was so inaccurate to the book that I actually had trouble following the story. The Francis Ford Coppola version was much closer to the book.BOOK; first few chapters are about Johnathan Harker's travels to and stay in Transylvania. Renfield already in madhouse by start of movie.MOVIE; Harker never leaves England, Renfield goes instead.BOOK; Madness seems to fluctuate. Sometimes he seems normal, sometimes he's even a philosopher, but once he bit Dr. Stewart's arm, screaming, ""Blood is the life! Blood is the life!"" But most of the time, either eating life things or catching flies, spiders and birds so that he can feed them to each other and later eat them. MOVIE; You don't see him acting sane much. (In an odd way, although it never happened in the book, the scene in the Mel Brooks version with Stewart and Renfield in the garden gives a much better example of Renield's frequent fluctuation between sanity and insanity.)BOOK; Dracula is described as an old man with werewolf-like features, glowing red eyes and a mustache, and gets younger as he drinks blood.MOVIE; Not even close. And, although fangs are alluded to, you never see them.BOOK; Dracula only ever converses directly with Harker. (Although he also yells something at Van Helsing)Preys on Lucy only when asleep and/or sleepwalking. Main characters spend most of their time hunting down Dracula and Lucy. MOVIE; Dracula meets and converse with main characters at opera and later at Lucy's house. (In fact, this seems to mostly be all that happens in the movie.)BOOK; If you've seen any version of Dracula you'll be well aware of the scene with Harker and Dracula's three brides. As well as a child in a sack. (Note to MATRIX fans; watch ""Bram Stoker's Dracula again, you may find it interesting that Neo and Persephone have ""met"") MOVIE; This happens to Renfield, but nothing interesting happens.BOOK; Dracula's arrival in England is very similar to Eddie Murphy's arrival in New Yourk in ""A Vampire in Brooklyn""; a ship with a dead crew crash-lands on the beach, with a cargo full of boxes full of clay, and a wolf jumps out. MOVIE; Doesn't seem to happen. And only seems to assume the form of a bat.BOOK; main characters chase Dracula all the way back to TransylvaniaMOVIE; doesn't happen.MOVIE; He uses hypnosis on various servants.BOOK; Well, why the hell not? He does, possibly, have some power over Lucy, she seems to sleepwalk exactly where Dracula wants her to.Other problems with the movie;-Seems to be all talking, almost no action. -Never see Dracula's fangs.-Extremely limited by early censorship -Armadillos?",Dracula
308,spdowling,It just wasn't not my cup of blood,4,12 March 2011,"Tod Browning's Dracula(1931) is another visually arresting Universal monster picture with very little story and character depth. Like Frankenstein(1931) the lighting and the settings of Dracula(1931) create a great tone and mood but the story, the characters and the performances don't live up to the quality of the images. Again, I can certainly understand why Dracula(1931) was a commercially successful film in the early days of sound films but commercial success does not equate to quality. The countless cutaways to Dracula's creepy eyes and the image of a the huge stationary bat flapping it's wings in the window became quite comical after a while as it became quite obvious that the filmmakers had zero trust in the audiences ability to infer anything about the story and needed to be told over and over again the the monster was scary and that he liked to watch people from windows. The scariest of scary movies tap into real human fears and emotions and a film like Dracula(1931) is so other-worldly and unrealistic that it seems impossible to me that audiences could be genuinely scared or frightened by this film.",Dracula
309,garishlybland,"It's Iconic, But...",4,22 February 2012,"I can't think of many films that are synonymous with their genre. Dracula is possibly the most iconic horror film of all time. It had amazing line delivery by Bela Lugosi, the sets were grandiose and gloomy, and it single-handedly brought about the beginning of the Universal monster movie. When you think of a vampire movie, or Dracula in general, you think of the 1931 movie, with Lugosi's thick Hungarian accent, long, flowing cap, and dark hair with a prominent widow's peak. It's really too bad that this movie is so terribly boring. The introduction of the characters Renfield and Dracula are probably the highlight of the film. Besides the climax of the film, the pace is dismal. It seems that a lot of these horror films are plagued by this problem and this movie is certainly no exception.",Dracula

I've grown up believing these characters were real, and still to this day want to believe some of the events actually happened. As cynical as it sounds, I believe the story is beautiful. It is interesting that Bela Lugosi had to practically beg to be given the lead role as Count Dracula, and today the Lugosi Dracula is one of the most universally recognized vampire portrayals. If you have trouble understanding the subtleties of early black and white film, find it difficult to comprehend that in 1931 many theaters didn't even have sound yet, and struggle to stay awake during movies with extensive dialog rather than explosions(Michael Bay), I would advise staying away from this horror classic. On the other hand, if you can watch a movie made in 1931 and appreciate it for what it is given the time in which it came to the big screen, then by all means, this is a must see movie for any true film lover.",Dracula

Being a little scared is something that is expected when watching a horror film especially Dracula and that fear was not there throughout the film. The acting was great by Dracula but for the rest of the characters it could of been a little less dramatic. The overall movie was good but not to the level of being scary that I expected to see. There was not much suspension throughout the movie you could figure out what was going to happen in the end of the movie even if you have never seen a Dracula film",Dracula

Bela Lugosi is fabulous for this park, giving his character charm and humor while being terrifying all at once. Film contains high contrast but more over powered by the exaggerated dark's and shadow. The soundtrack to the film truly supports the intensity of the film (like most horror/thrillers). No terribly impressive cinematography but very smooth fading in and out editing. The story line is a small bit confusing in the very beginning bu nothing that cant be fixed with some subtitles! Over all a very fun, although slightly slow film.

While I'm sure that this film was probably pretty scary back when it was made, it's pretty laughable when viewed now. I will admit it's made slightly scarier than some other horror films of the time such as Frankenstein, but it wasn't nearly as good in story and depth. The effects such as the bat and hypnotic lighting on Dracula's eyes were very cheesy, the characters felt rigid, shallow, and unrealistic, and in addition to the very slow motion form of acting and dialogue implemented, the entire film seemed to move very slowly along as well. I understand the ""slow"" effect and the absence of dialogue in many parts is to convey a sense of creepiness, and to an extent I think it accomplished this, but I think the lighting accomplished this just fine and the ""quiet slowness"" felt a tad overdone. All in all, I would say this was a pretty average horror film with nothing too revolutionary.",Dracula

As is, it spends a lot of time showing scenes with very little happening in them. I suppose those are supposed to increase tension, but all it did for me was make it less engaging.I hated the close ups of Dracula in which he has a small amount of light on just his eyes. The effect is painfully obvious in those shots, and then when it changed to a wider shot the light is just gone, and his eyes are actually in shadow.I liked the Count's accent. It does seem a bit forced, but it is still interesting, and when you talk with fangs it can't be easy.I'm not given any reason to care for any of the characters. All they do is move the plot along. They are all very shallow seeming.The climax at the end felt last minute with very little buildup.

Both German films, black and white, short-run time, and lacking special effects managed to captivate audiences, and these characters are still well known nearly 100 years later.For this review, I'm going to be focusing on ""Dracula"" (1931). Dracula isn't a monster, an evil spirit, or anything you should be immediately worried about. In fact, he's the opposite, creating a new kind of ""bad guy"". Dracula was charismatic, charming, handsome, and polite. Dracula got close to his victims, (in some cases, going in for a kiss) then he strikes. Re-gaining his youth with the blood he sucks from them. There are religious elements to this movie. This movie tells the tale of denying religion, and seeking worldly desires, no matter how immoral they may be. Blood-rituals are preformed, almost always being seen as Satanic practice. The villagers are fearful of Dracula, but their fears are not listened to seriously.The gothic themes of Dracula are translated well into the film. The scenes are dark, his accent is thick and eerie, the popped-up collar, slicked back hair, and well-dressed Dracula as we know him still all originate from this movie with very small changes ever being done.",Dracula
316,paleowildchild,Great Movie,8,14 February 2021,"Dracula 1931 was an excellent film. It was the first film I've seen of its time to attempt beautiful cinematography. I also noticed that they used the script to help add color. For example, a girl describes Dracula's eyes as red and a women's dress as white.Dwight Frye was my favorite actor in this film, and in my opinion, would have made a better Dracula than Bela Lugosi. Dwight Frye had a very well fleshed out character from the wild look in his eyes to the way he spoke. One good thing about Bela Lugosi's interpretation of Dracula was that he seemed unconstrained by time. All of his movements were very slow, which correlated with his immortality.From a plot perspective, the movie was a bit predictable. Perhaps because it has been done so many times over the years or because the plot was not very detailed. Dracula's abilities were, for the most part, that of the common vampire: shapeshifting, mind control, and the inability to look at crosses.",Dracula
317,tinyredspoons,Timeless,8,12 May 2011,"For me, watching Dracula (1931) is always an enjoyable experience. One of the first horror movies made, it encompasses everything a scary movie should be. The film also stays true to the excellent novel by Bram Stoker that it is based upon, which combined with the cinematic world of vampires makes for an engrossing movie. By any modern means, Dracula(1931) is not a ""terrifying"" movie, it is clunky in parts and sometimes outright silly; but one must remember it was one of the first of its kind. So successful in fact was the movie, that for the rest of his life Lugosi was pigeon-toed into playing vampires (for good reason, Lugosi's entire demeanor is intensely ""vampire-like."" Its no surprise that people still mimic Bela Lugosi's dripping vampire voice, ""I vant to suck your blood.""",Dracula
318,Piratezombie7,I Vant to suck your Blood,8,5 October 2011,"""I never drink....wine"" this line really shows what kind of vampire Bela's Dracula is like, classy, polite, and bloodthirsty. The movie is a classic by ever mean and really honors Bram Stoker's vision for his Vampire King. All the mythology of the movie is right on with the book and its depiction of Dracula and his weaknesses and powers. I very much enjoyed the ship scene were they show a model ship that by the standards of today is obviously fake but back then was quite advanced. Dracula's romp through London is quite amusing because of the fact that he is walking around, kills a girl very nonchalant, hypnotizes a random girl at a play and then continues with his business. The best part of the movie though in my eyes is Dracula's height. Most monsters are huge and imposing but Dracula is slight and so much more dangerous then any creature around.",Dracula

I enjoyed the absence of background music and sheer silence other than the dialog. I thought that gave it an eeriness that some movies may lack today. I was surprised to find myself a little scared in some of the scenes that were quite suspenseful and the silence would give me goosebumps. Bela Lugosi did a phenomenal job as Count Dracula. I found the film to have a little more light than the 1931 Frankenstein, which made it not only easier on the eyes, but easier to follow. I didn't find the storyline to be too predictable, many characters were introduced, making the film more interesting in my eyes. This film set the stage for horror movies to come, and the legend of Count Dracula has definitely not died. Vampires have become a bit of a phenomenon and the icon of ""Teen heartthrobs"" in today's media. I liked that almost everyone in the film succumbed to the will of Count Dracula.

320,Natybug97,The Classic Dracula,7,7 March 2014,"I have always heard great things about the classic horror of universal studios. I have not been thoroughly impressed. This was my second film in that genre and it was not all that it was cracked up to be. Not only was it not all that frightening, and that's probably because my generation has been so desensitize, but I felt that there was much lacking from the film. The character development was so shallow and disappointing because you didn't know anything but the most basic facts about them! I could have read a one page report about the movie and not have missed a thing. The story was lacking so much as well, it all seemed to be implied due to Dracula's powers. Also much of what was happening was explained in short bursts by Professor Van Helsing (who came out of nowhere with his theory and explanations) and made the other men seem incompetent. Dracula also acknowledges Van Helsing as his ""enemy"" but nothing more develops from that, the dynamic between the hero and villain is not explored any further and it leaves something to be desired. Despite all that the film was lacking it did have some good cinema qualities that help put it in that classic status. The acting was well done and Lugosi did an excellent job as Count Dracula. He was able to carry himself with grace and also make you think twice about being alone in a room with him. Frye, who played Renfield, was also a well played character. The perpetually crazed look in his eyes was so impressive that it kept you waiting for that moment when he would finally turn his master over. The lighting was also very well done, especially when focusing on the vampiric eyes that held you captive until they used you or disposed of you. The sets were also very impressive. The castle in Transylvania and even below the abbey where Dracula sleeps. They are so elaborate, made to look abandoned and creepy, until you get to the living spaces, and even then, there is an air of grace. I did find it interesting that Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake was used in the opening credits.",Dracula
321,SaveFerris97,"A good example of the period genre, but I wouldn't watch it again...",6,12 March 2014,"Dracula (1931, Tod Browning, Karl Freud) certainly achieves the eeriness it was obviously attempting. The use of dim lighting and shadows is definitely not subtle, but still really amusing to watch out for. Most notably, when the Count's face falls into shadow, but a beam of light falls across his eyes (sort of like a reverse raccoon effect) and it really adds to the mortality emanating from him. I'm not a big fan of horror movies (from any period, really) and this film wasn't an exception, but I don't particularly regret watching it. The additions to contribute to the sinister atmosphere like the music, or the use of fog, were fun to note. The costumes were also impressively authentic, if a little dramatized. The way Bela Lugosi plays Dracula is remarkable, as well, because he embodies the very cold impression every audience member gets from his character. I wouldn't watch it again, because I found it a bit cheesy, script and prop-wise, but I recommend watching it if you're a horror movie/thriller buff. It's a great example of the pioneering horror movies of the '30s.",Dracula

It really gave a 360 view and didn't have random, unimportant shots. This was especially present in the staircase scene. The sound effects were pretty good when it came to creaking noises in the castle but was fairly quiet with the dialogue. The plot could get a little boring but the message was pretty clear so it wasn't a difficult film to figure out. Pretty well done overall.",Dracula

A somewhat predictable plot, and some clear amateur stuff that was common for the time hinder this film, but it must be watched with a different frame of reference to fully enjoy it. The movie was honestly more entertaining than I thought it would be, but it just made me want to watch The Monster Squad (1987). Dracula is a trend setting movie like Frankenstein and is a classic, and well made for its time.",Dracula

Studios were all still testing out whether or not horror films would be a hit, but this one was a home run. The mix between horror and action was superb. I feel as though the movie wouldn't be as suspenseful if there was no sound. The sound is what made people spooked out. Count Dracula's accent alone was creepy but so cool. Universal Studios definitely made a great film for their viewers. To this day many people tell the story of Dracula as there are many remakes, however the original one was definitely the best!",Dracula
327,aleksandraryan,""" I never drink....wine""",9,16 February 2021,"Bela Lugosi is the OG Dracula! The acting in this movie by both Lugosi and Frye was masterful. From the creepy stare to the slow deliberate movements, Lugosi portrayed the perfect Dracula. The visuals were hit or miss. I really liked the way they lit up Draculas and Renfield's eyes, drawing attention to their severity and madness. The bats were a little comical, but given the limited technology they had back then I can't judge too harshly. One part that confused me was why was Renfield always wandering around the doctors? Wasn't he supposed to be locked up? At one point they mentioned he kept escaping, but it's a bit hard to believe that would be happening in an insane asylum. Also they kinda dropped the ball with the ending. Dracula's death was uneventful and almost disrespectful in my opinion. Lugosi gave such great performance and they just killed him off without any formality or drama. Overall this is a great movie and anyone who loves all things Dracula should watch it!",Dracula
328,c-farrell7,A True Classic,6,17 December 2010,"Tod Browning's 1931 classic, Dracula was Bela Lugosi's most famous role. Bases on a Broadway play by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston which that Bela Lugosi was the title character. The play itself is based on Bram Stroker's 1897 novel Dracula. Film itself its visually stunning. There is great use of silence and dramatic close ups that add to the creepiness of the main character. Todd Browning and many of the actors were trained in the silent film era. This comes across in the acting style and a lot of the special effects. The use of fog and rubber bats give the film a distinct style of the silents. Overall I would recommend this film to any fan of classic horror films.",Dracula

Although some things are a tad bit cheesy - like the rubber bats - the movie is legendary and enjoyable to watch, even if it may not be as scary today as it was back then. For being made in black and white, the lighting was sensational. Dracula's performance was almost mesmerizing. His horrifying eyes definitely made an impact. Many people today might find this movie to be dull and boring because it lacks almost everything that makes a movie scary now. Since there is no gore, extreme violence or technology to satisfy today's horror movie standards, some might find it to be unrealistic and far from horrifying.",Dracula

331,Morgan_Leslie93,Not the best but still decent classic,6,19 October 2012,"Dracula is definitely a classic horror film and I definitely appreciate it for its time period but I really wasn't that big of a fan for it. It had some really great features like the scenery, plot and the acting was pretty good. I think it is a classic movie that deserves to be seen at least once but there was something about it that makes it just not that memorable for me I guess. It actually took me twice to make it through the movie. And I was actually really excited to get to see the original version of Dracula but honestly I wasn't that impressed, I'm still unable to put my finger on just why. One of the things I thought was kind of funny was how each time Dracula started trancing people he would just stare at the camera and I swear that they just used a photograph and played it for a couple seconds because it was so still. I will admit that the acting was really good especially Bela Lugosi as Dracula. Some of the props in the movie were fake which kind of turn me off to it as well. But I will saw it was a decent movie to help start of the horror in the sound era.",Dracula
332,Arriflex1,Lugosi's Triumph,9,23 July 2004,"Tod Browning's film of the Stoker novel didn't so much eclipse Murnau's NOSFERATU (1922) as shove it into antiquity. One big reason was the technological advancement of sound. Roughly three years old by 1930, the public embraced the talking picture wholeheartedly over silents. The other big reason for Dracula's success was that the star of the stage play had been cast as the star of the film. And movie history was made. Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula is now a eighty-one year old icon, outlasting all other interpretations before or since. The twist is that this Dracula looks nothing like Stoker's creation (read the book). Lugosi, either through his work with the playwrights or later at Universal with Browning, devised the most insidious form the character would ever take- a handsome, courtly, well-groomed, civilized aristocrat, so gracious and attractive that he projected an aura of well-being over the viewer. This was worlds away from the Murnau/Max Schreck approach of head-on abomination in NOSFERATU. Sensibly, no one in their right mind would stay within viewing distance of Schreck (or Kinski in NOSFERATU, THE VAMPYRE and Dafoe in SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE) after the first glimpse. But Lugosi's Count would have you chatting and drinking wine- until he began to drink of you. That cape and those evening clothes are the perfect deception. Browning's Dracula is sometimes stagy and tentative in its continuity (it feels at times that the director was unsure where to go next in the progression of scenes). But Karl Freund's photography summons up a persistent mood of heavy gloom and enveloping dread. Two other assets in the film are Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing and Dwight Frye as Renfield. Van Sloan was Universal's resident Learned Man, appearing as an Egyptologist in THE MUMMY (1933), and perhaps most famously as Dr. Waldman in FRANKENSTEIN (1931). A career-long character actor, Dwight Frye was an eccentric talent who appears to have worked exclusively at Universal. He had his best role as Renfield, producing a still blood-curdling, sneering laugh that seemed to come from the depths of a hellish insanity. If you haven't seen this Dracula please do so. The Count awaits.",Dracula
333,csharrow1994,great,9,18 February 2014,"This classic horror film was brilliant. This film made Bela Lugosi's career. He plays a sinister and completely creepy count. He truly takes on this role, along with all the other actors in this film. While watching, I felt as if I were watching a glimpse of someone's life, because they all seemed to take on their role and really become their character. The cinematography definitely adds to the film. The lighting, sounds, and camera angles throughout give off a creepy, haunting ambiance. Although it isn't like today's horror films, for the time it was made, it showed things like never before in a horrifying manner. If you're into the history and evolution of horror films, then it is a necessity to see this as it is one of the building blocks for the horror industry.",Dracula

Bela's portrayal is incredibly iconic and he is a truly talented actor. Dwight Frye is also an amazing actor and I would have liked to see more of a presence of his character in the film. The shots of just Bela's face are so creepy but yet effective in reinforcing the horror in the mind of a viewer. Van Helsing and Dracula have a character dynamic that is unparalleled in any piece of film or literature even now into 2014.",Dracula

I thought it was quite incredible that they made it all in a studio. It really seems like I was there watching Dracula and right there in the setting itself. I really liked the acting by Bela Lugosi. He played the role very well. From all the Halloween stories I grew up hearing and stuff he fit the description of Dracula amazingly.

336,brainybrailler,Disloyal book-based movie,1,18 April 2006,"Even before I'd seen this movie as a kid, I'd heard much about it - it was my only knowledge of Dracula, actually. But I was determined to find and read the novel beforehand, to learn less-known information about the most famous vampire...I almost regret doing this now (""almost"" because if I hadn't I would've liked the film a bit more since, though I found it confusing WITH the book, so without it would've left me baffled but still entertained) because my experience of watching this was tainted. For those who don't know the novel's plot: Jonathan Harker is sent to Transylvania to see a mysterious client of his company's, and there notices many odd things about Dracula: he neither dines, drinks, nor reflects in mirrors, seems to covet human blood until prevented with a crucifix, is nearly nocturnal, seems to summon his neighboring wolves who prevent Jonathan from leaving, and intercepts 2 letters he sends home via gypsies and burns the one written to his lover Mina since it's shorthand. While defying his host's orders to sleep nowhere but his own room, he encounters 3 women who appear to be demons: they nearly attack him till Dracula offers them a child. As he recovers from a brain fever in a nearby mental hospital, Mina Murray and Lucy Westenra witness a ship enter port whose only occupants are the captain, dead with crucifix-tied hands, whose journal mysteriously hints ""something"" caused his crew's disappearance, and a gray dog who flees after landing. Shortly after, Lucy's sleepwalking finds her nearly attacked by something unidentifiable to Mina, who believes the 2 marks on Lucy's throat are from the pin she used to tie her shawl - though Dr. Van Helsing, friend of Lucy's suitor Dr. John Steward, believes it's more when she continues to weaken after being given 4 blood transfers. After death her wounds heal, and Van Helsing reveals to Steward and her fiancée Arthur Holmwood that she is un-dead. With another of Lucy's suitors, Quincey Morris, Van Helsing summons Mina and Jonathan to confront the vampire responsible, and attempts to question Steward's insane patient Renfield, who appears subservient to a vampire - and must save Mina when she's attacked. The movie leaves out and/or changes much of the plot - Renfield is the business worker who goes to meet Dracula but returns possessed with him via ship. Jack Steward is Mina's father and her lover John Harker is too practical to believe in vampires, Lucy Weston is barely introduced and is interested in Dracula whom she actually meets, Arthur and Quincey are absent - and the suspense is reduced by Dracula's directly socializing with the protagonists in London rather than their having to hunt him down across the Black Sea, such as Van Helsing fighting his hypnosis in a battle of wits which occurs before he can convince anyone around him of what Dracula truly is. The Count's true identity - a descendant of an old Transylvanian family/Turkish War veteran who practiced witchcraft - was never revealed. Even Renfield's death is pitiful as he falls downstairs rather than dying directly from a beating. I was bored and managed to forget the ending, of ""1 of the greatest horror films of all time"", no less. I can safely say that if it hadn't been for Bram Stoker's work, I'd have been confused by the hurried plot, so even on its own merits - I try to give at least 5 stars to be fair - this film wasn't enjoyable to me. I wish I wasn't such a purist, but I thought this was beyond help either way.",Dracula

Still it might seem simple but was so much more for when the film was actually made which is what makes me like the films so much.The old black and white dark horror film holds its name even more with it by using as many dark scenes as possible. Why not it is a film about a vampire. The perfect stare and movements make the character of Dracula even more believable. At the same time his character seems somewhat of a gentleman, but also scary which is the perfect combination for Dracula.The best of the movie is the darkness and using all of that dark space to make a film is even better. With shadows in just about every scene and others only faces are scene make this film so great with cinematography.",Dracula
339,michel_broeders,"Children of the night, what music they make",9,20 October 2018,"It is only one of many unforgettable quotes in the 1931 version of Dracula. Although Bram Stoker's vampire novel from 1897 was adapted as early as 1922 by F.W. Murnau (as Nosferatu) and director Tod Browning had let Lon Chaney perform as a fake vampire in the silent film London After Midnight, this early-speaking film was the first representative of a separate genre within the horror film, the vampire film. As was not uncommon with American horror films, this Dracula was not based on the literary source text, but on the 1924 stage adaptation (by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston).The film starts brilliantly, with a hint of Swan Lake and a rickety carriage in which we drive with solicitor Renfield (Dwight Frye) to Lugosi's Transylvanian castle, where we get a memorable introduction to Dracula. The story follows Dracula to London. There we meet Van Helsing, who is played by Edward Van Sloan as a thorough professor. In addition, Frye steals the show when Renfield turns into a fly-eating, giggling lunatic.The first major star of the new genre was Bela Lugosi, who played the role of Dracula on Broadway and was cast for the film after Browning's favorite actor Lon Chaney died. Maybe that's why Browning's direction was a bit flat, because George Melford directed the Spanish version at the same time (and on the same sets!) much more inspired. However, this version has to do without Dracula's powerful interpretation by Lugosi. With his demonic glowing eyes and his strong Hungarian accent, Lugosi portrayed a beautiful, threatening Dracula.Cameraman Karl Freund arose from German Expressionism and director Browning had provided Hollywood with grotesque productions. Hereby two horror traditions came together in Dracula. The castle of Dracula with its enormous Gothic windows is the most beautiful setting of the film, but during the scenes in London we can behold an impressive staircase and beautiful catacombs. It is unfortunate that the end comes to a sudden and anticlimactic end.Despite the primitive technique and a story that plays almost exclusively indoors, Browning's film is convincingly sinister and creepy.",Dracula
340,nekrotikk,Dracula (1931),10,15 January 2021,"Classic. Not very faithful to the book but a fantastic adaptation. Lugosi is so iconic that to this day when most people do impressions of Dracula they imitate Lugosi. Costumes and sets are beautiful. Some of the acting is clearly over-acted due to it being an early talkie and silent films really needed the over-acting. Most of it is still haunting though. And it gets in, tells the story, then ends in around an hour. This was common for old films but I really appreciate films that take the time they actually need rather than using a load of filler to hit 3 hours.",Dracula

This is a story about vampires, right? Do we get to see blood? Barely any, if at all. Last I checked, vampires drank blood. We see Dracula ""bite"" his victims, but any blood? like, a drop. Again, I understand the restrictions of the time, but weren't there ways to get around them? Screwball comedies essentially revolved around circumventing the Code. And while this isn't a screwball comedy, I expected to see some creativity in how the vampire was portrayed. Nope. Although, I will give points to Dracula for, if not being horrifying, being creepy as all hell. He legit sent shivers up my spine. He's a psychopath in purest form.",Dracula
342,josephkinion,Based on the Novel,10,13 May 2019,"Renfield (Dwight Frye) is a solicitor traveling to Count Dracula's (Bela Lugosi) castle in Transylvania on a business matter. The people in the local village fear that vampires inhabit the castle and warn Renfield not to go there. Renfield refuses to stay at the inn and asks his carriage driver to take him to the Borgo Pass. Renfield is driven to the castle by Dracula's coach, with Dracula disguised as the driver. En route, Renfield sticks his head out the window to ask the driver to slow down, but sees the driver has disappeared; a bat leads the horses.
Renfield enters the castle welcomed by the charming but eccentric Count, who unbeknownst to Renfield, is a vampire. They discuss Dracula's intention to lease Carfax Abbey in London, where he intends to travel the next day. Dracula hypnotizes Renfield into opening a window. Renfield faints as a bat appears and Dracula's three wives close in on him. Dracula waves them away, then attacks Renfield himself.
Aboard the schooner Vesta, Renfield is a raving lunatic slave to Dracula, who hides in a coffin and feeds on the ship's crew. When the ship reaches England, Renfield is discovered to be the only living person. Renfield is sent to Dr. Seward's sanatorium adjoining Carfax Abbey.
At a London theatre, Dracula meets Seward (Herbert Bunston). Seward introduces his daughter Mina (Helen Chandler), her fiancé John Harker (David Manners) and the family friend Lucy Weston (Frances Dade). Lucy is fascinated by Count Dracula. That night, Dracula enters her room and feasts on her blood while she sleeps. Lucy dies the next day after a string of transfusions.
Renfield is obsessed with eating flies and spiders. Professor Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) analyzes Renfield's blood and discovers his obsession. He starts talking about vampires, and that afternoon Renfield begs Seward to send him away, claiming his nightly cries may disturb Mina's dreams. When Dracula calls Renfield with wolf howling, Renfield is disturbed by Van Helsing showing him wolfsbane, which Van Helsing says is used for protection from vampires.
Dracula visits Mina, asleep in her bedroom, and bites her. The next evening, Dracula enters for a visit and Van Helsing and Harker notice that he does not have a reflection. When Van Helsing reveals this to Dracula, he smashes the mirror and leaves. Van Helsing deduces that Dracula is the vampire behind the recent tragedies.
Mina leaves her room and runs to Dracula in the garden, where he attacks her. She is found by the maid. Newspapers report that a woman in white is luring children from the park and biting them. Mina recognizes the lady as Lucy, risen as a vampire. Harker wants to take Mina to London for safety, but is convinced to leave Mina with Van Helsing. Van Helsing orders Nurse Briggs (Joan Standing) to take care of Mina when she sleeps, and not to remove the wreath of wolfsbane from her neck.
Renfield escapes from his cell and listens to the men discuss vampires. Before his attendant takes Renfield back to his cell, Renfield relates to them how Dracula convinced Renfield to allow him to enter the sanitorium by promising him thousands of rats with blood and life in them. Dracula enters the Seward parlour and talks with Van Helsing. Dracula states that Mina now belongs to him, and warns Van Helsing to return to his home country. Van Helsing swears to excavate Carfax Abbey and destroy Dracula. Dracula attempts to hypnotize Van Helsing, but the latter's resolve proves stronger. As Dracula lunges at Van Helsing, he withdraws a crucifix from his coat, forcing Dracula to retreat.
Harker visits Mina on a terrace, and she speaks of how much she loves ""nights and fogs"". A bat flies above them and squeaks to Mina. She then attacks Harker but Van Helsing and Seward save him. Mina confesses what Dracula has done to her, and tells Harker their love is finished.
Dracula hypnotizes Briggs into removing the wolfsbane from Mina's neck and opening the windows. Van Helsing and Harker see Renfield heading for Carfax Abbey. They see Dracula with Mina in the abbey. When Harker shouts to Mina, Dracula thinks Renfield has led them there and kills him. Dracula is hunted by Van Helsing and Harker knowing that Dracula is forced to sleep in his coffin during daylight, and the sun is rising. Van Helsing prepares a wooden stake while Harker searches for Mina. Van Helsing impales Dracula, killing him, and Mina returns to normal.",Dracula

The eyes of Bela Lugosi along with the voice are so iconic that any other person portraying Dracula can only try to match the amazing acting job he did. Oftentimes, they pail in comparison to Lugosi's version. I think my only complaint was that it was hard to keep in focus on watching the movie but I think that is an issue on my end as I grew up watching much different types of movies than a 1930's movie but this film is a horror classic that obviously has held up over time as a true horror gem for a reason.",Dracula
344,martinrandall-36706,A Masterpiece,10,28 October 2021,"I finally sat down and watched this film undisturbed from start to finish on TCM. Over the years I had seen bits and pieces on regular TV and I never thought much of it. But watching it whole, as it was meant to be seen changed my opinion of the film to say the least. I absolutely loved it!There is one weird plot change from the Stoker novel, otherwise it's pretty dead-on to the source material. Renfield the madman is given Jonathan Harker's role as the solicitor who visits the Count in Transylvania to close the deal on his London property. Once back in England, all the characters are as they are in the novel.Here is an amazing thing: there is absolutely no gore in this film. The story, as horrifying as it is, is told with a light hand and the viewer is allowed to imagine the grotesque abominations taking place just off camera. The special effects are limited to a bat flying around on a tether.Karl Freund was the brilliant cinematographer who was wisely left alone by director Tod Browning to do his thing. The result is some of the best black and white photography I have ever witnessed. There is one scene that gave me chills and stuck with me for its sheer beauty. This is where Dracula stands in the open double doors leading to the terrace at Dr. Seward's residence. Lugosi is in full form with his arms and cape fully extended as the fog creeps in from outside. It sneaks in, not in a rush, but subtly, until you can actually see tendrils of vapor emerge from the shadows and advance toward the camera and eventually filling the room. All the while Dracula is stock still, glaring at the frightened people inside. Good stuff!This film works as a horror story. It also works as a critique of modern society. One of the Count's best speeches is when he reminds Van Helsing of the matter of fact way people in the past accepted death as merely a part of life. To them, a vampire was as ordinary as a wild animal, and just as dangerous. Dr. Van Helsing and his ilk, with their test tubes and textbooks and scientific method seek to banish vampirism and the supernatural from the modern world. A fact Dracula finds laughable as much as it is impossible.Do yourself a favor and watch this film undisturbed and preferably at night and in a dark room. It is beautifully made and in my opinion a glorious work of art.",Dracula
345,Bbqska,Those catacombs...,7,11 May 2011,"I'm going to have to say that rubber bats don't work for me, unless they were in the movie for a sec or two, but they weren't. Bela Lugosi did a good job of playing a creepy blood sucker though, and the catacombs he found when he moved from Transylvania did a great job of creating a dark atmosphere. It's often copied. Even characters' names are stolen and changed, as in Dr. Van Helsing's. He's made into an acrobatic vampire and werewolf killer in the movie by the same name some 65 years later. I was disappointed in the ending for it felt very anticlimactic. In summary, suspending disbelief is extra hard when watching a dated movie (rubbers bats, rubber spiders, silly webs) but overall pretty good flick.

346,SuperDuperMCA,Draculaz boring....,4,20 February 2013,"Boring and confusing to watch like many other films of its era. ""Dracula"" is considered to be a classic in the horror movie genre but it is not a good film. I understand it is dated now a days and it was a major influence in film history at the time. Frankenstein has aged a lot better. The camera angles and the dialog are awkward and underproduced even for a 1930's movie. Additionally, most scenes tend to drag along becoming very uninteresting. Don't expect to be able to follow the plot easily unless you have read the novel. This film may have been terrifying to audiences when it was originally released, but today it lacks enough suspense or action to startle a toddler. Bela Lugosi get so much praise for his role as count Dracula but I think his performance sucks the whole way through and found it hard to stay awake. I would recommend this movie to someone interested in seeing the roots of vampire/horror movies but this is definitely not a film for everyone and its not to entertaining at all.",Dracula

It starts off slow and jumps around for the first ten minutes or so. This could make some people want to stop watching but if you can make it though the first fifteenth minutes it starts to make sense. As most of the reviews I write, this is written from the stand point of 21st century movie goer.Taking this into consideration, this movie is what you would expect from one of the first ever horror movies. It's special effect are typical for the early 1900's and are almost embarrassing by today's standards.The fact that this movie does not rely on flashy special effects makes you appreciate the acting and camera work a little more. For example, the use of lighting around Dracula's eyes when he puts people under his trance was a great way to show the audience that his eyes are the key to this power of his. Little things like these are why this film was a huge success and set the stage for all future vampire films(excluding Twilight of course).

Having it be as dry as it was and all the different little effects throughout the movie like the fog in the background and the light on Draculas face (which didn't always match up with his eyes) and the bats, I think that all made it comical and helped keep my interest. I thought Dracula was pretty corny though, the way he moved and little actions he made like quickly covering his face were a little weird looking. I thought the lighting was good, but some scenes were kind of blurry and camera positioning was alright.

I felt like the story moved so fast you got a simple understanding of the plot and no relationship with the characters, and for me, when you can connect to the characters in a movie it is so much more likable. i suppose for its time it isn't so bad but i was greatly disappointed.

351,oliviadoerrer17,Great Horror Movie!!,8,15 March 2013,"The mood of this film was definitely set in the beginning scenes, the ominous atmosphere made it spooky and at bit frightening to watch. Dracula's character looked and acted the part well, his tone of voice added to the scary aspect of the film. I would consider this another great horror monster movie by Universal in 193. Camera use was used great during this film, use of flowing movement up and down staircases. Another neat aspect was the transition of Dracula to bat always happened off camera. A ground breaking significance of the over all theme of the film was the fact that a powerful mind controlling vampire could be defeated by a human in the end. Considering this film was made in 1931, the pre-code area it did not have restrictions, so the use of female sexuality was another theme brought into the film. Overall great story and great acting that made the unbelievable, believable though the actions, connections and voices of the characters.",Dracula
352,ewright228,Ehh alright,6,11 March 2014,I thought overall this movie was not the greatest but it was not horrible at the same time . I did however really enjoy the acting that took place. Dracula obviously was played very well through out. I also really enjoyed the doctor and martin who is supposed to keep an eye on Renfield. Renfield's acting was also superb and almost stole the marvelous acting done by Dracula. I really didn't enjoy the whole story line of just finding new people to suck their blood. Overall the film was done well with the acting and the scenery. The castles and where Dracula's earth was was spectacular. I don't think i would watch this movie again but it definitely wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen.,Dracula
353,v-doody,Dracula (1931),9,13 March 2014,"What a film. In terms of classic horror, Browning's 1931 ""Dracula"" is definitely one of the most iconic films to ever grace the screen. Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula delivers a brilliant performance that thrills and excites the audience to no end. Despite being made over 80 years ago, Lugosi's ""Dracula"" is still found to be one of the most terrifying portrayals of the classic character. After all, this is the performance that not only launched Lugosi's acting career into high gear but set in motion the horror genre as it is today. With brilliant acting and an atmosphere to accompany it,""Dracula"" is definitely one of the best there is.The only issue I had with this film was its ending. Despite being so full of plot, the ending lacked the substance it deserved. It ended rather quickly, and didn't give much explanation as to how the rest of the story played out. Nonetheless, an amazing film. A definite must see.",Dracula

The whole film has spreading the felling of darkness. Especially this film is black and white. The main actor is the most elegant vampire I've ever seen. A close-up of his lens, there is a light between his eyes. That's how vampire supposed to be like. Actress clothes are overall very beautiful, and Dracula's three wives are also beautiful. Unfortunately, the ending is too hasty, thought there was a conspiracy or something.The vampire is should look like this, the gentleman, mysterious, slightly frightening color.Personal favorite of Dracula, only the nobility in the world, and the tablets compared all the other Dracula films all overshadowed by. Because this is not just a horror movie and aristocratic temperament and accomplishment on the inside of the movie. i really enjoy this movie!",Dracula
355,tophkissane,A great creepy horror film,8,13 May 2016,"This film was amazingly creepy. Bela Lugosi is an amazing Dracula; so suave and charming that his victims are unable to escape before its too late. His portrayal is how I will always imagine Dracula. He is a terrifying monster; one that can trick you into being a victim. Dwight Frye is also a brilliant Renfield. He gives an astounding and horrifying performance of a madman. The set of this movie is amazing. It is dark and gloomy, and provides the perfect backdrop for a story about a vampire. Tod Browning's direction is great as well. There are none of the loud jump scares that seem so vital to many horror films- only slow moving creepiness, which has an even scarier effect. But it is really Lugosi's portrayal of the famous vampire and Frye's Renfield that makes the film so powerful and so creepy. This is a great classic horror film, and I will definitely be seeing it again.",Dracula
356,rivardoman,Classic Creature of the Night!,10,19 February 2014,"Tod Browning's Dracula 1931 is every vampire movie you will ever need. Great performances all around. Dwight Frye as Renfield is great! The film has the elements of all great horror, the harbingers telling Renfield not to travel to see Dracula are great! Bela Lugosi does a fantastic job as Count Dracula. The hypnosis sequences are great, the effects draw the viewers attention to Lugosi's eyes. The composition of the shots was very well thought out. The lighting was substantial while maintaining a good darkness and good use of fog. The film has a spectacular build up as Dracula puts his spell on others. The climax resulting how most vampire films end. Dracula is a classic and everyone should view it at least once.",Dracula
357,Our_Feature_Presentation,Dracula: I Bid You Welcome,8,18 January 2014,"Dracula starts off in Transylvania, you're immediately set into the tone of the movie. The tone is made because of the fog, sets and scenery it puts the viewer into a strange mood that really fits this movie. Dracula himself is introduced in a pitch perfect way, and Dracula himself is brought to life by horror icon, Bela Lugosi. Lugosi gives one of the best and most memorable performances ever put into a movie, he's sinister, threatening, his stare (which is focused on many time) and the way he says his lines in that Hungarian accent all of it makes Lugosi not portray Dracula but he IS Dracula. The movie doesn't have a soundtrack at all if there's no talking there is no noise, but that's good it again heightens the mood of everything. For a movie that's 80 years + it is surprisingly.... frighting. Not in the sense of pure fear but more in the way that the whole time your kept in total suspense, the entire movie just felt like a long scene with endless suspense, this is due to the lack of music, scenery and Bela Lugosi's performance, I love the feeling of it. Now something I must say, some people may find it boring and slow, I can see how some people would find it boring but it wasn't to me. To close off this review Im going to give it a 9.2 out of 10. This is the perfect movie to watch during the Halloween season.",Dracula
358,saramatrazzo,More a Play than a Film,6,6 October 2019,"I was less than impressed with this film. It is a good story that wasn't executed nearly to its potential. Sometimes the absence of dialogue enhances the little that is said, but sometimes it just is lacking. There were too few effects to add to the supernatural elements of vampire nature... no scenes of wolves... very kitschy bats... not even a drop of blood. It was largely underwhelming. Van Helming and Dracula were played well, but I expected a less bizarre and comical looking vampire. I thought Dracula's wives would have benefited the movie if they had a larger part. All in all, this erred on the side of theatrical. Things were described-not shown-and the acting was over the top dramatic. Some positives: I loved the bright, wide eyes and the light and camera work used to illuminate faces. The best performance in my opinion was Mr. Renfield!",Dracula

Although it has its sort of cheesy props and stage settings, this movie makes for famous quotes and scenes that I knew about before I even saw the movie. Lagosi depicts a great corteous, but evil character. This movie also plays great with lighting and camera work. Early on in the movie, when Dracula sees Harker's blood from the finger, that angle & lighting plays so well with Dracula's thirst for blood. I also enjoy how the movie plays out scene to scene. I am not really a fan of early horror, but this movie is just a great watch all in all.",Dracula
360,persianlax,Was monumental at its time!,9,11 October 2017,"I love the story behind this and Nosferatu was one of my all time favorite classic horror movies. I've seen Dracula live in play to but Bela Lugosi absolutely kills it and owns the role. He has his way with the women and to see him sucking blood from a human for 1931 Im sure that was some what outlandish or controversial. I love the classic mirror scene where it is notices his reflection is not shown, it is a simple way of using the very basic camera angles and techniques to plant this seed in the audience of Dracula being truly the evil vampire he is . Good sense of realism I at times was fixated on the screen and for a moment forgot everything else and just wanted to see what would happen next. Draculas castle to this day is most impressive in this movie and instead of the monster which was Nosferatu you have the charming count ! I dig it",Dracula

The film has great sound quality and special effects for the time at which it was produced. The film in its own right is an amazing classic horror film. Many watching the film now would say that the film is ""dusty"" and clunky. I personally believe that the film was masterfully done for the technology that was available at the time. Great use of story telling that elegantly displayed the original text quite well. Truly a great representation of early American Cinema within the horror genre.",Dracula

There was quite a bit of suspense and the way Dracula was portrayed in most scenes, he was creepier than I expected. For instance, whenever they showed him staring at someone longingly, they showed a certain light only on his eyes to show the seriousness and intent that he had. Also, Dracula's castle was really interesting with all of the long, thin candlesticks to light everything; it emphasized the dark and creepiness within the movie. Also, Dracula's first victim in the movie, I loved how crazy he was, I felt that it wasn't silly, I felt it was neat how crazed he had become in his search for blood and doing what Dracula wanted him to. The only problem I had with this movie was way it had ended; I felt like it was so abrupt. I thought there was a lot of unanswered questions that needed to be resolved. I was impressed with this movie and would enjoy to watch it again and would recommend this to anyone.",Dracula

I think it a less is more situation. but that's only for some parts. in more...lighted scenes Dracula gives off the cool manipulative vibe that is so well accustomed to the fanged crusader.it hard to explain, but ill put it this way. the part of it that are good are really fricken good. but the parts that fall short, also fall on their face.",Dracula

To start off one thing i noticed that was very interesting about this film was the effects. One of the effects that was pretty cool was when they had the bats in the film, i thought they did a good job with that. Something i really enjoyed about this movie was how the actor who portrayed Dracula went all out to play his character to the best of his abilities. My reason for believing this is the actor really embraced his character, he gave Dracula what you could consider a monster like way of speaking and moving throughout the film, i thought this was very unique and made the movie stand out. In all honestly i thought this was a very good film, but i really wasn't to thrilled with how it ended. When the film nears towards the ending we see Dracula preparing for the coming of dawn, but as he is doing so the professor finds him. Once the professor finds Dracula i feel that the film is ended quickly and it should have lasted a little bit longer giving more details towards the films ending. All in all though i believe that Dracula was a pretty great film.",Dracula
365,inemjaso,"""I bid you Welcome"" to the masterful world of vampires",8,2 February 2017,"Like Universal's other 1931 'monster' film Frankenstein, Browning's Dracula uses impressive cinematography to create the early horror aesthetic. In the movie's opening, we see a still shot of smoke rolling ominously over the mountains in Transylvania as Renfield's coach approaches Count Dracula's residence. Soon after, we get a zoom shot into the hibernation catacombs where Dracula and his 'wives' sleep during the day; the camera eventually zooms into Dracula's casket where we see his hand emerge from inside. Another excellent use of cinematography in the opening half hour was when Renfield faints at the open window. A still shot from behind Renfield shows the three wives approaching Renfield until a smoke is seen building outside near the open window, from which Dracula emerges and sends away his wives. Dracula's character is carefully crafted so the viewer is aware of what attracts and repels him. He has an obvious affinity for blood and is capable of manipulating human minds to perform tasks for him (usually followed by a zoom shot of his evil smile). However, the brilliant adversary Dr. Van Helsing knows that wolf's bane, sunlight, mirrors and most powerfully- the crucifix- stop Dracula's advances. A brilliant recurring use of foreshadowing was the presence of the large bat in every scene before Dracula entered. Like Frankenstein, this film has an abrupt ending, but it provides closure nonetheless.",Dracula
366,plounzzzz,Horror classic,8,15 February 2017,"As a massive fan of horror films myself, I was intrigued to watch this as it was practically the inception of monster horror films. It is without a doubt that this film is very well made. The sets themselves are incredibly advanced for its time. Lugosi plays the role very well as the villain vamp. The acting is comical at times, and the times haven't been kind to the film in terms of effects. There's no blood/biting/death on screen. The film seemed rather low-budget. It gets a little slow around the middle of the film. The above needs to be taken with a grain of salt considering the date it was made.

367,j-maloney13,entertaining,7,17 April 2017,"This is such a classic horror film, epitomizing everything that is good in this genre. While the actual scare factor has decreased as time goes on, due to the newer style of jump scares in recent years, it was still a truly suspenseful and thrilling film. You really can get the feel of how evil Count Dracula is with the help of cinematography. In the beginning of the film, there were several medium and close up shots of Dracula and that devilish look in his eyes, with a pitch black background. This low-key lighting enabled us to feel fear, as the sole focus was on his face. Bela Lugosi really knocked this role out of the park, but what really stood out to me was Dwight Frye's role as Renfield. After he turned, he played the maniac role quite well, with his eyes imitating Dracula's, and his sinister laugh giving us goosebumps. The fact that there was no soundtrack improved the film tremendously, as it really helped with making it as eerie of a film as possible.I thought that the camera work added quite a lot to the creepiness of the film. As good as the acting was, cinematography played a major key in making this a quality picture. There were a lot of pan shots, and the film utilized the fade in and out effect for transitions. But the best shots were the evil close ups, because each time we were reminded of how terrifying he looked and how suspenseful he can make things. After Renfield cut himself, there was a quick zoom on Dracula's face that made us wondering if he was going to do it right then and there. Lastly, in the beginning there were establishing shots of Dracula's castle, which helped to showcase the mysteriousness of this man.",Dracula

Dracula manages to encapsulate an immersive and ominous tone thanks to it's fantastic mise-en-scene. Not only that but the camera work and use of low key lighting also adds a lot of substance to the imagery of this film. Other then those two key features of the production I found that the acting and writing, while perfectly fine, didn't produce the same kind of timeless influence found in the cinematography and editing of this movie.

While many people have done a good job playing this role I believe that Bela Lugosi had the most influence. Whenever someone does an impression of Dracula it is always the over-the-top Lugosi Transylvania voice which is great. It shows that this great movie has a lasting impact and a great influence on the genre as a whole. Over all this movie is very good, the sets are creepy, the story is memorable, and Bela Lugosi leaves a lasting impression even if he's not that creepy and more goofy.",Dracula

Everything from his foreign mannerisms to what syllable he decided to annunciate in speech totally embodied the mystical vampire creature essence. The set although dark and using shadow to the advantage was pretty elaborate I'm assuming for the time period.

For example early in the movie when a women is handing over a necklace, the camera zooms in close on her holding the necklace and its almost like a picture of her holding the necklace was put into the camera.

I understand that they it filmed it relatively quick but the acting was sub-par, the set not so scary and quite obvious. I guess my main problem that I can't get around is the fact that there always seems to be that damsel in distress that always needs saving from the monster. It was a predictable movie. The only redeeming quality the movie had was through the performance of Bela Lugosi who played Count Dracula. His performance was incredible and the the way they shot his scenes with the lighting and shooting looking up a him made him positively creepy. The directors would put shadows across his face and do upward shots so you had the feeling of being looked down upon. They had some nice trick shots with the cobs webs where Dracula could walk through them but the lawyer could not. They also did an interesting thing with making Count Dracula's appearance in mirrors not show up. Those little things made the movie worth watching and Bela Lugosi's performance but besides that I do not recommend this movie for its story but rather the things I mentioned earlier.",Dracula

He is charming, yet brings an intense aura to the screen. You believe you are in this cat and mouse chase for the man named Dracula. One feature that makes this movie effective is its lighting. Each shot was perfectly illuminated to show intensity or to make an impact on the scene or characters involved in a scene. Dracula's eyes were a great example of using lighting perfectly.

380,blanoue324,Dracula (1931) is an excellent horror film that avoids the usual gore of our current horror films.,8,18 October 2016,"Dracula (1931) is a very good movie. It uses many gloomy and dark scenes to set the tone for the whole movie. For example in the beginning Dracula's castle in completely dark and is in shambles. There's smoke everywhere and everything is dark. One scene I particularly like is when the travel agent passes out in the doorway and Dracula emerges from the smoke on the other side of the doorway and shoos away the three lady vampires. Then proceeds to drink his blood and turn him into a minion vampire. I find it funny when Dracula uses his hypnotizing vision. They do a close up and highlight his eyes while he stares into the camera. They use a lot of parallel editing throughout the movie to show where Dracula is in relation to what murder he has committed. Also we get some insight on Dracula's life, he says that there are worse things than death. This is his passive way of saying he doesn't like what he has to do in order to survive. The acting of Bela Lugosi as the count gives us all the creeps. The way he talks and the way he acts all adds to the horror that the film is about. The movie is a very creepy movie and it avoids all the gore that we usually have in our horror nowadays.",Dracula

Personally, I love stories with vampires and thrill so it was pretty interesting to see where it all started on film. Bela Lugosi's performance as Dracula was really amazing. It was the perfect balance between just creepy and scary. Dracula is a pretty believable character too, one of the most important things to have in a horror/thriller is a character that feels like it can actually exist in the real world.

I just didn't think the Dracula was all that scary. in todays films, I jump up and my heart races, but for a movie that is supposed to be a horror film, it just doesn't do it for me.The movie shows in black and white which could be better in color, but for the time it was okay. Inside the castle where the spider webs were was creepy, but from that point I could barely see the rest of the castle because of the dark shadows glaring. overall the film was alright, but nothing really jumped out at me.

Most note-worthy is the look on his face when he is communicating through telepathy, it just gives me the heebie jeebies!!! However, I found it a little lack luster and it was difficult to keep my eyes open. I believe this is largely due to the lack of a soundtrack, it was almost purely driven by dialogue. Not to mention, the ending left me disappointed and upset that there was not a large build up in suspense. It sort of just rose about as high as a Little Tykes plastic slide and, well, fell. Don't be mistaken, I still appreciate the movie for what it is and I recognize why it was so popular following it's release considering how it was one of the better well-made horror movies of the time.

The acting was great and the story line was obviously amazing. Van Helsing was the typical good guy and I couldn't help but root for him when things got crazy. The only thing I would change would be Dracula's death. I wish they would have made this part of the movie more of a climatic point. I think they could've done a lot more.

Bela Lugosi's portrayal of the vampire set the standard for what a true vampire should be, horrifyingly charming, yet as creepy as a creature of the night can possibly get. However, the movie was set at a fairly slow pace, in regards to action and even the Count's movement. His death had been anti-climactic, I had been expecting Count Dracula to put up more of a fight given his trouble of obtaining Mina, as opposed to going to sleep in his coffin allowing for Dr. Seward and Dr. Van Helsing to kill him effortlessly. However, his spooky personality and ruthless demeanor allowed for an entertaining thriller nonetheless. Dracula will continue to define the legacy of vampire movies until the end of time.",Dracula

Having not watch many movies from this era of filmmaking I've found it fun to see the difference in techniques compared to films of later years. One such technique is panning the camera at an actor walks across the room in order to follow their movements, Dracula had none of this and you can clearly see that an actor will simply walk out of view and into another camera shot.

388,Victoria0708,It doesn't suck,8,8 October 2018,"Tod Browning did an excellent job in choosing the Count Dracula character in Dracula. Bela Lugosi had the perfect demeanor and was able to keep a straight face, or an unreadable one, throughout the entire movie especially in the most rising action points. He was able to exceptionally capture the essence of Count Dracula. He made him creepy, but polite at the same time, which seems difficult to do. When I picture Count Dracula, Lugosi's appearances fit that criteria perfectly. There were a lot of characters within this film, but I think that they all played their roles very well, especially Dwight Frye who played as Renfield in the film. He did a really good job playing his character. He was obedient but also knew his standings and would try to help where he can without going against his master. You could see his confliction on his face and his internal struggle.
 
Although this film was not very scary to me, I can see how it may have been a hit back in the day. It does have a creepy sense and if for not all the scary movies I have seen, this may have been scarier. And this was one of the scarier ones from when these types of movies came out, from what I have heard. It also fit into the ""standard"" vampire which was one of my first standard vampire films. I have heard of what the normal theories of them were and I have seen the Twilight series, but that doesn't show the ""norm"" of vampires. It is more complex in that movie than in Dracula. Overall, I think this film is intriguing, creepy, and well made for the early 1930's.",Dracula

The movie was also hard to follow, and the scenes were always ending kind of abruptly. The accents, clothing and use of sound throughout the movie added to the fear of ""Dracula"". I think filming the movie with less use of lights did add to the overall sensation the film gave. Again, just as most movies during this time it was predictable, and there could have been more scenes that contributed to the plot.",Dracula
391,mafreysphone,Classic!,10,13 February 2019,"My first ever black and white film was Nosferatu and I absolutely loved comparing that movie to this one. Bela Lugosi portrays my favorite Dracula ever. I am particularly enthralled (no pun intended!) with his predatory stare even as I have to contain a giggle at the way his hands crook as he moves toward his next target. This movie is absolutely fantastic, one of my favorites, and never gets old! I can see how this film became the inspiration for the many, many, horror films that came after and it really does deserve to be recognized as the masterpiece that I consider it to be.",Dracula
392,j-howard-91663,Dracula Analysis - Jacob Howard,8,9 February 2020,"The conversations and the movement of the actors in the movie seemed very slow and rigid. Especially for Dracula, the slow and awkward movements expressed the idea that Dracula is a creepy creature of the night. Dracula was also quite slow and awkward when he was having conversations throughout the movie. This aspect expressed the overall feel of the movie alongside the creepy outfits of Dracula and his undead and the spine-chilling scenes of Dracula's castle and Carfax Abbey.The cinematography and editing had an excellent mix of focusing on one part of a scene and casting the big picture whenever it was necessary. For example, when Professor Van Helsing looked in the mirror, the audience has several close up shots of the mirror. Showing that Dracula's reflection is not visible, signifying Dracula is a vampire to Van Helsing and the audience. The overall lighting was well done. Brilliant use of lighting was when Dracula was attempting to hypnotize humans he encountered like Mr. Renfield and Miss Mina; there was a close-up shot of Dracula's face with lighting centered around his eyes, signifying he is trying to hypnotize them.Another component that expressed the mese-en-scene of the movie was the sounds that were expressed throughout the movie. The wolves howling in the night and the gut retching screams of a woman being murdered by Dracula are examples of the movie conveying a frightening tone to the audience.",Dracula
393,Storm3p,A Classic for the Times,7,12 February 2020,"This movie established many of the modern tropes that we all know for Dracula and the lead performance was definitely captivating. On an interesting note about cliches, in the movie the Vampire fears something other than the classic garlic, it is replaced with Wolfs-bane, which is traditionally used to cure people of lycanthropsy or just as a general poison. In general, while the movie is rightly seen as a classic, the acting was very stiff though ought outside of Dracula and Van Helsing themselves, and the lighting quality was quite poor so it was hard to tell what was going on, especially in the scenes that were supposed to be night time.
All in all, a fine movie, with flaws that in the modern age would have probably sunk this movie more than they affected it in that era.",Dracula
394,fidelio7,'Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make!',9,12 February 2011,"Based upon the novel by Bram Stoker, 'Dracula' tells the classic story of the titular Transylvanian Count, an ageless vampire who has existed for centuries. Seeking fresh blood, Count Dracula travels to England where he moves into Carfax Abbey and focuses his attentions upon an innocent young woman named Mina. He transforms a man named Renfield (Dwight Frye) into a raving lunatic who acts as Dracula's slave and who lives upon a steady diet of flies and spiders. Dwight Frye is a real scene stealer in this film; he is so charismatic that Alice Cooper even wrote a song about him (1971's 'Ballad of Dwight Frye')!Director Tod Browning and Karl Freund (an uncredited co-director) have crafted a wonderfully creepy Gothic horror film. Although I am not sure why the Count would have armadilloes roaming his dusty and cobweb-riddled castle! As Dracula, Bela Lugosi is splendid; he manages to be both creepy and elegant at the same time. The film is atmospheric and very detailed, and richly rewards multiple viewings. You will want to come back to this one again and again. Also, if you like Tod Browning's work, then his disturbing, uncompromising, and very controversial 'Freaks' is highly recommended.",Dracula
395,adillon1208,Set the way for horror movies,10,8 March 2011,"This is a fantastic eerie movie that is probably the first vampire movie ever made. It definitely set the way for all other vampire ideas.The tone and even the black and white of the movie (although it was not an option to have it any other way for a film made in the early 1930s) definitely gives you a feeling of eeriness and slight horror.A classic scary movie that I recommend everyone watch at least once in your life. Even if you do not really like horror movies (like me) this is definitely one you should give a chance. You may even find yourself liking horror movies after this, or at least wanting to give them a chance.",Dracula
396,ilvatz,Excellent in All Aspects,10,29 February 2012,"I found this movie to be one of the greatest experiences with classic horror films that I have ever had. I usually find them slightly tacky but the excellent acting and classic storyline of this movie made it an excellent experience all around.Lugosi never fails to amaze with his signature 'creepy' persona. He captures the feel of Count Dracula to a tee in this amazing film. You can almost see all the years of inflicting pain in his eyes every time he bites a victim. You can almost feel the conflict going on behind his eyes as he takes a victim for sustenance and snuffs out their bright light of life. The scene where he takes the girl in the asylum you can almost see the tears in his eyes as he bites the girl.Dracula's servant also has some incredible acting in this movie. The scene on the ship where they open up the hatch and you can see him staring up at you from the inside of the ship reflects such evil and insanity that it truly makes an unforgettable impression.Besides all of the incredible acting that this movie has to offer, the scenes are set up masterfully and truly set the mood for the film. Draculas castle, set up to be dark, dank and abandoned looking truly sets the scene for evil events to unfold. The cobwebs and long winding staircases could only be the most perfect dwelling place for the King of Vampires and lord of evil himself.",Dracula
397,WildestDreams,Too many flaws,3,11 June 2017,"The only impressive aspects are the lighting techniques throughout the movie and a few of the sets. Three minutes in, some Hungarians plainly state that ""Dracula is a vampire"". Every viewer is aware of this fact beforehand, but it is a lame choice to explicitly state it so early on. This characterizes the lack of suspense and intrigue in the film.The performance of Dracula is hailed as iconic, but he is not menacing or creepy. The awkward timing of his speech and movements, and the repetition of vacant stares more so give the impression that he is mentally challenged. It is unclear what the closeups of his clean-cut and fang-less face is supposed to be doing for the audience.When he arrives in London, Dracula advertises himself and his new address to everyone he meets. The property is adjacent to a sanitarium. The sanitarium contains a living quarters where a Dr. Seward lives with his daughter. It is said that Dr. Seward's daughter is in grave danger. This warning is issued by a man who returned to London at the same time as Dracula's arrival. But Dr. Seward is unable to put 2 and 2 together and get 4. He ignores repeated warning and his daughter indeed becomes in grave danger.People in London are being mysteriously killed, yet all the pretty ladies choose to sleep with their windows open. This makes for convenient access for Dracula in bat-form. He nails 2 ladies on back to back nights in this manner.At times, characters observe that ""he or she has a pair of strange marks on their neck!"". A black marker could have achieved this effect sufficiently, but the audience is shown necks that are unscathed. Even with a strong imagination, the absence of bites on the supposedly bitten is hard to look past.The most foolish element of 1931's Dracula is that Dr. Van Helsing could have taken Dracula out at any time. Dracula tells everyone where he lives, Van Helsing knows vampires must hide from daylight, and he knows how to dispose of vampires. He waits until the last minute to act, allowing the victims to pile up.These observations have nothing to do with the movie's age. There is a stunning lack of intelligence to it. And Dracula himself is written as a cunning powerhouse of a creature. His portrayal in this film is not clever nor strong.",Dracula
398,cokezero99,Classic Gothic Cinema!,9,23 September 2012,"Firstly I may be biased here. I have a strong fancy for Gothic literature, film, and music. This film is very much that: Gothic. So therefore I approve it thoroughly. This is a film from a different era. It's 1931. Only in 1922 did the now famous Nosferatu come out in it's full silent German expressionist glory but this film is with sound and lost the distorted look of expressionism. It's a classic just by these merits. But there are some things that a modern viewer might raise an eyebrow at: no music, the acting style, the flow of the film....The acting is of a different kind. The actors/actresses don't overact but exude the energy of their characters. Dracula is very Dracula, Renfield is very insane, and so on. They are exactly what they are cast as and that's good. The scenery is amazing.There are a few faults with the film which snapped me out of the dream. Some scene transitions were very fast; by that I mean the story seemed to be told too fast and the transition of events weren't fully elaborated. I knew what happened, having read the book and seen many other Dracula films, but I felt that it should have slowed down some parts. I really wanted to see more and more but at these times was thinking ""okay, that's happening already, no set up to it?""At times I laughed out aloud at some ridiculous parts such as a wasp/bee coming out of an apparent ""mini coffin"", armadillos lurking the castle, and Dracula's stare which occasionally went from being soul crushing to being absurd.The sets are amazing. At times you have to pause the film to admire it even though it is in a grainy sepia tone.All in all you have to watch this. The fact you looked up Dracula on here demands it because like Nosferatu this is a key point in the story that is Dracula.9/10... -1 because of the speed of the film and the armadillos.",Dracula
399,tyonkers1234,"A good film, but over-hyped",5,13 March 2013,"There is no denying that Dracula is a classic film. Bela Lugosi's portrayal of Count Dracula is flawless and alone makes the movie worth watching once, that's where the major appeal of this movie ended for me. I found it very hard for this film to grasp my attention and keep me craving more. As with the 1931 Frankenstein, these movies aren't considered scary by today's standards, but Dracula didn't even surprise me in many ways during it. That being said, I would still consider this film to be a classic, because it still fostered ideas for countless masses of horror movies to come and still features solid acting, particularly by Lugosi, whose acting is flawless.",Dracula

Bela was perfect and this has had a tremendous influence on Hollywood over the decades! It does drag in some places and certain parts were a little lack luster, but overall, it was creepiness at its best. The entire cast and most of the script/story were excellent.

401,jolieschu,"A plethora of dramatic faces, slanted lighting, and the occasional scream",8,18 October 2017,"I didn't expect to enjoy this film as much as i did. It's a short, one hour experience that essentially introduced one of the most memorable movie monsters to date. So, be prepared for a plethora of dramatic faces, slanted lighting, and the occasional scream.Bela Lugosi's performance as Dracula feels over the top, but in the best way possible. He is't given an exhaustive back story; as Hollywood feels the need to do with most every hero and villain on screen now, and that works in its favor. Not having an explanation as to how Dracula came to be actually opens up a lot of doors for storytelling with this character. Something that film-makers evidently knew, if the sequels are anything to go by. I was surprised at the way Van Helsing was portrayed; modern interpretations seem to take this character in varied ways. Dwight Frye, who played the role of 'Renfield' was massively entertaining, erratic and energetic in a way that the dignified Dracula was not. Together, they make an interesting pair on screen. This and its sequels would be great bing material for Halloween night.",Dracula
402,juliette-20138,Clearly influential,7,3 February 2018,"It is quite evident that this movie was very influential both with respect to society and the movie industry. It can be seen as one of the movies that kicked off the horror film genre, and even today, we seen remains of its effects. In present society, I would be surprised to find someone who is not familiar with the story of Dracula and the vampire movies that were inspired by this original story. As a horror movie lover today, I cannot overcome my bias in judging the plot of the movie and the movie in general. I found it very slow and predictable, but this is likely because of what I have been exposed to at present time. If I were a movie-goer in 1931, perhaps I would have have enjoyed it much more; I'm sure that I would not have seen anything like it, and it would most likely a very good thriller in my 1931 eyes. Even in my mindset today, I did find that the lighting (darkness throughout the film) contributed to the scary tone and was very effective in producing a horror effect. The widening of the eyes of both Dracula and Renfield had a similar effect that I enjoyed.Aside from my biases as a young adult in today's world, I enjoyed this movie. Its effects are clearly widespread, and I have movies like this to thank for the modern horror movies I love today.",Dracula
403,hayleygorman-43033,A classic,8,7 February 2018,"If there was to be a list of the most influential and well-loved films of all time, 1931's Dracula would very certainly be on it, if not near the very top. The main thing that sticks out in my mind is the atmosphere; the lack of music or background noise. Somehow, the lack of atmospheric sound makes for a wonderfully unnerving and creepy feeling. The acting is also well done, an oozingly charming but disconcerting Dracula and a manic and crazed Renfield, where much of the acting is expressed through the face, excellently portrayed in the latter. The lack of any actual blood or biting forces the terror to be explained verbally or seen through the characters and their actions, which actually heightens the experience of fearing the vampire man himself. A film that has lived on through history and seen countless retellings and reiterations, truly a film that has had and will have immense effect and influence over movies and for a long time.",Dracula

However, this movie is no Twilight.This movie actualizes and places the nightmare creatures of vampires into our own realities. A movie created at this time period with this subject matter was rare and Dracula was one of the first.Bela Lugosi had no actors, or visual characters to study. he set the bar high for fictional characters like vampires.The entrance of the movie shows great juxtaposition of Renfelid's oblivious and innocent nature to Count Dracula's ways compared to the people that reside in the town outside of the castle. There fear in there eyes are almost malleable. When they are speaking in a different language it creates a want to know that they are saying and draws you into the movie.The character of Dracula has lifetimes of knowledge and depth.

I re-watched the beginning several times to make sure that I hadn't missed anything because I was so confused. Many parts in the beginning seemed to leave it open to the viewer to interpret. No real reason I understood for the story.Now for the good...the lighting and camera usage was incredible! The lighting and the crisp contrasts of the blacks and whites in filming was I'm sure part of this movies success. The way in which it was filmed, the closes ups of Dracula's face, the way the camera showed things such as the mirror scene help to the dramatics of the story. Overall an okay movie, worth watching for the use of lighting and the actual filming in ""old"" Hollywood.",Dracula

It can make you feel like you are in the film too. Mina played by Helen chandler. She is one of the women that Dracula transformation her into a creature of the night.

They also got the idea of Dracula right as he was so powerful no human could compare making the other characters and the audience feel powerless to do anything. The other actor I enjoyed watching was Dwight Frye as Renfield as he portrayed a man who has gone mad in an entertaining fashion by just always being energetic and paranoid.While the acting was ok, the way the movie was shot was beautiful. It was able to get the atmosphere right with its Gothic architecture combined with it dark lighting giving a foreboding feeling.

Best actor best character very round. Dracula was not even the least bit intimidating. His faces were hilarious, not frightening.

Although it's not a particularly exciting movie, it has its horror moments and subtleties that make it very watchable. As opposed to reading the quite lengthy original book. I'd give it a watch it's certainly a classic.",Dracula
412,stevebob99,"Watch the movie, but read the book, too.",10,14 July 2004,"Bela Lugosi's Dracula is the standard by which all other Dracula stories are measured, but it has basically 3 fundamental flaws:1) Plot lines are not developed very well2) It deviates from vampire legend and from the Bram Stoker novel3) It lacks the religious undertone of perverted resurrectionSome spoilers follow-1) Plot lines not developed- for instance- Lucy Westenra dies after one vampire bite instead of having a slow torturous death that involves heroic efforts from 3 suitors and recruiting of Van Helsing. There doesn't really seem to be a good reason to write Van Helsing in the first place.2) Plot deviations- for instance- Dr Seward should be Lucy and Nina's contemporary, but he is portrayed as Nina's father. Renfield is unrelated to the rest in the story and is separately recruited by Dracula, but in movie he acts as the real estate agent (Jonathan Harker's role)...3) Religious undertones- Dracula is a story about an anti-Christ who is resurrected to undeath rather than to life. The parallels to Christ are numerous- he lives after death, he is both corporal and spirit, he must be invited to enter a house while Christ bids us to invite Him into our heart, etc and the contrasts are also important- he hates light where Christ is the light of the World, he gropes about in darkness, he seeks to destroy, he pollutes blood.Bela Lugosi's acting is superb, almost too good. The book's Dracula is repulsive while Lugosi is suave. The book's Dracula speaks English perfectly, while Lugosi has permanently cursed the character with a Romanian accent.The movie is tremendous, but the book tells a different story. Watch the movie, but read the book, too. Both are great in their own rite.",Dracula
413,KylePowell,Dracula,7,14 December 2016,"Overall, a great film of its time although feeling a bit clunky in some areas. For instance, when the bat flies up to the window, the camera cuts from bat to girl to Bela Lugosi, the viewer is left insinuating the bat to man transition. It happened so fast I almost missed it. The acting helped to boost its attractiveness very much. Lugosi's portrayal of a Transylvanian vampire stuck out so much that most media involving Dracula even to today try to replicate the speaking voice. The whole ""insane man"" persona that Dwight Frye portrayed was spectacular. In conclusion, I generally enjoyed most of the film albeit seeing some of it as clunky and mashed together.",Dracula
414,owengoldstoff,A certainly good (but somewhat stale) watch,7,13 February 2019,"Although it definitely felt a bit stale, I enjoyed and appreciated this classic horror film. At the beginning, the lack of soundtrack helped create an ominous, eerie mood, but, as the film went on, I felt it could have benefited from the addition of music. The pacing was noticeably off, and I think music could have changed that, along with adding greater suspense to certain scenes. There were many interesting camera shots and the use of mirrors throughout the film was very clever. One shot, however, of Count Dracula's face, up-close, the light fixed on his gleaming eyes, was heavily overused. Don't get me wrong, it was a cool shot, but I think the use of it over and over was too much, when maybe one or two times could have done the job just as well.
I commend the acting, most notably Bela Lugosi as Dracula and Dwight Frye as Renfield. Lugosi played your quintessential vampire character. You can clearly see the influence his performance has had on later portrayals of this character and of vampires in general. As for Frye, he portrayed a man who's mental health and sanity are slowly deteriorating. He is aware of his transformation, and the frustration he shows due to his inability to fight it is extremely convincing. In the end, regardless of the movie's flaws, I am glad I watched it. I say this without regard to the terrifying scenes of Dracula standing at the foot of a bed, slowly approaching the person sleeping, which provided me, as I'm sure it has many others before, with some serious nightmare fuel.",Dracula

Phillip Glass' score for Koyaanisqatsi is annoyingly jarring but really an essential part of the ""crazy life""-effect in that film, but with Dracula, I'm a little bit old school-- leave the soundtrack (or what little there is of it) alone, and sure, give us the option of the Glass score only if we'd like to hear it that way.",Dracula

418,jsgam,Quite an intense adaption,10,13 March 2020,"As far as I'm concerned, Nosferatu (1922) is arguably the best Dracula film ever made. However, Universal Studio's Dracula is still one of the best 1930's movies, clocking in at 89 years old in 2020.What makes Dracula a great movie is the exceptionally creepy Bela Lugosi' (Undead! Undead! Undead.) The ominous nature with no background music, except when it's natural, and the well cast actors.The film is not very close to the novel at all, eliminating some characters and expanding Van Helsing a bit. Many awesome scenes were added that were not from its source material, such as the cross scene, the scene where Dracula turns into a bat and the sets that look like a novice film project by today's standards. still, the simplicity gives the feel a vintage charm, and we have a vestige into classic horror.Initially, I was a bit disapointed when I first saw Dracula, as I had literally just finished Dracula by Bram Stoker prior, then i realized that this film must be taken for what it is and not what it should be. I've come to accept it as my favorite film of the 1930's.The film also has a cool use of characters. Reinfield is initially dull and innocent. Harker is not mentioned very often. Mina is portrayed as quite meek, as opposed to Ellen in Nosferatu, where she is portrayed significantly stronger etc.Albeit this film in no way holds up to the CGI of today's standards, you can feel the heart and soul that went into making this film. Dracula is so absurdly artsy that it makes you gripped from start to finish.it must be said however, if you want to see a really scary picture, you probably won't find it here. The effects are laughable by today's standards, but that only adds to its charm.""You're all crazy.""",Dracula

Growing up knowing who that was and is brought excitement when I had seen there was a very very early make of it. Sadly for me, Did not even come close to anything involved with Dracula. This seemed pushed and rushed. The acting was so-so at best and story line very bland. Those things need to be executed very well for a modern day audience to enjoy it.

Had the horror that they could do back then and even now it is still good for a thriller. How Dracula was portrayed could easily freak people out and also could easily attract people with his normal side. Camera work on the film was done very well, and the transitions from room to room (scene to scene) were pretty smooth.

With Renfield being held inside of Dr.Sewards sanitarium it gave Dracula an upper hand. It is almost like Professor Van Helsing and Dr.Seward had to solve a mystery. The scene where the Professor sees that he can not see Dracula in a mirror really is the turning point of them figuring out what is really going on. The story of Dracula trying to go after Mina and the almost love for each other is very interesting. It kept the viewer on their toes throughout the whole movie with all the different events.

I will always have so much respect for this film because of that. Every Dracula or vampire film made since this movie was shaped by this film. Whether they emulated parts of it or consciously tried to set themselves apart from it. The imagery of Dracula or vampires immediately draw the image of Bela's Dracula to mind. Bela did an excellent job being Dracula, especially since he barely had an idea what he was saying. His face was very expressive and dramatic.Dracula is a well made movie. It's always successful in painting an eerie mood. It has suspense and creeps, action and romance. I love the lighting in the film, how much everything contrasts. I always liked the effect of the tight shots of Dracula's face when he's using his powers of persuasion. And the ghostly flowing gowns of Dracula's wives striding across the room. This movie is great and I've seen it several times. My brother always preferred Frankenstein but I always liked Dracula.",Dracula
424,loveandjoy1188,Instant Classic,8,13 March 2019,"This movie is one of the rare movies that becomes an instant classic that everyone needs to see. It really got the horror genre to come into it's own and fueled further movies. Bela Lugosi plays Dracula perfectly, he gives me chills. This is the kind of movie that gives your bones a chill and you love it! The gliding camera shots are wonderful and the more times you watch this, the more you will enjoy it!",Dracula
425,LoneWolf19,Classic,9,13 February 2019,"This film is a classic, and a must-see for film buffs and horror fans alike. Excellent use of light and sound, and absolutely stunning performances especially from Bela Lugosi. There are quite a few reboots and spin-offs, but this is still the best in my opinion.",Dracula
426,morrjack,Nice to see where it came from,9,13 February 2019,"I was really excited to watch this film, excited to see where the many many adaptations came from and was not disappointed at all. I really enjoyed the story, even though it was simple and basic, it captures all the elements of Dracula. Shapeshifting, fear of crosses, invisible in mirrors, turning others into vampires, everything. Even though some of the effects were a little outdated the set design was wonderful, glad to see the broken down castles and beautiful homes.",Dracula
427,mmcclelland,"""Children of the night. . . what music they make.""",8,3 November 2000,"Tod Browning directed one of the most visually eerie films ever made. It is so visually eerie that it wasn't given a score. I always felt that the bleak silence added to the powerful visuals and disturbing mood of the movie. I feared a score would detract from Bela Lugosi's sublime and sexually charged performance. I bought a CD of the new film score by the genius composer Phillip Glass and the brilliant Kronos Quartet some months ago and found the music to be understated and moody. So I decided to give the new scored version of Dracula a try. And While there is much to be said for the stark bareness of the unscored original -- I have to say that the full background that music gives a film is probably essential for making this classic more accessible to modern audiences. Glass does a wonderful job of complimenting the atmosphere of each scene and I did not find the score to be detracting in any way. I enjoyed this viewing of Dracula as much as I ever have. I should have realized that a little music could not steal a scene from the hypnotic tour de force of Bela Lugosi, the enigmatic performance by Dwight Frye or Browning's lusciously decaying sets of sugary webs and crumbling vermin infested stones. Dracula (1931) is one of the moodiest and most unsettling films ever made-- despite the fact that there is virtually no on-camera violence-- only threat and menace-- which comes exclusively from Lugosi's rich presence. Each frame is like a work of art -- meticulously painted by Browning. Lugosi moves through that painting as if he were artwork as well. It's probably been too long since you watched this movie and the new scored version is as good an excuse as any. ""Children of the night. . . what music they make.""",Dracula
428,ltdragonpress,Dracula is the perfect example of an outdated classic,7,21 October 2019,"Dracula is a cinema classic and there is no doubt about its historical significance. It was one the first monster films that spawned an entire genre as well as countless spin offs of the movie itself. However, I think it has definitely lost some of its appeal as time goes by. I thought the beginning of the movie was very good, because it was not overly dramatic like many movies at the time. It was mellow, in a suspenseful way, which made it feel more real. In addition, the relatively small cast and secluded gloomy nature of the setting made the movie feel spooky. However, as the movie went on, the acting started to get overly dramatic, which kind of broke the spell. In addition, the movie really milked the shocking (at the time) monster aspect to the point where it felt very dragged out. I'm sure it had a much more profound effect back when it was released. The quality of the movie is still very good, I just think that the execution of the plot was to slow. For that reason, I think the same film condensed to maybe 45 min would still hold up well today.",Dracula
429,ryanvaine,universal studios monsters,8,12 March 2020,"When Universal Studios produced and released ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dracula"" in the early 1930's, not only did these two movies turn Universal Studios into a well-known film-making studio, but also made the horror genre become immensely popular in American society. Although this film has many flaws, the plot and amazing acting by Bela Lugosi really turned this film into a classic. The camera work isn't amazing and pretty much stays stationary with little movement and long scenes, which makes you feel like you are watching a live play instead of a film. The little music and limited special effects make the film also feel a little amateur. However, the use of sound effects(bangs, thumps, etc), the use of lighting to create the different moods in the scenes, spooky setting, amazing plot and script, and excellent casting, really make up for the flaws and make people love this movie. The setting/location of this movie is in a dark, isolated, gloomy castle. Tod Browning(the director) went into extreme detail with making the setting/location of the film feel extremely eerie and not like a place you would want to end up in. The castle was enormous and empty, the stairs had comb webs, and he created a very unwelcoming feeling. The plot of this film was original and really scared people. The script was well-written and helped intensify the feeling of dread that the setting/location and plot line the film followed. The plot and script flowed together. The most important part of the film was how well Bela Lugosi embraced his role as Dracula. He morphed Dracula from a character on paper to a terrifying real-life vampire. His deep, unsettling voice combined with his facial expressions and gestures, really made Dracula seem like a real blood-thirsty monster. Bela Lugosi became the model for every vampire movie that came after Dracula.Overall, this films camera work and editing quality is not up to par, and could have been better. However, in the early 1930's, film-making was a lot different and directors did not have the same knowledge, resources, and experiences that later directors had access too. Regardless in the flaws were present or not, this film would still be a classic. Dracula was the birth of horror films.",Dracula
430,AdmiralLurch,Classic Horror,7,14 March 2013,"While this film is not the best horror movie I have seen, it is undoubtedly one of the classics. Bela Lugosi is fantastic in his portrayal of the Count, and his performance is what makes this movie work. Even if you don't typically enjoy horror movies you should see this movie. Even if it is outdated there are certain qualities that still make for some eerie moments, not to mention the chills from Lugosi's eyes during his many close-ups. I'm personally a horror fan, and it took me quite a while to getting around to seeing this film; Afterwards I wonder why, the ambiance is fantastic and you get drawn into the story, even if some of the other actors performance seemed lackluster. I recommend seeing this regardless of your typical taste in films.",Dracula
431,steffaneybenson,It was OK,7,4 February 2018,"I liked this film to an extent. Some parts did bore me a little bit and other parts kept me intrigued. Overall it was a good horror movie for this particular time frame. The ending was questionable as to what the guy planned to do after the couple had left and we see the guy put the stake up to Dracula's heart but we do not really see him actually kill him, so it leaves you with some questions. This film had a good screenplay and some good actors and a good setting so overall it was a good film.",Dracula
432,Glenn1820,Review for dracula,6,10 February 2019,"Dracula was an interesting film to watch.
While i personally thought it was boring in certain spots. I can very much imagine the terror it must have caused at it's release. With its use of light and dark and the creepy tone and lighting every time you see Dracula face. There was also in the opening scene the random placement of odd and disturbing animals in a way. I also found it interesting the way the actor that played Dracula was able to make simple tasks and conversations creepy.
Overall definitely worth the watch.",Dracula
433,CraWill,The Best Horror Film America Has Produced,10,28 November 2000,"This film is exactly what so many new horror movies are not.  There is little blood, little violence, no gore.  The settings, acting, etc. are so well done and so creepy, there's no need for the kind of shock value blood and gore provide.  Every other Dracula film, with the exception of the Jack Palance version from 1973, might as well not have been done.  Skip all of the new stuff and go to the classic!",Dracula
434,asjpier,A Horror Masterpiece,10,19 September 2019,"I was truly enamored with this film. The use of wolf howls and lighting really set the mood and feel of the whole movie. The absence of music in the movie made it seem very creepy and mysterious at times, especially in the meeting between Dracula and Renfield. Each of the actors did an amazing job at portraying their characters and really bringing them to life. Lugosi was amazing as Dracula and really made him seem mysterious and quite terrifying. Dwight Frye did a phenomenal job as Renfield at showing just how creepily insane the character was becoming over time. This film was truly a breakthrough for its time and I definitely recommend it to anyone who's a fan of horror movies.",Dracula
435,ryanatlan,Classic but doesn't go right with me,4,26 February 2020,"I do not understand how to say this without hurting a lot of feelings but I did not enjoy this film, like at all. Usually I am not to much of a critic of older movies because they only have so much to work with however this was a big flop for me and it wasn't because it was made in 1931. Not at all. For a movie that was competing with movies like Frankenstein, this was a total bust. I hated the fact that he never bit someone on the neck, or at least we didn't get to see it. I mean really? That's what Dracula is all about. So that was disappointing, also even though it was old, the ""gimmicks"" where absolutely horrible it looked so bad. However Dwight Frye had a strong performance. Overall I would not recommend this movie.",Dracula
436,Cinemarker,Lugosi is Dracula,8,11 March 2015,"There is no doubt that Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula is not only one of the most recognizable but also one of the most popular of the Draculas. The film is very clean, in that each of the cuts and edits were done so that it wasn't unsettling for the viewer. The sound of this film was very clean as well. The music is eerie and really sets the movie up with an early horror and or typical monster movie feel. Which is exactly what it is. While today some of the special effects, such as the faux bats are not up to the standard moviegoers expect to see today, for the 1930's this film was something. This is a movie you can watch again and again and not grow tired of. Not only is it a classic cinematic masterpiece, it has left an impression on and inspired numerous other movies following it.",Dracula
437,adamfabbie,Adams,2,6 April 2011,The lighting really makes this film and gives it an eerie feel.But other than that I really didn't like the plot had a lot of holes and just seemed to skip around a lot and didn't flow properly. It was very slow and not scary at all. I did like the castle and the scene with the giant spider web it gave off a very dark Gothic mood.Vanhelsing was an easy choice for the best actor I also liked the crazed man.The coolest part of the movie was the lighting just over the eyes when Dracula was putting someone in a trans. I have seen this used in many later films and i think this was the first film it was used in.,Dracula
438,ncouse-78425,decent film,5,10 December 2016,"I found this film very interesting; especially for the time it came out. Bela Lugosi took on the role of Dracula in a very exaggerated yet meaningful way. Scary movies were not very prominent back then which is why I found it not very scary and almost meaningless at times. I wonder how the people felt when they watched it back then because I think many people would find this film to not be scary and almost awkward at points. That being said this film was a decent watch and I really liked the grandiose setting that the studio had given for the film. I think as scary movies adapt over time, older ones like this seem harder to appreciate but this film was not bad. Overall I would not recommend it if you actually intend to be scared.",Dracula
439,zachdignum,Dracula Review,7,8 December 2017,"It absolutely holds up its reputation as not only being a horror classic but an overall Hollywood classic. While it is probably not a film for someone who is looking for ""jump"" scares it is very creepy and has a dark feel while watching. I also love the sharp contrast between the dark and light in these early Universal films, it adds to the creepiness of them. The tension throughout the film between Dracula and the Professor make it an exciting film to watch through its entirety.",Dracula
440,skywalking997,Bela Legosi's Iconic Take on the Legendary Character,8,7 July 2018,"Although it is somewhat less an adaptation of original Stoker novel, than it is an adaptation of the stage play, itself based on the novel, the 1931 version of ""Dracula"" does manage to create its own distinctive take on the story. It is also, of course, visibly dated, both in terms of its stylistic choices and (especially) in its use of music, but the film is compelling, nevertheless, and succeeds largely on the strength of its casting. Bela Lugosi never quite escaped the shadow of ""Dracula"", and Dracula never quite escaped the shadow of Lugosi. Regardless of how many others might play the role, there is still something intrinsically identifiable about this version of the character and, even though much of the horror and sexuality of later cinematic incarnations is muted, here, this version does remain one of the most iconic landmarks of vampire cinema.",Dracula

This is truly a classic horror film. Watching this movie in 2012, I wasn't afraid at all but back in the 30's the plot of this movie could easily scare someone.I like the fact that they didn't use any special effects. They didn't have special effects back then but it makes for a great raw horror film feel.You have to keep in mind that this is relativily the start of horror films and people were not used to being scared from a film. The Characters play very well throughout the whole film. Overall this is a great horror film and If you haven't already seen this movie you need to see it.",Dracula
442,Comix,Philip Glass kills Dracula!,6,21 November 1999,"Finally, I bought Dracula on video. I remember looking on the cover of the video, saying restored version and new musical score by Philip Glass on the cover. But I was so crazed by my find that I didn't stop to think if that was the video I wanted. If I buy a video, it must be as original as the movie. A very important part of the Universal pictures in the '30, is the music. The music is very much a character in those movies. The music adds a special mood. The new score by Philip Glass didn't add that feeling. It was irritating. For instance, when Renfield visits Count Dracula in Transsylvania. These scenes are very important because they introduce us to Dracula. When Dracula and Renfield have conversation, I had trouble concentrating because of the ridicilous score! The score wasn't a character to the film, as the original was.",Dracula

Also, in the 1930's there was not a lot of films in the genre of horror like this film except for Frankenstein which in my opinion really jump started horror films as I know them in present day. I think Lugosi had the best acting of out all the actors, even watching the film in present day can give you a little chills by how well he plays his character, so I can only imagine how scary it must've been for audience in the 1930's.",Dracula

While not based on Stoker's novel (""Nosferatu"" is much closer), it is an interesting story, none-the-less!Almost every line that Bela utters has become a classic (""Children of the night"".... etc).The only fault is that the acting of the hero/heroine is EXTREMELY ""wooden"", and the ""romance"" isn't convincing.Having seen both this film AND the Spanish version, I have to say that (in THIS aspect) the Spanish version is MUCH better; the characters are move ""believeable""....BUT.....they didn't have LUGOSI!BTW...there's an interesting ""blooper"" in this film, that not many people know about.  About 37 mins in, Lugosi leans down on Nina's bed (to bite her in the neck) -- if you look on the RIGHT side of the screen, you'll see a PIECE OF CARDBOARD that was attached to the lampshade, to take the glare off her face!

The opening half of the film is so loaded with eerie and dreaded mood however that it's enough for me to give it the perfect 10. The silence accompanying the rising vampires (much of it comprised, off camera, of coffin lids falling) brings an absolute terror to the mood. Lugosi's Dracula is perfection. Even his brides are otherworldly and terrifying. What is unfortunate is that over the years, Lugosi's performance has been watered down for many (not me) by the countless imitations of Lugosi's delivery including mostly humorous ones (remember ""Count Chocula""?). Try to look past all that and watch his performance in this initial film. There is just no equal.",Dracula

450,elwood-x,"The king of all vampires, and the beginning of modern horror.",10,22 October 2013,"What can be said about a movie that has had such a profound impact on both film and pop culture? After years of living in a decrepit castle with his vampire ""brides"", the notorious Count Dracula begins to mysteriously buy property in London with the help of a real estate agent named Harker. However, we soon learn that there is a sinister reason behind the Count's move, as he begins his reign of terror once he arrives in the City.Bela Lugosi created a character that would become the standard for all vampires. Sophisticated, charming but downright horrifying, Lugosi' Dracula still holds up as one of the most magnificent horror villains. Other stand out characters include Dwight Frye's disturbing portrayal of Harker, and Edward Van Sloan's Dr. Van Helsing.Eight decades after it first terrorized audiences, Dracula the film was falling apart. Decreased picture quality, and a significant hissing sound severely hurt the quality of one of the greatest films in the horror genre. But over the past 15 years, two great things have happened. The first, which is a bit controversial with film purists, was the inclusion of a new film score performed by renowned composer Philip Glass. I have to say, the score was much needed to help bring the film to modern times. The sophisticated, but eerie, score really adds depth to the scenes and is a profound upgrade for the quality of the film overall.Finally, in 2012, Universal did a full scale restoration of the film (along with the other Universal monster movies) for its release on blu ray. All I can say is WOW. The picture is nearly crisp, with a more balanced picture and virtually no scratches. Furthermore, that horrible hissing noise that plagued the film is significantly reduced, and for the first time in eighty years, the sounds and dialogue are as clear as the day the film was released. These restoration processes have dramatically inflated the quality and relevance of the film, helping to cement it as one of the most significant pieces to come out of the golden age of cinema.",Dracula

His voice and gestures as well as facial expressions are absolutely superb. My favorite thing about this film though is the atmosphere it creates. The lighting or lack thereof is fantastic as well as the sets for Dracula's castle and Transylvania. Personally I feel the film starts to drag once in London (which happens pretty fast) but as I said between Lugosi and the lighting it keeps me going. It is worth mentioning though that Dwight Frye also does an amazing performance as Renfield.",Dracula

The way the portrayed Dracula himself was very well and you could definitely see the fascination and wonder in everyone's faces. Walking through the giant spiderweb, not seeing his reflection in the mirrors. They did not even realize that he was a vampire until the mirrors. Personally to me it seemed kind of thrown together and that it could have maybe been done a little better in the acting area. Overall the film was very good for a beginning horror film. It was very enjoyable and you could relate to most of the characters if for some reason you were to find yourself in a situation like that.",Dracula
453,Kort225,"Great acting, okay lighting.",5,26 October 2016,"The acting in the original Dracula is magnificent. Bela Lugosi alone made the movie interesting to watch. Lugosi expresses the characterization of Dracula all in his facial expressions. A particular scene that shows this is the scene with the maid. Dracula is on the ground crawling towards her with this malicious laughter and look that is honestly frightening. The movie would not have been as great if Bela Lugosi was not the main character. His acting drew me in to the film. Although the acing was good, the lighting made me lose interest at times. I felt as if the picture quality was not up to par for that time period as seen in the original Frankenstein, which was made around the same time.

I expected it to maybe be a little dumbed down or to skip parts of the story that I'm already familiar with. For the most part, it does stay with the main story line with a few minor changes. They use some excellent trickery (for the time) for the special effects, such as when Dracula walks through a web as if it isn't there and another character gets tangled in them. Another surprising thing to me was just how honest they are in the portrayal of violence and other taboo subjects. I would have expected it to be more played down, but i forget this was before the Hays code started. It's great for film makers to be able to stay true to their material, as they did in this film.",Dracula

The Black and White coloring felt less like a limitation that they had to work around, but rather a strength that the film uses to its' advantage. This is clearly seen with the incredible use of lighting throughout the film. This is a very dark movie, but it's all used to maintain an eerie atmosphere as Count Dracula goes about his various schemes. On the topic of The Count, Lugosi captures the titular character's essence absolutely perfectly. The movie uses no music at all, with the only sound work being the voices of the characters. While this may be perceived as dull, it serves to keep the viewer on edge throughout the entire film. The camera is used very well for its' time as well, from wide establishing shots to the usage of shooting a scene from a reflection in a mirror.

He is simply majestic (especially when hes walking throughout the streets of London) and gives a lot of character to what we know Dracula as today. The biggest surprise for me was Dwight Frye as Renfield. His ghoulish laugh and his body movement in the film made him feel like something to actually fear which is something I hugely adore in horror films. I want to be scared and i want to feel my skin crawl and Frye does just that. The sets felt right and the sound effects did justice to the horror genre. The supporting cast along with Van Helsing played by Edward Van Sloan provide the tracks that move the story along and wrap up the end with a somewhat lackluster finale. The marionette of a bad was somewhat funny to watch and even for that time period i probably would've found it just as funny. This is truly a classic horror film from top to bottom.

I tried to be opened minded when i watched the movie since the movie is from 1931 (as I am whenever I watch a film this old) so i knew not to expect much, but even with that in mind I just can't understand how can anyone in their right mind can say this is the best or even one of the best horror movies ever, Nosferatu is even older and i find it to be better than this, the director seemed to have a better vision. I've seen many other movies from around the same time and even earlier and they weren't this badly acted or directed.

The iconic Count Dracula would become the template for nearly all vampires and similar ghouls. Bela's performance transformed the vampire from a cadaverous ghoul into an suave aristocrat dominating the weak willed. Most of the acting aside from Lugosi's, Sloan's and Frye's is awful with awkward pauses between lines and actions. Characters will often make a single appearance and disappear from the movie, never to be mentioned again(Dracula's brides).

In the beginning of the film there is a scene with two women walking in all white against a dark background and they almost look like ghosts. The fog and stark black against some bright white items created the intended spooky ora. Although, I found that at some points the soundtrack played throughout the version I watch was distracting from the actors voices. Also many scenes seemed to drag out. There wasn't much going on at many times and you must just listen to the actors speak in a room. Overall I am glad I watched this film but probably would not recommend this to a friend.",Dracula
465,emilymccrea,One of my favorites!,10,12 December 2018,I really enjoyed this film. It definitely is a classic. Although the movie isn't that scary it has a feeling of being scary. The movie made the horror industry rise in the 1930's and 1940's especially vampires. I personally an=m a huge fan of horror movies they are honestly my favorite. I throughly enjoyed the way this movie was made. It had a lot of detail put into the actors and the costumes. The design of Dracula was the idea the director had and added his own style.,Dracula
466,d-ellsbury,Listen to them. Children of the night.,8,12 October 2018,"Dracula is one of the most iconic horror/monster films of its time that would go on to influence more movies of this genes. There have been many remakes of this movie but this one is a true classic. When I say its a true classic I don't mean the version with the music, I mean the original one. The one with the music is good but I believe that it looses the element of being scary. Because, When there is music accompanying a scary movie you can tell when something is going to happen because the music intensifies. However, when it dons't have music to warn you, you just have to wait and see what happens next. 
The only thing I didn't like about the movie is the ending, Dracula is supposed to be this Bad*** vampire, but he doesn't even put up a fight in the end. What is that? This movie would get 10/10 if Dracula had fought for his life a little more.",Dracula

His voice, his face, the way he moves, his body language, the mansion, the whole deal is creepy! The way the lighting captured Dracula's eyes is something that will show up in my nightmares! I thought blood and gore (which there is none of in this film) was the thing of ""good"" horror movies, but it's really the creepy crawly feeling you get listening to Lugosi as Dracula. If you are into horror movies and being creeped out, this movie is a must watch classic.",Dracula

Since this movie is considered to be the birth of the horror genre I did have high expectations going into it. However, I personally thought the pace was a little slow, which made me not want to finish the movie. Also, this may just be my opinion, but the directors choice to have the actors look at an item out of frame and describe it to the audience rather than just show us the item I did not like. I felt that this added to the slow pace and made the movie slightly less enjoyable. This movie did have redeemable qualities though. The lack of score adds an extra sense of uncertainty that horror movies today strive for. The version that I saw did not have any added music, which I preferred for this type of film. Also, the lighting in this movie was brilliant. There are eerie shadows and bright lights that grab your attention. I think it was done very well.",Dracula

But then about half way through something goes wrong.The budget seems to have dried up out of nowhere and the film becomes incredibly dull and talky.

Thinking back to 1931 when this film was made, it's easy to see the brilliance of the producers and actors. Universal Studios and Tod Brownings adaptation changed the way people saw Dracula.
This famous horror movie, directed by Tod Browning, is one for the ages. Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula portrayed the passion of Count Dracula perfectly.

476,abs-14,Underrated or overrated?,7,12 June 2017,"Dracula (1931) june 12, 2017 by abs007 SYNOPSISThe dashing, mysterious Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi), after hypnotizing a British soldier, Renfield (Dwight Frye), into his mindless slave, travels to London and takes up residence in an old castle. Soon Dracula begins to wreak havoc, sucking the blood of young women and turning them into vampires. When he sets his sights on Mina (Helen Chandler), the daughter of a prominent doctor, vampire-hunter Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) is enlisted to put a stop to the count's never-ending bloodlust.Initial release: 12 February 1931 (New York City) Directors: Tod Browning, Karl Freund Production company: Universal PicturesSTORYThe Dracula story is, of course a brilliant one. However I'm not rating the original Stoker novel but this adaptation of the play of the novel. I quite like this treatment overall although it betrays its stage play origins in the middle where it becomes little more than a filmed theatrical production and becomes stodgy.68%ACTINGI was worried at the start of this film that I was in for that unique early talkies style of acting. Just dialled up a little too high. However once it settles in to the the main meat of the movie the main cast are pretty good. Dwight Frye is a splendid Renfield and Van Sloan a believable Van Helsing. Now Lugosi. Is he really good or actually not really? For me he just about gets away with it. He certainly has a certain charismatic bearing and his delivery of what to him are foreign lines is charmingly odd, but some of those glares to camera are teetering on the edge of comical at times.75%VISUALSThe opening half hour of the film is top notch. Dracula's castle is very nicely realised with all the mist and creepy crawlies you'd expect. The sea voyage over to England also looks fine. The middle section is hard to judge as it's all very set bound although those sets are good.80%MUSICNow how can I fairly judge a film's music score when it doesn't have one! Not through choice either but just because it wasn't done on many of the early talkies. What it does show is just how important music is to create the necessary atmosphere and to help with storytelling. This film is crying out for a music score in the scary scenes and it really is diminished because of it. How to be fair about thisI'm just going to score it 50%. I know it's not perfect and it's unsatisfactory but I can't think of any other way to do it.50%PACEThese older films are slower. That's just a fact. However after that great start it does get bogged down for a good forty minutes in the middle before a decent climax. The director definitely needed to use some imagination in those slow scenes and it hurts the film.60%SCARINESSA good horror film needs to be at least a bit scary. This is an old movie and though I'm sure it gave the general public of the day the willies it is very tame today. Having said that the opening is quite spooky as is Lugosi's Count and Renfield is often quite unnerving.65%FINAL PERCENTAGE SCORE66.3%",Dracula
477,starostenkoivan-90744,The golden age of horror,8,27 November 2019,"In the 1920s, the American Universal studio released dozens of silent horror films in which the roles of villains and monsters were brilliantly played by the greatest mime of silent cinema ""Man of a Thousand Faces"" - Lon Chaney. The highlight of his career was roles in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1923) and ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (1925).Silent horror films featuring Chaney spawned the Golden Horror era of the Universal Studio.The most prolific films featuring Chaney were directed by Tod Browning, who, like Chaney, was at the forefront of the genre in the United States. Their cooperation spawned 10 joint films, which are the undisputed movie classics and horror films in particular.With the advent of talkies, Browning decides to make the adaptation of ""Dracula"", the theatrical production of which was very successful on Broadway. Browning's regular Chaney enthusiastically began to prepare for the role of the famous vampire. But, unfortunately, Chaney died in 1930 of laryngeal cancer.Shortly after Chaney's death, casting for the role of Dracula began. After lengthy casting, this role ultimately went to Bele Lugosi, who successfully performed it on Broadway.Lugosi got the role of Dracula in the film due to his persistence, which he showed to Universal.Lugosi carefully prepared for the film adaptation of Dracula. He worked on the image for days, fully getting used to the role. Lugosi, unlike Chaney, did not like to apply layers of makeup. He relied on his charm and magnetism.In the theater, Lugosi had the role of an insidious seducer. The role of Dracula fit him perfectly. His performance of Dracula was enchanting, magnetic, sensitive. Women were crazy about Lugosi. His Hungarian accent, a piercing hypnotic look and an brilliant performance fascinated the audience. He created the canonical image of Dracula - seductive, aristocratic, insinuating, elegant and sophisticated.The role of Van Helsing was brilliantly played by Edward Van Sloan, who, like Lugosi, also played this role on Broadway. In his performance, Van Helsing was extremely resourceful, inventive, and fearless. Van Sloan remains one of the best performers of the role of Van Helsing.Dwight Fry brilliantly played the role of mad Renfield, who later often had to play characters like this.D. P. in ""Dracula"" was Karl Freund, who had previously collaborated with German expressionists. There is a version that Freund was also director at a certain stage, since Browning was depressed due to the loss of his star and, moreover, was not completely satisfied with the final version of the script.The main components of the Dracula story were perfectly arranged in the film: eroticism, charm and attractiveness.As a result, ""Dracula"" was a huge success, and the title role brought Bele Lugosi worldwide fame.""Dracula"" was the first horror sound film, and thanks to its success, a wave of classic horror films arose at Universal Studios.",Dracula

We get good but under-utilized Gothic sets, spooky close-ups of Lagosi's eyes, and acceptable performances from most of the cast, but the cinematography and effects are flat. I didn't expect a 90s-style editing pace to pick up the tension and the music does more to motivate anxiety than this pre-Psycho film is credited with.

And the pick was a good one.Dracula is about the vampire by the same name who is on the haunt for fresh blood. And for that he moves to England. In England he reaps one victim after the other (Only women).This movie is pretty slow, but that is what you can expect since the book is also pretty slow sometimes. There are some changes from the book, and i will not spoil it, but for one the ending is different, and it has less blood then you expect (if you read the book).There are 3 characters that makes the movie really good.The first one is Dracula, brilliantly done by Lugosi, he is just so creepy sometimes. You will remember the most famous stare in movie history after this movie.The second on is Renfield. You can summarize him with ""Rats"" and ""Ne-hehehe"" The last one is Martin.

It's not scary, it's not interesting, it's not beautiful, it's not technically innovative, it's not even ""good for its time"", it's just not good.About the performances, Lugosi's shouldn't be remembered as fondly as it is. I suspect that he's famous today for being famous in his era, not because he deserves to be. The only good performance in the film is that of Dwight Frye as Renfield. And by good I mean timeless, like you could pluck him out and drop him in a modern remake of Dracula and it'd still be a great performance, unlike all the others who will all always look like they belong in the 1930s.Ultimately, Dracula reminds me of the myth about audiences at a Lumière Brothers showing of a recording of a train pulling into a station. The legend says that people screamed and ran out of the theatre because they were scared that the train was going to hit them. That contemporary audience reaction doesn't mean that the 50s recording of a train is a great horror film. Well, neither is Dracula.",Dracula

I could even talk about my favorite scenes in the movie and say how well they were shot. But the one thing I appreciate in this film is how much weight and gravity the actors give their situations. Dracula, by today's standards, is a run of the mill vampire. But the way that the characters react to Dracula and the severity of the conflict made me acknowledge why people have had a fascination with vampires for all these years. Does it have its flaws? absolutely. There is a lack of music, and while it does work during some scenes, it can be incredibly distracting in others. The characters also seem to over explain things to a certain extent. But those can be easily glanced over because Dracula pulls everything back and makes things interesting again.

The film was a bad abstract from the bad novel. Some very important persons were just left out, another were swapped. The story was told so quickly that the film was even more inconsistent than the book. Some scenes were made useless because they were told so quickly that it was impossible to understand what they were about, unless you didn't read the book.And what I found really rude was, that we didn't see Dracula biting into anybody's neck, we didn't see even those two little holes in the victims' necks, we didn't see him getting out of his coffin, Lucy died just by the way (you don't even realize she dies, actually you don't even realize she was ever there) and so on and so on.

His performance in this picture and many more set the standard for a suave sophisticated villain of diabolical evil. His problem was that he was so completely convincing as Dracula, that his association with the character became, in the audience's mind, natural and eternal. The legion of fans of Bela Lugosi will remain grateful for his untiring efforts to entertain and enthrall us with his stylish and sincere performances even when confronted with a poor script and low budget.

Lugosi really knew how to make himself look supernaturally evil on demand. And of course there are Lugosi's ominous vocal intonations, still instantly recognizable to many people almost seventy-five years after the film's initial release. That's a pretty remarkable feat. Purists may quibble that Lugosi was a little too solid to match up to Bram Stoker's written descriptions of the Count, but Lugosi's brilliant acting overcame not only those discrepancies, but what would otherwise have been a lousy and forgettable film. If you want to see what this film could have been with some decent direction and supporting performances, you'd better view the Spanish language version that was shot simultaneously with the Lugosi classic.

495,tylerss20nh,"The archetypal Dracula, still effective decades later",7,4 September 2020,"The legend the vampire certainly didn't begin with Bela Lugosi, his wasn't even among the first portrayals on screen. But it can be said without exaggeration that his early performance as the classic Count Dracula helped to cement the figure as part of our cultural lexicon, and Lugosi set the blueprint by which subsequent adaptations and reinterpretations are judged.Director Tod Browning deserves a lot of credit. The film is very spare with its music cues, much of the suspense comes from its slow, claustrophobic shots of its actors under the thrall of Dracula's influence often shown without music. Browning uses the set very effectively, particularly in the opening act of the movie as much of the Transylvanian countryside and interior shots of the castle are shrouded in darkness. Renfield's slow walk up the main staircase as a lone, small figure illuminated against the dark backdrop, and his meal eaten at the solitary place setting in the vast, gloomy guest quarters are very effective in ramping up the audience's anxiety.One thing I didn't expect was Renfield (Dwight Frye) and Mina (Helen Chandler) stealing the show from Bela Lugosi. In their performances, we see the duality of Dracula's influence. Two characters that are under his control, but also have the unfortunate awareness of what is happening around them. Renfield oscillates between terror at Count Dracula's machinations and obsequious manic laughter, and Mina shifts from meekness and fear of what's happening to a hypnotic, hungry and penetrative stare when she attempts to attack Harker. These otherwise blameless characters demonstrate very well the creeping dread of the Dracula's influence, not just in the threat on their lives but the threat to their minds and self control.A few fair criticisms arise when judging this film against contemporary films. There are scenes of over the top vaudevillean style acting that took me out of the moment. Some of the key turns in the story take place off screen, certainly due to the limits of practical effects of the time, enough so that there are sudden leaps forward in the plot that can be jarring.

Bela Lugosi had been playing Dracula on Broadway for two years so after the unfortunate death of Lon Chaney Sr (he died of lung cancer) he was the obvious choice to replace him. Bela didn't know much English but his heavy Hungarian accent has been mimicked countless times. My favourite parts are when Dracula says to Reinfield ""I never drink........wine"" and when Reinfield does his insane laugh aboard the ship. Dwight Frye portrays Reinfield amazingly. Edward Van Sloan does some beautiful acting as the wise Professor Van Helsing. This is one of universals best creations and by far Bela Lugosi's greatest role.

The actors talk so slow, that I think it was intended for people with either bad hearing or the mildly retarded.

Ooops, I guess they thought the audience wouldn't catch it. I could go on, but whats the use. This movie is so bad, I now appreciate the crap that is in the theaters today.",Dracula
501,Delayreview,A real piece of horror history,8,5 April 2013,Dracula (1931) is 1 of my favorite horror movie. If it wasn't for this movie Dracula wouldn't be like today. So it deserves a 8. Because its a classic. It isn't actually nothing more to say about this movie. I recommend this movie for hardcore horror movie fans (like me). But if you are not familiar with Dracula. And not so fan of horror movies i wouldn't see it. Thank you for reading this review if you liked it let me know. And 1 last thing. For me Dracula is 1 of my all time favorite horror characters he is of course not a inspirational character that would just be weird.Delayreview,Dracula
502,roylucianna,the best,10,26 March 2005,"When I ""hear"" the silence of this film, I also hear the noise of most other films. This is to say that movies are increasingly noisy -- not only full of manipulating and unnecessary sounds, but full of film composers' scores which desperately try to fill some role in the visual medium (I am a visual artist and also a musician and feel that these guys should take a break). The silence of this film is pregnant with horror and so eerie. Lugosi is also so frightening that in the scenes in which he is absent (or silent), the fear of his return remains. I also think of Van Helsing's silence in his approach to Dracula: without a word, he opens the cigarette case .... There is power and chi in the stillness of this film which is lacking today. There is also, despite from ""antique"" acting techniques, a lot of sincerity here.",Dracula
503,GuyOnThisWebsite,Great Movie That Has A Few Flaws,8,20 February 2016,"Before I begin I would like to say that I watched the 2012 blu-ray.Now to begin, the plot of this movie was very interesting, most of you will know the basic plot but if you do not I will not spoil it here. It kept me guessing and compelled to see what Dracula would do next.The characters... Well, Dracula is interesting, Reinfield was probably my favorite as he had the most interesting story in my opinion. Their was a couple of other characters that I thought were interesting. All the other characters were OK, I can not really remember much about them other that they were there.The creepiness in this movie is very good, the lack of almost any music is both good and bad. It sometimes helps with the suspense and creep factor, but it can make for pretty odd moments and might make some people laugh or smile. But then again, you can watch the 1999 version that has its own score.Their were a few flaws in this movie. As I mentioned before the lack of music is a double edged sword. Some of the characters were not really explored at all, they were simply there to be scared. The run time could have been longer to explore the characters more and flesh out some of the scenes. Also, the editing was a bit weird at times, it would jump from one location to the other. This did not bother me to much but it may bother and confuse some people.All in all I enjoyed this movie, it may have some flaws but it is still a good movie.(Please note my opinion may change)8/10.",Dracula
504,avseiler,What Dwight Frye as Renfield really said about spiders & flies,9,1 July 2011,"So much good reviewing has been done here that any opinions I might have are redundant. (Also I am disabled, quite sick & am not up to it anyway!) However, I do feel compelled to correctly quote what Dwight Frye as Renfield really says about spiders and flies. For some reason, Renfield's words always seem to be misquoted, and it has happened here yet again (in didi-5's otherwise fine review). I suspect it's because nobody ever forgets the creepy scene in which Frye all but steals the movies, but they quote what he said from memory. Well, it's hard to get this right when you're doing it from memory, because it's actually back-and-forth dialogue between Renfield & Martin, his Cockney keeper in the lunatic asylum. For the record, here is what Renfield & Martin actually say: Renfield: ""Flies, flies? Poor puny things! Who wants to eat flies?"" Martin: ""You do, ya loony!"" Renfield: ""Not when I can get nice, fat spiders!""",Dracula
505,bigtagada,A classic,10,6 March 2019,"It is true that some effects are real crap and that there acting is not so perfekt but in all it's gorgeous.
This is one of the only movies that i can watch over and over again without getting bored.
For those who didn't watched it do it or you miss some thing.",Dracula
