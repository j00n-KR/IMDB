0,SnoopyStyle,undeniable Pattinson,8,27 February 2018,"In NYC, Connie Nikas (Robert Pattinson) pushes his mentally handicap brother Nick into a bank robbery. They escape but a hidden dye pack explodes. Nick is caught by the cops. Connie desperately tries to get him out.There is a devastating sense of inevitable doom. Connie's determination is undeniable. Pattinson's performance is awesome. His non-stop flow of lies are delivered with a straight face aggressiveness. It is uncomfortably mesmerizing. It never stops. My only wish is for the brothers to spend more time together. I would love to have the siblings' relationship develop. The surprise reveal is interesting although taking the standard path would have been fascinating. Pattinson is proving to be a compelling actor.",Good Time
1,Horst_In_Translation,The breakthrough for the Safdie Brothers?,6,14 November 2017,"""Good Time"" is an American English-language movie from 2017, so a really fresh and new release that runs for 100 minutes and was directed by Benny and Josh Safdie with one of them being also credited as a writer and the other playing the perhaps biggest supporting character. It is their second full feature film I think after a very prolific short film career. The star in the center of it all is Robert Pattinson and with his turn here he proves once more that he is in completely another category than most of his fellow Twilight actors, especially Lautner, and that he may be looking ahead to an equally great career as Kristen Stewart. But back to this one here. Pattinson is in basically every scene of the film and he elevated the material many times and carries the film single-handedly on his shoulders from start to finish. There are not many other known actors in here and those who are, like Jennifer Jason Leigh and Barkhad Abdi who both scored their first Oscar nominations not too long ago, only have a small deal of screen time. The film itself can be cleanly cut in two halves with the sequence in the old Black lady's house being at the very middle of it. Before that the focus is on the protagonist's brother and afterward the focus is on the guy who the protagonist thought to be his brother.In my opinion, the film does get a bit worse in the second half story-wise, but it's not too much to change my overall positive perception of the film. This is a bit of a pity as I quite like Abdi and also because Pattinson's changed hair color could have made for a brightly shining creative sequence of events. But the only thing that was somewhat memorable from the second half is the moment he leaves the building eventually very close to the end. The actual ending with the mentally challenged brother in this group was also fairly weak again. The biggest question I asked myself during this film was why he used his brother too for the robbery if he loves him so much and always tries to protect and free him. Anyway, this film scored a pretty solid deal of awards recognition already and we will see if it stays that way when the real awards season keeps going. Can the Safdie brothers be considered the next Coen brothers? Certainly not yet. This film is a good start, but it really lacks in the execution of the subtle comedy moments still. But there is also a lot of good in here and they are still young, so certainly one of the more aspiring brother filmmakers these days. And as for Pattinson, I heard many times that this is his best career performance so far and maybe it is true. We can also expect a lot of greatness from him in the future I'm sure. All in all, the good in ""Good Time"" is certainly more frequent than the bad and I believe you will have the equivalent to the film's title when seeing this one. Go for it.",Good Time
2,nogodnomasters,Truth is an act of love.,6,3 January 2018,"The film introduces Nick (Benny Safdie) a large mentally challenged man. His brother Connie (Robert Pattinson) comes up with a bank robbery plan that goes good until the dye. Nick ends up in Rikers while Connie escapes...but devises a plan. Then during the rescue there is a pleasant plot surprise twist. For awhile it is ""Nick who?"" Connie is our desperate protagonist and not very likeable. He is reckless, lies, and uses people. And those are his good points other than the devotion he has to his brother. Well done, but difficult to get into. Guide: F-word. Sex. butt nudity.",Good Time
3,kosmasp,Today was a good ...,8,12 July 2021,"Day? Was it though? And for whom? One may almost think the title was chosen ironically. Now maybe it was meant for the viewer ... you know having a good time watching it. But that would depend on your defintion of it. You really do have to have a love for low budget movies, otherwise ... maybe stay clear from this.Robert Pattinson gives a performance that will very likely be far removed from what we see him do in the new Batman movie. And that just goes to show you his range. While a movie he did for Netflix (he was one of many talented actors involved in the project) was ripe for people to make fun of (I actually enjoyed it), because of his accent (""Laz""), here he plays a character who is way over the top crazy.But he still manages to make him likeable. You kind of root for the guy. Of course that also has to do with the person he is trying to do these things for - he seems like a gullible guy who gets into trouble, because of Pattinsons character ... a weird little gem/nugget of a movie - surely not for everyone to enjoy.",Good Time
4,classicsoncall,"""Are you feeling as good as I'm feeling right now?""",4,6 March 2021,"I couldn't find anything remotely pleasing or satisfying about this film. The brothers in the story are low lifes, and that's being kind. Normally, I'd be sympathetic for a mentally challenged person no matter who they were, but in this milieu, even the handicapped Nick (Benny Safdie) is largely unappealing. And the story quite frankly is preposterous almost from the start, though it really goes off the rails when Connie (Robert Pattinson) attempts to smuggle his brother out of a hospital intensive care unit under guard, and winds up wheeling out the wrong guy! Connie's picture belongs in the dictionary under the definition of 'loser', but that's only getting started. After that, it's one impossible situation after another, culminating in a dubious search for some sort of valuable liquid drug that was stashed in an amusement park when the 'wrong guy' and Connie form an ambiguous relationship as they try to evade authorities. That wrong guy is named Ray in the credits for the film, but if it was, I never heard that name mentioned, and captioning for the movie called him 'Bells', so I have no idea what any of that is all about.Anomalies in the story abound, as I couldn't reconcile a bail amount of twenty six thousand four hundred eighty dollars for a robbery of sixty five grand. OK, the bail bondsman was taking liberties here, so even if that doesn't make sense, I get it. But when Connie demanded fifteen thousand for a half full, sixteen ounce bottle of acid, I knew right there he was out of his mind. Maybe not as nuts as Caliph (Necro), because Caliph made like he was actually going to go and get it. And then, in his deranged stupor, Bells decides to escape a police detail by climbing down the side of a high rise! Here's some news, it's not the fall that kills you, it's the sudden stop.That all of his hi-jinx eventually catches up to Connie should come as no surprise. For once, the goofball who had a response for every impossible situation is left speechless, while the curtain comes down on Nick in a therapy session coming to grips with his unfortunate situation. At least he's got the wits about him to properly respond to a therapist's directive to ""cross the room if you have ever not gotten along with family members sometimes"".",Good Time
5,Quinoa1984,an astonishing performance in an OKAY movie,7,27 August 2017,"So, this may be me thinking too hard about this, but... why does Connie (Robert Pattinson, and I'll get to him in a moment because he is by a 100 million miles the best thing about this movie, with the score a million miles behind) rob the bank in the first place? After a first scene in Good Time where we're introduced to Connie's brother, Nick (Ben Safdie, one of the directors) in a therapy session where he is asked some questions that leads to a painful memory being unearthed - and being whisked away quickly by Connie because, hey, he shouldn't have to be talking to someone like *this* - the second scene in the movie is the two Nikas brothers robbing a bank. Of course Connie is the mastermind, so to speak, as Nick could barely tell the time without some help, but this of course leads to trouble as the bag is filled with that explosive ink that coats everything, and the cops get on the trail of the two. They catch up to Nick, he goes to jail, gets beat up and is put in the hospital, so Connie's initial search for bail funds quickly turns to an escape plan. But the question I had bugging me, not all the time but often way... why did this happen at all? Good Time is like if you took some ingredients from, I dunno, Of Mice and Men (maybe) with Before the Devil Knows You're Dead and took it down to the grittiest street level, with a thousand and one dirty close-ups during dialog (and often non-dialog) scenes. It's meant to provoke us and to put us into a terrible state of anxiety and tension because we don't know how Connie will get his brother out of this mess. It's so visually intense that I almost had a headache watching - no, I confess I apologize, I did - as the brothers Safdie mean to put the audience totally on edge: Connie has one motivation above everything else, to keep his brother safe. But what about himself? The bank robbery is a bust, of course, but what was the plan to start with? Why was he doing this? If everything had gone to plan, if there even was one, what was the next step? To be sure, with a downward-spiral sort of narrative like this where absolutely nothing goes to plan and that's the idea - this includes the person that Connie thinks he's slipping out of the hospital in the wheelchair that is poor, defenseless Nick, is NOT that person but a criminal scumbag who has his *own* story, with a face that looks like Paul Dano halfway through his interrogation in Prisoners, and that leads to other mad events here - and it's never *badly* made. I can see why it's getting the rapturous praise by certain critics out there because it doesn't look like any movie this year, or most years, and it has a score by Daniel Lopatin that feels like there's a good successor to Tangerine Dream. There's atmosphere to burn here, and they burn it like a gigantic, multi-colored spliff.At the same time, I didn't get invested in what this man's struggle even was to start with. I know it's the wrong thing to do usually in screen writing terms, but in this case a little motivation, a moment or two more with this grandmother that is practically never seen on screen (one might infer there is no mother and father in the picture... I guess Jennifer Jason Leigh was a relative? the mother? a girlfriend? I don't f***ing know, but she has a couple of scenes as a spacey older woman who's credit card doesn't work), to get me into what this dynamic between the brothers is like and how Connie got into this desperate situation. There may not even *be* a motivation, and that's fine too, but we got to know that. Otherwise, by the end when (spoiler, surprise?) Connie gets caught, my thought was... ""well, what was the point of all of that?"" While Ben Safdie does fine in his (few) scenes as the brother, mostly as the book-ends to the film (and they *are* strong emotional bookends that, if I cared more about the story, would get me more invested in this downfall of Connie's and possible by proxy Nicks own damnation, could work), it's Pattinson's movie. Good God is this perhaps the textbook example of an actor being monumental, earth-shatteringly brilliant in a movie that can only barely support him. He has the force of Pacino in 1975, and if he had been around back then he could've been strong competition to star in that film. Every moment he's kinetic, alive, aware, constantly trying to think though his mind is going a mile a minute - it can't be helped, given the s*** he's in - and despite the directors trying to make him grungy and disheveled (a hair dye mid- way through gives him a Cobain image, especially in his final shot), his star quality actually shows. It doesn't make me take back what I've thought of some of his quite poor work in the past like in Twilight (as bad as those are he's actively *horrible* in them, but hey, maybe I should reevaluate them up to a point), rather Good Time makes me realize that with the right character he IS someone that should be taken seriously.This is a performance for the ages, and in that sense it does make it kind of a must see. The movie almost is.",Good Time
6,evanston_dad,Thrilling Achievement,9,19 December 2017,"I've never snorted coke, but I bet plenty of the characters in ""Good Time"" have, and the film feels like the cinematic equivalent.""Good Time"" races by, driven by a propulsive soundtrack and regular blasts of neon. It's both a feel-bad and a feel-good movie at the same time, bad because the milieu of the film and the poor people who populate it are so desperate and bleak, but good because....well....because the movie itself is just so damn good that there's a high from the sheer physical craft on display.Robert Pattinson stuns with his acting ability in this film, a far cry from anything I've ever seen him in. He plays a loser who engineers a bank robbery with the assistance of his special needs brother and then watches as it all goes to hell. The movie descends into a prolonged nightmare, mostly set at night, as he goes to increasingly desperate and frenzied lengths to scrape up bail money, anointing himself his brother's caretaker and the only one who knows what's best for him. The film is both a tribute to brotherly and familial love and a cautionary tale about how we can sometimes cause more harm than good when our intentions blind us to our actions. Pattinson's character is actually quite despicable, affection for his brother aside. He's selfish, casually cruel, and willing to let others be the stooges and fall guys when he needs them to be. The film is in no way a diatribe about white privilege, but I don't think it's accidental that it creates scenario after scenario where Pattinson's designs work because he's inherently trusted while the minorities around him fall immediately under suspicion.And the last scene of this film is one of the most quietly devastating I saw all year.Grade: A",Good Time
7,AlsExGal,An exhausting crime drama,7,24 November 2019,"Connie (Robert Pattinson) and Nick (Benny Safdie) are low-life brothers in NYC who attempt to rob a bank so that they can buy a farm in Virginia. Things don't go well, and Nick, who is mentally handicapped, gets arrested. Connie then begins a night-long odyssey to try and get his brother free while avoiding the cops himself, running into an assortment of fringe characters along the way. Also featuring Buddy Duress, Taliah Webster, Barkhad Abdi, Peter Verby, Robert Clohessy, and Jennifer Jason Leigh.Filmed in a gritty manner with over-saturated colors and a relentless electronic score, once this movie gets started it becomes an adrenaline-fueled marathon of tense situations, with Pattinson's character consistently asked to make split-second decisions that go wrong as often as right. I consider Robert Pattinson one of the least impressive movie stars to have sprung up in the last decade, but he acquits himself well here, grungy, desperate and vulpine. All of the supporting characters are believable, although largely unsavory. I wasn't quite as impressed with the end result as some critics, as I felt that the story stumbled to an unsatisfying conclusion, and nothing really added up to much, with events virtually ending where they began. That may have been the filmmakers point, but the majority of the film is a tense journey that crime film fans should enjoy.",Good Time
8,ferguson-6,hyper-kinetic frenzied trip,7,24 August 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. The Drifters and later George Benson sang ""the neon lights are bright on Broadway"". Well, we aren't on Broadway, and though they aren't bright, the neon lights are ever present and crucial to the tone of the latest from brothers and co-directors Benny Safdie and Josh Safdie. Robert Pattinson stars as Connie Nikas, and turns in a performance unlike anything we have previously seen from him. Connie is protective of his brother Nick (played by director Benny Safdie), and he's also a grungy unhinged bank robber. He doesn't look like a man with a plan, but fortunately, Connie is a smooth talker who thinks 'quick on his feet'. We say fortunately, because he is barraged with an endless stream of danger, catastrophes and near traumatic events as the story progresses. A botched bank robbery separates the brothers and sends Nick to jail and Connie on the lam. Co-writers Ronald Bronstein and Josh Safdie seemingly take immense pleasure in sending Connie off-the-rails has he desperately attempts to avoid capture while simultaneously figuring out how to spring brother Nick. With a frenetic pace that escalates Griffin Dunne's misery in AFTER HOURS, Connie's escapades have him crossing paths with his girlfriend played by Jennifer Jason Leigh (wish she had more screen time), a psychiatrist played by Peter Verby, a new anxious-to-help acquaintance in Taliah Webster, an accidental partner-in-crime played by Buddy Duress, an amusement park security guard played by Barkhad Abdi (""Look at me!""), and a brutish thug played by hip-hop artist Necro.The pounding, pulsating techno/synth music perfectly complements the unusual tone (almost noirish, and bordering on comedic), feverish pace, and fascinating visuals throughout. Some viewers will be turned off quickly, and those that stick with it will be rewarded with an entertaining crime thriller featuring Pattinson's best performance to date.",Good Time
9,deloudelouvain,Robert Pattinson made me forget the pathetic 'Twilight' series.,7,2 August 2018,"When I saw Robert Pattinson was the main star of this movie I have to admit I didn't have high expectations. I guess his 'Twilight' years didn't do him any good, at least in my mind, because if I have to be honest the 'Twilight' movies were really not my type of movies. But Robert Pattinson proved me wrong with Good Time. He clearly can act better then I thought he could. Good Time is probably the best movie I saw with him in the leading role. The story is very entertaining as it is a rollercoaster of events. You won't get bored for a second, at least I didn't. Plenty of action with unlikely outcomes, enough twists to keep the story interesting and entertaining to watch. I enjoyed it, and don't care about reviewers that scored this the lowest possible. They clearly didn't watch alot of movies in their lives.",Good Time

12,Hellmant,So surprisingly fresh and unique!,9,22 September 2017,"'GOOD TIME': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new stylized heist genre flick from directors Ben and Josh Safdie; Josh also co-wrote the script with Ronald Bronstein (the trio performed the same duties on 2014's 'HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT'). Ben also costars in the movie with Robert Pattinson, Buddy Duress, Taliah Webster,Jennifer Jason Leigh and Barkhad Abdi. The film tells the story of two brothers that rob a New York bank together, but things go horribly wrong when the younger brother (who's mentally handicap) is caught and taken into custody by the police. His older brother will then desperately do anything to get him out of prison. It's received rave reviews from critics, and it also premiered at the main competition of the 2017 Cannes Film Festival; where electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never's score won the Best Soundtrack award (Iggy Pop collaborated on a track as well). The movie is now playing in indie theaters, and I absolutely loved it!Connie Nikas (Pattinson), and his mentally handicap brother Nick (Safdie), rob a New York bank together. They appear to get away with several thousand dollars of cash, until a dye pack goes off in one of their bags, and causes their getaway driver to crash his car. Connie and Nick flee the crash scene on foot, but they're stopped by police for questioning. Nick panics and runs, so Connie follows. Connie is able to evade capture, but Nick is caught and arrested. Fearing for his brother's safety, Connie desperately tries to get enough bail money together to get his brother out of prison. When Connie finds out that Nick was taken to a hospital, after being beaten in a prison fight, Connie attempts to break him out. He mistakes another criminal (Duress) for his brother though, and things keep getting worse from there. The movie is so surprisingly fresh and unique, that I can't help but rave about it. It's stylized in a familiar genre way, but the story and characters are so original and different (than almost any other film out there), that you can't help but be completely captivated by every minute of it. The characters are mostly unlikable, and the entire setting is pretty depressing and disturbing, but the film leaves a very memorable impression by it's conclusion. Pattinson also gives arguably the best performance of his career (and I remember when I use to think he was a horrible actor), plus the soundtrack is also totally awesome and classic as well! I think this film is definitely worth seeing, that's for sure.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/PdeLWCp_JrI",Good Time

14,lost-in-limbo,So good!,9,28 April 2020,"And not just that ticking bomb of an electronic score, but the entire film is lit up, tautly told and deftly executed. What the crime-thriller premise sets up is a supercharged rush of scatterbrained missteps kickstarted by a bungled heist - there it snowballs into a grimy, sleep-depraved nocturnal urban journey of crumbling consequences and swirling disarray all in the name of brotherly love. It can be relentless, quite morose, even slightly disturbing in its grounded reality, but where it got me was how surprisingly melancholy and complicated the connection was between the characters and story. It virtually had a stranglehold over me in its quest to keep you on edge - lost in its aesthetics and feeling every exhausted avenue it takes you. Robert Pattinson's raw, desperate performance cuts deep by getting into his character's shrewd headspace. We watch as the escalating circumstances brought upon by his own hasty deeds, even when he's trying to correct his previous mistake by using anything to his advantage, only sees him falling further down the pitch black rabbit hole. What goes is far from anything resembling a good time.",Good Time
15,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A good time from beginning to end.,7,23 May 2018,"The protagonist in 'Good Time (2017)' is certainly no hero and his journey to free his brother seems to be as selfish a quest as it is genuine, with his manipulative manner coming out in every ever-escalating scene until his erraticism outweighs his reasoning and he starts to get so sloppy that the mistakes he makes are perhaps more dangerous than the situations he enters in the first place. It is this central character, along with his frenetic and suitably grimy performance, that keeps you engaged, by being surprisingly seedy, even when the narrative doesn't take the turns you'd expect it to - which is ultimately a good thing. Props must also be given to the actor - who is also a co-director - portraying the lead's mentally-handicapped brother, as he does a phenomenal job of embodying a character whom we can wholly empathise with. The piece is never predictable and properly pacy, with a definite sense of style that seeps into every situation and marks the overall story with a tangibly 'loose strand' feel, a kind of vibe that pushes tension and suspense into the most mundane of misguided moments that feel just disconnected enough to be true-to-life. The realist sensibility and superb synthetic soundtrack keep every beat fresh and exciting, though, so that, while they do seem somewhat coincidental, they always come across as wholly necessary and all-encompassing, the only thing occupying both the characters' and audience's mind. This 'in-the-moment' vibe is incredibly energetic and puts you in the head of the stressed and worn-out lead, lessening the impact of the inevitable retroactive realisation that the action seems more like disconnected set-pieces happening almost out of the blue, with little ultimately falling into place, than a proper planned narrative. Still, that's not to imply there wasn't thought put in behind the scenes. It takes a special kind of planning to make things seem spontaneous. In the end, this piece becomes more realistic, and thematically futile (though still hopeful), precisely because it refuses to follow convention and fit into a neat narrative package. Plus, as I mentioned, it is all about being in the head-space of the character, which is why most of the piece is shot using claustrophobic close-ups, and feeling like every little event is the biggest moment of the movie. The situation itself almost acts as the antagonist, throwing curve-balls to stop our protagonist from achieving his goals. Every moment could be his last and danger comes from the most unexpected of places, be that by coincidence or by his mistakes, which makes the flick a thrilling ride from start-to-end in a more domestic kind of way than usual. There are no big explosions, massive gun-fights or country-wide car chases. Yet, every moment is exciting. That's the beauty of it, really. For all its subversion, thematic elements, character depth and clever, realist twists, the most important thing about it is this: it's just a good time. 7/10",Good Time
16,ThomasDrufke,Evoking Scorsese,7,3 September 2017,"It's not often a film from this era manages to make me think of some of Scorsese's early features, but 'Good Time' does just that. Taking place in New York City, focusing on criminals, and presenting a bleak tone with a few black comedy laughs as well, director Ben Safdie is doing his best Scorsese impression without it feeling too homage-y. In fact, Scorsese is one of the first people listed in the thank you section of the credits.I think one of the critiques that 'Good Time' may receive is that it's too miserable and there never seems to be any light at the end of the tunnel. Take Robert Pattinson's lead character, Connie. He's the character we follow for most of the movie, and I'm not sure he makes a single decision that would be considered morally right. He's constantly trying to evade law-enforcement to get back to his brother who was arrested for robbing a bank with him. It's very difficult to root for someone with that type of mindset, but Pattinson winds up being someone who I didn't want to fail. Sometimes just taking a back seat and watching a film unfold is better than trying to attach yourself to characters are unlikable.One standout from 'Good Time' is the score by Daniel Lopatin. Much like Drive, Neon Demon, and the upcoming Blade Runner 2049, 'Good Time' tries to evoke a different era with its music. Lopatin's score feels like it's straight out of an 80's film. You wouldn't think it would work, but there's something some hauntishly thrilling about it, with an undertone of humanity that made it really effective. No wonder it won an award back at Cannes.Energetic, relentless, filled with great performances, and a brutally dark story. makes 'Good Time' one of the more interestingly unique films of 2017, and certainly one of the best directed. Evoking Scorsese's 70's films is a good start, but the film definitely makes its own imprint along the way.7.9/10",Good Time
17,gbill-74877,Lots of action,7,26 March 2020,"Calling this an action film doesn't seem adequate, since its breakneck pace is kept up over a series of tense scenes throughout the movie. Robert Pattinson just melts into this role and turns in a great performance as a con man who is pretty wily at getting people to do what he wants, but pretty inept in all of his schemes and spur of the moment plans. The Safdie brothers give this film a real flair, and the sound design fits very well. It was a near miss for a higher rating for me, maybe because it just seemed to be missing something underneath the style, performances, and madcap moments of action. (Jeez that seems to be quite enough as it is, so I'm not sure what's holding me back.) Maybe more of those little moments at the beginning and ending of the film that subtly give us an idea of what the home life of these two guys was like, or maybe a smarter character somewhere to balance things out. Even the supporting roles, like the good-hearted but extremely naïve Caribbean immigrant grandmother, are filled with really dumb behavior. Certainly entertaining though.",Good Time

19,ironhorse_iv,"I had a semi-good time, watching this movie. Nevertheless, I still wish it could had been little better. It was just okay.",7,3 September 2017,"It's really hard to like a Robert Pattinson film, after such stinkers, as 'the Twilight Saga', film series (2008-2012). However, this film is not that bad. It was honestly good, but it needed a little more work for me, to really like it. Directed by Ben and Josh Safdie, the crime film has actor, Robert Pattison as Constantine 'Connie' Nikas embarking on a nighttime insomnia acid trip through New York City's underworld in an increasingly desperate-and dangerous-attempt to pay off, the bait to get his brother, Nick Nikas (Ben Safdie) out of Riker Island, after a botched bank robbery. Without spoiling the movie, too much, one thing that the film has against it, is the lack of tone. I really have no direction, where this movie was taking us. While, some people might think, this is unique and innovating. I found the story, written by Josh Safdie & Ronald Bronstein, to be confusing and downright with intent nerve-wracking too messy. I really have no clue, if I'm supposed to take it, as a comedy about dumb criminals, in the same vain as the Canadian satire TV Show, 'Trailer Park Boys', or serious drama like 2004's film 'Collateral', that has a similar premise. Its tone is all over the place. It really has, no direction. One minute, it's about an emotional Nick crying explaining his parental troubles to unnamed doctor (Peter Verby), and then it cut to a hilarious cartoon version of Connie chasing after money in a drug deal, gone bad in a theme park. Those scenes does not really match. Not only that, but it also abandon, the focus on Nick, as we don't see much of him, after the first couple of minutes; which is sad, because Josh Safdie acting, is the best thing, about this movie. Since, they did that, it also cut the emotional levels of the brothers, frustration, with their parents; making forth, a weak connection in depth with Connie. Don't get me wrong, Robert Pattinson does a great job in what he is given. However, we barely get to know anything about Connie; besides being an unlikeable manipulative sociopath with no real positive personality traits; thus making the film, hard to watch at times as we, the audience can't relation to him. Even the focus on surface level Connie is abrupt, as we go through, a series of flashbacks of another supporting character, Ray (Buddy Duress); that adds, nothing more than filler. By this time, the movie is already, suffering from pacing issues, by staying, too long in a dark safe house with cringe-worthy kissing scenes with 16 years old, girl, Chrystal (Taliah Webster). To make the film even harder to watch, the movie has way too many produce placement, ranging from Subway, Dominos, to White Castle. It really makes all the fast food places seem like bad places to go. Not cool. I really have, no idea, what they were, going for, with showing that. The same, can be said, with the large amount of scenes of the protagonist, television surfing. Was the brothers watching shows like 'Law & Order' & 'Cops', as if it was a dress rehearsal on what to do if caught or was it, just curiosity, on ideas, how to get away!? Maybe, there was a meta-social commentary about 'schadenfreude' & how we are not better than the dumb criminals, we watch. While, it is true, that people get pleasure from other people's problems; I still, don't think the movie is sophistical, enough to notice that vague connection of 'Dog eat Dog' analysis. Who knows, what this movie was originally, going for!? All, I know, the soundtrack by composer, Oneohtrix Point Never AKA Daniel Lopatin, for this film is amazing. The weird dark synthesizer music really does fit the odd mood swings and paranoia of being a criminal. Along, with that, the movie does have creepy, cinematography by Sean Price Williams. It really does make the neighborhood of Queens seem like more like a hell-hole than it really is. However, it was a bit, too dark at parts with really bad lighting. I really couldn't see, much of anything, going on, at times. Another thing, this movie does, is have, way too much, close-up. Some of them, really works, like the beginning, but the shots to the face seem to get tiresome, as the movie went on. Maybe, it went a little too much close. Overall: While, this is a richly textured crime genre piece, packs a visceral punch with its restless visuals and adrenalizing music. It still could had been, a little bit, better in the story. It's seem to me, the film was just a form of trolling, with coy, self-disavowing provocation. Sometimes it flaunts its clichés— and other times, the story drop it, acting as if they were doing something cool and daring. Yet, it isn't. It isn't. It's stale & empty. That's why 'Good Time' is just meh. At least, it's not time, wasted.",Good Time
20,tomgillespie2002,One of the most enjoyable experiences I've had this year,8,17 December 2017,"Whether he likes it or not - and I suspect the latter - Robert Pattinson will always be synonymous with Edward Cullen, the sullen and handsome vampire with impressive hair from the Twilight series. He caught many people's attention with his brief appearance in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, but Twilight turned him into a global star and the subject of much adoration from screaming teenage girls. It's an image few actors hoping to be taken seriously wishes to be lumped with throughout their entire career, and Pattinson has been making a noticeable effort to distant himself from the teen idol image ever since 2012's Breaking Dawn - Part 2 with the likes of Cosmopolis and The Rover. Yet despite Pattinson's commendable performances, neither were particularly brilliant films. However, his latest, Benny and Josh Safdie's Good Time, is very good indeed.Taking inspiration from journey-into-night films like Martin Scorsese's After Hours and sharing the urgent pace of the techno-thrillers of the 1990s, Good Time is a huge explosion of energy. Taking place over the course of an eventful and increasingly weird 24 hours, we open not with Pattinson's petty criminal Connie Nikas, but his mentally handicapped brother Nick (co-director Benny Safdie). Nick is undergoing a psychiatric evaluation, but is quickly pulled out of it by Connie, who takes no time to convince his impressionable brother to help him rob a bank. In the grand tradition of movie heists, the robbery goes wrong when the bag of money explodes red dye all over the brothers. Nick is caught but Connie escapes, and the former is sent to Riker's Island. With a mixture of street-smarts and pure desperation, Connie sets out to raise the bail money, and later - after Nick is placed in hospital following a violent attack - to break his brother out.Good Time is an experience best enjoyed by simply going with the flow. Like Connie, the film feels like it doesn't know where it's going, and that's part of the thrill. Connie proves himself skillful at talking his way out of the increasingly dangerous situations he finds himself in, but proves completely inept at decision-making. His journey takes him from borrowing money from his sort-of girlfriend (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh), to an encounter with a mother and daughter, and later to a fairground to retrieve a bottle of acid worth $10,000, where an honest security guard played by Barkhad Abdi awaits him. The story occasionally gets away from the Safdie brothers, but things are quickly helped back on track by some jet-black humour, impressive supporting performances from Buddy Duress and newcomer Taliah Webster, and, at its very centre, Robert Pattinson, who pulls you into wanting to see the night out with him despite his character's utter loathsomeness. The title is supposed to be ironic, but Good Time is one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had this year.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Good Time
21,Floated2,Gripping and Intense,9,7 May 2020,"After viewing Uncut Gems and being very fond of that film and noticing the specific style and atmosphere in which the film presented, the Safdie brothers became people's radar. Good Time is their film prior to Uncut Gems and it has also received many glaring positive reviews and praise from critics and fans alike.This film most definitely is as good as heard and lives up to the hype. From the tone, to the story, to the acting, the colors and style, the dialogue. It makes for a very intriguing, gripping and intense thriller which satisfies on several different fronts. The film's pacing is also top notch as what we are watching is entertaining and moves at a pace in which we somewhat wanted more after the film has ended. This is done is a well manner with it's music and score which is another highlight as it makes the film have a unique and ""edge of your seat"" type adrenaline feel. It shows that the writing is well done as the film doesn't drag.Good Time isn't a regular type film, and is quite raw and refreshing- which is what Hollywood needs more of. The visuals in which the film displays is another highlight which makes the film standout. Just as in Uncut Gems, it appears the Safdies like bright neon colors mixed with a darker set tones (many scenes at night).I suspect this film will become a cult classic of sorts, where in the future as the Safdie brothers get more exposure and become more known, people will come back to this film. As it stands, with Good Times and Uncut Gems, the Safdie brothers show that they are creative directors/writers and have a bright future ahead of them.",Good Time
22,eddie_baggins,Pattinson shines in this fast-paced thriller,6,26 March 2018,"Paced in a similar tempo and style to a film like Run Lola Run or even to a lesser extent Jason Statham's hyperactive actioner Crank, Good Time see's Edward Cullen not having a particularly fun night out after himself and his handicapped brother attempt a botched bank robbery and then Pattinson's Connie breaks the wrong guy out of hospital to extend his woes.Written and directed by sibling duo Benny and Josh Safdie (of which Benny also stars as Connie's brother Nick), Good Time is a relentlessly paced and frenetic experience heightened by a sense of constant threat and foreboding and an at times over intrusive score by Oneohtrix Point Never and the Safdie brother's film is one that certainly can't be accused of playing out by the rulebook as this thriller with a difference is constantly engaging throughout, even if it doesn't have a that special something to elevate it to the next level.From the moment the Safdie's throw us into the plight of Connie and Nick and their messed up lives we can tell things aren't going to go smoothly for the duo and likely won't go smoothly in the future either. It's that typical hard luck style of crime thriller where a collection of not overly bad people are just trying to break free from their tough luck lives but the Safdie's aren't concerned with exploring these characters too much as we're instead taken on a wild night out with Pattinson's Connie as he tries to right the wrongs his responsible for.It's another impressively committed turn from Pattinson (peroxided hair and all) who couldn't have been doing much more in the years since Twilight to shed that teen heartthrob image that franchise created for him.His in almost every scene of the film and carries with him the energy and intensity the film required of him and while the characters that appear around him such as the glaringly over the top Buddy Duress as fresh out of jail criminal Ray feel sub-par and misplaced and the narrative choices the Nikas brothers make don't always ring true, Pattinson holds steady and is a major reason why Good Time ends up being the solid thriller that it is.Final Say - An energetic and fast-paced thriller with a strong sense of visuals and uniqueness of tone, Good Time may not always make the right calls but held down by an impressive Pattinson turn, this is a film that marks the Safdie's as filmmakers with a bright future ahead of them and ends up as one of last years more impressive independent offerings.3 White Castle food stops out of 5",Good Time
23,matthewssilverhammer,#TeamEdward,10,18 February 2018,"A tragedy of errors, Good Time is quite possibly the most empathetic portrayal of thieves I've ever seen. The Safdies have filled every moment with not only character logic, but with a deep essence of truth. Pattinson's character is wonderfully delusional about who he is; even with our understanding behind him, we know he's not as noble as he wants people to think, and we see the cracks in his ego. Like a super coherent fever dream, Good Time is full of dark color, rapid pacing, and fantastic performances.",Good Time
24,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Exciting, frantic crime thriller with great style and just enough realism",8,7 February 2018,"Robert Pattinson's body of work has generally been on a spectrum between ""Twilight"" and flat-out weird (his David Cronenberg collaborations), but the fit is a good one between him and Benny and Josh Safdie, the latest filmmaking brothers making waves. ""Good Time"" has an aggressive pulse, assured style and enough grounding to connect with audiences.Pattinson stars as Connie Niklas, who ropes his brother Nick (Benny Safdie), who has clear social/intellectual disabilities, into robbing a bank with him. When their getaway goes awry, and Nick ends up in custody, Connie becomes desperate and makes a series of high-risk moves attempting to save Nick and evade his own capture.What stands out most about the film is the frantic pacing and anxious energy that rarely relents. Connie is a criminal at large, so he (and the film) is constantly looking over his shoulder. The question of if and when he gets caught in a bind he can't escape keeps ""Good Time"" rolling. Each move he makes narrowly avoids raising our implausibility alarms - the scenarios are just believable enough that it's hard not to stay hooked in the story.Helping ground the plot are characters and performances that feel decidedly real. Films about small-time criminals usually glorify the characters or become larger-than-life, but the Safdies have been careful to keep this film about salt-of-the-earth people. This is not the glamorous or mythological side of New York City. Pattinson, the dapper Englishman, convincingly plays a troubled, street-wise, kind-of-gross New Yorker in all that character's complexity. It's probably his most memorable if not best performance.Benny Safdie also plays his part in a way that feels powerfully real. We've seen people with disabilities struggle in this way and in the film witness how terrible our systems are at helping them. The only problem is that we lose Nick for a significant chunk of the movie and he - and his relationship with Connie - are the emotional core of the film. Had Josh Safdie and co-writer Ronald Bronstein been able to work him back in besides the film's coda, ""Good Time"" would've been something truly special.What we do get, however, is nothing to scoff at. The film's aesthetic is extremely engaging with stunning aerial shots and Daniel Lopatin/Oneohtrix Point Never's electronic score fitting it all perfectly, even among the proliferation of electronic scores since 2010. The last crime film to move this well and look this good doing it was ""John Wick,"" and ""Good Time"" has no traditional action components to lean on. Instead, we get a kinetic crime drama fueled by a troubled man's deep sense of obligation and blind hope for the future. ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",Good Time
25,subxerogravity,A Very Good Time,8,13 August 2017,"Very ironic title as a good time was not had by Constantine ""Connie"" Nikas (Played by Robert Pattinson who I'm sure is having a good time over the praise he's getting from the film). His brother lands in jail after a bad bank heist and Connie is trying to raise the bail money to get him out, which turns out to be a serious night walking down the danger zone.Robert Pattinson does do an amazing job in this movie. I come from a stand point of a person who has never scene Twilight so I have little impression of who he was really as an actor prior, except to say he looks very different now and the difference is better. You can compare this performance in this to DiNiro's in Taxai Driver, it does stand up like that.I really liked what the Safdie brothers have done here. Ben (Who doubles as co-director and plays Connie's brother, Nick) and his brother, Josh have created a well told adventure here through the gritty part of The city, using that strange retro 80s style all the fresh young directors in their thirties seem to be doing. Good Time is raw and grounded yet slick and stylistic. Makes me want to see the rest of their filmography.It's oddly colorful and filled with characters. It does not seem like the type of movie people would get but it's relateable, thanks in large part to the focus on Mr. Twilight, cause it does pay to have a well known actor in your movie.Good watch!http://cinemagardens.com",Good Time
26,jtindahouse,It's hard to fault a film that is made this well,7,5 December 2018,"'Good Time' sets itself up to be one thing, and then goes on to become another thing entirely. The opening scene of the movie would have you believe this was going to be a film about a couple of brothers and their journey, and while it was in a way, it chooses to focus on one of the brothers in particular and base it around his love for the other one. The result is quite a strange film that is so well made you don't even question other routes they could have taken in terms of story, you simply accept what is in front of you and move on to enjoying the film.Looking at the film from the path that they chose to take, and forgetting what other ways it could have been done, I really liked the film. The story is interesting, it moves at a cracking pace, the acting is impeccable (from the entire cast, but in particular Robert Pattinson) and the dialogue is some of the best writing you'll ever see. In one scene you are asked to respect and love the main character, then in the next scene he does something despicable and you are put to the test over whether you still like him or not. This is a film that challenges its audiences from start to finish and I loved that about it.I also loved the background music/noises the film had. I couldn't even tell you what the noises sounded like, but they felt like they would fit perfectly into a sci-fi film. They worked masterfully to set the tone and keep you on the edge of your seat. 'Good Time' is a simple, straight-forward story that is somehow anything but. It is made expertly with class, thoughtfulness and knowing. This film is definitely worth your time.",Good Time
27,Turfseer,Compelling portrait of psychopathic bank robber with filial obligations lacks obligatory twist ending,6,15 November 2017,"Good Time is indie filmmakers Ben and Jose Safdie's third full-length feature film. Their previous efforts, Daddy Longlegs and Heaven Knows What, showed potential but those films were decidedly much more ""art- house"" than anything approaching a viable commercial product. But here they appear to have found the formula for more success at the box office.The strength of the film is in the portrait of the protagonist, ""Connie"" (Constantine) Nikas, a short-tempered, manipulative psychopath who dreams up the idea of committing a bank robbery, bringing his mentally challenged brother, Nick (played convincingly by one of the Safdie brothers, Ben), along for the ride. Played frenetically and believably by Robert Pattinson, Connie, despite his compulsion to lie at just about every turn, still has a soft spot in his heart for brother Nick. His obsessive need to protect Nick is obviously unhealthy but there's enough here to provide a modicum of likability for the beleaguered criminal ""mastermind.""Good Time becomes a fairly ""good time"" for the expectant film-goer through a series of twists and turns in the plot. The first twist occurs after Connie and Nick commit the bank robbery—all seems like it's going to plan until a dye pack explodes in the bag of cash inside the getaway car. The clock begins ticking as the brothers must figure out how to scrub the dye off their faces and avoid the cops who have now flooded the area. There's a great little scene in the bathroom of a fast food restaurant where Connie frantically directs Nick on how to clean up and later how to comport himself when stopped by the police.The twists keep coming when the brothers are stopped by the police and Nick panics--foolishly making a run for it—only to end up falling through a glass window and captured by the men in blue. Now Connie has to figure out how to come up with $10,000 in bail money to spring Nick from Riker's Island (where he knows his mentally challenged brother is in danger of becoming prey for hardened inmates).Connie tries to manipulate his sycophantic, clueless girlfriend Corey (Jennifer Jason Leigh, in a cameo of a role), into charging the money on her mother's credit card; but the mother cancels the card before Connie can get the cash. Soon Connie finds out that Nick has been transferred to the hospital ward in Elmhurst, Queens, after being beaten up on Riker's Island. Perhaps the biggest twist is when Connie manages to furtively remove someone who appears to be the heavily bandaged Nick from the hospital (SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD), then hiding out in a stranger's house (consisting of a grandmother and her 16 year old daughter--whom Connie manipulates into having sex and aiding in his quest for the bail money), only to discover that the man he ferreted out of the hospital in a wheelchair, is not his brother.Instead, the adventure continues with Connie dealing with the recent parolee, Ray, who rivals Connie for honors as most dumb ass criminal of the year. There's a Macguffin here, a bottle containing an LSD solution, which Ray lost (while drunk) at an amusement park, so Connie figures if they can just find the drug, he can sell it and make enough money to pay the bail bond. The amusement park seems an awfully convenient place to have your next confrontation scene with the police but that's what the Good Time scenarists have come up with—although there is another twist: Connie is able to knock out the security guard at the park, put on his uniform, fool the cops and make his escape.The denouement is a bit anti-climactic as the Safdies seem to have run out of clever ideas from their bag of tricks. It's all a bit perfunctory when Connie's plan to sell the LSD to one of Ray's associates goes awry and he ends up running into the hands of the police (there's a nice overhead shot from the high-rise apartment which Connie just left) showing him being cornered below in a maze of paths in front of the building that lead to a cul-de-sac. I must disagree with Rex Reed writing in the Observer that the Safdie brothers are ""glorifying the underground culture of drugs and thugs avoided by sane people everywhere."" Quite the contrary, the Safdies make it clear that that Connie is not a person to be applauded—and his take-down by the police at film's end suggests that he's clearly received a hearty comeuppance.Good Time moves back to brother Nick at the very end, depicting him participating in a group therapy class with other mentally challenged folks. It's a nice touch but reminds us what an underdeveloped character Nick really is, as he has disappeared for most of the narrative.Good time moves along aided by a cool, pulsating, electronic music score. It makes its points about the criminal soul effectively and manages to keep our interest through those twists and turns, chronicled above. Somehow what's missing is the twist ending—a la Agatha Christie— and perhaps the brothers Safdie will hone their crime/mystery writing skills to a finer pitch and wrap things up a bit more creatively in their eagerly awaited fourth feature effort.",Good Time
28,jadavix,Unique crime drama,8,22 March 2018,"""Good Time"" is an entertaining, inventive thriller film with Robert Pattinson, who seems to have truly cast off his ""Twilight"" image.The film is not the typical expedient suspenser about men in positions of power and high powered officers of law. Instead, it's about two brothers, one mentally handicapped, the other streetwise but unfortunate, who bungle a bank robbery and end up on the run. When the handicapped brother gets caught, the other tries to free him, without appearing to change gears. It's fun to watch as the Pattinson character continually improvises ways of getting out of trouble, usually only digging in deeper.The movie has that shot-on-video look and feel that you expect from a gritty drama like this, and yet it also has a distinctive, neon colour scheme.

It's really about the brother who supposedly isn't insane however. Turns out he's the real bad apple. He causes harm to everyone he touches not the least is his mentally challenged brother. A pretty down and dirty wild ride ensues. Is this potentially a very real reflection of something which could happen? The viewer will have to decide. I wouldn't say this is an entertaining movie in any way. In fact it's a bit of a mess in the middle. But, I'd say it returns to telling the story of a empty vessel brother sociopath (the mentally ""right"" one) who goes off the rails in his convoluted sense of righting his brother's life. The mentally challenged brother comes through it all right back where he was when the movie started maybe none the worse for the wear.

38,bkrauser-81-311064,"Bleak, Chaotic and Endlessly Fascinating",8,25 August 2017,"Good Time is a small movie about small people doing small things. But never let it be said that it's dreary or dull. This movie somehow took the edgy anxiety of a waking nightmare, bottled it up, and put it on the screen so you'd leave the theater in a cold sweat. If the DVD/Blu-ray release of Good Time doesn't have a critic blurb saying ""this movie gave me indigestion,"" I'll be sorely disappointed.The setup is simple: a wanted man (Pattinson) tries to raise the money for bail to get his mentally handicapped brother (Safdie) out of prison. The two had held up a bank earlier that day and throughout the night, Connie resorts to dubious and dangerous lengths to avoid punishment and consequence.In an interview with NPR co-director and co-star Benny Safdie said ""We wanted to deliver a piece of pulp that actually felt dangerous."" With that in mind cinematographer Sean Price Williams shot on 35mm and much of the movie is loaded with claustrophobic close-ups and delirious hand-held sweeps. The 35mm film bleeds into the New York nocturne. The punishing fluorescents and neon glints that makeup the movie's milieu taunts our protagonist as he spins his wheels round and round. It's a movie that recaptures the intimacy and intensity of a 4am sneak-about.Even in calmer moments, the film pulses in its nervy desperation. The various innocents the come across Connie's path are more-or-less looking for the same thing, a way out of the mess. They approach their situations with variant levels of legality but never with Pattinson's level of sleaze or sense of entitlement. Despite this, Connie proves remarkably resourceful; one minute his back is up against a corner, the next he's clawed his way out and slumping towards the next hurdle of his odyssey. One can't help but think that if Connie put his mind towards anything other than crime, he'd be on the cover of a business magazine.Instead he's in an unending fever dream whereby the urban sprawl is the water to his drowning rat. At its height, Good Time has the sparseness and clarity of a John Steinbeck novel and at its most pedestrian it still has the chaotic energy of The 25th Hour (2002).",Good Time

[+68%],7,23 April 2020,"Fueled by a no-nonsense performance from Robert Pattinson, The Safdies take you on a panic-brimming journey into the shady side of New York City. There's a foiled bank robbery attempt, a jailed (developmentally disabled) brother, a bottle of LSD, wads of cash, an amusement park setting, and more packed into this wild 100-minute rollercoaster ride.Oneohtrix Point Never's musical score, filled with thumping synths and swaying electronic tones, really aid in escalating the thrill factor. Sean Price Williams also deserves a mention, capturing the uneasiness of each passing scene in wonderfully grainy, naturally textured 35 mm. The recurring aerial shots are also impressive. The Safdies are intelligent in replacing typical genre thrills with ones you wouldn't even dream of. Much of the film plays out over the course of a single night; one that gets increasingly unpredictable as it progresses.Barkhad Abdi is present in a blink-and-miss but extremely relevant role that emphasizes how skin color can, at times, make a criminal out of an honest man and vice versa. If you didn't go ""what the hell!"" at least on a couple of occasions while watching, you're probably one tough nut to please. Post this and The Lighthouse, Pattinson proves that he can carry the heavyweight role of Bruce Wayne in the upcoming Batman movie.",Good Time
42,michaeltrivedi,Great Effort by Little Known Directors,7,5 January 2018,"This is a pretty good movie. It starts off very fresh and thrilling, as two brothers rob a bank. We envision this movie being a fantastic heist or crime thriller. It sort of does that, but goes in a couple of weird, but pleasing, directions. By that I mean the movie never stops on the thrills, but takes us in directions we would never envision it to go. It is not a step by step movie, which is great about it. What can be perceived as boring, space fillers, turns out to be effective and concludes in a very pleasing space. On a different note, Pattinson does not shine in this film as was expected.Not Oscar worthy, but definitely a great ride of 2017. 7 Stars",Good Time

44,gedikreverdi,I can't get enough of the movies by Safdie,9,2 March 2021,"I watched this after I had watched Uncut Gems and this is definitely as good. From the first minute on, tension never stops building up. It is gloomy, bleak and depressing but very thrilling at the same time. The actors were amazing especially Benny Safdie and Jennifer Jason Leigh although we get to see her very shortly in this movie. It was impossible to not have empathy toward nick and the way how his older brother Connie cared about him. They robbed a bank. It all seemed to have gone good but the paint bomb in the money bag messed up all the money. They tried to get rid of the paint on their clothes and faces in a bathroom at a fast food restaurant. And he stashed the money bag up in the duct vent in the bathroom. While they seems to have got away with it, nick panicked and ran away while the patrolling officers asked them to take off their hoodies. They caught Nick while Connie managed to escape. He tried to pay the bail out money but it wasn't enough because the money was messed up. He tried to borrow it from his girlfriend but her mother blocked the credit card and there they learns nick was hospitalized as he got into a fight with another inmate. He went to the hospital. He managed to take him out of the hospital and took him to an old lady's house and she was one of those who were on the hospital bus. She offered a room to nick until their mother came over and went to sleep while nick and her granddaughter hung around watching tv. When their robbery was on the news he kissed the girl to distract her. The man woke up but it was not nick. They drove away in the girl's car but couldn't walk in the hospital because there were police officers all around. The long scene at the dilapidated house of the old lady was so bleak and overwhelming. I felt like I was a part of their poverty stricken lives. Then ray the man cuffed to the hospital and kidnapped by Connie said they stashed some money in the amusement park. They sneaked in but got caught by the security guard. Connie beat and undressed him and wore his uniform to act like he was the guard for the officers. Then they went over to the guards apartment with lsd bottle that ray found in the stash. Connie couldn't make a deal with the man that's a friend of ray and left the house while the police officers were already there. Ray fell down from the window to the ground and it's impossible he survived the fall and the officers arrested Connie. And nick was out of the prison and back in his therapy session again.",Good Time
45,proud_luddite,Bad lead character makes movie difficult to like,5,13 January 2018,"Connie (Robert Pattinson) is a New York City criminal who convinces his mentally handicapped brother, Nick (Ben Safdie), to help him in a bank robbery. From then on, as so often happens in this film genre, numerous mishaps pile on top of each other.Where the film deserves credit: it is fast-paced with more than a few surprises. It also avoids the usual fake glamour of crime films by showing how gritty life truly is for the underclass caught in the cycle of a life of crime. (Safdie and his brother Josh are the film's directors and they deserve credit for their skills.)There are films that have a disadvantage where the main character is truly unlikeable. In this sense, ""Good Time"" is extremely disadvantaged. Connie is an absolutely rancid piece of slime. He is also a hybrid of the extremities of willfulness, stupidity, and pathological narcissism. There are some rare movies that could take this negative situation and twist it into something surprisingly fascinating. ""Good Time"" is not one of those movies. - dbamateurcritic",Good Time

48,aciessi,Pounding Concrete.,8,17 February 2020,"Good Time was the world's introduction to the Safdie Bros. It helped tremendously to see Uncut Gems first before seeing this. It helped to amplify this film's strengths, and even its flaws. Like UG, Good Time is a never-ending adrenaline rush. The first 30 minutes alone are absolutely heart pounding. If ever you wanted to be a small-time criminal, Good Time will give you second thoughts. Connie and Nick are an explosive crime duo. The chemistry that Pattinson and Sadie have with each other is undeniable. Which left me puzzled when the last half of the film only features Pattinson's character Connie. After what is a mind-blowingly good reveal (in which Connie accidentally kidnaps someone who he thought was his injured brother), the story focuses primarily on Connie's long and excruciatingly elongated rescue mission. His brother, Nick, is left to the wayside. With the amount of character development and attachment that we already established with Nick, he nary makes an appearance until the last few minutes of the film. He lose so much time to see his side of the story. Had all of those loose ends been tied, this film would have gone from good to masterpiece-level great. Regardless, Good Time and Uncut Gems have respectively made the Safdies into street icons and the premier New York filmmakers of the new decade. Whatever they make next, drop what you're doing and see it.",Good Time

50,dave-mcclain,Tough to watch - and tough to turn away from!,7,26 August 2017,"Meet the Safdie Brothers, Josh and Ben. Oh, they've been making movies since they were kids in New York City and their films (starting with short films) have been seen in theaters since 2006, but it's the 2017 crime drama ""Good Time"" (R, 1:40) that serves as their introduction to a significant number of Movie Fans. Their films usually follow the misadventures and misdeeds of morally-challenged characters through various settings in New York's dark underbelly. Josh and Ben (sometimes, Joshua and Benny) often each pull at least double-duty when making their movies, in roles to include producer, director, writer, cinematographer, editor and actor. ""Good Time"" is no exception. Josh and Ben share directing duties, while Josh is also the film's co- writer (with Ronald Bronstein) and Ben (as ""Benny Safdie"") plays a key supporting role. The end result can be seen as difficult to watch, but it's hard not to be impressed with the skill the Safdie brothers demonstrate in their various roles – behind and in front of the camera. Nick Nikas (Benny Safdie) is a mentally-challenged man-child who lives with his grandmother. As the film opens, he is being evaluated by an elderly psychiatrist (Peter Verby) after unintentionally breaking his grandmother's arm. Nick alternates between emotional and non-communicative until his older brother, Constantine (Robert Pattinson), bursts into the room and pulls Nick out of the session over the stringent objections of the well-meaning psychiatrist. Constantine (who goes by Connie) assures Nick that he's the one with Nick's best interests at heart. The two talk about getting a place together where Nick dreams that he'll be able to ""do what I want, when I want."" Connie loves his brother and sincerely wants to take care of him, but Connie can't even take care of himself. He's a manipulator whose moral compass lost its needle long ago – and the kind of guy who might find a four-leaf clover, right before the leaves fall off. Connie's idea of making his and Nick's lives better starts with the two of them attempting to rob a bank. In spite of impressive disguises and a plan that seems well thought-out (up to a point), the heist goes awry, the brothers get separated and Nick is arrested. Connie goes to see his girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and tries to coerce her into giving him the money for Nick's bail. In the meantime, a confused and stressed-out Nick gets beaten so badly by another prisoner that he ends up in the hospital. When Connie learns about this, even though his face is all over the news as one of the bank robbers, he boldly walks through the hospital hallways with the intention of spiriting his brother away. What follows is a series of Connie's mistakes, manipulations and misjudgments which bring him into contact with and endanger a teenage girl (Taliah Webster), a drug dealer (Buddy Duress), a security guard (Barkhad Abdi) and others who are affected by Connie's well-meaning, but misguided attempts to help his younger brother.""Good Time"" is an ironically titled, intense and intelligent crime drama. It's dark in tone and visuals, while the framing of those visuals and the words spoken by the actors make the story uncomfortably personal. It's a raw and engaging window into the desperation of a single-minded, violent and slightly sympathetic loser. Pattinson's performance is disturbingly real, while Benny Safdie's is startling and emotionally sophisticated in its simplicity. Both performances are award-worthy – especially that of Safdie. Watching him on screen, I got the same feeling of awards season inevitability that I had when I first saw Christoph Waltz in ""Inglourious Basterds"" and Mark Rylance in ""Bridge of Spies"", both of which won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. But acting recognitions aside, this film is a work of art, like a dark, disturbing and hauntingly beautiful painting that you might wish hadn't captured your attention, but find yourself unable to turn away from until you have experienced everything it has to offer. It's difficult to call such a film ""entertaining"" (which is my main criterion for assigning a grade to a movie). The viewer won't have a ""good time"", per se, but will likely be impressed by the film's artistry. ""B+""",Good Time

Connie Nikas (Robert Pattinson) tries to take care of his troubled brother Nick Nikas (Benny Safdie) who has a learning disability. He takes him out of a learning program and on a heist at a bank. He wears the mask of a black man and demands the cash through handwritten notes. The thieves get away and are picked up by a friend but when they are driving away the bag explodes with red paint. Connie and Nick try to hide by washing off as much of the paint as they can and pulling up their hoods. The cops still question them and Nick takes off running. Connie follows and pulls ahead leaving his brother behind as Nick crashes through a window and is caught by the cops.Nick is shipped to Rikers Island and his behavior problems lead him to be hospitalized. Connie works to free his brother by negotiating with the bail bondsman but the money is stained with red paint. He asks his girlfriend, Corey (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to use her mother's credit card to pay the bond but Corey's mother doesn't like her boyfriend so she cancels the card before Corey can spend the ten thousand dollars. During the process to bail out his brother, Connie learns that his brother is in the hospital. Connie heads to the hospital to find his brother.

Yes.Did I enjoy it? Not really. While it was engaging throughout, the grittiness, bleakness and ending just left me feeling depressed. The soundtrack was anxiety-inducing in the worst kind of way. It was even distracting at times, and took away from dialogue.I think a lot of people are blinded by the fact it's uniquely made and written, and features Robert Pattinson in a role vastly different to Twilight. His performance was incredible, though his character (Connie) was woefully frustrating. I found his character hard to like, and therefore, found myself not as invested in his plight during the most tense moments.Good Time gets points for being one of the fastest paced films I've seen and feeling incredibly authentic and 'real'.

I noticed his talent in ""The Lost City of Z"" already and now he gives another fantastic turn this year, far far away from the boring shallowness he started his career with. In ""Good Time"" Robert Pattinson shows what he really can, and I go so far and almost compare this performance to a young Robert De Niro, It was just intense, honest, full of emotions and power. It was as twisted as his character and from the first to the last second convincing. You never saw Pattinson but always the character. Benny Safdie, who is also one of the directors, was okay and had his moments but there was something distracting / off about his performance. Jennifer Jason Leigh had a smaller role as one of Pattinson's weird love interests. Well, she can do better. Another positive aspect about this film is the great atmosphere created by some inspired GTA- like camera ankles (but they totally fitted the scenario) and the truly good and fitting soundtrack. The screenplay was decent as well and I really liked the honest portrayal about the characters. No fake development no fake sympathy but you still cared a lot. Its a dark film but one that still leaves you with a good feeling. And it is the birth of ""actor"" Robert Pattinson.",Good Time

61,ronakkotian,DEFINITELY a GOOD TIME!!!,10,11 October 2019,"I was never fond of Robert Pattinson as the only movies I remember him in is the terrible franchise known as Twilight. Since I got to know that he's very likely to play the new Batman, I became more skeptical whether or not he could pull it off. With Good Time, my doubts have been cleared.Good Time follows the journey of Connie Nikas who tries to get his brother out of jail after a failed attempt of committing a robbery.This movie is criminally underrated. Even I didn't hear about it when it initially came out. After hearing some buzz surrounding this movie, I decided to give it a shot.Everything about Good Time is simply outstanding. This is the first time I saw a film by the Safdie Brothers and I can't wait to see what other projects they helm. The way this movie was shot couldn't have the same feeling if the Safdies didn't direct it. This movie feels very gritty and realistic which make the events that take place believable and shocking. The story is compelling and has a lot of twists and turns which leave you questioning the success rate of Connie's mission. The characters all leave a profound impact once they're on screen. The cinematography is gorgeous. A lot of the film takes place during the night and the atmosphere that's created has a sense of urgency and tension.This film is a character study more than plot driven film and the characters that we're presented with are amazing. Robert Pattinson proves his worth as he gives a career best performance. His variety of expressions convey a lot about his personality and how he feels towards people he interacts with over the course of the runtime. A performance which really surprised me was of Benny Safdie. He plays Pattinson's mentally disabled brother in a very unmannered way and he's one of the directors as well. I believed his acting all the way. Then we have actors like Buddy Duress and Jennifer Jason Leigh who play great and interesting characters. The entire cast is superb.Good Time is incredible. We learn so much about our protagonist, Connie Nikas, and how badly he affects the people he meet which establishes this thriller as one of the most intriguing. The writing, direction, music and acting here are blended to craft an enthralling thriller that cannot be forgotten easily. Huge praise for the Safdies and Pattinson as they both created something magical.",Good Time
62,rubenm,Excellent crime drama,7,22 October 2017,"Few films have such an ironic title as 'Good Time'. A more fitting title would have been 'Murphy's Law'. Anything that possibly could go wrong, goes wrong.In this case, the law applies to Connie, a tough and streetwise New Yorker. Het robs a bank with his mentally handicapped brother Nick, who gets caught soon after. By trying to get the money for his brother's bail, Connie gets himself in deep trouble. His situation goes from bad to worse. Some of the predicaments he gets himself in, are sad and funny at the same time. He stumbles from one seemingly hopeless situation into another, but with some luck and a lot of guts he can escape most of them.A large part of the film takes place during the night time, which gives it a special character. The cinematography shows a neon-lit urban landscape, filmed in a nervous style, corresponding with Connie's state of mind. The soundtrack full of sinister music adds to the gloomy atmosphere. The Safdie brothers, one of whom also plays the part of the handicapped brother, have shown to be very talented directors.The interesting thing is that viewers will have no problem identifying with Connie. Although he is a criminal and a hoodlum, the ultimate motivation for his acts is the love for his brother. He has to get the money for his brother's bail, and that's the reason to forgive him for his less noble acts. 'I am better than you', he tells another criminal at one point. At first this seems preposterous, because at that point Connie seems to be the ultimate loser. But then you realize he's right: there is a deeper motivation for his acts than just foolishness.In the end Connie becomes more and more desperate, and throughout the film you know that this can't end well. But it does: although he doesn't succeed in his goal and has to face defeat in the end, the very last scene of the film is a very hopeful one. It adds to the theme of moral ambiguity that gives this movie an extra dimension.",Good Time

An edge-of-your-seat, uncomfortable, intense crime thriller with Pattinson spearheading it sounds awesome. While I did enjoy it and thought the characters and plot were much more true to reality than many crime movies, there was not much thematically or in the plot that made you think. The Safdies do a good job of establishing Connie as an intelligent man who's means always justify his ends, and is always looking to manipulate others for money. Pattinson, for his part, does succeed and brings a frantic energy that pervades the movie. As the plot unfurled, I didn't feel like I got anything further from the developments - it was just more of the same, Pattinson struggling and no twists or interesting elements. The bond between Connie and his brother was interesting, but unfortunately we saw nothing further between them after the first 15 minutes or so. I didn't feel especially thrilled or intrigued by the end, because it felt like I was just watching a misguided, fervent person try to get money and put pieces of his and his brother's life together. By the end, I didn't feel sad or sympathy for them, just acceptance and understanding of their character, no further intrigue. It's a shame, because it definitely had potential and I liked the way it was shot and acted, the plot just didn't show me much of any development or things to ponder.

It's different from the others, with a bigger budget and big name cast member (Robert Pattinson in his finest role ever), and I was apprehensive for that reason. But all my worries went away within the first few minutes of the film.The entire cast does a great job. The directing and camerawork are wonderful as well, as is the unique music. But the best part of all is the story. It's so fast-paced and unpredictable, full of twists, but it never feels stupid or fake. I would compare it to WHIPLASH. It's about criminals, not drummers, but it's got that same sort of unpredictability to it. You never have a clue what's going to happen next, and that's what's so fun and exciting about it.

There is a constant feeling of unease, of pressure, of tension laced throughout this film, which makes it a truly captivating experience.A large part of this is down to Pattinson, who portrays Connie so powerfully and intelligently in a truly captivating. I would say this was Pattinson at his best, but having seen The Lighthouse that performance takes it for me, this was very close though. It's hard to put into words but it was a very visceral, as was the whole film.If a large part of Good Time's success was due to Pattinson, and even larger part was due to the Safdie's themselves.

The opening scene felt like imrpov aka a documentary, (and I know some of this was definitely improved) but when you realize that is was mostly scripted you become impress, because majority of films feel totally like films. Overly written, badly cast, and poorly directed, i.e. so in your face and apart form reality.A great director is one that can take a subject matter and make you emerge yourself into the film forgetting it is a film, but making you feel like you're watching everything in front of your eyes in real time.Very few movies accomplishes that.

70,coreyjdenford,Pattinson on the rob,8,17 November 2017,"This review of Good Time is spoiler free**** (4/5)ELECTRICITY PULSATES THROUGH the night-time streets of New York in Josh and Benny Safdie's latest Good Time - pulsing in stunning greenish glows across the drone camera or the glow of white shirts in ultraviolet light to the lights coming from cars speeding down the street. The city that never sleeps brims with life here so well that it's amply scary. Yet beneath it there's an intriguing family narrative, in their 2009 debut Daddy Longlegs they focused on father-child relationships here they shift their focus to a fraternal one. Robert Pattinson is Constantine 'Connie' Nikas a conman who goes in search for the next big hit, meanwhile protecting his vulnerable brother (co-writer/co-director Benny Safdie) from the help he currently gets from a school. They each go on the run after being involved in a bank heist that goes horribly wrong, one is caught by the police, and the other embarks on a journey across New York City to get his brother out by any means necessary. On paper it's Mean Streets meets Trainspotting if each of them were to share a can of acid-fuelled Red Bull with a little bit of Run Lola Run on the side as Connie will do literally anything to get his brother out, whether it's getting money from his much older girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh), or getting involved in a drug deal which by coincidence is worse for his current predicament. And in each moment Pattinson, now clearly so far away from the long shadow, cast from the angst of his Twilight years, owns the screen with his blistering performance.Here the Safdie brothers (whose previous film was Heroin-infused drama Heaven Knows What) have crafted a superb heist thriller basking in well-written characters (Connie is endlessly entertaining) and is restlessly taut in the dramatic storytelling particularly with the love Connie has for his brother. Polished in documentary-esque filmmaking, there are several close-ups zooming on the emotion immersing the characters, fast-paced running scenes and to top it all off is Daniel Lopatin's creepy, evocative grand slabs of retro-futurist keyboard synth that will be bouncing around your head for ages. Previously a hefty amount of heist thrillers have tried this kind of vivid filmmaking to a solid degree, yet in Good Time the Safdie brothers have craftily moved away from that by creating an entirely new genre - an original state of madness for the protagonist that's never been achieved before and it couldn't be timelier. As good a time it is though, it's not perfect there's a long time in the middle section when Connie takes a break from the action and it's a while before the film picks up. That said this is a superbly crafted heist thriller telling an enchanting tale of one man's madness and the love for his brother and it certainly is a good time. VERDICT Just like Robert De Niro in the 70s Pattinson is phenomenal in the Safdie brothers' superbly crafted heist thriller – and could be one of this year's best performances.",Good Time
71,Ramascreen,Robert Pattinson on the go!,8,1 August 2017,"#GoodTime is a fantastic insomniac crime comedy/thriller with the fully determined & daring #RobertPattinson. It's like if ""Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"" met ""Trainspotting"" and had a Red Bull-fueled baby. It's entertaining through and through.Directed by Josh and Ben Safdie, Robert Pattinson plays Constantine Nikas who commits a botched bank robbery that lands his younger brother in prison. The rest of the film shows Nikas' dangerous attempt in a span of one crazy night just to get his brother out. Madness, mayhem and violence ensue as he also tries to evade the consequences of his actions.I haven't watched ""Heaven Knows What,"" but I am now definitely a big fan of the Safdie brothers after ""Good Time"" because their vision and craftsmanship are simply hypnotic. Not only do they play with neons and glows but also almost the entire time, the film is done with close-up shots which tightly frames the characters so much so that it intensifies the story's unpredictability.The characters in ""Good Time"" may not be quite as dumb as the characters in the Coen Brothers' crime comedies, but they're quite rudderless. Nikas knows that his main objective is his brother, but he doesn't have a clear plan. He's got bits and pieces of what can be considered close to a plan but for the most part, he just wings it, which makes this whole thing hilarious. It's as if the script intentionally throws a curve ball at him every other five minutes or so, you see him encounter unexpected blunders, mostly of his own doing as he's winging it from one cluster- mess after another. He's always on the go. And Robert Pattinson is marvelous, some say this is his breakout performance, I say it's the performance that no one else but him could play. Pattinson becomes this desperate loser, part of you empathizes with him but part of you wants to see him get what he deserves. ""Good Time"" is a helluva way to end this summer season at the movies.-- Rama's Screen --",Good Time

74,WalkdenEntertainment,"Watch This And You Will Have A ""Good Time""...",8,10 January 2019,"Two brothers rob a bank, which has the results of one of them ending up behind bars. The other brother, Connie, manages to escape from the police. Connie (played by Robert Patterson) now has concerns and fears about his handicapped brother, now behind bars. Connie has one night to do everything he can to set his brother free from jail, or else his brother will be sent where more possible harm could come to him. The amount Connie needs to save his brother is ... $10,000. Good Time occurs over the course of one evening.Good Time is an example of a low budget film done well. When I think about the whole film, there aren't many actors in the film and most of the shots are done at night (less people around). Also, the actor who plays Connie's brother is in fact one of the directors of this film. The film has a script that is creative and edgy, but another key strength is the lead actor.Robert Patterson is best known for his Twilight series, but after seeing him in the Australian film The Rover, Robert Patterson was starting to show the world that he more than a vampire covered in glitter. As he plays this character Connie, he looks very worn out, dirty and gives a strong desperate vibe to do whatever it takes to save his brother from jail. He is also simply not to be messed with. For Robert Patterson's performance, this is his greatest work that I have ever him complete to date.The film doesn't take long to get going. Watching the suspenseful opening robbery scene, I enjoyed the film's pace and the sequences are great. The film; however, does slightly struggle around the halfway mark as the pacing became a little slower and I started to question what the film was doing. Certain parts of the story also started becoming a little predictable. By the 3rd act thankfully, the film picks up a better pace and the suspense kicks in just like the film started with to begin.Overall, Good Time is a well crafted low budget film done right. Robert Patterson gives us his best performance and his character is believable and real. The film pacing around the halfway mark is a slight struggle after so much suspense and rushing from the start. Because of this stumble, I started to question the film's duration. For some, this downer could be rather minor as the film picks up in the 3rd act.7.8/10

75,squirrel_burst,Dig through the show times to find this one,10,10 September 2017,"""Good Time"" is a drama/crime thriller with a tight grip. It constantly ups the stakes and keeps you invested thanks to its blend of tension and humor. With a stellar performance by Robert Pattinson and slick direction by Ben and Josh Safdie, you've got one of my favorite films of the year.Connie Nikas (Pattinson) and his mentally handicapped younger brother, Nick (Ben Safdie) attempt to rob a bank. When the heist goes wrong and Nick is captured by police, Connie fails to come up with the bail money. He decides that it'll just be easier to break his brother out of the hospital room in which he's being held.This film is a continuous cycle of ""bad to worse"". Connie is basically chewing his fingers off worrying about his brother. To him, nothing is too underhanded. He's willing, quick-witted, resourceful... but he's also been cursed with the Midas touch of sh*t and, let's face it, he's not all that intelligent. The man has a knack for finding people to prey upon. You'd feel bad when the situation blows up and he's the only one left unscathed... but it feels like their fate was an inevitability. It just happened a bit quicker thanks to our protagonist. You're nervous all the way through, but dumb criminals are such a joy to watch that you devour every moment with enthusiasm. I never knew what to expect out of ""Good Time"". Will Connie find some kind of redemption in the teenage girl (Talia Webster) he dupes into helping him? Will the innocent, naive bystander become a pawn or a victim? Whenever the crook encounters someone, you tense up. Even if you disregard the tight story that keeps you guessing, this is a great film. It's expertly shot, the use of music and the general tone give it a distinct identity. Then, there are the performances. Pattinson disappears in this unglamorous, but meaty and nuanced role. He's accompanied by many great moments courtesy of Jennifer Jason Leigh (in a small part), Barkhab Abdi (whom you'll remember from ""Captain Phillips""), Buddy Duress as a criminal who forms a tenuous alliance with Connie as well as the aforementioned Ben Safdie and Taliah Webster. I never wanted the movie to end. I enjoyed seeing this seedy world that much.""Good Time"" offers a slow, steady drip of thrills. You'll be sweating and, very frequently, laughing at the expense of people who are probably getting what was coming to them. There's also tenderness. At its core, this is a story about love, a poisonous love. It's another small film that you're going to have to look for, but wow is it worth the effort. When you watch ""Good Time"", stay through the credits. The story continues as the words scroll. (Theatrical version on the big screen, September 5, 2017)",Good Time
76,payasoingenioso,Why Was This Produced?,5,26 February 2020,"The plot seems depressingly plausible. PSA.The lead character is a trash human. The. Worst. It made the film quite difficult to finish.Meanwhile, the cinematography is excellent.",Good Time
77,trublu215,One of the Absolute Best of the Year,10,26 August 2017,"Good Time stars Robert Pattinson as a desperate criminal fresh off of a botched bank robbery that tries to free his accomplice brother from Rikers Island before he gets sent to general population. Written and Directed by The Safdie Brothers, Good Time is an exhilarating crime drama that brings back the grit that made these types of films so palpable and treats us to both a visual and emotional journey through the underbelly of NY.Starting off with the robbery and subsequent botching, Good Time starts off like a bullet train and doesn't let up for even a second. Centering on Rober Pattinson's Connie Nika, the film is a crime odyssey much in the vein of Scorsese's After Hours. This is a ticking time bomb of a film that brings Pattinson to his absolute best. Make no mistake, this is a master class performance from him. This is far from the performances he gives in sappy romance films. This is a fully realized performance that is bound to be talked about for years to come. But as great of a performance as he gives, the credit goes to the Safdie brothers' phenomenal script.The story of Good Time is very race-against-the-clock. But when broken down, this is a film about a desperate guy that wants to make a change. He doesn't want the hustle and bustle of NY, he wants a farm and his brother. He doesn't want to do bad things but he's willing to do it if it advances him to get to his brother. The whole story is centered around Love, much like their previous film Heaven Knows What. Love is a central theme in Good Time and it might be hard to decipher that through its gritty absolution but the end result will surely make you realize what really was important all along to Connie Nikas. It's a truly magnificent and heart pounding film that has surprising emotional heft to it. Overall, Good Time is a fantastic film that finally allows that NY grit back into the scene and really cranks up the tension while doing so. With a great script and an undeniably Oscar caliber performance from Robert Pattinson, Good Time ranks with the very best of the year.",Good Time
78,dallasryan,Pattinson is a Great Actor,9,12 June 2018,"I used to write Pattinson off as a good actor from the Twilight series. But then I saw him in a movie called The Rover, and he was superb in it and I've been a Pattinson fan ever since. Pattinson gives a dynamic, all out performance in Good Time. Things unravel for Pattinson's character as each situation keeps getting worse and worse finally spiraling fully out of control. The film gives the ambiance of spiraling out of control with it's dark, blazing, hallucinogenic, acid trip, vivid and luminous tone. Pattinson's remarkable performance fits perfectly with the ambiance, making this a magnificent movie of glowing razzle-dazzle.Benny Safdie did a great job directing this one, and was terrific as the brother in the film as well. Check out it for the acting and filmmaking! A great joy ride experience.",Good Time

83,austin0731,"Good Time was a neon lit, claustrophobic rat trap of a film",8,24 November 2017,"Good Time was a neon lit, claustrophobic rat trap of a film. Starring Robert Pattinson as Connie Nikas as he tries to break out his mentally ill brother following a failed bank robbery. This whole film follows the events of one night in which the protagonist constantly runs around New York city as events go from bad to worse and to down right absurd, and it was great. It was very amazing to watch, as the film really had this tonal shift in a very key moment of the film after which Good Time played somewhat like an installment of the Hangover series unfolding in a most breathtaking and beautiful cityscape. Robert Pattinson in this film was truly uncanny, this isn't Robert Pattinson the sexy, young vampire as we had known him from the Twilight saga but this is a grizzled, refined actor. This complete 180 of the actor has been slowly building since we last saw him in the Lost city of Z where he played an older man differing a lot from his previous roles. Now, we have Good Time where he plays a complete scum and unsympathetic character except perhaps for his love of his little brother. This is a riveting performance by Pattinson as we follow him through the slums of New York city slowly digging himself into an inescapable hole. This film explores the idea of that one misstep, one mistake that can turn things from good to bad in a split second. It was so interesting seeing a character like this and his constant attempts of digging himself out of this issue and situation that he has gotten himself into. More interestingly the futility of these attempts as we see him struggle but keep working against himself where one wrong move leads him to dead end after dead end, not only so but the walls are slowly closing in. I have mentioned that it is very interesting because we get to see this unsympathetic character but I think that actually this narrative angle does in fact allow certain space for us to sympathize with this character, in spite of the horrible deeds, as viewers I feel that there is a certain backstory that we would automatically apply to this character, a backstory that I feel was specifically left out in order to fuel audience imagination. We sympathize because we reason ourselves into doing so in order to makes sense of his actions.Good Time was a fresh, different thriller with a very dark comedic tone sewn throughout the film.",Good Time

This whole movie looks like one adventure, one unusual journey. We don't know what's going to happen next, but we know it's going to be tense. I enjoyed that ride, but I didn't like the ending of the film so I give it a lower rating.",Good Time
86,bastos,Another tense ride by the Safdies,7,19 October 2020,"I don't like the Safdie brothers as much as most indie lovers but I still think their movies are good tense rides. Much like Uncut Gems this is a very tense and gripping movie with great performances (sometimes by amateurs) and unforgettable situations. Benny Safdie especially stands out as the disabled brother giving one of those performances where he just seems mentally disabled and not acting, which is pretty rare. The screenplay is solid but starts with a bit of a leap of faith where you are led to believe that someone would take his mentally disabled brother to a bank robbery! But other than that I liked it and had a twist in the middle that genuinely took me by surprise. The one thing I really don't like with the Safdies is the cinematography. Their use of close ups is so over the top that it becomes distracting and takes a little to get used to. I understand that they're trying to convey a sense of claustrophobia, but by doing it with these extreme close ups feels a bit cheap and gimmicky. The ending felt also a bit flat but nevertheless this is a good solid movie.",Good Time
87,Jared_Andrews,Frantic and Fantastic,8,19 September 2017,"If I could ever experience what it's like to be a neon light inside a crowded nightclub, I imagine it would feel a lot like watching Good Time.This movie exudes intensity, electricity, and neonicity (not a real word, just roll with it). The opening scene provides the movie's blandest color scheme, but it's serious and compelling and important, so pay attention.From there, the movie leaps fearlessly into a techno blasting, adrenaline surging, rush of mayhem and terrible decision making. Two brothers rob a bank, run from the police, and one ends up in the hospital. Then it gets worse.Constantine (played by Robert Pattinson, in a career-making performance) lives a life of dysfunction. He struggles to maintain healthy relationships with family or friends or anyone. The one thing in his life that he's sure of is that he wants to take care of his brother, who has intellectual disabilities. He spends a majority of the film frantically (frantic accurately describes the mood for most of Good Time) attempting to save his brother from the trouble that he put him in. The problem is that Constantine can't even properly take care of himself, so helping his brother is far beyond his abilities.Try as he may, every attempt to help backfires. Despite Constantine's good intentions, he is a powerfully negative influence in his brother's life. He sees himself as his brother's savior, but that's very far from the truth.It's tempting to sympathize with Constantine. He has real moments of decency. But just when you may think this isn't such a bad guy, he showcases another instance of unsavory behavior. That seems to be the story of his life—fleeting moments of hope, followed by swift slaps of grim reality that are mostly brought on by his own doing.In the end, his brother, Nick, becomes the more likable character. We want what is best for Nick, just like Constantine does. Because of this shared goal, I want Constantine to succeed. I have never rooted harder for a character that I didn't really want to root for. That's all because of Nick.Since this is sounding deeply dramatic, let me reiterate, this isn't a plodding sob story. The frantic pace, ludicrously rousing music and color scheme will make your eyes bug out and your hair stand up. Actually, you may literally stand up at certain moments because of the intensity.See Good Time if you're up for an intense crime thriller. Just don't forget to think while watching. There's more to this movie than neon and techno.",Good Time

The movie is pretty fine the fist 30 minutes of a brother trying to pay out his brother out of jail and finding ways to make money but he gets into deeper trouble and starts to do pointless things and begin to like the character even less. It is honestly pretty boring and dissapointing. 3.5/10.",Good Time
93,PotassiumMan,Robert Pattinson shines in this hard-hitting NYC nightmare,8,13 August 2017,"The Safdie Brothers' newest film is a bleak, unflinching tale of a career criminal (Pattinson in the most intense performance of his career) who furiously objects to his mentally deficient brother's psychiatric treatment and blithely coerces him into helping him carry out a bank robbery. When their plans unexpectedly fall apart and the brother gets arrested, this lowlife proceeds to use every means possible to try to bail his brother out.Pattinson's acting in the past has never caught fire the way it does here. It's a transformation. He completely embodies a born loser who has no other way to get through life other than lying, conning and flat out breaking the law. Simply put, if this is your first on-screen impression of Robert Pattinson, you've hit the jackpot. Benny Safdie is affecting as the mentally handicapped brother. By contrast, Jennifer Jason Leigh is regrettably under-utilized as the older female companion whose inclination toward generosity is misplaced with the criminal schemer. Taliah Webster gives a fine turn as the street-smart but still somewhat innocent Queens teenager who gets caught up in a web of crime and deception. And Buddy Duress is solid as Pattinson's random criminal accomplice.A percolating, perpetually menacing soundtrack guides the skittish, volatile pace of this film in which there are plenty of moments of tension and ungovernable aggression. The hellish world that is presented here is alternately scary but also consoling in a weary-world kind of way, much like the 1970's films of Martin Scorsese back in the day. Here, iPhones, texting and newer New York news channels add to the mix of anger, misery and desperation.This film has neither the pedigree nor the marketing for it to be considered an Oscar contender. It also hasn't been heavily touted; I watched it in a mostly empty theater in Manhattan. But it's still one of the most well-made films of the year- a potent story of the clash between family love and hopeless criminal tendencies, one that will leave its mark. Highly recommended.",Good Time
94,Der_Schnibbler,Most of these reviews must be fake...,2,19 January 2019,"This can't be just a case of the vanilla crowd being easily impressed. When you have words thrown around like ""A thrilling, neon-drenched subterranean madcap odyssey anchored by a superbly nervy Robert Pattinson"" and a ""thrilling ride"" and half the review titles sound like wannabe Eberts, something must be up.Especially once you've seen the movie yourself...I didn't dislike ""Good Time"" but reading all these hogwash reviews certainly set me up for disappointment.No, it is not a ""thrilling ride"" and there is nothing ""crazy"" or ""madcap"" about it. In fact, the film promises to start off one way and then, once the second act hits, it's simply one long detour.Everything the characters do seems pointless, ill thought out, and doomed from the start, robbing you of the hope they'll somehow win, as you realize you're watching a losing battle.The good moments were few and far between, such as a very cool and Tarantino-esque expository monologue leading into the (sadly misguided) second act.I also liked the gritty look and thoughtful casting. Similar to Aronofsky's ""Pi,"" you feel the dirt of a now forgotten New York City after dark, once the lights go out and all the McStores close down. The actors are ""ugly,"" disheveled, alienated. The way they act and speak is exactly what New Yorkers are like, down to the van driver.But sadly, aside from that, the film falls short.",Good Time

The characters are great and are really the main focus of the movie, each one with their own flaws and individual traits. The acting is incredible, especially by Robert Pattinson, a lot on screaming but a lot of quiet moments as well to really develop the viewers relationship with each character. The soundtrack was also surprisingly amazing as well as the cinematography. A lot of the shots in the movie where close ups of a persons face which to begin was quite odd and a bit distract but in the end really allows the viewer to focus on the characters facial expressions. As far as plot it's really good, easy to follow and unpredictable. It starts fast and ends slow. Overall a terrific movie 8/10.",Good Time
99,svhot,"Creative neo-noir movie, brilliant performances, unique direction style",9,18 September 2017,"""Good Time"" is a twisted bank heist film that definitely proves two things - one, Robert Pattinson's versatility as an actor ; two, the Safdie brothers' unique and creative style of direction.Robert Pattinson shines brightly in his role as the stubble-laden, nervy criminal in this movie who attempts to rob a bank with his brother. The viewers can actually feel the intensity and the tension through his eyes and expressions. Robert has played his role to perfection in ""Good Time"". He has really managed to break out of his ""cute, romantic hero"" image that he unintentionally acquired through the ""Twilight"" movie franchise.All the best, brother Robert, for all the award nominations, ceremonies and film festivals this year. People who have under-rated him so far must watch this movie to become fully aware of the fact that Robert Pattinson is really a versatile actor.The Safdie brothers direction work in this movie has been compared by some people to Sidney Lumet's work in ""Dog Day Afternoon""(it featured the great Al Pacino). They should take this comment as a compliment.The Safdie bros have definitely hit the bull's eye by making ""Good Time"" intense, unique, quirky, and entertaining. It will always be remembered as one of the best crime-comedies / neo-noir thrillers of its time. The Safdie bros have shot a lot of scenes in this movie using only streetlights, cellphone lights, car lights, and TV screen lights. This creates the correct atmosphere for the story being conveyed to viewers. The soundtrack of the movie simultaneously escalates its entertainment value and its intensity.I would love to become a full-time story-writer for movies or a full-time movie critic, because movies exist in every breathe I take.

It is not about luxury, rich finances and Wall Street. Instead it is about a middle aged man with a developmental disability and his creative brother who is a criminal. What makes this movie special is the cinematic styles of very creative film frames combined with very unique self-developed sound effects (like an echo in a time warp machine) and the flash blurry mixed camera frame shots. In a way, this movie was like a Tarantino's 1994 movie Pulp Fiction. To me, this movie Good Time could become a 2017 cult-movie like The Rocky Picture Horror Show (1975). This story-line was a warped story line from beginning to end; nothing good happens and everything is set-up to fail. However Constantine is a sympathetic character. He, in his own way, cares about his brother a lot and wants to protect him in the way he knows how. Throughout the entire movie, Constantine continues to come up with artistic ways of survival. It is clear that Constantine is living on borrow time; but time and time again he escapes the tightest of dead-ends - and he keeps a spirit about him. His attitude is similar to Jack Nicolson character in Five Easy Pieces (1970), which was set to become an All-American movie genre (but did not).",Good Time

Everything in this film feels like it comes together perfectly, from the cinematography, which was pretty good, to the soundtrack, which was great, and the acting, which was superb. Robert Pattinson did great as the main character but Ben Safdie really blew me away, before this I thought he was only a director but he gives an amazing performance. This film is tense and exciting and does a really good of pulling you into the world of the movie, I thoroughly recommend it.",Good Time

Uncut Gems didn't do it for me so I thought I'd watch this one. I wish I could state many good things to recommend this movie. But I fell asleep as it didn't keep me engaged. When I woke, there was someone beating someone on the ground. The person doing the beating was angry. It reminds me of the temperament of some (most) of the characters in Uncut Gems. There are angry people doing their angry thing. I can accept that people get angry and that they carry this anger. But two angry films in a row by the same creators? Give me a break. Oh ... and about the music. The music literally drowns out actor's lines at times ... is that for real? Has this been done deliberately? I noticed something similar happening in Uncut Gems. The music is unusual and I suspect that they have made the music a feature of the film. I could accept this, except that in both of these films I now recognize a pattern. The music is annoying. Maybe that is the intention.",Good Time

111,antoniokowatsch,Exceptional thriller:,8,19 June 2018,"First off I'd like to state that this is one of the best thrillers I've seen thus far. It constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat with its ridiculously fast-paced style. Furthermore, the movie shines with its original story and unique execution.Quick synopsis:
The movie starts out with a psychological evaluation of some sort. A visibly/seemingly ""mentally challenged"" person is asked a couple of revealing questions. The whole setting of the scene was very reminiscent of the opening scene in the original Blade Runner movie. And just like in the Blade Runner movie the session gets interrupted. This time, however, by non-violent means. We later find out that the mentally challenged person from the first scene is the brother of the protagonist. Together the Nikas-brothers are a criminal duo of sorts. Connie Nikas, the older brother, definitely has a somewhat shady past as we later find out, when we get to see his handler. Right at the beginning of the movie the two brothers decide to take it to the next level with their next exploit. We as the viewers are there to witness the protagonists transition from small-time criminals to big-time criminals. Well, let's just say that things go horribly wrong and just like that everything changes. The protagonist finds himself in an impossible situation and goes to extreme lengths to right his wrongs.
At the end of the day it's a really moving story with believable characters. The protagonist, Connie Nikas, is quite complex. He's a petty criminal who also seems to have his heart in the right place. The relationship with his brother is equally as complex; on a fundamental level he really cares about him. But he doesn't seem to think that involving him in his criminal activities is wrong. Well, that's until things go FUBAR. It is at that point that the protagonist finds himself in a neverending downward spiral as he embarks on his quest for redemption. The movie gets extremely emotional towards the end, with the totally messed up family dynamics. It's a really powerful ending. And the movie does come full circle as Nick Nikas finds himself in yet another session with his psychologist.Acting-wise I have to say that Robert Pattinson delivered his best performance yet. It was extremely satisfying to see how well he performed his role. Truly mesmerizing.The film score consists of very energetic synthwave music and perfectly compliments the movie and its pacing. Unlike in most movies these days, where the film score just silently plays along, this movie's film score is prominently displayed to the point where it becomes an entity of its own. It's loud and it's ""in your face"". Very unapologetically. I love it. As expected, the pacing is extremely fast. What the movie does really well is humanizing the characters. All of the characters in this movie have flaws. Some are more obvious than others but no one is perfect. And that is very important. It adds an extra layer of realism to the story. Especially since most of the protagonists are criminals. Take e.g. Connie Nikas; although he made the lives of those that he encountered ""much worse"" you couldn't help but feel sorry for him. Because you knew that he was trying to be the good guy. Even though he failed, his intentions were ""mostly"" benign.Furthermore, I'd like to stress how comical the movie is, despite its serious subject matter (which is criminal intent in all its diversity). There are some scenes that were so bizarre that they became extremely hilarious. Like the whole thing with the LSD bottle and the guard. It's still one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen. Whoever wrote that script must have a very peculiar mind (in the most positive way of course).Final verdict: totally recommended. If you want to have a ""good time"" watch this movie (pun intended).",Good Time
112,Irena_Spa,Unrecognizable Robert Pattinson!!!,8,28 November 2017,"""Good Time"" is far more than I've expected to see, especially Robert Pattinson. Totally different from all what he's done before and what to say than he is excellent as one hysterical, emotionally driven character. Almost through full movie goes Daniel Lopatin's music, which sounds like Jean-Michel Jarre made it, and gives a good tempo for all what's going on. It is rare that some movie has the music which goes almost non- stop, as this one has. The story ends there where it should be and how it should be, and by that we have feeling that justice has been satisfied.",Good Time
113,shawnmikedryer,Exhilarating !!,9,13 May 2021,"Connie Nikas is the definition of an unpredictable degenerate who beneath it all truly means well. He has the upmost love for his intellectually challenged brother, Nick, but Connie who at times seems unable to get out of his own way always gets the two of them in the most twisted of situations. Knowing full well his brother always looks up to him and is unable to help avoid disaster, he can only sit back and watch the carnage unfold. This time Connie and Nick hit at bank at gunpoint, while fleeing however Nick is caught and arrested leaving Connie helplessly watching in the shadows unable to help. Connie learns he needs to come up with $10,000 to secure his brothers bail bond in order to free him. What insues can only be described as a frantic journey threw the darkest depths of the city where Connie will go through any lengths to raise the money, but he has to question if he's doing more harm than good.Josh and Benny Safdie have emerged in the film world with a bang. The camera shots are those of a seasoned filmmakers and the Safdie brothers make it look easy, how inventive they are. Pairing with an intense soundtrack that leaves you pinned to you're seat from start to finish.

While I'm not a fan of this film, only because the pacing is bad, as well as the writing, but also there are no real likable characters and Patterson's character is horrible, in my opinion. I somehow made it to the end and when I got there I was exhausted, as I'm sure you'll be by the end by the absurdly convoluted storyline that finishes with a splat rather than a bang.",Good Time

The new film from Joshua and Benny Safdie, the brother-team of indie filmmakers behind abrasive micro-budget hits like Daddy Longlegs and Heaven Knows, is hardly a fun experience in the theater, but it's a memorable one.

121,CinePendejo,Propulsive energy amongst a grimy world.,8,29 August 2017,"A few months ago, I watched the Safdie Brothers previous film HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT. Chronicling the moment-to-moment life of a homeless drug abuser in the dregs of New York, it was a film that took me awhile to adjust to by the very nature of it's design. It aimed to replicate the shoddy, aimless, claustrophobic mindset of these drug addicts while neither praising nor condemning their questionable characterization. It felt genuinely unique, drawing me in to a world that I wouldn't imagine myself being in and leaving me shocked while doing so. Even though it's several beats away from being perfect, I wouldn't imagine anything more unique than that film.The Safdies' follow up GOOD TIME, however, is a genuine improvement while also keeping true to the originals grimy language. Telling a story about a robber trying to break out his mentally handicapped brother from prison after a heist blunder, it finds both genuine heart and humor among such a grungy world while also adding propulsive energy and polish. It's The Safdies' at their peak, and may be one of the most oddly enjoyable rides I've seen in a while.There's more of a plot at play, but there's still mostly a lot more downtime. The whole film revolves around Robert Pattinson as Connie plowing through multiple tough situations to get his brother out, but it never feels confined to it. Mostly feeling like a purped-up ride shifting from dreamy to dynamic then back to dreamy, it's only concerned is immersing you in this crazy world.I was a touch disappointed, at first, by how there's barely any connection with the two brothers. Looking into it more, there's a subtle theme with not condoning to the old ""Mice and Men trope"". The whole thing is centered around the much more adaptable Connie trying to break his brother out by fear that his nature would bring him to pain, but the film delivers a sly swap between them. All of Connie's extreme means ultimately cost him his freedom, while Nick gradually grows. It's a clever subversion, one that complements the danger their world has.None of that wouldn't work, however, without the sheer talent on hand. Pattison became that one teen heartthrob who now chooses daring roles, but never has he felt this believable. Connie's character, by design, might be the biggest asshole ever put to film, but Pattison makes him like a full-fledged human being rather than a cliché. One of the director Benny Safdie plays the not-so-bright brother Nick, and its a damn great performance. For only just barely any lines, he comes off painfully heartbreaking as he struggles with this world he lives in without turning into a comedic buffoon. These two make this film.It may not be a perfect film - it does move a bit too slow at times and The Safdies are no professionals in the special effects parts - but it's a film worthy of its title. Funny, delightful, and full of adrenaline, it's a film that needs to be seen.",Good Time

124,thirtyfivestories,Devotion Blinds Responsibility,9,22 September 2017,"Connie and Nick are brothers, but their ties are not limited to genetics. They are a symbiotic swirl of aggression and possibility. Together the two are impaired with an uncanny blindness. Barriers disappear and strangers' murmurs fizzle out. Their wild, dirt-etched plans are carried out with ferocity and total abandon. Running is their pastime, and they have become proficient dodgers. Nick is viewed as a liability to society, and Connie is labeled as a danger to it. Newscasters reduce them to mugshots and sensational teleprompter poetry. The city needs villains. The cops need robbers. The pubic needs faces to fear. The brothers need to get to Virginia.Not a single soul can decipher the calamity in Nick's head, not even Connie. A therapist chisels away at his cranium only to discover that Nick was raised in the wilderness. The professional world clashes with the feral, urban ghetto in a nauseating office. Connie fends off the emotional combat for his brother. Huddled in the corner of a descending elevator, he assures Nick that no one understands their pain.They steal rather than earn; fight rather than accommodate. They are devoted brutes, writhing in uncontrollable suspicion. Sensitive to blue and red streams, and terrified of separation. Meandering upon steam-breathing streets like amputated Siamese twins. Their conjoined heart palpitates with neon intensity.Connie has been educated by the cruelty of the city. The assaults upon his brother have toned his muscles and sharpened his wit. He is the unstoppable force that causes officers to be armed. He transcends the status of guardian. Connie is a fable of determination. His good deeds are shadowed by his actions, but his actions are birthed from his compassion. ​The brother's story is an expose on the concept of ""good"". Maybe we should redefine righteousness, and leave room for desperate souls. An ""us versus them"" mentality erodes the potential kindness of strangers. Connie subverts all social norms in route towards securing his brother's salvation. On this pilgrimage, a restless city tosses in its bed as a two brothers attempt to steal back their birthright of happiness.",Good Time

There were so many close-ups, I had to leave the theatre a few minutes before the film ended because the headache it gave me became unbearable. Come on!The cinematography is so bad that it crossed my mind that they might be showing a pirated version of the film, or that something might have gone wrong in the projection room to make it display improperly. (FYI I saw this at Alamo Drafthouse in Brooklyn.) For nearly every shot, I wanted the cameraman to take 10 steps back.I've never seen anything like it. All of that hard work for nothing!

Last, I grew up in the neighborhood much of the film is shot in so I am somewhat biased. This, however, is not what makes the film so good.Pattinson is brilliant as the Big brother trying to make a better life for himself and his learning disabled brother. A bank robbery they attempt goes wrong and the remainder of the film is an attempt to recover his brother from a hospital after getting caught and beat up in jail. I won't give any more away but have to say the film is thought provoking, exciting and fast paced. I also felt it was quite realistically done in the way each character plays their parts.

136,iamjacksmoviechannel,Pattinson's best work,7,29 August 2017,"OK let me come out and say it, this movie is not likable in the traditional sense of the word. In fact you may walk away hating the main character and you will have every right to. But damn, i'm proud of Robert Pattinson. He's joining that club of former YA actors like Daniel Radcliffe and Kristen Stewart who are pushing themselves when it comes to their independent film choices now. Credit should be given to the Safdie brothers, who I honestly don't know much about but this movie makes me want to look into their past work. You can tell they have a visual style. This is one of the grittiest looking thrillers to come out in a while and the way they have colors just pierce through the darkness and edginess just fuels this acid-induced thriller more. Every time these guys turn up the suspense this movie just grabs you by the cortex and never lets go. Part of that is the most kick ass musical score you've ever heard. This score is phenomenal, it is workout music times 100. But yeah, the reason this works so well is really Robert Pattinson. This is his best role ever. I know there are going to be teenage girls who are like ""noo"", but i'm saying yes, mostly because the dude is mostly making you have to like him through facial expressions alone.He plays a guy whose brother is mentally disabled and in order to get them both out of a shitty situation, he manipulates the brother into robbing a bank in which case the brother is arrested and he has to figure out a way to get him out of jail.And that Pattinson manages any sympathy at all is really something cause he does some seriously screwed up stuff in this movie, like try to seduce a 16 year old type badness. He's a scumbag and Pattinson never makes you lose sight of that but he's a character in a story with many scumbags and in the end his motivations are at least understandable. What hurts this movie a little more than you may not be totally behind the characters is the down time. Sometimes it's funny and sometimes its clever but it doesn't exactly have a story populated with enough ideas or action to constitute the run-time. So I go 7 out of 10 guys.

137,AW_McGOWAN,Safdie Brothers Serve Harsh Realism In Unconventional Crime Story,7,9 January 2021,"With ""Good Time,"" brothers Benny and Josh Safdie direct a high energy blue-collar crime film that dances in the neo-realist tradition while also offering something strikingly contemporary. After Connie Nikas (Robert Pattinson) rips his mentally handicapped brother Nick (Benny Safdie) out of a therapy session, the two rob a bank together. Once they leave with the money, it does not take long for the cops to catch up with them. While Connie escapes, Nick ends up in handcuffs. Now it is up to Nick to bail out his brother, while also avoiding his own arrest.The entire film takes place over the course of less than twenty-four hours, illustrating a gritty chase between Connie and the cops. However, ""Good Time"" shies away from explosions, gunfire, or epic standoffs. Instead, it takes a realistic approach. The script evolves serendipitously, as Connie adapts to one unfortunate situation after another. It is because of this fluid, unforgiving structure that I compare ""Good Time"" to neo-realist pictures - it does not care for Hollywood conventions and takes on a lifelike naturality.Robert Pattinson is the star of the film, and he solidifies himself as a talented actor here. Conventionally known as a pretty boy for his roles in the ""Twilight"" and ""Harry Potter"" movies, Pattinson remains handsome in this role, but falls far from sexy. Connie is soft spoken and somewhat mysterious. His compassion for his brother comes off as genuine, but his choice to include Nick in criminal activities is questionable. The Safdie brothers are not interested in explicating the protagonist beyond the moment. We never learn where his motives come from, as the movie takes place intensely in the present.For that same reason, none of the other characters (except perhaps Nick) get much depth. Although there are many speaking parts in ""Good Time,"" each enters and exits Connie's journey unceremoniously. Every time we think we're getting to know someone new, he or she evaporates from the narrative. In most movies, such a lack of depth would be detrimental, but in ""Good Time,"" it supports the film's lifelike authenticity.Outside of Josh Safdie's highly original script co-written with Ronald Bronstein, the brothers also create a down-to-earth environment through the film's more technical elements. Shot on location in Queens, most of the movie takes place at night and depicts New York City in as unflatteringly opaque. At the same time, vibrant splashes of fluorescent storefronts and urban lights contrast the darkness. It is a harsh dichotomy - courtesy of cinematographer Sean Price Williams - that once again captures the movie's grim, yet truthful tone. At times, it even suggests a psychedelic visual effect.Additional praise goes out to the sound department and composer Daniel Lopatin. For such a grounded film, ""Good Time"" has a raucously booming score that cuts into the auditory nerves. The movie makes equally daring use of diegetic sound. Characters frequently talk over each other, and organic background noise feels omnipresent, making the occasional bouts of silence all the more jarring as well.Overall, there is a lot to chew on in ""Good Time."" The directors clearly had a subversive vision and executed it skillfully on levels beyond just the story. As a story, though, it echoes Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs,"" David Simon's HBO series ""The Wire,"" and even Vittorio De Sica's 1948 Italian classic ""Bicycle Theives."" All of this is to say that if you're looking for a movie with closure, ""Good Time"" might not be for you. However, if you seek something that is cinematically unique and very true to the seedy world we currently live in, then this definitely deserves a place on your watch list.",Good Time

The plot never stops to catch its breath, forcing main character Pattinson, who's acting blew me away considering his past films, to constantly adapt and evoke an engaging fight and flight response from scene to scene. The cinematography is electrifying, and the balance between wide landscape shots and claustrophobic closeups is constantly gripping.

143,littlemankazoo,"A pulsing, heart-pounding, neon nightmare",9,7 February 2018,"""The pure always act from love. The damned always act from love...""So says the haunting chords that close out this 'film.'I say 'Film' because I struggle to really call this a normal piece of cinema, instead of an 'experience'. This is a film that is to be EXPERIENCED, not just watched and digested. It grips you with no qualms for your comfort, and juts you into a nightmare world of neon, crime, Sprite bottles full of acid and synthesized heartbeats.'Good Time' is the story of Connie Nikas, a criminal from Brooklyn that you spend the majority of this film balancing a treacherous love-hate relationship with that, like some of the characters he meets within the film, could turn costly at any moment. In the midst of a failed bank robbery, Connie's autistic brother Nicholas is arrested, which catapults Connie into a one-night frantic struggle to free the brother he loves, and only that matters. From then...I'm not sure WHERE to begin...To begin with what many will likely take away from this film, I have to note that the score to this film is GORGEOUS. Simplistic in its design and extremely familiar to those who have ever heard the score to 'The Terminator' by the legendary Brad Fiedel, the primarily Synth score by Oneohtrix Point Never is haunting in its pulsing rhythm as we watch Connie's situation turn all the more desperate throughout the film. It feels frantic, as if it is our own pulse rocketing-out and our nerves manifesting in sound. It coats the film in a sleek sheen of sound, which I will be remembering for a long time and will be likely purchasing in physical form. In a land barren of unique-sounding film music, this stands-out from the crowd in a big way.A film would be no good, however, with sights to go with excellent sound. Thankfully, Good Time sports a gorgeous-yet-grungy style to it that is also all its own. This film sports an odd approach of most of its characters being shot in tight closeups, a startling contrast from most studio films, and what would often be considered a deal-breaker. However, this adds to the comfort-destroying tone Good Time intends to create. The look of it is claustrophobic, and makes us FEEL this desperation these characters feel as they struggle through the night. Along with these tight and confined shots, the lighting of the film is gorgeous as well. Everything from red neon to orange streetlights and TV static illuminate this film in a gloss that I can't recall from any other film that dares to call itself 'grungy' in any form. Like its score, its visuals haunt the viewer, and drag them into the world of the Brooklyn crime world at night.Robert Pattinson, who essentially carries the weight of this film's acting duties, is absolutely phenomenal as a character we struggle to deduce whether we love or hate. He shows love and compassion for those who are weaker, especially for his autistic brother. At the same time, however, we see him bulldoze through anyone and anything that attempts to stop him from freeing his brother. The film is quite literally his path of destruction that makes us question by the end of this film's crisp 99-minute runtime; ""At what cost?""By the end of the film, where we are shown the reality of the world 'Good Time' rushes us through, we are allowed to breath and really take-in everything...and wonder why some people we consider scum truly DO these horrible things. What leads them to these ends? What do they love that they constantly struggle and fight for? Does this undying love make them GOOD or EVIL for what they do?In the end, we are left to judge. And we are left to ask who is really in their 'right place' in the world, who is wrong or right, and what the struggles in the midst of desperation are worth in the end, and how destructive that death rattle can become.Sporting an incredible score, grungy cinematography, terrific performances, and a haunting presence that has yet to even leave me, 'Good Time' is the best film that NO ONE has seen from 2017.And frankly, you should go see it, now, and have yourself a good time.",Good Time

145,Bantam,The very talented Mr. Pattinson,7,18 March 2018,"I never thought I was gonna live to see the day that Pattinson would become a decent actor. Fortunately, I did.Having to carry the burden of teen actor on your shoulders is probably a heavy one. Pattinson did not only shrug it off, but he starts to become, IMO a very good actor and in this one he absolutely underlined this. Let's quickly go over the technicalities. 
I presume the budged wasn't enormous, but even though, everything is solid. As mentioned, Pattinson's acting is really good. All other actors, even the short, yet shrill appearance by Jennifer Jason Leigh, are really good. The sets are as grimy as they should be, camera and editing are keen and mostly spot-on. The sound editing (and soundtrack choices) was not quite my cup of tea, but it did fit.The movie is an indie production with a certain 80's flair to it and depicts the hardships of people who try to get by in a gnarly world. 
The story revolves around two brothers, one of them is mentally handicapped, the other tries to care for him, as good as he can.
If I am not mistaken, the entire story plays out in the frame of a couple of days, with a few cuts to allow for the story to progress in the background.
Basically it starts at a point where the situation of the two brothers is bad and it gets only worse from there. However, it has a few light moments and and is very realistic. 
Topics that are covered range from dealing with the harsh realities of life, if you're not quite lucky enough to fit into the mainstream image of a ""normal"" person, to the futile attempts to get a grip on your life. Also, the movie poses the question of how far you'd go, if you're in tough spot, to live up to the promise you made (here: to care for you brother).There are no easy decisions to be made, nor is the outcome neither predictable nor happy. The movie ends on a rather bitter note, even though we are led to believe that this ending is supposed to be ""good"". Personally, I found this ending the movie's strongest part.If you're still shunning Pattinson for his Twighlight debacle, watch this one and see for yourself how much that man has matured as an actor.",Good Time

Only this time, IT'S ALL CLOSE UPS. WOOH Shaky CAM, GO LOW BUDGET. The directors are such idiots that they once again make the mistake of what made their movie Heaven Knows What extremely mediocre. HIRING PEOPLE WHO WORK THEIR OWN JOBS. They aren't acting cause they can't act, you can tell when a police officer is an actual police officer or a nurse is an actual nurse. Way to be so lazy and not hire actors to challenge them to try to be a legitimate police officer or nurse. Where's the ambition? You're gonna use the same piece of crap narcotic crackhead that got real jail time years ago from Heaven Knows What? Really directors? Also, Ben Safdie is insulting to mentally handicapped people. His performance is so wrong in so many ways. Wow, such genuine directors. Way to make fun of handicapped people JUST WOW! Robert Pattinson once again cannot act. What an idiot, he ruins method acting just as Jared Leto. You don't starve yourself in a basement and look like a homeless hobo when the character clearly isn't supposed to look like one or act like one. He literally has a nice apartment and his parents are wealthy enough. This is one of the first times I've seen an actor add plot holes to a movie. The cinematography is pretty bad. It's filled with obnoxious pandering metaphors using neon colors. Oh, when they're in the red. It's danger. When it's pink, it's love. Are you serious? You are going to play the audience dumb because you think they can't process information without visual cues? Who do they think we are? Sunjay Gupta? JUST LET US THINK FOR OURSELVES.

After watching the film yesterday I realized that this film is no old wine but a distinctly tasty elixir that I never knew existed. There is a hilarious twist in this film that acts like a virtual bridge between the initial events and the final events.The film is infused with moments of frustration, disruption and ambition and the director makes sure you easily slip into the muddled -up mind of the character played by Robert Pattinson who by the way has evolved in leaps and bounds as an actor over the last few years.

164,Joetampa90,Good Time is a great time.,8,13 September 2017,"Good Time is a gritty dirty crime thriller staring Pattinson in what is easily his best performance to date which should be considered for the Oscar nomination. Pattinson channels Vincent Gallo's Billy Brown character in some ways from the great movie ""Buffalo 66"". He really nails the role of somewhat eccentric possible sociopath that is Connie. However staying on the note of performances it would be a total overlooking to not mention Benny Safdie's absolute knock out performance of mentally handicapped Nick. This performance easily rivals some of the greatest mentally handicapped renditions of all time. I wish we saw some more of Nick who kind of disappears till the very end of the movie after the first 30 minutes or so.Now that I've covered the performances let me get to the cinematography and score. Both of which are of very high quality. The original score is easily the best of the 2017 releases. The score is very effective in delivering the message of intensity and anxiety when things pick up. Also, the closing credits Iggy Pop ""The Pure and the Damned"" is a perfect and sad choice for whats going on during the credits.The story is a great ride with some amazing side characters that come and go through out. I'm sure if you are reading this review you are aware of the plot so there is no need for me to rehash what the film is about. But for an NYC crime drama this ones up there with some of the heavyweights of the sub genre. It's frantic but sometimes mellow and blends dirtiness with the good intentions of Connie in a way that comes out really well.I'm giving the movie an 8, its just short of a 9. I'm not gonna go with a 9 due to the somewhat non-ending end and the lack of Benny's ""Nick"" after the first 30 minutes. I felt more Nick would have added to the tone of the film if every now and then as Connie was struggling to get things done we saw brief scenes of Nick continuing to have a hard time in jail here and there.Go out and buy a ticket to this movie and support this kind of cinema because it deserves it.",Good Time

Half the movie is shot in dark rooms, hiding any emotion or nuisance he may have brought to his character. Don't know if this was his agent's way of showing his range apart from 'Twilight', but it was a mistake regardless.The plot loses itself over and over, trying to find a direction or purpose, and fails hard.

The 2nd act of this movie is where it gets a little slow. Which is my only issue with the movie, is that it slows down at parts. There's also a scene in the house that is very weird and hard to watch once you know some details about the characters. But it shows what kind of character our ""Protagonist"" is. Now why the quotation around Protagonist?? Because Pattinsons character is bad in this movie. Yes he's trying to do good for his brother but he obviously has issues and needs help. Which is why its a little sad. Yes he tries to help his brother but at the same time he uses his brother to help him do horrible crimes, like robbing the bank in the beginning.

This film's energy is just so chaotic but so enticing. It's shot in a beautifully trippy way where the surroundings are dark but the colours are bright and the shots are striking even though they capture something that is the exact opposite of that. It's not something that should work, there's no character you should really sympathise with or root for but you do nonetheless. There's also so many rise and fall moments and even though the falls outweigh the rise moments, you still hope everything will turn out right in the end but it just doesn't.

The movie begins with two brothers botching a bank robbery job where one brother Nick, played by co-director Benny Safdie, gets caught and sent to prison and the other brother, Robert Pattinson (from the Twilight movies) ends up on the run, pursued by the authorities and trying to find a way to get his brother out of jail.Both actors give stellar performances. Nick (Benny Safdie) as the mentally challenged brother and Robert Pattenson gives such a hard core performance as brother Connie you'll easily forget he was a teen heart throb vampire in the Twilight movies. The movie starts off with a bang (literally) with plenty of action and a musical soundtrack that keeps you enthralled. (The soundtrack is probably one of the 5 best of the year.) The problem for me was at some point the movie turns into ""Groundhog Day"" with the same situations happening over and over again. It's a movie that ends with a whimper. I give the movie high marks for its direction by the brothers team of Benny and Josh Safdie and the visuals on the big screen are stunning; it's just that the story is a little weak. It doesn't have quite enough to bring the movie all the way to the finish line.Good Time has a run time of 1 hour and 40 minutes and it earns its strong ""R"" rating with plenty of violence, sex and drugs.

178,brooklynjm,Wha ???,2,4 September 2017,"Don't quite understand the very high ratings for this -- I picture friends of the producer, or interns at the distributor working away to find new ways to praise with faint damns. I saw it at BAM in Brooklyn, and the mostly hipster audience sat in stunned silence throughout - with occasional relieved chuckles at the few flashes of stupidity that came off as funny. Loud, violent, all closeups and menacing pretentious music unrelated to the action.Pattinson indeed breaks his pretty boy mold, and works very hard - but a lot of ""fucks"" and running very fast down urban streets does not constitute a breakout performance. JL Leigh does her usual sterling job as a frighteningly dumb victim -- but she was on screen for maybe 4 minutes. The only performance that worked was the 16yo girl Crystal -- Taliah Webster seemed to inherently get the power of underplaying, and she did it brilliantly. Of course, she disappears as the whole mess grinds down, ceding the screen to the boys.The coda at the end was indeed touching - but not in the way the director(s) may have intended. Actual (?) mentally disabled clients in treatment were shown in a therapy group as the credits rolled -- they were sweet and fascinating, but they were being used - hard - in a commercial film, as a career move by a millionaire actor. Also, for a story trading so freely in the Queens, NY milieu - the sudden emergence of a large haunted house fun park, setting for a pointlessly violent beating of one of the few interesting characters, followed by giving him a huge dose of LSD -- was ridiculous. Not gritty, just cruel & pointless.I debated a few seconds between a 2 or 3 rating -- but honesty won out. It's a 2.",Good Time
179,SeaBassEon,Disappointed,3,1 December 2020,"I had high hope but I was also skeptic as I really disliked Uncut Gems from the same director. I was right to be skeptic as this movie left me on my appetite.I can't bash the acting, or the cinematography because they are good. But the scenario is dull and leads nowhere. Sure it gets you interested from the start in knowing what will happen but the thriller aspect faded away around mid-movie. Overall it's more of a familial drama between two brothers than a thriller, which explains the disappointment of many. There's also a lot of focus on Pattinson's character but no arc story or development for him.It's always tough to admit not liking a movie with good ratings, but I didn't enjoy the ride and the whole thing felt flat. It's way better than Uncut Gems though, which I hated.",Good Time
180,sossevarvo,"A thrilling, neon-drenched subterranean madcap odyssey anchored by a superbly nervy Robert Pattinson",8,29 June 2017,"The new feature from the Safdie Brothers, Good Time, is utterly incontrovertible proof of Robert Pattinson's talent. A skilled young actor who broke out young, Pattinson, like his equally skilled former co-star Kristen Stewart, has been plagued by his ""Twilight"" image, and accordingly (and unjustly) derided because of his involvement. The truth is that both Pattinson and Stewart are audacious and feverishly talented young actors, and Good Time will convince all who see it that Robert Pattinson is a fearless and versatile actor. As an ashen-faced, stubble-laden, nervy-eyed criminal thrust into a constantly escalating trip into the recesses of city nightlife, where stakes are always high, Pattinson relishes in the opportunity to inhabit this character and fully realise all his traits. His pretty-boy-image disappears into an expertly assembled composite of agitated mannerisms and a thick Bronx-like brogue. The film excels in its visuals. The Safdies adore neon light, which leads to many memorable neon-drenched sequences, such as an extended sequence in a haunted-house theme park that reels in the tension. Much of the film takes place at night, allowing for some atmospheric, neo-noir vibes to come to the fore. What also must be credited is the unrelenting pace of the film, living up to its cheeky title through constantly escalating stakes, a thunderously exciting electronic score and a plot that keeps throwing delightfully absurd and insane twists to keep you constantly engaged. Good Time been likened a lot to Dog Day Afternoon, Sidney Lumet's taut and incredible bank-heist-gone-wrong film, and it's a comparison that is apt, if a bit flattering; the Safdies come close to matching that film's inspired lunacy and delirious tension, through a decidedly more modern aesthetic. The Safdies directorial style is unique, and I'll be honest it at times got on my nerves. I noticed early on that almost every shot is a close up, often hand-held, which can feel claustrophobic, but also just irritating. That being said, I grew used to the style, and eventually understood its purpose, in buttressing the manic instability of its protagonist, and his morally questionable odyssey. Even so, the style was not always seamless with the narrative. Make sure you don't sit too close to the screen when you watch this film. Good Time is an exciting, pulsating, modernised noir/New Hollywood thriller that deserves a lot of praise for its terrific suspense and Pattinson's bravura turn.",Good Time
181,mdhugs,Grubby excellence,8,17 January 2018,"Pattinson is a revelation in this movie playing the nervy, wide-eyed and sweating Connie who's love for his mentally challenged brother, Nick (played in a deft and touching manner by Benny Safdie), leads him into 24 hours of chaos after 'rescuing' Nick from Peter the Psychiatrist. Connie is no hero despite his good intentions trying to support his brother - sporadic outburst of violence and chronically stupid decisions prevent the viewer feeling much sympathy with him. Rather it is the descent into destruction that we can empathise with - haven't we all had a day where everything we touch turns to garbage? Part way through Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a drunken/drug-addled ex of Nick's to perfection - you can almost smell the booze on her breath .

as for this film, it really didn't feel like my cup of tea. i suppose one of the goals of this movie (to some extent) is to make the audience feel uncomfortable and anxious by making the objectively ""bad"" character the protagonist and by examining his personality and journey, and to subsequently make the viewer think and decide between good or bad.
most of the time, for me to like a movie, i need a character who i can sympathize or even identify with, which (logically) wasn't the case for this one. i really wish i liked this more, but just about everything the characters did made me feel unbelievably uneasy and stressed; and even though it's probably, like i said, what this movie was aiming for, it lessened my enjoyment, and the chilling soundtrack only added to the anxiety-inducing atmosphere.
at the same time, the storyline unfortunately felt somewhat flat to me. the main character obviously has a goal, and i wouldn't go so far as to say that it bored me, but the action and story itself seemed extremely monotonous to me. again, although this might be one of the purposes of this movie, to highlight just how stuck connie is and how far he's willing to go, it didn't do it for me.
what i did like though were ALL of the performances, and the beautiful contrast and connection between the intriguing opening and sobering closing scene. and there were a few scenes where the cinematography and blocking really stood out to me!",Good Time

His performance, along with the directors ability to capture some type of cool neon lighting shades in all of the camera shots along with a pulsating, electronic score, are the best parts of the movie. I don't know what exactly I found 'low-production' but this isn't a polished movie at all. It works though, as the movie starts right away and never stops and it all adds to the grittiness.

193,jsph_calabrese,"""Good Time"" indeed",10,12 July 2018,"The emphatic entrance of Robert Pattinson's character minutes into the movie signaled two things:1. The former Twilight actor is not messing around in an attempt to reinvent himself from the pretty boy typecast. Pattinson delivers the best performance of 2017 as the gritty anti-hero Connie, and you get the feeling this entrance will one day be remembered as the pivotal moment of his career.2. The title of this heist thriller is no misnomer. From this moment on, we are flung into an unrelenting adrenaline ride that hasn't felt so exhilarating since 2015's Fury Road.It's hard not to recall the late film critic Manny Farber's coined term ""Termite Art"" when describing the dramatic depth here. Farber argued that true glory of American cinema is not found in high-minded message pictures like To Kill a Mockingbird or Schindler's List, but rather in B-movies and genre pictures where the artistry is hidden within the entertainment. Good Time provides thorough entertainment throughout, but it also stays in your mind long past viewing, with little termites eating at you with questions regarding the American handling of penal system, poverty, privilege, and mental health. The overarching theme of the movie is destructive love, and above all begs the question, can you truly love someone despite not having the right kind of love to give them?",Good Time
194,raphaellecat,a twisted odyssey,10,29 March 2019,"Robert Pattinson has steered very clear from his Twilight years to give us an impressive resumé of independent films that have scrubbed off his Cullen brand and moulded him into a compelling actor. The Safdie Brother's Good Time is but a testament to his ability, giving us what could be his best performance yet.
Two brothers, Connie and Nick Nikas, attempt at a bank robbery but fail and Nick lands in jail. This sets Connie to embark on a desperate and dangerous journey to get his brother out. What seems like a simple premise, quickly descends into a twisted odyssey, offering more than just a casual heist-gone-wrong flick.Pattinson stuns as Connie Nikas with an approach to the character that will make you ponder on his motivations and lead you to question what he will do next. This is far from anything he has done prior, Connie is unsympathetic, desperate and immoral as he evades the ludicrous situations he finds himself in with but a tinge of luck. The other characters, played splendidly by mostly newcomers, paint a picture of debauchery and excess for New York's underworld, forever maintaining a true level of authenticity that often feels part- 70s arthouse and part- contemporary anthemic.A large fraction of the success of Good Time is thanks to masterful direction by Benny Safdie and Josh Safdie and a consistently stellar performance from Robert Pattinson. A sleeper hit for 2017, all the more reason to watch it.",Good Time

196,moodorf,Characters and plot points that don't make any sense,5,9 April 2020,"I tried to like this movie but I found it pretty underwhelming, largely because of the highly implausible events of the first act.So Pattinson's character brings his mentally-challenged brother with him to a bank robbery....which no bank robber ever would ever do. Then shockingly it doesn't go well and his brother is arrested. Pattinson can't come up with the money to bail his brother out, so a few scenes later he casually walks into a hospital where his brother is being hospitalized after being beaten up in jail, sits down and talks to a healthcare professional who straight up tells him where the prisoners are kept in the building....which would never happen, that type of information is privileged.
Then Pattinson waits until the cop outside his brother's hospital room goes to the vending machines for a coffee and gets him into a wheelchair and gets him out of the room. By the way.....the cop would never just leave a criminal unsupervised like that. So, again.....that wouldn't happen.
It gets better, then Pattinson wheels his brother right out the front of the Hospital--still dressed in a gown and unconscious--without anyone questioning them. Ask yourself, reader, this: have you ever seen anyone discharged from the hospital in a hospital gown? Did the cop at the front desk, and yes there is one at the front desk, get kicked off the force for incompetence?
So then him and his brother get on a bus and leave the hospital grounds. They find themselves asking a woman and her daughter if they can come in to use her phone. It's implied that Pattinson has met this woman before albeit briefly, but still she lets this person right into her house without question. Then when Pattinson says he's going to have to wait in a Dunkin Donuts for a ride this woman who barely knows him gives him a room to stay in in her house. Yes! That's a great idea! Give a near-stranger who shows up at night to your doorstep a room in your house! What is happening in this movie!? Am I on drugs or is everyone in this movie a moron??
Later Pattinson beats up a security guard, frames him as a trespasser while dressed in the guard's clothes and then decides (after the cops take said security guard away) that a great place to hide would be the security guard's house. Y'know, one of the first places cops would look if they knew someone had taken someone's house keys.I could go on and on about the nonsense in this movie but I'll just stop it here. For the record, I'm not saying that I can't suspend my disbelief when it comes to watching movies. I can watch movies where there's some plot holes or have sort of ridiculous premise or where there's fantastical coincidences occurring and stuff like that. But with this movie the people who wrote the script use plot holes to ADVANCE THE MOVIE ALONG because they couldn't think of logical ways to.5/10",Good Time
197,anishchari,"A dark, dreary film bereft of light and hope",5,16 June 2018,"Good Time is a movie about awful people doing awful things and you hope awful things happen to them. There are few redeeming characters in the movie and the ones that exist have awful things happen to them. At times their imbecility is humorous, but much of it is agonizing.It's a low budget spastic movie, but the story is basic: An incompetent bank robber tries to steal/con/borrow $10,000 to bail his brother out of jail over the course of a day/night. He makes a series of terrible decisions (both practically and morally) to come up with the money, and all the while you'll be hoping he gets what he deserves.That may be Good Times biggest strength; making a protagnoist so unlikable but still so human. You're not rooting for the guy, but he's not a caricature either. I knew nothing about Robert Pattison other than his infamous Twilight role, but he performs well here.

211,lucasacosta,Una obra maestra del submundo,10,19 December 2018,"Good Time es una de esas muchas películas que pasan desapercibidas, pero que definitivamente serán consideradas grandes obras maestras en el futuro. De qué manera, fácil, cuando sus directores, los hermanos Safdie, reciban el reconocimiento que merecen porque seguramente estamos hablando de algunos de los grandes nombres del futuro cine (junto con varios otros, como Xavier Dolan). Particularmente, en Good Time vemos un excepcional trabajo de Dirección, marcado por su estilo de realización de Guerrilla que, aunque a veces distrae (dado el riesgo de usar a los transeúntes como extras), es una prueba del amor por el cine y el deseo de aprovechar al máximo esa pasión. Cualquiera diría que sus debilidades recaen en su impredecible guión y que se traduce en situaciones convenientes y aleatorias, algo que, lamentablemente, se adapta a varios agujeros de la trama, pero que viéndolo de otra manera, se traduce como un estilo narrativo caótico y muy realista (incluso cuando varios momentos de la película no lo son, o se sienten tremendamente convenientes). Esto, porque cuando se combina con interpretaciones creíbles (y la precisa actuación de Robert Pattinson, fácilmente el mejor de su carrera hasta el momento), una fotografía llena de luces y sombras (que realza el realismo nocturno que se pretende transmitir) y un montaje intenso en los momentos correctos, pero precisamente modesto en otros, da como resultado un thriller que narra una aventura que podría estar sucediendo fácilmente en este momento, en cualquier parte del mundo, pero hecha con pasión extrema y una fuerte intención de ser vista por parte de los hermanos Safdie.

There are a few unique shots that bring a surreal aspect to the film, such as a chase with Pattinson's character being filmed from the apartment balcony.The music is a bit annoying at times because of its chaotic tone, but I suppose that it's intentional considering the plot.Overall it felt like a day in the life of a petty, sloppy, at times clever criminal who is improvising every one of his next moves.

I found many comparing the level of stress and fast paced development in the later movie to this one, so I was excited to recreate the Uncut Gems experience and gave it a shot. Not only I was disappointing by the lack of any similarity between the two movies, I have also found this movie to be meaningless, boring, and fragmented.Throughout the movie, the protagonist seems like a perfect crap who exploits innocent people, selfish to a provocative level, and neither his motives nor his development held anything for a spectator to be sympathetic to him. As a starter, he took his mentally challenged brother to a bank robbery ,for real, left him in the dust for the cops while he ran like a coward. He then went to exploit his wealthy lover for her mother's credit card to ""get out"" his brother (who he has just left behind), etc, etc.All these things could be acceptable for an average story line/character, but what got me really off was that scene at the black lady house. After she offered this a**hole a phone, a room, and even a TV, he went like a pervert to semi-rape her 16 years old grand daughter, who didn't seem to give consent, in a tremendously disgusting scene! For real, what message was that supposed to deliver? It is even more hilarious that later, he put this child in deep trouble just to save himself.The only three stars I gave for this work were for direction and cinematography, which I found pretty decent and showed a subtle vibe from Uncut Gems, but not much.

220,Zakliz477,"Unsettling, Unwavering, Electrifying",10,12 August 2017,"Good Time is an unrelenting edge of your seat thriller, that demonstrates the Safdie brothers mastery of both social realism and genre filmmaking. This film uses a b movie set up to hammer home an emotionally riveting story ladened with social commentary. The story is that of Connie a low level criminal who finds himself in increasingly desperate circumstances trying to free his brother whose taken the fall for a crime conceived by Connie. The brilliance of this film stems from the Safdie brothers no hold bars gorilla direction, and Robert Pattinson's powerful central performance. The direction of this film is energetic and eerie, with much of the film made using real locations and non professional actors. This makes the films various twists and turns palpably plausible. For example at one point the characters end up in a Dominos Pizza, desperate to hide. This moment comes off as entirely realistic and earned, where as in another movie it would come off as contrived. But by far the best aspect of this movie is Pattinson's central performance as Connie. Pattinson has taken a lot of flack over the years for his role in the Twilight films, but Good Time cements him not only as capable actor, but among the best working today. Seriously he's Oscar worthy here. All in all Good Time is film that shows the blossoming of both a pair of great new directors, and an actor fully realizing his craft.",Good Time
221,sampsatoivonen,Interesting journey,7,1 August 2021,"Very interesting movie. It has this unique feel to it that is hard to explain.

We can obviously assume that the damned is Robert Pattinson's character (Connie) and the pure is Benny Safdie's (Nick), but throught the movie we see how the tables turn, how Connie's intention of getting Nick out of the jail is something really pure and by trying it his problems get bigger and bigger throught every minute of the movie, but I dont see him worried about himself for even a second. And how Nick, the pure, is also damned by his condition, like in the scene where he is at the police station and want to watch another channel in the communitary TV but gets beaten up by other incels, cause they think he is being cocky.",Good Time

After all, stuff like that is totally subjective; I could say that about any movie and it technically shouldn't ruin anything. Anyway, the 80s music score and high paced high anxiety feel reminds me a lot of Adam Sandler's latest movie, Uncut Gems, which I thought was surprisingly good. Pattinson's acting is great in this, and the events really do keep me enthralled and intrigued to see what happens next, but alas, as I've already said it had a very disappointing and unsatisfying ending in my humble opinion. This is one that I don't think I'll ever watch again, regardless of the fact that I enjoyed the first 95% of it for the most part.",Good Time

The Safdie's bring their (quickly becoming) signature style which leaves you mesmerised as much as horrified. The light and music give their work a 'fever dream' quality that complements the slight surrealness of the subject matter. Pattinson is outstanding...anyone who hasn't seen any of his work since Twilight is missing out on one of this generations finest actors. The supporting cast, though largely unknown, are also excellent, including Benny Safdie himself. I will admit that I found it a little slow at the beginning, but by the midpoint I was as engrossed as with any film I have watched this year.

229,Chrispy_808,Frantic and nail-biting,7,14 September 2020,"Good Time is a frantic movie about a bad guy who's situation and decisions go from bad to worse. After a bank heist goes wrong, he works to get his mentally-handicapped brother out of prison.The movie is very tense and moves very quickly. Plot twists happen quite often and very quickly, always keeping you at the edge of your seat. Because of this fast pace, there's a tensity to the movie that doesn't ever seem to let up. Even sequences that are slower still have that tensity because you don't know what is going to happen next.The movie closely follows on Connie, played by Robert Pattinson. Pattinson really delivers a stellar performance here, and is front and center for the entire movie. Connie is a pretty bad guy, taking advantage of others all the time and using sympathy and a little bit of charisma to do so. You see glimpses of humanity though within him, small moments that make you sympathize with him and his situation, twisting that sympathy very quickly to make you question how you feel about him yourself. This character and performance are definitely the strongest part of the movie.The camera work feels handheld and can be pretty shaky. In some scenes this works well to build tension and lend itself to the frantic pace, as well as give the movie a more intimate feel. The scenes also had a lot of neon in them, giving a neo-noir feel to them. The synth-heavy soundtrack was pretty great, also adding to the tension and colorful atmosphere. The movie uses color very well, but I think the shaky cam did get in the way of that a bit.There was a couple decisions I didn't care for. The big one was that I felt the movie ended abruptly. It's so nail-bitingly fast and frantic, I felt like it was building to something bigger. The cops are on Connie's tail the whole time, but since you follow him so closely it's hard to tell how hidden he is. They just all show up in force at the end, put him away and that's the end of the movie. It's a twist I didn't expect, but it just seemed to abrupt for me. The other was the credits ran for too long and come in oddly too late in the movie. Since they're in the center of the screen its too distracting.Overall, I liked Good Time quite a bit and would definitely recommend it. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Robert Pattinson keeps your attention the whole movie and you find yourself rooting for someone you really don't like. The world is realistic and gritty, but the neon-drenched atmosphere really give it a cool vibe. There's a few problems that stuck out to me, and I wouldn't say this is a modern classic by any means, but I had a 'Good Time' watching it.",Good Time
230,macmichaelomalley,Morally Grey and Atmouspheric,8,21 September 2020,"Pattinson is great, amazin that they've somehow managed to make him not handsome. The whole movie reeks of his desperation and escalation in trying get enough money to help out his brother, causing him to get more and more reckless. The host of supporting characters are really interesting too and feel fleshed out.",Good Time
231,LuSachs,Intensity of the highest order.,8,22 September 2021,"Without sounding cliché, Good Time delivers some mighty 'edge of your seat' drama. Robert Pattison (as Connie) brings an utterly chaotic performance; he takes you on a journey through intense scenarios which could only be compared to one of those weird, slightly troubling dreams you've likely had. The screenplay element alone ranks highly amongst every film I have seen, it is one twist after another with each one stranger than the last.The story centres around Connie (Robert Pattison), and his relentless journey throughout New York, all to do what he thinks is best for his mentally ill, younger brother. The whole film feels like a whimsical and troubling psychedelic trip, it will leave you laughing at its absurdity one minute, then perplexed by an unexpected twist the next. It's the little things too... when Connie appears for the first time, you'll notice that satisfying 'quick zoom-in close up' camera play. Towards the end there is a lovely shot from very high up which you should appreciate as something very different to a lot of newer films.This modern day, 'film-noir' future classic will give you a different cinematic experience compared to most newer films, the camera work is absolutely flawless, storyline is impeccable, the acting is very good, then it's all topped-off with a brilliant directorial performance from Benny and Josh Safdie.",Good Time

The movie starts off fast, and grabs your attention. A very odd series of events will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie too. The disappointing part didn't happen until the end for me. It was like
GO!GO! GO! (For an hour) and then ""aw. Wtf just happened?! It's over!! That's CRAP!""The end just has zero closure to it, and it's ceerainly not a happy ending.

It's jangly, the soundtrack jarring, but the scripts is at turns irony-soaked black comedy, neon noir, and unflinching in character portrayal.

The process in which the movie is directed, scripted, and casted further develops it's ability to involve the viewer in the ambitious circumstances ""Good Time"" is constantly throwing at it's audience.

Robert Pattison impressed me with his acting here. Admittedly I have only seen him in Twilight, not my type of movie and I didn't care for his acting in it. When I heard he was going to be batman I rolled my eyes. Then I saw him here. He proves that he does have acting ability, as a matter of fact he could very well be an actor on his way to hollywood elitism.
He plays a manic criminal in this movie who commits a crime with his mentally disabled brother. His brother is caught and he spends the movie trying to get his brother out.
He played the character perfect. The character is a criminal, not a good man but his love for his brother is genuine and the writing and the acting pulled it off.",Good Time
242,RayCarney_47,"An unoriginal premise, but a paragon of unpredictability",9,27 May 2020,"I was not excited to see this film and would likely not have watched it if not for the directors, whose earlier works I had seen and admired. However, they had previously made small-budget indie films, so this one had me thinking they had sold out, making a bigger Hollywood-type movie with Robert Pattinson.I will say I have never been a fan of Pattinson, although I am more of one now after seeing this film. And this film was completely different from anything the Safdie brothers had made previously.It's a story about two brothers who rob a bank. Each of them has his own personal weaknesses, but they care deeply about each other. The robbery itself takes place early in the film, and what happens after that is anyone's guess.It is a jarring ride and we never know where it will take us. The filmmakers apparently didn't even know, as I later learned, going back and adding new scenes later on to change the course of the film.And that is the film's genius. If someone were to rob a bank in real life, they would hope to get away with it, but any ensuing chase and where it would lead them would be anyone's guess. All too often these days, films follow the same basic pattern and are all too predictable. Here, however, we get to just enjoy the unpredictable nature of a chaotic situation in which these characters find themselves.That is truly the one thing that makes this film so good. Unpredictability is so rare in films these days, especially when it's the sort of film that we think we've seen a thousand times. But rest assured this is not just another bank robbery film. It is a film like none you have ever seen before, and you'll have no idea where the story will take you.For that reason, I doubt the film will have much rewatchability. A second viewing, when the viewer already knows exactly what will happen, will only reveal the fact that the one thing this film has going for it is the fact that you don't know what's going to happen next. However, it does that one things so very well that it could still be considered a masterpiece, and for a first time viewer you can't get any better than this.Thanks for reading!",Good Time

244,jasgeo,Great but. . . .,7,3 November 2017,"But I confess to quitting this movie just shy of the halfway point because I found it too depressing & disturbing to watch. Maybe I made a bad call and am wrong about the likelihood that the battlers will lose in most ways possible (except perhaps their affection and trust for each other) but because this movie was well made & realistically scripted I became drawn into the story, so I decided that the odds were not great that I was likely to see anything 'uplifting'.Another day, a different mood maybeThere is a reason successful heist movies are box office catnip and it isn't that we're all closet thieves. I reckon it is because in most versions of this trope the story's predication is unrealistic, the audience views a tale set in an alternate reality where normal decent people can win. Win at the expense of the greedies who normally defeat us.So since ""Good Time"" as a heist movie handicapped by reality, appeared unlikely to do more than heighten an already well developed sense of injustice, I quit as I'm not an adherent of the ""just face reality"" as a carrot for revolution.",Good Time
245,Matt_Corkhill,Fremdscham - embarrassment at another's misfortune,10,30 May 2020,"What a sour treat this film was.A special kind of spectacle, a delightfully reductive series of unfortunate events. Take the most unpalatable option on the decision tree, let the tree spit in your mouth, repeat, continue until forcibly stopped. Not a car crash, which implies sudden tragedy intervening banal routine - more like finding a roller coaster in malignant disrepair, then choosing to ride it over and over until the inevitable happens.We open to find the developmentally impaired Nick - played by Benny Safdie, the co-director of the film - pressured by his brother Connie - the protagonist, played by Robert Pattinson - into what appears to be a relatively benign bank heist, which of course goes wrong.The pair is separated, and for the rest of the film Connie tries to find his brother.What follows next is a painfully prolonged red brown flush down a truck stop toilet. If you twisted my arm I'd call it a sublime rendition of fatalistic misanthropy; one man's descent into a violently deep jungle trap of his own making, dragging in with him as many others as he can.Are these other people collateral damage or are they white noise? The secondary gas to his violent chemical reaction.Benny Safdie plays an impressive acting role in this film, but the true star is Robert Pattinson with a sublime performance. What made it so commanding was that, like Uncut Gems, it perfectly captured free will permeating each poor decision - a conscious choice to embrace flagrant risk - and yet we're left with this odd sense of sympathy as though the free will is just an illusion, the body is a subjugated victim of a deep and despotic blackness.Schadenfreude means pleasure derived by someone from another's misfortune. Fremdscham - probably the most opposite concept - means embarrassment at another's misfortune, and I think if you had to summarise this film in one word, that would be it.",Good Time

Grabbing you collar with both fists and dragging you along, Pattison delivers a solid performance while the viewer struggles to keep up.Blindingly bright neon visuals with a thumping electronic score fit this film like a glove, but I feel as if Pattinson did as much as he could with what the script gave his character.

Throughout the entirety of the film, you are emerged and invested completely in the characters and the story. The music is fantastic as well. It consists of synth type of music as well as a song with a piano that I fell in love with. The only problem I have with the film is the fact that there was a character who felt unnecessary.

251,bryanhchu,A fantastically profane exploration of the lowest places in society,8,26 January 2018,"Good Time is a dark and twisted film that does what it set out to do perfectly, but may not be for everybody. The movie opens with Conny Nikas (Robert Pattinson) and his mentally disabled brother robbing a store, but when the situation turns south and his brother ends up in jail, he very desperately and very illegally struggles to clean up his mess. Every choice made during the production of the film, every character trait, every line of dialogue, every camera angle, and every piece of music combine to form a dirty, trashy feeling that resonates throughout the movie and is very necessary for the story to work as well as it did. The cinematography leans much heavier on the extreme close-up side than most films would dare. The frames are filled with harshly contrasting colors that perfectly illustrate why cinematography doesn't have to be pretty to be good. All these choices make the movie slightly uncomfortable to watch from a purely aesthetic standpoint, which is exactly what they were going for. The acting performances are all very good, with Robert Pattinson doing everything he can to redeem himself from the Twilight movies. With the exception of one character, pretty much everyone in this movie is a bad person, including the protagonist, but despite that, the audience is rooting for him the whole way through. This film serves as a fantastically profane exploration of the lowest places in society, as well as a modern day retelling of John Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men"", and it perfectly communicates the feeling that it set out to create.",Good Time
252,frankparnell,"Dark, tense and a utterly riveting game of cat and mouse",8,16 July 2019,"Every few months a film comes out that really grabs my attention as a film lover. A film that isn't a blockbuster, like an Avengers or a Star Wars dominating box office earnings and the hype train of audiences, but a film that is interesting in it's presentation and execution, Good Time is such a movie. Good Time is directed by Bennie Safdie and Josh Safdie and stars Robbert Pattinson in the lead role as bank robber Connie Nikas who, after ongoing pressures from his personal family life is forced into a guardian position caring for his physically handicapped younger brother played by the films co-director Bennie Safdie. After a bank robbery job goes awry however Connie's brother Nicolas becomes incarcerate leading Connie to desperately attempt to make up the money to bail him out.Firstly where this film truly excels is in its performances. After seeing her supporting role in The Hateful Eight (2015) and Annihilation (2018), Jennifer Jason Leigh delivers a devastating performance playing a close friend of Pattinsons darker character. She truly excels as a woman who is pressured by her family also but also conflicted by her loyalty to the people she cares for. I only wish she was given a more substantial role with more screen time as she was prominent in the first act, after however she is no longer focused on. Bennie Duress co-stars as the despicable ""villain"" type character, causing issues for the protagonist character of Nikas, although only being a character to push the film though its 3rd act he truly delivers a role that'll leave audiences seething with tension. Bennie Safdie excels as Nicolas Nikas, the handicapped younger brother, similar to Jason Leigh's character's leading complaint, my only problem is the film doesn't give him enough screen time to truly grow, with potential to detail the devastating way illness can effect and damage a family. The first act saw this character grow, building the main structure and emotional pull of the entire movie, however by mid act two he falls by the way side to focus or the leading characters. However, the main acting praise must go to Robert Pattinson who delivers what could be the best work that I may have ever seen from him. Although being a standout in both Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire (2005) and the best thing to come from the Twilight franchise (2008-2012) in my opinion, in this he truly delivers a role that is both complex and devastating, and truly makes the audience question his motives and justifies his actions, however despicable, with his performance elevating the second and third acts.The way the film is edited and directed is also truly interesting. The Safdie brothers' use of colour, their use of using dark colours contrasting with bright colours is so interesting to anyone who is intrested in the making of films and the rising number of low budget films being made by up and coming directors. With a budget of $4.5 million a relatively unknown cast and unknown to mainstream audiences I believe this film is also boosted by its 99 minute run time, giving tbe film a sense of urgency and quick paced intensity whilst also not feeling rushed and not plot points not being explored thoroughly enough. Saying that however I do believe perhaps 15 extra minutes could've been added to flesh out characters such as Corey Ellman (Jason Leigh) and also Nicolas (Safdie), with the fast paced nature of the film I do believe this change wouldn't hinder the overall experience of the film for audience members.Overall Good Time isn't a perfect film, if there is such a thing, it abandons plot point with potential mainly to flesh out pattinsons leading character, which on the other hand is one of the main highlights of the entire movie. Pattinson leading role is a mesmerising and devastating look into desperation and how far someone would go for the ones they love. The action sequences are wonderfully directed as well as the smaller, character driven moments. And for that reason it's gains a recommendation from me and is should entertain casual movie viewers as well as people interested in these smaller, low budget movies created by lesser known directors. Bennie Safdie and Josh Safdie as directors knock it out of the park with this effort and I am genuinely intrested in what comes after this from them.",Good Time

The constant claustrophobic cinematography help maintain an atmosphere of panic and stress, especially combined with the frenetic movement of the camera. This mirrors how from the very beginning the two main characters are constantly in trouble and on the run, trying to quickly figure out what the best next move is. It's very engaging and does a great job of drawing you in.Robert Pattinson gives one of the best performances I've seen all year. He does an excellent job of completely buying into this character and consequently he's essentially unrecognizable. Performances on the whole are very solid, with Benny Safdie and Taliah Webster as other particular standouts.The music is also very well done. It's very unique and its constantly loud and pounding vibes help echo that same sense of worry and stress that the characters face.The movie certainly isn't without fault. There are several scenes where the characters are able to escape certain situations a bit too easily or certain events in the plot don't quite make sense.

Robert Pattinson is phenomenal as the loving, desperate, single-minded brother; Bennie Safdie is amazing: volatile, unpredictable, dangerous; the smallest roles are perfectly cast - to mention just a few, Taliah Webster as Crystal, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Corey, Barkhad Abdi as Dash the Park Security Guard, Necro in a dynamite performance as Caliph, and Souleymane Sy Savane as the African Cab Driver. Of special note, in a bit of inspired casting, Eric the Bail Bondsman was played by a real bail bondsman, Eric Paykert, cold, detached, bored, and uninvolved.

262,charlesliulv,Indeed A Good Time,9,12 May 2020,"A sweat (and LSD) drenched caper through the grimy underbelly of midnight New York, told through a barrage of close-ups and zoom-ins by a constantly moving camera - the occasional aerial tracking shot serving not to alleviate the tension, but to heighten it as we watch from overhead our protagonist and his unwilling cronies drive at dangerously fast speeds to their next ill-fated escapade. The characters Connie encounters initially seem to have surface-level, albeit distinct, personalities, but become fleshed-out through their decisions and interactions with Connie. The 80s-themed synth music perfectly complements the characters' neon-lit surroundings, and nearly every scene is imbued with a sense of urgency. The heart of the story does become lost somewhere among the escapes, betrayals and chases (""I'm doing this for my mentally-disabled brother"" can only take you so far), but it makes a heartrending return in a final scene that reaffirms the directors' understanding and compassion for the characters they have created.",Good Time

266,Cfoudyrun,The most underrated film of 2017.,10,2 May 2018,"It is truly a disappointment that ""Good Time"" hasn't gotten more recognition, as it was my favorite movie of last year. I saw it in theaters last winter and then recently bought it on Blu-ray and re-watched it. It is even better the 2nd time around. 
""Good Time"" is a character-study, a heist film and it is a gritty odyssey across Queens all wrapped into one. And while all these elements are played completely straight, there are incredibly dark comedy moments sprinkled throughout. Somehow, in the midst of all these insane actions taking place, this film still has a heart at the center of it.
All the performances were fantastic, and all technical aspects were on point. However it seems as though this Safdie brothers project was completely overlooked. Still no love for small films with no backing by a giant major studio. Maybe if it were directed by Ron Howard and starred Matt Damon, it could've gotten a couple of award nods. But on that same note, the movie would've had no heart, no soul and no vision behind it.
If for some strange reason the directors were to read this review, I would just ask one thing: PLEASE DO NOT SELL OUT! Hollywood has a habit of taking independent film makers and then have them direct blockbusters (with highly variying success). Would I blame you if you did? No, I can't say that I would. But you two are among the best in filmmaking right now, and I cannot wait to see what project you have cooking next (sans superheroes, Star Wars or dinosaurs preferred).",Good Time

270,steelhammermolly,Frustrating in the best way,8,3 September 2017,"Robert Pattinson is pure perfection like you've never seen him before. Connie (Pattinson) is so hard to watch as he makes wrong decision after wrong decision. His demeanor and how he uses others makes you sick. He is an awful human being. But, he loves his special needs brother Nick (Safdie), to the end of their world. All of Connie's terrible decisions and horrific predicaments are in the pursuit of making his brother's dreams come true. Connie thinks he's doing what is best for Nick, but is completely deaf to other (professional) opinions. The whole movie focusing on such terrible situations made me want to walk out of the theater, but boy am I glad I didn't. The end is pure symphonious revelation. The conclusion is satisfyingly melancholy. About an hour 20 into this movie, I don't think I would've written the recommendation I'm about to write. This is an absolute must see. Everyone needs to explore such a truly human concept: He's doing all the wrong things, for the right reason. This film calls out your instincts in judging Connie by his hate-ability, when we all could essentially be him when backed into a corner. This film shows the darkest side of doing anything for the ones you love but also toys with the idea of redemption through sacrifice. If you want to be existentially shaken, this film is a bulls-eye. I could go on, but to keep this brief, anyone who likes to think on and explore their emotional biases absolutely needs to experience this story.",Good Time

In fact, I decided to watch it a second time just two days after my first viewing. I don't hesitate to say that this is my absolute favorite movie of the year. This was my first Safdie Brothers film, and it was brilliantly done.Good Time delivered a very engaging and nail-biting story line. The camera work and background music was so well done that it effectively slowed and quickened the pace when (I'm speculating) it was needed. Robert Pattinson took this role to a whole new level, and he has never failed to impress me with his acting.Essentially, you're enveloped in a neon world with characters that are nothing short of real. Words can't describe the flurry of emotions that rushed through me. The story itself is so raw and harsh, and as you watch, every obstacle the main character encounters snowballs, and every single time, it's a thrill. Needless to say, it will never allow you to feel bored, leaving you wishing there was more to it. I believe though, that that's the beautiful thing about this movie. For anyone who might say that this movie was too spontaneous or confusing, I believe you missed the fact that this movies emulates life as it is.

This is something they did especially well in Uncut Gems, but whereas in that movie you're sitting on the edge of your seat, and hating every single character on screen, Good Time does something slightly different.Even though you still hate a lot of the characters there's a special bond between Robert Pattinson's character, and his mentally handicapped brother played by Benny Safdie. It's clear from the very beginning that Pattinson's character cares a lot about Safdie's character. This causes a strange dynamic where Pattinson's immoral morals get them into a lot of trouble, and it's clear throughout the whole thing that he sets his brother's well-being very high.Pattinson's morals are something that haunts him throughout the whole film. Every decision made makes you angry, or disappointed. This is what makes you anxious, this is what makes this movie exciting. The and the masterful cinematography and sound design of course add to the anxiety as well, all of which are extenuated in Uncut Gems where there is no mentally handicapped brother, to keep the main character's morals excused.Overall I'd say this thrilling film is a great character study showing brotherly love in a very messed up, and real way.",Good Time

8/10
Good Time's attraction is the intriguing plot and it doesn't fail to hold you for the run time. The dialogue feels authentic and the protagonist's reasons for his actions are totally believable.This film has a decent amount of curve balls to throw at the viewer that you won't see coming. The tense moments of suspense in this film are well earned and heightened by its great score. This film is shot very well for the most part. It is heavily reliant on close ups and handheld, however, similar to the Bourne films, it has a couple of well placed wides to give you a sense of the layout.The acting is just as good as the script, if not better. Robert Pattinson shows some great subtlety in his acting here. The interactions he has with his brother as opposed to the other characters really brings the character to life. Benny Safdie gave a very real performance as a mentally challenged character and most importantly, he didn't over sell the character and make it a stereotype. He managed to give genuine emotion to the character whilst acting mentally challenged which could've been done bad many different ways.The directing was a mixed bag, for the most part it was done well with its use of handheld and close ups but it did overstay its welcome in a couple of scenes. some of the scenes inside a house were too close and felt a little claustrophobic. The few transitional scenes in this film were a big let down for me and felt a bit uninspiring and amateur. with the wide shots of cars traveling from point A to point B and the score playing over them felt uninteresting and lazy especially given the unique aesthetic of the rest of the film.The cinematography was very good overall, with its use of colours and light giving the world a very lived in gritty Neo-Noir look. However, the were a couple of times the colour and lighting went too drastic. especially in the house scenes. When it works, it adds a visually distinct style to the film that is very memorable.All and all this film is a great film, it has a great story, with fantastic acting and is well directed. if you haven't seen it yet. I recommend it highly..",Good Time

Not dissimilar to films like 25th Hour or Collateral, we get to see one crazy night in the lead character's life. This wild night, ultimately leads to a feeling of ""wow did that just happen?"" like coming down the morning after a raging party.The characters here are all flawed and while you feel for them at times, none of them are great people (aside from maybe the handicapped brother who is pulled into all of this).

Props to Pattinson for his convincing and polished portrayal - he truly proved himself here. Benny Safdie as ""Nick"" and Jennifer Jason Leigh as ""Corey"" are commendable in their own depictions.But don't incorrectly pigeonhole Good Times as a bank heist movie. Sure, there's a bank heist and plenty of crime, but moreover it's a depiction of a criminal's desperation and disregard for consequence. Put simply, it's a wild ride with a blindfold on.The cinematography and framing is great. The incorporation of close ups immerse you in each character's frustrations.

The paint by numbers formula of following a hero through a series of tribulations to see him ultimately defeat the bad guy and get the girl is beyond trite at this point in my experience. I appreciated how this film does very little moralizing to it's audience and instead opts to show just how gritty and sleazy the underworld of petty crime can be.I have to give praise to the filmmakers whom I assume had a low budget to make this as they more than make up for it in style, ambience and a well crafter story.
The performance by Robert Pattinson is above and beyond what I would of expected to him given what he's most known for. I now consider him a a rising talent in the industry. The rest of the cast are unknown but all do fantastic work and should get bigger roles moving forward judging by their performances in this film.Overall what I appreciated most about this film was it's world building. They make you feel as if you're getting some insight into what your life would be had you made a chain of consecutive bad decisions. As I stated earlier, this film does absolutely no moralizing, hell sometimes you even find yourself rooting for the criminals, but it also in no way glamorizes the life of a lowly criminal.I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a thrill ride of a film and who isn't all that easily offended or squeamish when it comes to exploring the darker aspects of society.",Good Time

314,Worst-Movie-Ever,Blood is thicker than water.,9,18 November 2017,"Good Time (2017)Cast: Robert Pattinson, Benny Safdie, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Taliah WebsterDirectors: Benny Safdie and Josh SafdieSynopsis: Connie (Robert Pattinson) and his brother Nick (Benny Safdie) botch a bank robbery. Nick gets caught and sent to Rikers Island. Once in prison Nick gets assaulted and sent to the hospital. Connie spends the night risking everything to spring his disabled brother from going back to prison while everything around him spirals out of control.Review: Robert Pattinson proves once again to be one of the most underrated young actors in Hollywood. If all you know of him is Twilight, do yourself a favor and check him out in The Rover and of course Good Time. The directors, brothers Benny and Josh Safdie, pull off an intense night of thrills against the backdrop of New York City. While the synthesizer laden film score by Oneohtrix Point Never, adds a great dynamic to the film. Good Time is in the vein of films like Dog Day Afternoon and Mean Streets. The tone and look of the film is gritty, edgy and makes you feel claustrophobic. You spend the entire time following Connie's schemes as he will do whatever it takes to save his brother. Connie will do anything and will an sacrifice anyone he comes across. Overall, Good Time is a captivating and intense crime thriller that proves blood is thicker than water. 8.7 / 10Runtime: 1h 41m Rated: R",Good Time
315,mr-navy-bean,"Watch it with the sound off, it will make more sense",1,28 August 2017,"One of the worst, laziest, illogical, empty films I have EVER seen. I cannot believe the critics on this. It really makes me think the system is dirty. This is a loud, boring, nonsensical movie. There are plot holes everywhere, long shots of cars driving on the street, loud music, and a laughably (not intentional) sentimental ending. I could (but won't) list all the lazy, sloppy and idiotic choices this movie makes, but I don't blame the filmmakers. I blame the ""film critics"" who can't see the difference between a good movie and a complete waste of time and money. Only A.O. Scott recuses himself.",Good Time

By turns tense, funny, gorgeous, ugly, exhausting, deeply sad and always so real it hurts with a unique sound track to match. Even the minor characters are sharply drawn, and the major ones perfection. It was a good day when the Safdies & Robert Pattinson crossed paths.",Good Time
318,prateekprateek,So so..,6,15 January 2019,The Sadfie brothers have done a great job putting together all the hooks and twists that the narrative demands. However nothing really holds thanks too... drum roll! Robert Pattinson. His character just doesn't seem to hold me. His decisions have nothing clever and he shows complete apathy towards the one person he loves. I would personally have liked to see what his brother's narrative than his instead.,Good Time

Everything is so great.Every single actor is stellar. The best role Robert Pattinson has done, Buddy Duress steals every scene hes in and Benny Safdie plays a very convincing mentally challenged person.The story is something you'll never predict there are so many twist and turns it keeps you guessing how far this character will go.The music compliments the movie so well. I've been listening to it ever since and OPN is an artist who I am going to keep an eye on as well.There's small things that bugged me, but its not something that takes you away from the experience.",Good Time

324,Ninetwo,"Everything but a ""Good Time""",2,12 September 2018,"I had a strange feeling about this movie from the start. From screenshots I knew the camera would be close-up most of the time and the plot summary sounded a bit off-putting. I still gave it a shot since it recieved good reviews.The first act is fine but it goes downhill when you realizie that the main character is unrelatable, unrealistically selfish and one sided. He relies on other people on everything he does and everything he does goes wrong because he is simply to stupid to make smart or creative choices. Even the simple things he messes up.Also his motives are never explained. Is he doing all that because somewhere in his heart he is actually a loving person that cares so much about his poor retarded brother? You hear him saying that, but you never SEE it. All you see him doing is exploiting people by telling his ""poor brother"" story (including the viewer?). He even uses his ""beloved"" brother for a bank robbery because he obviously can't make a living for himself.The only cool thing about him is his died hair, I give you that. He stole the dye from a poor stranger that trusted him when he was in need, though. There is nothing that makes me care about this character. Obvioulsy Robert Pattinson still tries to recover from his Twilight image. Here he tries to be as unlikeable and ugly as it gets. Whatever would happen to him (good or bad) would be fine for me, I lost interest in the story over time, at the last 30 minutes I was completely uninterested.The plot is generally predictable and repetitive.
At the very end I was hoping the get something like a twisted ending that would explain the good reviews. Something like: Mentally challenged Nick actually made up the whole story about his non-existing evil brother and it was all playing in his head. He had the fantasy of a ""cool bank robbery that went wrong"". This way the plotholes and stupid decision would have been explained somehow.
But nope, the story plays out straight.So did I have a ""good time"" watching these 101 minutes?
Not really. The camera most of the time just barley misses to capture enough for me to be invested. At times it feels like they chose the wrong aspect ratio, but I think it's simply bad camera work that didn't know where to go to.
Another aspect that bothered me was all the screaming. Yes I get that you guys have to build tension somehow. But thats so shallow. Every character just screams and swears all the time. Even people who have nothing to do with the story.I am a fan of Jennifer Jason Leigh acting, in this movie you will see her for like 5 minutes. An actual highlight is the kid Crystal though. She was the only relatable character that made me care about what's going on a little. The retarded brother's acting (played by the co-director) was surprisingly good but he doesn't have much screen time anyways.The colors and lightning were interesting as well. Also the synth soundtrack was quite good at times. So it wasnt all bad. But I wouldnt waste my time again.2/10",Good Time
325,andemand25,Perfect late evening movie for outrunners,9,27 October 2020,"What an amazing movie to watch late at night perfect for anyone that loves synth wave and outrun. The soundtrack from Oneohtrix Point Never is the perfect fit for this movie.A movie that keeps you intrigued, immersed and shocked at times showing you a darker side of society in a thought provoking manner.Excellent movie with a great theme, music, cinematographer and characters definitely a must watch.",Good Time
326,istiaqismail,An unfortunate tale.,8,3 November 2018,"Yesterday I had the pleasure to watch this film. I was trying to watch the film at least for 6 months now but didn't have the opportunity but yesterday I finally watched it. I heard a lot of good words about this film and praise for Robert Pattinson. After watching the film I can say that this film is absolutely praiseworthy.So about the movie, the title here is kinda sarcastic actually. Because almost nothing in this story is supposed to be a good for the lead characters. The story revolves around Connie ( Robert Pattinson ) and his mentally challenged brother Nick ( Benny Safdie ) whom he loves very much. After doing a successful robbery in the bank they thought that their good time began but they couldn't have thought that in how many possible way things could go wrong after that. And after the robbery, in any direction he (R) was going things were going out of control, out of hands and situation was becoming more problematic then ever.About the title, it is actually a prison slang. It is used when someone gets their sentence reduced because of their good behavior in the prison. And it suggests that Connie behaved well in prison and that's why he got out early from the prison. But after getting out he again starts to do this and thus his not so Good Time begins.Robert Pattinson gives a very memorable performance as Connie. His character is in stress, tensed about his brother health, worrying about how to arrange money or how to be safe or both at the same time but circumstances never went according to his way. Till today Pattinson's most famous work and also his most mocked work was ""Twilight"". I also remember his bland work in Twilight. But in this film, his character is motivated by the affection for his brother but doesn't care whether it is to good or bad direction. He just need his money and safety for him and his brother. He is desperate, he is needy and the way his expression and whole body language changed while playing the character is just fabulous.Good time also includes some supporting characters like Barkhad Abdi, Buddy Duress who also gives very remarkable performance.The way this films shows the crookedness around us is really wonderful. It also questions the morality of the characters we see on the screen which is kinda a pressure to watch for the audience. Audiences will try to watch the things from his perspective at some point of the movie. The measures he takes to gain that money and the reason behind it really confuses the audiences whether they should support him or not.Good time is a good crime-thriller which begins as a heist then carried out by the lead characters performance and events that happens around them. The direction and the camerawork was good. Some scenes like chasing in the road or the theme park situation were really noteworthy. But people will remember this film for Robert Pattinson's awesome performance.Rating: 8.5/10",Good Time
327,Yeccy,Most underrated movie of 2017.,10,13 November 2018,"This movie is near-perfect. Its uber-fast pacing keeps you engaged, the writing is excellent and realistic, Pattinson is unbelievably good (best actor worthy), its style and visuals are marvelous, and the story is raw and exciting.

335,aliceeveserin,Raw and acted brilliantly,8,29 October 2018,"This felt more like a peek into the lives of those living an unfortunate reality of poverty, drugs and doing what you can to stay afloat in society. It was an uncomfortable watch in the sense that the subject matter is hard hitting and almost too realistic for comfort. You could picture this film playing out in real life sure with some slightly dramatic scenes but overall I think this is what the directors intended.The things that stood out for me were the hard hitting claustrophobic cinematography, absolutely brilliant acting that was rich and well rounded, and an amazing atmospheric soundtrack. My only complaint was that I wanted a little more back story into Connie's character and world the film leaves everything quite impersonal and I know some people will love this about it I felt like I wanted a little more.",Good Time
336,cmruddy,What was enjoyable about that?,2,17 October 2021,"Wow. Usually trust ratings, but there must be a lot of people on acid out there. Trying to think of one redeeming aspect of the main character and am at a loss. I get humanizing the anti-hero. But not every scumbag a writer can devise deserves our empathy or our attention. This story made me realize some people just suck. And so do some movies.",Good Time
337,masondmcfarland,It's really good,10,17 October 2017,"Good Time, written and directed by Benny and Josh Safdie is simply amazing. From the story and neon drenched color palette Good Time is something similar to a sleazy, grimy late night crime stories in the 70's and 80's. But, while the visuals are fantastic to look at the greatest strength Good Time has going for it is the cast. The two brothers, played by director Benny Safdie and Roberts Pattinson are of course the stand outs. The opening scene with Benny's character Nick slowly breaking down into tears is a powerful cold open. Pattinson's erratic Connie is so well acted that you feel Connie's brain going a mile a minute in a effort to help his brother. In the end I would wager money Good Time will be making many, many top ten lists for this year and I can't think of a more deserving movie.",Good Time
338,chiefguns,Good Time,1,4 November 2017,"In all my life I haven't seen such a pathetic production of what they seem to think is a movie of good entertainment. Rookie actors who can't act to save their lives. Pathetic scripting. Total lack of any quality whatsoever. After watching this movie for 10 minutes, I couldn't stomach watching such garbage again. I have approx. 5000 movies and 3000 other films in my collection. I can definitely assure you that this one will be thrown out with the rest of garbage around here. What a waste of money.How much did this movie cost to make. My guess looking at the quality of filming, the actors and production, maybe about $100. Because I wouldn't pay any of those actors based on their pathetic understanding of what a really good actor can achieve. Not even one ""A"" class actor. I have a collection of ""B"" rated movies. Compared to your production, my ""B"" rated movies are high class.Seriously guys, if your going to make a movie, try to come up with something that people can appreciate as good entertainment. Try to find an actor who doesn't think the movie is about him. Trying to act cool on camera is an art, a true talent to get it right. Just look at actors like, ""Tom Hanks"", ""Tom Cruise"", ""Morgan Freeman"". These guys know how to act cool and do it very well. Your people suck.!! Spend a few extra dollars next time and just maybe you may get it right, but I sincerely doubt it looking at the quality of your past work.My Rating is 0.",Good Time

I get that the director wants the audience to feel uncomfortable, but if this film was served in a restaurant it would be a reduction of vinegar and detergent, completely inedible.

The acting, (especially Rob Pattinson's), direction by the Safdie Brothers, and soundtrack all came together to create a masterpiece. It's not a regular type of film, which might be why some people don't enjoy it. It was raw, edgy, and intense. The movie pulls you in and leaves you wondering what to do once its over.

Within minutes you are strapped into this roller coaster ride of emotions and watch a bad trip unfold. Pattinson delivers an electrifying and visceral performance that keep your eyes glued on him trying to anticipate his each and every move. The Safdie Brothers create a gritty and almost utopian like version of New York that's swallows you into this adventurous scandal, filled with unique characters, constant bad luck, and an impacting end. If anything, Good Time is a movie that is definitely worth your time.",Good Time
