0,SnoopyStyle,"""These are not real problems""",6,1 November 2020,Sloane (Emma Roberts) hates being stuck at the kids table during another family Christmas. She meets Jackson (Luke Bracey) at a store return line. They both hate being single on the holidays and decide to be each other's Holidate.There are some good rom-com ideas. The meet-cute is good. It's almost a good rom-com. There are issues with the construction. The stakes are never that high since the ending is always inevitable. It's not all one thing and it's not all down to one person. The actors are fine. The filmmaking is functional. The premise has some problems and the writing is just a little bit off.,Holidate
1,kosmasp,Self Aware,7,27 December 2020,"Yes this movie makes fun of romantic comedies where it is obvious that the two leads will end up together ... come on! What are you trying to do to us? Well still and even though some may find that particular jab at themselves and ""reality"" or fourth wall breaking annoying and irritating, the movie itself can manage to be fun and light entertainment.Yes this is as predictable as any other romantic comedy and it may have the added factor that some viewers may feel even sadder in Lockdown (dependingon where they are and if they are actually alone) ... but try to take it with a pinch of salt! Like the main male character does! Emma Roberts obviously is telling him ""you ain't a Ryan Reynolds"" ... otherwise I'd be on you.Talking about on you, the movie is quite crude in places, while it never is explicit visually (we don't see oral pleasure for example but we know it happens - and not just because it is later acknowledged in a very crude manner verbally). So if you are easily offended ... maybe this isn't for you. Anyone else who has used swear words probably will fall in love ... no pun intended",Holidate
2,phd_travel,Refreshing change a grown up Christmas comedy,6,28 December 2020,After all the cookie cutter Hallmark and Lifetime Christmas movies this one is a nice change. It is often funny with good one liners now and then and has some grown up jokes. It doesn't get too painful surprisingly. Good Supporting cast like Kristin Chenoweth and Frances Fisher. above the average standard. Emma has the right attitude. Luke Bracey and her click well.,Holidate
3,Thanos_Alfie,Average...,4,30 November 2020,"""Holidate"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch a young woman and a young man tired of being single during holidays agree on being each other's dates. They agree that they won't be friends with benefits and their relationship will be strictly platonic.I have to admit that since I did not have high expectations from this movie I was not disappointed by it. Even if you are a fan of romantic movies I believe that you would want something more or at least you would expect more from this movie. The interpretations of both Emma Roberts who played as Sloane and Luke Bracey who played as Jackson were average. Finally, I have to say that ""Holidate"" is an average movie with a simple plot that if you don't have high expectations from it you might enjoy it too.",Holidate
4,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,7,28 December 2020,"Holidate is exactly what one should expect: a rom com of two strangers getting together to randomly date, no strings attatched, and they end up... Well, you know. But, one thing that worked for Holidate, setting it apart from other movies that tried the same theme but failed, is the characters. They were somehow enjoyable, especially the leading lady who did a great job with her performances. So, overall, it's enjoyable, feel good, with a fast pace and some funny moments.",Holidate
5,marmar-69780,Holidate,6,4 November 2020,"Holidate is another romantic comedy that has nothing new or different to offer but i had some solid time while watching it and i must say that actors somewhat saved this film from becoming another lazy made film that has stupid characters,predictable plot and stupid jokes.Dont get me wrong this film has that in a plenty of ways,but actors were able to make me to ignore such staff and to enjoy a little bit what was happening on screen.Our leads were cute together and they fine chemistry.Story was of course very predictable but you can enjoy it if you turn of your brain.Holidate is obviously another genre troop but you can have fine time with it",Holidate

9,jadavix,"Above average, at times slyly satirical holiday rom-com for every holiday",7,22 December 2020,"I didn't expect much from ""Holidate"". For one thing, it's a romantic comedy with a plot that sounds like it must have been used by at least a dozen other movies. For another, it's a Netflix production, and I have found that movies made straight for the streaming service are usually gaudy and obnoxious. Emma Roberts is great as usual, however, creating a character you believe in and care about, and whereas the movie may be clichéd, there are moments where you can see everybody involved had their tongue in their cheek, and were carefully walking the line between genuine rom-com and satire of same. Take the part where Emma Roberts says Ryan Gosling is too cool to shop for himself, and someone clearly made up to look like Gosling is shopping behind her, and the silly climactic moment where Roberts commandeers a Christmas orchestra's microphone - and they're more than happy to let her have it, which comes straight from the ""How to Write a Rom-Com in 7 Days"" hand-book, except for the fact that she has to aggressively, dangerously shove past people on an escalator to get there, which amusingly juxtaposes realism with cliché.The movie also features a scene involving a laxative-related accident. How many rom-coms would have that? How many actresses would be willing to go through that on screen?It was actually funny at times, too, and I warmed to the Australian guy who played the love interest by the end of the movie.I say check it out.",Holidate
10,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Holidate,6,19 November 2020,"6/10 - Netflix said, ""Let's make a Hallmark movie, but raunchy""...and to be honest, it kind of worked (in large part thanks to Emma Roberts)",Holidate

Wholeheartedly recommend if you like romcoms.",Holidate
12,r96sk,Roberts in particular stands out,6,10 December 2020,"Not good, not bad. Just meh.Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey make for a charming duo, Roberts in particular stands out. The premise they star in is an interesting one, I don't really have any issues with 'Holidate' - it's fine. It just lacks the necessary cohesion and entertainment, there are a few amusing moments but not nearly enough. The overly sappy ending is out of place, also.",Holidate

They had really good chemistry together. The film follows the exact formula that one would expect. But honestly for some reason I liked it. It was competently filmed enough, and the two leads keep things afloat. The humor is fine. I never really laughed out loud but I'd be lying if I said I didn't smile. Overall, this was fine enough. It doesn't reinvent the formula but its charming stars keep things engaging.",Holidate

16,aidanratesmovies,"Nothing too special, but a fun film nevertheless",6,15 November 2021,"Fun and entertaining, although lacking the much desired originality and uniqueness it thinks it has, Holidate is a largely decent little Holiday flick thanks to it's charisma and performances from it's two lead stars. Let's get this straight, Holidate is not much different from what you have seen before. Yes it's concept is different and it takes place at more than one holiday, but it's formula is still the same as am average Rom-com, which can be dissapointing for sure, concidering it could have been a lot more from the start. It has its corny moments and it's cliche characters, mainly all the supporting cast, but somehow in someway it was pretty fun to watch. Emma Roberts easily steals the show throughout the entire film, giving us a compelling and entertaining lead to follow, as well as with Australian actor Luke Bracey as Jackson. The film is well shot and the costume design is incredibly well done. It's a beautiful movie to look at and it's very easy to sink into. It might not be much, but it was a fun quirky little ride and certainly not the worst choice to watch for the holiday season. In the end, Holidate may lack originality, but it does make up for that and it's other flaws with it's charming cast and pacing into a movie that's at the very least- very watchable.My Rating: 6.4/10.",Holidate

19,Kamurai25,"""Dating in Relationship Recovery""",7,6 November 2020,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.An odd, jaded, but good approach to the social pressures of being single, but dateable. I guess other people see it as wasted resource, I wouldn't know.Realistically, this is as much a breakup recovery movie as it is a romantic comedy. The cast does a great job of subtly expressing things without it being obvious. Ultimately it's a cute and charming little movie from a jaded and socially abnormal stand point.The biggest problem is that they spend a lot of time saying ""this works"", ""this is normal"", with the impending implication that they'll get together, and being that it is a romantic comedy, it should be obvious what the conclusion is.If you're a fan of Emma Roberts, then you can definitely see her grow in this, proving her range.",Holidate

That become extremely cheesy, once they drop the jaded and sarcastic act. This is another « new generation » movie, trying to avoid every cliché in the book, while listing them one by one.

[+37%],4,29 October 2020,"Everything that we've ever seen in romantic comedies featuring protagonists who hit it off as friends-(with-non-sexual)-benefits and later fall in love (aw!), is packaged in the form of a perfunctory cliche in 'Holidate'. The film is so by-the-numbers that you can keep your eyes closed, randomly name the leads X & Y, and it'd all end up exactly the way you expect. No real surprises in the screenplay (by Tiffany Paulsen) - it's a ragbag of ""I've-seen-that-before""s, oozing cheese and gloss. The leads, Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey, look great but they play stock characters that only appear in dreary, easy-on-the-brain rom-coms. The humor is the biggest letdown here: the only time I even chuckled was when a mother of two explains who a wh*re is, to her kids.",Holidate
22,leftbanker-1,Another Paint-By-Numbers Rom-Com To Avoid,1,30 October 2020,"There must be a computer program that spits out the scripts for all of these rom-coms. You just mix and match the elements you are looking for and the program does the rest.Here is the structure of these Paint-By-Numbers Rom-Coms:1- Gimmicky Hook2- Guy with some sort of accent. Why does every movie about Americans have to have someone with a British or Australian accent? It's almost always the male character because for some reason, certain women think accents are cute and sexy. I would imagine that none of these women have ever traveled anywhere except maybe to Florida on spring break of Vegas.3- First they hate each other, then they don't.4- Humor mostly is about someone falling down or running into something, which is only funny if they die. These new Netflix ""comedies"" rely on vulgarity, as if that is synonymous with humor.5- You are asked if your review contains spoilers, but there is nothing in these dreadful movies to be spoiled. It was spoiled before I even watched the trailer.",Holidate

Director: John Whitesell
Starring: Emma Roberts, Luke Bracey, Kristin Chenoweth, Frances Fisher, Andrew Bachelor, Jessica Capshaw, Manish Dayal, Alex Moffatt, Cynthy Wu, Jake Manley, etcOverall rating 76/100Holidate focuses on two single people Sloane (Emma Roberts) and Jackson (Luke Bracey) who are tired of being alone over the holiday season so agree to be each other's platonic dates for the holidays but they fall in love with each other along the way. Holidate was a lot of fun and had a lot of loveable qualities to it so let's get started.First of all the movie had an interesting plot, was hilarious and had likeable characters with a good set up between the two main characters. The actual idea of the movie having someone to be with over the holiday with no strings attached was a really interesting set up and concept, it left a lot of humour to have fun with, The movie was also hilarious, the dialogue was very clever, the characters comedic timing and chemistry with each other was excellent and the movie was just infectious and put a smile on your face, it didn't hold back or play it safe with its comedic moments as well which I Loved. All the characters were also extremely likeable, every singly character played their perfectly within the film, Kristen Chenowith especially was fantastic and her comedic performance with her character was excellent. Finally, I also loved the set up between the main two characters. I loved how the movie spent time on where both characters were at with their love life, with one being the only single one in the family and the other just getting out of a crazy relationship it set up them meeting very well and set the tone well for the rest of the movie.My next couple of positives would be the cinematography and the great self-aware tone and dialogue. This movie actually had fantastic visuals which I wasn't expecting, there was some beautiful set pieces in transitioning between all the different festive periods, and some really nice uses of colour that was visually striking especially in the club or party scenes. I loved how self aware the movie was in terms of it's dialogue and how the plot developed, the movie knew what kind of film it was and the dialogue exchanged especially with Emma Roberts made the film a lot more fun and easier to watch knowing what kind of movie you were watching you could just sit back and enjoy as the movies plot developed.My few negatives for the movie would be that it was still very generic, had very corny dialogue in parts and there was a lack of development or change to the plot for a long period of time. Despite the movies self aware tone it was still very generic, it would have been nice for a few surprises or slightly less obvious character decisions with the plot, so this effected the movie slightly, I also thought some of the dialogue was very corny in places. In parts the dialogue between the different characters was very awkward and not all of the jokes landed, a lot of the dialogue just lacked freshness. Finally, my biggest issue with the movie for me was the lack of change or development to the plot, I liked the decision to have the main characters not together for the whole film, but Holidate got itself stuck in a rut where it was just constantly changing holidays and there relationship still being the same with no development, it just made parts of the movie feel very repetitive, and made the original and cool idea go slightly stale, this was fixed eventually but it definitely effected the movie a fair amount.My final few positives would be the chemistry between characters, development of the main characters relationship, and the satisfying ending. I thought that Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey has absolutely fantastic on screen chemistry, their relationship was believable, charming and heart-warming to watch evolve throughout the movie. I also loved how their relationship developed, the fact that they stayed friends for a while for me worked really well and added a really interesting dynamic to the movie as you got to see two different side to their relationship. The final act was also despite being predictable very satisfying, despite seeing them get together from a mile off, the way it was executed in the final act was excellent with more polished dialogue that worked for all the characters and ended the film in a positive way.Overall, despite having some dialogue issues and being creatively stuck in a rut for too much of the movie, Holidate is a funny, charming and likeable movie that will do very well over the holiday season and shine a light on the comedic talent involved within the movie.",Holidate

Predictable like all of its kind.

Mild sexual language and light nudity.

36,zac-04879,Plenty of Average Romcom Elements,6,10 June 2021,"As the lovey-dovey title implies, Holidate is a romantic holiday comedy substantially regarding dating. Although the film is slowly adequate, it's an original romcom with happiness, love and laughs.The best factor of the film would have to be the well-produced plot, followed by what romcom fans are expecting: love and laughs. Unlike countless romance films, the actual dating in Holidate isn't utterly awkward. With characters engaging in joyfully-spirited conversations, the film isn't so average or boring in that category.But just like most romantic comedies, the ingeniously untouched topics are destroyed by the film's pace. Other than that, gender stereotypes and other romantic-comedy-factors fill to the edge of Holidate. If it weren't for the jokes and the skilful acting of Emma Roberts, the film would've mainly been a romantic catastrophe. This holiday favourite is definitely worth being discovered by romcom fans and holiday lovers, but any audience would have to admit that Holidate is not for everyone.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Holidate

39,pranayjalvi,As bad as it gets..,2,28 October 2020,"Arriving with a quiet thud in the holiday romcom sorting trough is this new Netflix offering with Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey. Sloane (Roberts) and Jackson (Bracey) are the latest pair of extremely good looking single people to like each other very much but find about 95 (out of about 104 total) minutes' worth of reasons not to be together.There's plenty of dialogue that would rub off the surface of any romcom snow globe, but alas, little beneath.

40,jackgdemoss,Does an excellent job of not being as awful as it should have been,4,9 November 2020,"This movie was set up to be feel good cheese, but it does a solid job on holding the cheese. Both lead roles aren't historically talented at convincing the viewer that this will be a dramatic and emotional roller coaster. Thankfully, that is the exact reason they were cast into this script. With all of these seemingly positive comments, understand that they are mostly angel's advocate teasing out the good in what is a mostly poor film.",Holidate
41,LukeCustomer2,Paint by the numbers,5,1 November 2020,"This movie is such a formula romantic comedy but worse, has a number of problems. The script itself has nothing new. Jackson and Sloan hate the holidays. One day while returning clothing at the store they meet and commiserate and agree, at first reluctantly, to be each other's platonic ""Holidate"" - just date on the Holidays if they don't have anyone else. Now that they have agreed to something other than a romantic relationship, of course, that will now rear its ugly head. The lead couple - Jackson (Luke Bracy) and Sloan (Emma Roberts) seem a Hollywood mis match. Jackson seems much older than Sloan - though I understand the lead actor is close to 30. They do establish that Sloan is close to that age but Jackson seems about 42. Both actors were, straining. Emma seemed to be doing a version of her character in ""Scream Queens"" far too uptight and not sympathetic. Jackson is much too upbeat most of the time. They had mostly zero chemistry. The script is not brave at all. Sloan is eventually found to have had a broken heart and that is why she doesn't like the holidays - rather than just making a single woman who is happy with her life and hates the way the holidays put so much pressure on women. Jackson really doesn't have any reason for this agreement other than he doesn't want a serious relationship. Makes him come off as a bit of a cad which is utterly boring and typical of rom coms. There are also a number of subplots that imho did not need to be in the movie. It kind of seemed like welfare for actors. Many of the plots were boring (and one a little insulting-- looking at you Aunt Susan) and I ended up fast forwarding though them. If there is nothing on I would watch but not expect it to be great.",Holidate
42,Eli_Elvis,Easter w bunnies?,1,29 October 2020,Gmmie fking break. Holiday's w out christ. St. Valentine. St. Patrick. Day of the dead. St. Nikolas. The fking resurrection! Maybe that's why these idiots are miserable. Their lives are as shallow as the writer and characters in this pathetic hollyweird film.

43,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Entertaining enough but cliche,6,24 November 2020,"Ok, the movie did surprise me that it spans a whole year. I was just expecting this to take place during the Christmas Holidays and it was going to be a cliche thing where they fall madly in love in less than a month. So despite the time this movie is being released and the Christmas Tree on the poster, this is truly an ALL Holiday movie. You'll see Christmas, You'll see St. Patrick's Day, you'll see Cinco De Mayo. But other than that....the film is very cliche and predictable. Then again most rom-coms have a certain formula to them and if you like rom-coms that probably isnt going to detract too much.However, the comedy for me was hit or miss. There was some genuinely funny moments to me (during the wedding/Labor Day scene for instance) but it also felt like they were trying too hard for a laugh. Very early on there is a scene of Jackson at his girlfriend's parents house for Christmas. After a misinterpretation between the couple she exclaims out loud ""So you know me well enough to ___ in my mouth but not get me a gift?"" and I sat there and thought ""WHO SAYS THIS IN FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS?"". It just felt really forced and cheap to get a laugh.Story wise, I think it was cute. There was a story element about halfway through the film (which makes sense cause this was the Cinco De Mayo portion) where they wake up after a drunken night and aren't sure if they have had sex. and that plot point never really goes anywhere. Its not a catalyst for them actually getting closer together. Its not a catalyst for them acting more awkward around each other. I was even wondering if it was going to go down a surprise pregnancy route. But no, nothing. Again, probably just thrown in for a bit of comedy. But it honestly just felt a bit random, and could have been edited out. Its not like it really added anything one way or another.Certainly not a bad film though. And it did keep me engaged throughout.",Holidate

I mean it was well made and well acted. But it was also pure Hallmark Christmas movie which I happen to find boring and trite. That being said it doesn't deserve the one star reviews either. A few of them are overly harsh. The movie isn't overly offensive. If you hate romances and expect the female lead to decide that yes she really does want to be alone instead of with the hot Aussie then romances aren't your genre.

So flicking through Netflix and saw this movie I thought it look quite good and I was definitely right. What a fantastic light hearted Christmas film certainly what we all need going through a pandemic in the world. Plenty of laughs with romantic storyline that will keep you entertained all the way through. Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey are just great in playing the characters.

55,mbhgkmsgg,Holidate,5,19 November 2020,"Gets the job done. Holidate is, at times, quite funny, and it managed to get me in the end of the year holiday spirit. I think that that's about as much as you can ask from a film like this.There isn't much to say about this film. Even at its deepest, it remains quite shallow and offers very little in the way of story or emotion. It did, however, make me laugh more than I expected. Especially considering that it was filled with the type of humour that is very self-aware. Something that I think is quite hard to get right.
It was also very hard to care about the main characters. As such, the great emotional end piece struggles to make an impact and quite frankly, I think that that's a good thing. As long as it's funny and even somewhat entertaining, it's doing its job.The biggest problem, however, was the length of the film. I was stunned when I checked how much of the film was left only to find out that I had been watching it only for an hour. That first hour felt like an eternity. It almost felt like I was trapped in an endless simulation of holidays where awkward and sometimes funny stuff happens. Indeed, it felt excruciatingly long at times. Something that I would consider quite problematic for a film like Holidate.At the end of the day, though, films like these aren't trying to be great, or even particularly good. They try to be entertaining and funny. If they succeed in that, then they have accomplished what they set out to do. As many problems as Holidate has, it does accomplish those two things.",Holidate

If you are looking for 'depth' you should probably choose another genre of film.

I wouldn't rush to see this, has it of been in the cinema I would have been disappointed but it was a Saturday night in just scrolling through Netflix and it's the kind of film that you will forget, total cliches.
You are better off watching One Day, The Choice (any Nicholas Sparks films), if you are looking for a romantic film. If it wasn't for the swearing it could pass as a Hallmark film.

70,PerryAtTheMovies,A corny & cheesy rom-com that is actually not so bad...,6,15 November 2020,"Emma Roberts portrays the perfect girl next door in this cheesy and corny rom-com. The first hour is filled with hilarity, that doesn't feel forced, as corny jokes fill the air, while the second hour is crammed with all the emotions that have bottled up along the way. The chemistry between Emma and Luke made the romance, that is eventually felt, feel real. As is true to any person who is living the single life, Emma's character, Sloan, is always bombarded by her mom and siblings with questions as to why she doesn't have a boyfriend. Eventually, because of the pressure, true love is able to bloom through all the ""meaningless"" dates.Overall, this is a decent romantic comedy that brings the laughs, the tears, and the go after him/her yells to the screen. I believe this film could be enjoyed by most. However, if you're offended by drinking and the odd one night stand, maybe stay away. Also, this is not a family friendly rom-com.

Maybe it was the chemistry of the people, maybe it was the script being another been there done that. You won't walk away saying it was horrible. Sometimes people leave these reviews that say this was the worst movie they have ever seen but that just makes you wonder how limited there movie viewing is. There are some really really bad movies out there. Movies that have like a 1 or 2 rating. But then you have those who say it is the best movie they ever seen.Bottom line is if you want to waste some time and not feel ripped off this will do it. But don't think it is one of those where it will knock your socks off.No nudity, lots of inappropriate discussion (nothing wrong with that), some cussing (nothing wrong with that either), but I didn't laugh once.

I didn't really get the premise of a ""Holidate"", except that they would not need to be subjected to set ups by well-intentioned family, and then, oh no, they got to avoid friends with benefits. ""So then what's the point,"" an astute family member asks Sloan. There were some parts that were ok, I usually like Kristin Chenoweth but again, her character was so overdone it felt forced.

I'm a horror and crime fan so I can't understand what's going on. This film is funny after a while and the 2 leads definitely have chemistry. I actually (jeeze I can't believe I'm going to say this) wanted them to get together. Of course, it could be that I'm trying out gin properly for the first time in my life, which I also normally hate, so I've added a mix of other booze to make it drinkable. So, overall; a funny, feelgood film to watch during a pandemic. If you're drunk and expecting to die soon. Cheers!",Holidate

108,bknb02,Great casting and sweet and touching!,10,31 December 2020,"This was probably the best cast rom com since Pretty Woman! It was one exciting actor after another!! I loved that I had no idea who to expect too!
I kept going oh he's great and I love her!
Yes, it's a formula and they make fun of that at the get go! ALL GOOD! Don't we expect the formula in rom coms and if one didn't follow the formula, which is the same formula they teach you in school, would it even be a rom com? I wanna see my formula and I want it done flawlessly so I can relax and enjoy the highs and cry at the lows! It's an emotional release. That is how it works!
You laugh then you cry then you go ahhhh, sweet, it world out! All is good in the world!
It's a really sweet touching movie beautiful acted in the genre of ""Pretty Woman""!
Isn't Emma Roberts Julia Roberts's niece? They look a lot alike. A lot of the same rhythm too. And that Luke Aussie guy, what a hunka munka! He is a cutie pie! I loved his facial expressions too! And there were some highly rated award winning actors in there too who really pulled it all together.
I am really happy I found this movie tonight! It made my evening! I wish I had indulged in hot cocoa with it instead of tea though! You'll understand the desire to indulge when you see it! I am giving you a heads up to go ahead and grab a treat!
Enjoy!",Holidate

That being said, it is funny enough and a welcome respite from all the standard cheesy fare offered up around the holiday's. Premise and acting is solid and singles (or those once single) who experienced the partner-less holiday explaining will get it.

I won't spoil it if you like cheesey silly sleazy Holidate rom coms. Holidate will probably become a new term. I'm still calling it Holidays + Dating??!!!!
Holidate is the funniest movie title I've ever heard. If you're reading this watch something better on Netflix. I'm getting too repetitive. Butt wait.... There's more!!!! There are better movies than Holidate. Here's a short list:

Teenagers and 20 somethings may love this movie. I just found it to be a little vulgar and not funny. It had many moments that made me cringe that I didn't feel were funny.

Emma Roberts was cute but I found her character annoying. The male lead, also cute but annoying. 2 annoying characters made me lose interest in this movie real fast. Didn't find anything romantic, comedic nor interesting about this movie. The casting was great but the potential was lost. Inserts of meet-cutes, annoying banter and side storylines were just a waste of time. I fast forwarded so much and lost interest that I barely even know how it ended nor do I care.

Maybe I don't really know who the stars are, so I wasn't invested in the predicatable love story and their chemistry wasn't great. There were some laugh out moments, but as far as romcoms and Christmas films go, I probably won't watch again. I also didnt think the script was great...not all millennials and young people talk about blow/hand jobs or oral sex like it's no big thing. I don't think it worked for a chrismas film...that felt intuitively and morally wrong. So I couldn't give this more than 5 stars and that was being generous.

At no point in time, did I hope for them to get together.I'm a bit in shock at how bad this was, to be able to articulate the other problems.Netflix, I love you and I love a lot of the originals you've made, but I think there needs to be a stronger vetting process on where you spend your funds.",Holidate

The premise was promising and being a rom-com the destination was clear, too.""Holidate"" disappointed in it all doesn't seem to work.On the positive side I enjoyed the character of Jackson and Luke Bracey's acting. He had genuine and believable reactions out of probably the whole cast.The interactions and conversations between characters don't sound realistic. As another reviewer noted, that's not how people talk. The overacting, Emma Roberts's in particular, doesn't help. The character of Sloane is pretty one dimensional, permanently wound up and never has the tone you'd expect.Action wise, the movie begins with both protagonists attending different Christmas family gatherings. At hers, Sloane is being grilled by her mother about her being single. Strange - are these people not in contact usually? Why would a mother push her daughter so much on this holiday? Add a proposal to the mix and our girl's misery (and self-centeredness, can't you be happy for your brother?) are established. Meanwhile, Jackson he joins a casual date - who misrepresented their relationship - to her parents' house.All side characters seem to be caricatures of caricatures which doesn't help the viewer get into the movie, so the story doesn't really flow. I kept wondering why everything was so strange. Special mention to the women who are all a bit nutty, not in the good way.Sloane and Jackson meet at the returns counter where they both act like they've never returned anything in their lives. Somehow the premise gets going and a bit of negging later they agree to be each other's dates for various occasions and we're underway. Their first event goes well and has the best scenes in the movie.Sloane tells her family and whoever else wants to listen that they are not dating but doing this holiday dates only, seemingly oblivious to this defeating the purpose of holidating in the first place.The main characters, Sloane especially, seem to fight every natural romantic or tender moment that comes their way which makes for an unsatisfying viewing experience. She wants the romance and the nice moments but she kills them on every occasion. This for me included the ending which to me required an intimate moment instead to sell the story, since both characters are so emotionally stunted throughout.Since watching this I found out about ""Plus One"", a movie based on the same premise but executed better in each way; worth a watch if only for comparison.The movie was overall a meh watch. It didn't leave me with that warm and fuzzy feeling. I didn't really care about the characters in the end and there was no emotional payoff for me. I really wanted to like it but unfortunately I felt that many things were a bit off.",Holidate

160,marbanks29,Cringe fest. The rating is a joke.,3,26 December 2020,"This is NOT a good movie. You might enjoy it and that's ok. But don't give it 10 stars just because you enjoyed it after getting drunk (as said in the reviews). At this point the rating is very close to the ratings of romantic comedies like Sleepless in Seattle or You've Got Mail - and those are brilliant and fun classics, this movie is NOT and soon will be forgotten. Just to give you some perspective: The Matrix has now the rating of 8.7 and some people here are saying this one is a 10? Ridiculous. To compare with some other rom-coms: Notting Hill has 7.1, Love Actually has 7.6, The Shape of Water 7.3, Titanic 7.8. Whoever rated this movie 5 or above obviously hasn't seen a good movie in their life. Now that's my rant on IMDB ratings we've been having for some time now.
The script as a whole wasn't that bad. Clichés can be ok but they have to be well executed. They weren't here. Most of the jokes were cringe-worthy and fell flat. The only good thing that saves this movie from being a total garbage are the main actors, especially Emma Roberts. They made their characters believable. And the only rare moments of good humour to be found in this ""comedy"" were delivered by Emma's acting skills (Luke Bracey's acting wasn't bad but his lines, for most of the time, were terrible).",Holidate
161,keridb,Surprisingly Good,7,3 November 2020,"Not a big RomCom fan so I was hesitant at first. But the Trailer & some reviews convinced me to give it a try.
I was pleasantly surprised. This movie takes an unconventional & clever spin to casual dating. It puts the function in dysfunction when it comes to family, self reflection, and dating-VS-single-VS-commitment debate.
What I found refreshing: the sarcasm, self-deprecation, and the occasional bend (not break) of the ""4th wall"".
The ending doesn't deviate much from the trusted formula...but I can appreciate their rendition.

164,Miroslav-A,One of the best rom-coms in last few years,10,10 July 2021,"Without looking back on whether another movie has processed a similar story before, I'll say this one really cheered up my evening. For a genre that serves to cheer up and entertain, a assessment of me - immodest 10.Last year's classic rom-comedy, with two young actors in lead roles who already have enough famous titles behind them.Perhaps the biggest impression on me left the much better performance of the lovable E. Roberts, compared to 'Little Italy', which in a sea of these sweet films didn't quite excel.... and which I looked at just before this title, so the direct comparison made sense to me somehow.In '...Italy' story we watched H. Christensen who got a chance to try out for the lead role of a more casual genre like this. I don't think that worked out very well.About the movie? Boy and girl, both in avoiding serious relationships, accidentally get to know each other and very quickly make a deal (for mutual benefit) to be each other's 'holidate' - casual partner during the holidays. Of course, over time, that friendship turns into a story expected in romantic comedies.It is a common case in this genre that at the beginning of the film we are briefly shown male-female friendship from childhood, and then the action takes us 10-15 years later when these characters are already adults.In such titles, the actor/actress in the 'adult version' should be striking, not only by acting but by appearance. Christensen doesn't have that necessary attractiveness, whereas with L. Bracey it's a different story.I'll mention just a few examples of where it was done right - 'The Best of Me' (J. Marsden, with L. Bracey as a male character from childhood), 'Ghosts of Girlfriends Past' (McConaughey)...... And this title is just as good an example. Although the accompanying story of childhood is missing, the point is clear. Compared to '... Italy' - romance is more mature, the action more fun, the acting more convincing, and Bracey and Emma a visibly more attractive couple.For more movie reviews, visit my blog :

But even on the RomCom spectrum, 'Holidate' was particularly silly and mindless. I'm looking at the, ""Does this review contain spoilers"" question at the bottom of this review, and realizing that there is no way my review could contain spoilers, as it is utterly evident what will happen within the first few minutes. Is there any doubt that in the end the girl will get the boy? Of course not, but this particular movie broadcasts it harder and sooner. 'Holidate' was certainly inoffensive, and I don't feel any the worse for watching it, but I sure as heck don't feel illuminated or happier for having watched it either. I'm just a little disappointed that I chose it over the other 500 choices that were available on Netflix.

It's a film where all the characters continuously says nasty things, and their faces must contort to properly express them.

Otherwise, it is one of the worst movies I've seen lately. It isn't even the kind of silly movie that is light hearted and funny. There is nothing funny here but cringeworthy moments. The message passed on this movie is also terrible, you can't be happy unless you have someone else. Doesn't matter that it's just to fill this clingy, needy hole the characters have. There is no substance, all characters are so vapid, the script a horrible collection of all the worst things in romantic comedies. Even one of the characters talked about how in romantic comedies the dashing hero and naïve heroine will always end up together. Surprise, surprise: they fall in love and end up together. I skimmed along some parts because I kept waiting for the punch line, for the moment they would reveal: hey! we are making fun of all these kind of movies. Sadly it never happened.

Why not make her goofy or awkward? Or even smart or shy? Or ANYTHING other than a size 2 hip millennial who whines for 120mins about how she doesn't trust men and is bothered by everyone around her. The male main character is also laughable. Btw, I'm tired of Netflix using the same POC as their side characters.

The references, however, either haven't been relevant for at least a decade or will only be understood by American audiences.I'm usually a fan of Emma Roberts, however, the combination of her over exaggerated acting and a poor script makes for a lead that it generally lacking. Not to mention that her male co-star is portraying an incredibly sexist character and while I could understand that the things he said could be jokes I feel they just add to his dislikability. There is, of course, a redemption scene but his bad attitude for the rest of the film makes it impossible to feel sorry for him when conflict arises with Sloane.The script is... I wasn't sure the writer had interacted with a real human at certain points of the film as the dialogue was so clunky, unrealistic and awkward.The costumes are quite nice, nothing special but I thought they matched the characters that were wearing them.The cinematography was definitely the best part of the film. There were quite a few nice shots that I took notice of.There is a chance, a very small chance, that this film is a parody. The number of clichés, king bach, the characters, the writing, all of them are so over exaggerated that you could interpret this film as a parody, however, I don't think that was the intent and instead was just a symptom of how bad the writing is.1 star for cinematography
1 star for costumes

I usually love movies like Love Actually and Bridget Jones and this seems to have all the ingredients, thrown together in a bad mix. Neurotic cute girl, handsome man who somehow is attracted to her weirdness and doesn't mind her being rude and convincing him to do stuff he doesn't want to do, old fashioned mother who is constantly belittling her daughter and trying to set her up with someone, weird over the top family member, sister who seems to have it all but is unhappy in her marriage, the obligatory (and long, boring and not very convincing) speech at Christmas time in a square full of people. Oh and apparently someone thought 'We've got to have a diarrhea scene in there, that's always funny too!"" I think it might be trying too hard.",Holidate

Throughout the film Jackson is sexist, misogynistic and very unlikeable. Sloane is constantly putting herself down and comes across as a very damaged person. Sloane is surrounded by a toxic family that are fixated on the fact that marrying someone is the only goal in life and every time Sloane says that single people can be happy this is shut down.Jackson throughout the film tells Sloane she is unattractive, talks about how all women act a certain way and is manipulative. I was hoping this would be addressed but it wasn't.For some reason the mum also takes a dig at cancer patients and how noone will find a bald girl attractive. Very odd.The film is toxic throughout which is why I felt the need to write a review. I am disappointed that Netflix made a film with such a horrible main guy and damaged main girl and tried to play it off as romance.",Holidate

While the cursing is superfluous, the disappointment of the movie is the underdeveloped characters - people who are semi-witty, semi-nice, adequate at their jobs, no hobbies, few interesting thoughts, and no hopes or dreams except to someday not be single. I couldn't find a reason to like them or to be inspired by them. In line with the underdeveloped characters was the lack of character progression but that is to be expected when the big hurdle to overcome is ""I'm scared"" as a result of a breakup from a short relationship. The post-relationship emotional scarring was both unbelievably significant and then also so easy to overcome.

Like..no one ever would be so stubborn if she would end up meeting this guy and had that connection with him.I get that this sort of stubborness brings more drama and makes us wonder ""oh, are they gonna be together in the end?"" ""oh,what's he gonna do now?"" and so on... But DAMN they are adults.. They act like adults the whole movie and then there are some scenes where they act like a 15 year old that's in love and doesn't know what to do - again, Sloane in this case.She is maad stubborn! They could have gave these 2 main actors so many opportunities in this one, but yet again, classic modern romantic comedy strikes!

393,MightDeleteLater,Aren't we past this?,1,29 November 2020,Yet another movie that paints women as desperate for love and men as indifferent to it. Wrap a Christmas tree in a gender stereotypes and apparently you've got a holiday romcom? Ffs please stop writing this garbage. Being in an actual happy relationship starts with liking yourself. Everyone is or should be capable of finding happiness in solitude outside of their relationship status. You don't need a man by your side in order to have fun at a party or to care about how you look.,Holidate
394,ericabranning,Loved the writing!,10,11 November 2020,"This movie was fun! I loved the writing, it was funny and more realistic of how people talk. There's a lot of real life gross things that happen in the movie that wouldn't be in a normal rom-com.",Holidate
395,brandylsmith,Cute....but unnecessary language.,8,5 November 2020,"I thought this movie was cute and followed the rom-com recipe well. My only issue is the unnecessary use of language. It is a personal pet peeve to have children curse in movies, it is just not needed. It's rate mature, when it really doesn't need to be.",Holidate
396,debsabean,Mediocre in Every Way,1,30 October 2020,"Not romantic, not funny, lousy script, bad acting, no chemistry between any of the the characters, and so on. Just really bad from beginning to end. Had to stop it, move onto something watchable, then resume several times so I could get it off my ""Continue Watching"" list.",Holidate
397,zouzoukhalil,worst film,1,2 December 2020,What is the message of this film ?!! acting so bad and even the situation so dumb and aren't good at all don't waste your time!!!,Holidate
398,mikkellildal,Terrible acting that is barely funny,2,29 November 2020,"This movie showcases some of the worst acting I have seen. It made me laugh a few times. The story I predictable, not original in any way. Pretty boring and really cheap laughs. But still made me laugh a couple of times. It was hard not doing other stuff while watching the movie.",Holidate
399,nike53,Why are movies like this still made in 2020?,1,28 October 2020,"It's misogynistic, boring, the story is contrived, and the characters are completely unlikable. If I could rate it a zero, I would. It's 2020, we need to do better than this.",Holidate
400,eng_alaa_badarneh,Super cheesy,1,9 November 2020,"The story was not only predictable but also annoying. The characters were pushed into the story to create comedy out of something that is not actually funny. The cheesy romance between a hot guy and a girl who doesn't even notice he is hot and acts careless around him could have been wrote even better by a 10 year old.
All in all it seemed more like a desperate attempt than a movie 👎🏻",Holidate
401,rondy-34648,But why....,1,14 November 2020,"It. Was. Bad. Jessica Capshaw, you could do so much better than this. Emma Roberts is annoying. Her character is ridiculously unlikeable in every possible way. Whiny, overreacting, unfunny, desperate, etc...I typically love rom-coms, but this ain't cutting it. Save yourself. Watch something else.",Holidate
402,margaretstobieniecka,Not funny,4,26 December 2020,I felt like it was boring and the jokes weren't even funny. I couldn't push it through the entire thing. Just stopped watching..,Holidate
403,kccastles,Best part was the trailer,3,29 October 2020,"After seeing the trailer I was really anticipating this Netflix movie for weeks but I was so disappointed! Luke Bracey is crazy gorgeous but the writer should be ashamed at how bad she wrote this. It was silly and even stupid with a dumb ending and it could have been great. I guess I have been completely romance-spoiled by Outlander, Bones and Lucifer that I can't enjoy such a crappy attempt. Do yourself a huge favor and binge any of the aforementioned shows or watch Always Be My Maybe or To All The Boys I've Loved Before, even Kissing Booth all on Netflix. Bones is on Prime and 12 seasons of it made my month!",Holidate
404,prodhimanisha-58354,Is this...satire?,1,28 October 2020,"It has to be, wow. All the tropes, all the stock characters, all the regressive and sexist dialogue--there is no way this isn't a satire of the formulaic romantic comedy film.",Holidate
405,coralystrinidad,Great movie,10,31 October 2020,The cast is great. The movie was great. Jessica Capshaw was great in it,Holidate
406,sarkazmovaol,One of a worst films ever!,1,16 December 2020,"God, It's really sucks! Stupid jokes, stupid heroes.
Full of cliches. I waisted my time. Terrible😵😵😵",Holidate
