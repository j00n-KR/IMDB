0,Leofwine_draca,Dated but still fun,6,9 April 2016,"THE WARRIOR is Walter Hill's magnum opus about gang warfare in New York. Supposedly devised as a grittily realistic rebuttal to the stylised romanticism of WEST SIDE STORY, this has dated in its own way, and now stands out as the epitome of '70s fashion and ideas. The action-focused storyline is a simple one: members of a gang are stranded across town and forced to evade rival gang members and police in their bid to return home to safe turf.There aren't any big name actors here to distract the viewer, just lots of effective and suspenseful shooting on the dark streets of New York at night. There are a handful of fun action scenes which are acceptable, but this film works best thanks to the suspense, which is ever-present. It has dated and it does feel rather tame by modern standards - and it's fair to say that Hill's later works like SOUTHERN COMFORT are considerably better - but THE WARRIORS still has its charms. David Patrick Kelly (COMMANDO) proves to be something of a scene-stealer as the villain of the piece.",The Warriors
1,SnoopyStyle,needs better violence,6,10 April 2015,The powerful Cyrus calls on all the gangs of New York to send 9 members with no weapons to gather in the Bronx. He calls on every gang to unite to take over the crime world of the city. Luther (David Patrick Kelly) shoots Cyrus and then blames the Warriors. Warriors leader Cleon is taken down and Swan (Michael Beck) leads the rest despite being opposed by Ajax (James Remar). They are hunted down by the rest of the gangs but don't know the reason.I like the concept behind the movie. Taking Greek mythology and putting it in an alternate NY world is interesting. It's got the comic book style which should show where this movie is coming from. The plot isn't that interesting. It could be much improved with some good fight choreography. That's really missing here and the pace drags. Also the group shouldn't have split up. It takes away the group chemistry. The movie works best when the group is together.,The Warriors
2,claudio_carvalho,The Long Journey Back Home,8,17 July 2013,"In a near future, Cyrus (Roger Hill) is a respected leader that intends to unite the gangs in New York. Cyrus invites the most relevant gangs for a meeting at the Central Park, a neutral turf in a moment of truce. He explains that if the gangs unite, they would be 60,000 members against 20,000 policemen and they could rule New York.Out of the blue, the punk Luther (David Patrick Kelly) shots Cyrus and blames The Warriors, a gang from Coney Island. There is a riot in the Central Park and the police arrive and put the group under siege. The Warriors try to return to Coney Island while all the gangs decide to hunt them down. The long journey back home of The Warriors begins.""The Warriors"" is a cult movie directed by Walter Hill with the story of a gang falsely accused of murdering a charismatic leader that spend the night trying to get back home. The full of action story has stunning characters and a wonderful chemistry between Swan, performed by Michael Beck, and Mercy, performed by Deborah Van Valkenburgh. David Patrick Kelly is scary in the role of the psychopath Luther and the choreography, costumes and cinematography are top-notch. This is another movie that has not aged and even after watching it so many times, I do not get tired of it. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Warriors - Os Selvagens da Noite"" (""The Warriors – The Savages of the Night"")",The Warriors
3,kosmasp,Can you dig it?,8,2 August 2019,"Warriors - come out and play ... well there are a quite a few things that you probably will remember. Depending on how much you like it and how much you can get over hairdos or style in general, you will actually like this. It is more than well made.So there may be a few things that feel dated, but not the overall quality of the movie. Walter Hill does stand for quality and he delivers when it comes to tension and thriller. He has some regrets concerning the handling of the character played by James Remar, but the viewer may feel differently. Stunt and action scenes are well choreographed and the road trip you take with our one group is quite the adventure. There is mayhem and there are laws broken - but you still are with this outsiders (or at least the movie does steer you that way) ... a classic",The Warriors
4,gavin6942,A 1970s Classic,7,4 February 2013,"In a future, dystopian New York City, turf gangs and cops rule the streets. When one gang leader tries to bring all gangs together against the cops, the Warriors are framed for his murder and the entire city turns on them.What could have been a film about gang violence -- and glamorized gang violence at that -- is actually a story about diplomacy. How do the gangs cope with knowing hundreds of other gangs exist in New York City? How do they work together (or fail to work together) to stand their ground against a police force that wants them dead? This film, although fun and action-packed, is really a small-scale look at the world. We have Cyrus, trying to unite the gangs into a sort of United Nations. We have sovereignty and territory disputes, and the choice to defend them by force or negotiate a peaceful way for others to travel through who mean no harm.",The Warriors
5,lee_eisenberg,"on the streets, it's get tough or die trying",10,4 July 2020,"I had heard about ""The Warriors"" for years but only now got around to seeing it. This gritty, violent, and all-around lovable movie makes it sad that Walter Hill saw the quality of his movies decline over the years. The gangs here have no choice but to accomplish their goal, made all the more difficult by the pitiless setting.I watched the director's cut, with Hill noting that he emphasized the comic book connection. Said connection doesn't subtract from the quality at all; it actually reminded me of George Romero's ""Creepshow"".Basically, you haven't understood authentic action cinema until you've seen this movie (it's a whole lot more realistic than the repetitive, crummy movies starring Tom Cruise). Definitely check it out.So yes, can you dig it?",The Warriors
6,rmax304823,The Old Ultra Violence.,5,26 September 2013,"This is reasonably done for what it is, a violent action movie about revolting street gangs in a dilapidated New York City. I understand it was based on a Greek myth and that that should give it some class, but I don't care if the assassinated gang leader's name is Cyrus or not. The movie yet lives that Cyrus will debase.The plot -- Michael Beck's gang, the eponymous Warriors, is unjustly blamed for a killing and is hunted by the thousand other weirdly gotten-up gangs of the city -- is only a series of pegs to drape some bloody bandages on. One violent encounter relentlessly follows another.All the gangs wear ""colors"", signature items of clothing or strange grooming. The most bizarre of all are ""The Furies"" -- I can't believe this is another mythological allusion -- who dress in filthy baseball uniforms and paint their faces canary yellow, eggshell white, and other designer colors. Their lips are black and their eyes are dark with mascara or kohl or whatever it is. They're armed with baseball bats. They're scary as hell and I'd have run away but the Warriors, though unarmed, defeat these ""wimps"" without taking serious casualties.A couple of good things. One is that this was released in 1979, before the current high-contrast fad of draining the color palette of everything but the kind of green we associate with the faces of ghouls. It was also before Hollywood's cameramen and directors developed a case of palsy and caused the camera to wobble, jerk, until it collapsed from exhaustion -- or the viewer did. The only current cliché the director could fall back on was the use of slow motion as bodies crash through windows and walls.Michael Beck looks right but isn't much of an actor. That's okay because he doesn't get to say much. When he gives an order, he simply nods to a subordinate. The young girl he protects is Deborah van Valkenberg, whose performance is quite good. A provocative, mischievous, sexy, whorish woman at the beginning, her character is given a vulnerability that turns her human in a way that none of the blustering Warriors are human.In a dark deserted subway tunnel she begs Beck to play doctor and projects genuine pathos. Later, when they are seated in a subway car, two preppy couples, gay and laughing, sit across from them. The rich kids survey her torn dress, messed face, spaghetti shoes, and dirty toes, while she stares directly back at them, ashamed and defiant at the same time. Good scene.The last scene finds the Warriors -- minus two KIA -- back on their own quiet turf in Coney Island. A last grotesquely painted old Cadillac has followed them, stops outside their shelter, and a menacing clicking vibratory sound is heard from the car. It's their pediculous enemy, clicking three empty bottles together.It's all a little depressing. Coney Island was named for its flourishing coney population, rodents who made their homes in the dunes. Beck stands on the boardwalk, gazing around at the worn-down amusement rides, the shabby shacks, the dirt and litter, and wonders aloud, ""This is what we came home for?"" What's sad is that he doesn't realize that people like him have made this nightmare into what it is.",The Warriors
7,ma-cortes,A Coney gang accused of murder is pursued by violent urban tribes through N.Y.,7,7 February 2010,"The gangs of New York reunite in Riverside Drive Park, there a leader is murdered and the Warriors (Michael Beck, James Remar,Wright, Brian Tyler, among others) are accused of crime (Roger Hill). When they attempt to make their way home are pursued by all weird bands in rare dress as the Baseball Furies, Punks, Lizzies and several others. While a gang's female (Deborah Van Valkenburgh) is recruited and falling in love with the leader (Michael Beck). They must return Coney Island throughout a surrealist city transformed into a phantasmagoric labyrinth full of urban tribes and finally confronting a nasty gang leader (David Patrick Kelly).This exciting picture packs noisy action, thrills, tension ,suspense, fights and lots of comic book style violence. It's a dangerous trip of heroic dimensions , as it's said that turns out to be a special version from ¨Anabasis¨ by Xenophon or ¨Back the ten thousand¨, a known epic Greek. Filming completely on New York locations at night with superb photography by Andrew Laszlo. Screeching and stirring musical score in the 70s style by Barry De Vorzon. Lavishly produced by Joel Silver , Lawrence Gordon, Frank Marshall, three future successful producers. The motion picture is stunningly directed by Walter Hill who subsequently achieved several hits such as ¨Hard times¨, ¨The driver¨, ¨Streets of fire¨, ¨Long riders¨, ¨Crossroads¨ and ¨Red Heat¨, among them. The flick will appeal to action movies fans and Walter Hill enthusiasts. Rating : Better than average. Well worth watching.",The Warriors
8,BA_Harrison,"Try ditching the waist-coats, guys!",5,25 April 2015,"'Sometime in the future', Cyrus (Roger Hill), charismatic leader of the biggest gang in New York, summons nine representatives from each major street gang in a bid to join forces and raise an army to take control of the city. As he rallies the crowd, Cyrus is shot dead by loose cannon Luther (David Patrick Kelly), leader of The Rogues, who somehow manages to pin the blame on Coney Island schmucks The Warriors. Now, hunted by the other gangs, The Warriors must fight their way back across town to their home turf.Walter Hill's influential 1979 cult classic The Warriors has quite the loyal following, but I fail to understand what the fuss is about. The film's terrific premise could have made for a wonderfully bleak, gritty and ultra-violent tale of urban survival, but instead Hill opts for a comic-book approach that renders the action devoid of tension and excitement. The 2005 Ultimate Director's Cut of the film makes the situation even worse, with some really cheap and nasty editing effects that attempt (but fail) to make the film look even more like a comic book.After an hour and a half of running for their lives from numerous badly dressed gangs with silly names—all of which might have been avoided if they had just ditched their waistcoats with 'The Warriors' proudly embroidered on the back—the guys arrive on Coney Island only to be confronted by The Rogues and The Riffs. Fortunately, The Warriors' problem has been resolved by a handy witness to the shooting who has waited till very near the end of the film before speaking up.",The Warriors
9,dbdumonteil,Jungleland,7,13 November 2005,"This is not my kind of movie ,but ""the warriors"" sustained my interest till the very end.The characters are not very interesting but the sensational use of night landscapes is absolutely mind-boggling,with those desert streets,those saving subway stations and those parks where it's dangerous to venture after dark ,as Simon and Garfunkel sing.More than the retreat of the 10,000 after Cyrus 's death,the long trip back to Coney Island makes me think of an Odyssey in miniature ,with its descent into Hell (the subway tunnel),its mermaids (the girls who invite the warriors) and its Circe (the woman in the park). The DJ ( we only see her lips) provides the antique chorus and gives the movie an eerie touch.Recommended",The Warriors
10,Quinoa1984,one bad mutha of a 70s gangland action flick,10,3 June 2007,"The Warriors is that near perfect movie to watch after midnight; it's got 'grit' carved out on its back and its got a look (and I'm quoting Grindhouse for a moment) that will tear you in two. One scene sort of spells out the attitude of our ""heroes"", and heroes as in they are the bunch that are a little down on the line of being rough dudes- they're on the subway back to Coney Island, and this is after just getting through a fight with another gang in a bathroom in Union Square. It's a brutal fight, with neither side coming away without scars, and while they're sort of zoning out for one of the only moments of peace so far in this night of havoc while getting back home, two couples who've obviously come out of a disco club come onto the train and sit right across from Swan (Michael Beck) and Mercy (Valkenburgh). Even tired as they are- and she not even a member but someone who decided to tag along with the group- the look that they exchange is not pretty, at all, and promptly the couples leave the train. This is not only one of my favorite scenes in the film, but it's one of the pure cinematic moments in any gang movie (not to be confused with gangster, more like the gangs of the 50s, think West Side Story only 100 times more stylized and potentially violent), adding just that nice extra layer onto what these Warriors represent.Walter Hill, drawing from Greek history of the Spartans in Persian territory (and no, it's not 300), as well as heavily with comic-books (this is probably more-so with the director's cut, though it's only in the transitions that this is more than obvious, otherwise it's more intrinsic), crafts his film out of the blood, sweat and lack of tears that go on in the middle of the New York City night with these not-so-bizarre gang wars. The premise is simple: the Warriors got to go back to Coney Island after falling into a huge gang gathering in the Bronx that goes to s*** when the supposed future all-of-NYC gang leader (Roger Hill as Cyrus, a very notable one-scene turn full of power) is shot down by a whacko (David Patrick Kelly, wonderfully one-note as a bad-ass heel), who pins the murder on the Warriors. It's a chase picture, a lot of the time, as the gang has to run from rival gangs- not because they wouldn't want to take them on, just because it's a little inconvenient, especially with the conceit of the subway- but it's also one of the more heavy fight-centric gang films I've ever seen, with guys with bats, girls with vendettas (yes, girls), and punks on roller-skates.Hill's film is captivating without being too ridiculous, which is a very fine line to tread, especially with a cast of unknowns. He could have easily just as made a wild exploitation flick, and there may be some out there who'll consider it just that. But it deftly mixes two aspects, one being the nature of the period in New York City, of the complete lack of real order of law (the cops sometimes get them, sometimes not, it's usually good/bad luck, as with the comic note with Ajax's arrest scene), and where it could be conceivable that after hours on the streets all hell could break loose; one could see this as being somewhat in relation to the world of Death Wish, albeit in this film the gangs not being centered on going after civilians, yet still same city, same wretched crime problem of the 70s. The other being the atmosphere of a down n dirty comic book, loaded with juicy one-liners (some of the best include ""Can you dig it?"", ""I'll shove that bat up your ass and turn you into a popsicle"", ""Friday nights are good, Saturday nights are better""), expertly timed and edited scenes of violence and action- not just the gangs fights but also the opening with the gangs spreading out with the arrival of the cops- and the lines between good and evil blurred just enough to make it work for the material.It's hard to envision the Warriors being properly remade today, as there's too much access to new visual effects and other tricks of the trade to maybe make things a little too 'slick', or to just simply admonish the ferocity of the characters and situations of the original. As it stands, the original Warriors lacks the greatest ending imaginable (it's really just an inevitable one, however fun it is to see it come down), and it does teeter on becoming a little too over-the-top for its own good. But overall, Hill has fashioned a modern midnight movie classic, where the people look like they've been taken off the streets and given very brief acting lessons, and the intensity is kept very thick from start to finish, plus an amazing soundtrack with funk and rock songs perfect for any outlaw picture. It's not too hard to wonder that it caused the kind of reaction when first released, from actual gangs in the theaters, not seen since the Wild One.",The Warriors
11,Coventry,Come out to Play!,9,2 August 2004,"Not a highly realistic or dramatic portrait of the New York gangs, but a very exiting roller coaster-ride of action, raw settings and imaginative characters. The film's opening sequence is classic and downright brilliant with NY's most vicious gangs gathering in the park. The self-acclaimed leader  Cyrus  encourages the gangs to work together and take over power. When he's suddenly killed from within the crowd, the Coney Island Warriors are immediately pointed as the betrayers. What follows is a fascinatingly shot chase through the dark and foggy NY ghettos. The Warriors encounter angry-filled gangs and fight them in typical, rough backtown settings like the Subway or the notorious Bronx. James Remar is terrific as the overactive Warrior Ajax and he receives good feedback from the rest of the cast. Plusthe music is GREAT! Easily Walter Hill's best movie and maybe it even ranks among the 10 best films of the late 70's. The cult-status of The Warriors is still increasing.",The Warriors
12,hitchcockthelegend,"Can you dig it? Well actually yes Mr Hill, I bloody can!",8,4 March 2008,"During my schooling as a teenager there were a handful of films that it was deemed cool to love, The Wanderers, Scum, Quadrophenia and The Warriors, and it's perhaps a weird thing to say... but I still feel here in my middle age that these are still cool films to be adored and cherished.I have just sat through The Warriors again for about the hundredth time in my life, and it still entertains me as much now as it did back then, sure it's dated, sure I see more cheese than I thought it had back then, but I also see a visually tight movie that actually delves interestingly into the lives and psyche of young gangers.The plot is simple, all the gangs of New York City are called to a meeting where they are called to unite to take over the city, the leader of the gang known as The Riffs is a guy called Cyrus who is the one calling for the unity. He is shot and killed during the rally and The Warriors are wrongly framed for his murder. The Warriors then have to make their way back home to Coney Island with every gang in the city out to kill them, and also with the police hot on their tail as well. This journey is excellent as we are introduced to a number of gangs trying to get the better of The Warriors, the fights are well choreographed, the clothes are wonderful, and some of the dialogue is now teenage folklore.The film was criticised on release for glamorising gangs, but I fail to see how this opinion was formed, if anything, when analysing the main characters, the film has a sad streak running through it. Be that as it may, the films triumph is getting the will of the viewer to hopefully see the unfairly tarnished Warriors make it home to Coney Island, which builds to the climax of the film that is both poignant and punch the air greatness. 8/10",The Warriors
13,Theo Robertson,Turn Off Your Brain And Enjoy This Classical Thriller,7,4 February 2014,"This caused a fair bit of controversy on its release . Apparently real life gang members would queue outside of cinemas in America and get involved in violent murders so much so that councils in Britain rushed to block the films release . One can't help thinking that these stories of murder and mayhem are apocryphal . What is certain is that Walter Hill has made an extremely sexy film featuring gang culture and he sets the stall out from the opening frame as he cuts the different gangs from New York catching trains to their destination . This type of editing along with a blaring soundtrack is a director trademark which Hill used to devastating effect a couple of years later with his Vietnam allegory SOUTHERN COMFORT . In that film Hill borrowed the story of Anabasis and reworked it and THE WARRIORS is a straight reworking of this plot . If a theme lasts two and a half thousand years then it's worth borrowing Of course you have to switch off the brain occasionally in order for the story to work . We know the street gang called The Warriors are good guys because only good guys have a multi ethnic gang . You'll also find yourself questioning why NY gangs need to have meetings in the same way corporate share holders have meetings , and why no one noticed who was really behind the inciting incident at the start of the film , or why didn't The Warriors bring money for a taxi to get home . In other words the whole story structure revolves around strong suspension of disbelief in order for the film to work because everything is contrived and convenient to the plot . . Some of the acting is also stilted and wooden However none of this matter's in the slightest because Walter Hill is on top of his game and has crafted a very involving and exciting high concept urban thriller",The Warriors
14,Hey_Sweden,I can dig it.,8,4 May 2013,"Director Walter Hill again proves himself a master of the action film with this tough, hard- hitting, colourful bit of entertainment that comes off as something of a fantasy, with assorted gangs (often with their own amusing gimmick) running rampant in NYC.Cyrus (the charismatic Roger Hill) is the most powerful gang leader in the city and he has a great many of its gangs gather together for a sort of pep rally wherein he motivates them to mobilize their forces and take over the city. However, Cyrus is gunned down, and a gang named The Warriors is falsely accused of the crime. Led by their tight lipped, soft spoken ""war chief"" Swan (Michael Beck), they have to cross the turfs of many rival gangs in order to get home to Coney Island.The movie is of course notorious for the kind of incidents associated with it; gangs attending viewings would inevitably mix it up with each other. But the simple fact is that it's a fun flick, well shot by Andrew Laszlo and making great use of its various locations. It's got a lightning pace and the characters are all quite entertaining and memorable. James Remar is a scene stealer as Ajax, the hot headed, impulsive Warrior who would rather fight than run. David Patrick Kelly is a gas as Luther, a weaselly, worthless lowlife out to get the Warriors. One can understand why Hill would use these two actors again for ""48 Hrs."" Interesting thing about Thomas Waites, who plays the Warrior named Fox; he didn't see eye to eye with Hill, and ultimately he doesn't get any billing in the film. Hill even rewrote the script to ensure a different outcome for his character! Deborah Van Valkenburgh is appealing as tough talking gal Mercy who attaches herself to the Warriors, especially Swan. The late Lynne Thigpen plays a D.J. who also functions as sort of a narrator. A couple of familiar faces in small parts include Mercedes Ruehl, Steve James, Irwin Keyes, and Sonny Landham.Fans will have a great time checking out such gangs as the Gramercy Riffs, the Turnbull A.C.'s, the Baseball Furies, the Lizzies, and the Rogues. The Baseball Furies are especially amusing with their bats, baseball uniforms...and clown-like makeup. The action scenes are exciting, especially one particular group fight in a mens' room, and the wrap-up is quite satisfying. The soundtrack is great, with Joe Walshs' ""In the City"" used to close out the movie.All in all, this is a movie that deserves its cult status.Eight out of 10.",The Warriors
15,LeonLouisRicci,Ultra-Stylish and Darkly Visioned Fantasy,9,22 April 2014,"This is an Odd One. It has a Reputation for being a Cult Film and it Fits Smoothly in that Category. Upon its Initial Release there were a lot of Problems. It was Viciously Attacked by Critics and Community Leaders as Glorifying Gangs and Gang Violence, among other Things.Viewed Today it is so Tame that the Charge is Laughable. The Violence in the Movie was even Mild for its Day. It was the Overall Outrageousness of the Movie that gave it that Defiant, In Your Face Tone. It is Darkly Humorous and it takes place Primarily in the Dark.It is Fantasy with Barely a Hint of Reality. The Film is Surreal and the Pacing is Packed with an Endless Parade of Painted Up, Swaggering, and Posturing Cliques of Cornball Expressionism and Comic Book Dialog.The New Director's Cut Adds Graphic Novel Art Pages with Captions that may Ruin some of the Edginess of the Original, but According to Director Walter Hill that was His Initial Vision. Even in 1979 it was not Made to be Taken Seriously, as so Many did, but a Dark Dream Like Vision of a Classic Story of Turf Warfare and a Journey Home.The Movie Holds Up Well and it doesn't Hold Up Very Well, Depending on Your Interpretation. As a 1970's Gritty Timepiece, Maybe Not, but as a Uniquely Ambitious, B-Movie with a Cool Look and a Compelling Story Combined with an Ultra-Stylish Director and Great Cinematographer, it will Do Just Fine.",The Warriors

Awesome movie from Walter Hill. Probably his best film and he's had some good ones. Terrific cast, great cinematography, and lots of quotable lines.

18,Boba_Fett1138,A true '70's cult-classic.,8,12 July 2008,"""The Warriros"" is a very unique and really great movie, that has become a real cult-classic over the years for good reasons. It's an action/adventure movie set in 'future' New York city, in which a gang called the warriors gets framed for killing a big gang leader and are therefore are on the run for all of the other many gangs active in New York City, while trying to make it back to their turf on Coney Island. So it's a movie that is constantly on the move and always has action in it, despite being an obvious fairly low budget production. The movie is like a modern odyssey.If Robert Rodriquez and Quentin Tarantino would make a remake of this now days, done in the same style as ""Sin City"", the movie would be totally awesome! This movie is basically a sort of a ""Sin City"" of the '70's, done in a comic book sort of way, only without the style and flair and more with a pure typical '70's atmosphere instead, which also works out fine on its own, although it also makes the movie outdated- and perhaps also a bit silly at the same time. Currently a remake is announced to be released in 2010, with Tony Scott attached to it as director. It could work out well. Of course I'm never a too big fan of remakes but it needs to be admitted that some 'old' pictures would make great, if not better, modern remakes. Tony Scott proofed this before with his movie ""Man on Fire"" and he is currently working on another remake ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" of the 1974 movie ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"", which in my opinion also was one of those movies that could use a modern remake.It's an unique and also odd movie, that uses some original concepts of having often strange looking gangs, with strange sounding names, fighting each other in New York City. It's set in a near futuristic world (for 1979). The concept has cult written all over it and it's a movie that really delivers. It has everything in it need to make a typical '70's cult movie, with a typical '70's atmosphere and style, mostly with its editing, chases, sexual orientated and bad '70's haircuts. Also quite interesting that the movie featured some small homosexual hinted themes. It makes the movie just a bit more edgy and daring in parts.It's obviously a movie made with limited resources. It's an early movie from Walter Hill, whose earliest movies, from the '70's mainly, strangely enough also seem to be his best. Unlike his earliest movies he doesn't use, or perhaps couldn't use, any well known actors. The movie instead uses a bunch of young unknowns, who have the looks but not really the right acting skills. The movie has some very cheesy acting in parts. Seems like unknown actors were cast deliberately to give the movie a more realistic feeling but it sort of backfires at time.Even though it might seem like and odd and sort of outdated movie, ""The Warriors"" is still one great and entertaining watch.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Warriors
19,view_and_review,Warriors Come Out to Playyay,8,22 June 2019,"This movie was such a pop culture centerpiece that it was quoted in rap songs. Most prominently, who can forget O.D.B. from the Wu-Tang Clan singing:Crews be actin like they gangs, anyway
Be like, ""Warriors! Come out and playiyay!""
This movie was an acknowledgement of the streets of New York in the 70's. Not a praise, not a ridicule, just an acknowledgement. Gangs were everywhere.All the major gangs of New York were invited to the Bronx to have a big pow-wow. They were to all send nine unarmed delegates. The meeting was being hosted by Cyrus (Roger Hill) of the Riffs, the biggest baddest gang in New York. The topic: unity. Cyrus was shot and killed in that congregation but not before gracing us with the line: ""Can you dig iiiiiiit!!"" The Warriors were blamed and so sent them on the run back to Coney Island. All they had to do was get through every gang in New York. No sweat.I have a nostalgic sweet spot for this movie. It just reminds me of my youth. No, not the gang activity, just the movie. The Warriors were such underdogs you couldn't help but root for them. And the true antagonist, Luther (David Patrick Kelly), was such a weasel you had to hate him. To me, he is in bad guy lore for most hated. It's easy to play a bad guy but only a select few ever evoke that visceral loathing. Kelly was able to do that and man!, did he enhance the movie.",The Warriors
20,Uriah43,Totally Unrealistic but Entertaining All the Same,6,11 April 2016,"Invited to attend a meeting of the most prominent gangs in New York City, the Warriors agree to the stipulated conditions of a city-wide truce and send only 9 of their members from Coney Island all the way to the Bronx. Unfortunately, when the main speaker at this event is assassinated the blame falls directly upon the Warriors--who must now navigate through hostile terrain back to their home turf with every gang in the city targeting them. To make matters even worse, they are forced to travel without their main leader who was killed at this same meeting. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although it tended to be quite flashy and unrealistic, it still turned out to be fairly entertaining all the same. One extremely memorable scene involved the leader of the gang (known as the Rogues) taunting the Warriors to ""come out to play"". Although not exactly a wise decision on his part the end result was still quite enjoyable. In any case, despite the extremely implausible plot, I still liked this picture and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",The Warriors

Finding the RockStar video game a thrill to play, I binned my old video and got the new DVD.Expecting to see the cut I'd always known, I was shocked to find that the only version on disc was a ""Director's Cut"", featuring ""Comic-Book panels"" messily slapped on to end of shots, ruining the original composition.)Spotting that the Electric cinema in Birmingham (oldest working cinema in the UK) was doing a revival showing,I got a Nightmare on Elm Street cocktail, (as The Warriors score played in foyer) entered the screening, and was excited to find the original theatrical cut being played.View on the film:Last having caught this version on video, the new (?) is one of the most outstanding film transfers/remastering I've seen, replacing the VHS fuzz with crystal clear clarity on the faces and gang costumes, along with the balance between the sounds levels of score and dialogue being kept at a perfect pitch.Riding on the subway with The Warriors backed by Barry De Vorzon's super catchy dark synch Sci-Fi styled score, co-writer/(with David Shaber) directing auteur Walter Hill & his regular cinematographer Andrew Laszlo bask in a hard-edge pulpy atmosphere. Thankfully lacking the misjudged gimmicky ""Comic Book transitions"" shoved into the Director's Cut, Hill and Laszlo attack The Warriors in purest Comic-Book ultra-stylisation, punching each of the gangs The Warriors must take on to survive with waves of primary coloured face paint and gang outfits.Filmed on the turf of actual gangs, Hill pens his anti-(super) heroes with a continuation of building the underlying ""Western"" theme, with Laszlo's push for the action to take place over one wet night leading to reflections in puddles of these gang-ruled ghost towns, and quick-draw whip-pans on other gangs attempts to pistol-whip Warriors.Loosely based on Sol Yurick, these boppers Hill and Shaber jump from a study of gang culture with the starter pistol of a assassination at a multi-gang gathering, running to a lightning fast survive the night adventure fuelled by wonderfully ripe comedic one-liners , pit stopping the gang at knife-welding lesbian and baseball player-dressed gangs pitching to defeat The Warriors.",The Warriors

All of the actors were brilliantly casted and well acted, not the least being David Patrick Kelly as highly memorable villain, Luther (Waahhrriioors come out to pllllllaahhhhyyyaaaa, is all I have to say). The new Director's cut which adds a prologue text crawl that ties it more firmly to an ancient Greek tale, as well as comic book wipes that transitions some scenes, may dumb it down a tad and spell it out for the audience too unsubtly, but it does NOT diminish from the overall greatness of the movie in the least. The superb director/ writer Walter Hill has made some all-time classics with ""48 Hrs."", ""The Getaway"", ""the Driver"", Red Heat"", among others. ALL of them much loved by me and to say that this film is hands down the best of all is quite a compliment indeed. Followed by a video game based on it by Rockstar that looks simply amazing and a planned remake that will in no way even hope to be as half as good as the original (It won't even have the great Baseball Furies, I mean, come on now!!)

23,Wuchakk,"""Who ARE the Warriors... I WANT the Warriors""",9,28 May 2014,"""The Warriors"" (1979) is perhaps the definitive cult film -- a flick you always enjoy seeing again.The story involves a Coney Island gang that gets wrongly accused of murder and must make it back home from the Bronx, fighting enemy gangs and police all the way.The 'feel' of the movie is part surreal, part realistic and wholly captivating! ""The Warriors"" is just a great flick full of memorable scenes and lines. I really love the ending where the remaining Warriors walk down the Coney Island beach while the DJ offers them a tribute song -- ""Survival In the City"" by Joe Walsh & The Eagles.I also like the fact that the Warriors are a racially mixed gang -- a group of lost souls in the urban jungle, banded together perhaps for no other reason except for the obvious fact that they're from the same urban cesspool and have a need to belong.I stated that the movie is part realistic, but only in the sense that it never becomes campy; the creators and cast properly take it all quite serious. Other than that, the flick showcases a mesmerizing fantastical New York City, that could never be mistaken for reality.The only version I've seen is the original; I've never seen the version with the comic book additions, which most people seem to criticize.The film runs 92 minutes.GRADE: A",The Warriors
24,mm-39,Entertaining but I give it a six,6,27 July 2000,"This film is entertaining, but lags in parts, and is a bit stupid.  The action scenes are incredible, and some of the dialog is entertaining, but there is some boring stretches in this one.  The best part in the movie is when Cyres gets shot, he was so annoying (can you dig it) I could see the motive behind the shooting.  My friend Tony cheered at that scene, anyways this movie is not to be taken seriously it is sorta comic book style.  When the subway caught fire and they did not get home I would of called a cab, but then we would have one very boring movie.  They got to fight there way back with these comic book dressed type gangs, one of the gangs look like a cross between alternative music Nervana and farmers.  The bad guys in this film did a very entertaining job and I was sorta rooting for them.  If you like foolish movies ie Repo Man rent this one.",The Warriors

I remember the day I watched this movie for the first time and I absolutely loved it. You would go out with your mates watching this movie and would come out of the theater like the world belonged to you. True friendship, sticking up for each other, walking through enemy territory. I loved that feeling. When I decided to watch this movie once again after so many years passing by I was wondering if I would still find it that good, because some movies I liked from those days didn't age that well and now I find them boring and I can't even remember what I liked about it. But this one stood the age of time so well. It will always stay one of my favorite movies. As gang related movies go this is by far the best movie ever made. When I went to New York, more then 30 years after the release of the movie, the only thing I really wanted to do there was going to Coney Island, take a picture on the beach with the big wheel in the background, and scream Warrrrrriors come out and playyyyyy.

The gang called the Warriors are from Coney Island and during the rally the leader is killed and the Warriors are blamed for the killing. Swan, (Michael Beck) is the leader of the Warriors and he has to fight his gang back to Coney Island, but standing in their way are some of the worst cold blooded gangs in New York City.

27,siderite,The raw stuff,9,27 October 2008,"This wasn't a great movie, but it had what it takes. You know when a film starts with an idea and then everything except the idea is to fill up the 2 hours? That's not what happened here. Here the idea was the film, and nothing else really mattered.As the novel was based on a Greek ancient story, the movie also had the same connotations, but it could just as well be an RPG game or a fantasy novel. You have a group of ""warriors"" fighting to get back to their own territory, to safety, while all kind of colorful enemies are trying to ambush them. And it's not even a now classic type of a team, with specialised roles, just a bunch of guys, so you never know what will happen and to whom. Simple idea, simple movie, direct delivery. The music was OK, all 70's tracks, the acting was decent, the dialogues a bit weird for this millennium, but reasonable.Bottom line: It is easy to understand why it has achieved a cult status and why there is a remake planned for 2010. If you enter the atmosphere of the 70's gang lands and empathise with the heroes, you will not be disappointed. If you expect a cinematic masterpiece, you should look elsewhere.",The Warriors
28,MovieAddict2016,"""Warriors...WARRIORS! Come out and play-ee-AYYY!"" A really fun, cheesy suspense flick",8,16 October 2005,"""The Warriors"" is a film that takes place in New York City during the hellish hours after dark, when the gangs emerge to roam the streets and search for their prey.One of these gangs, named The Warriors, agree to attend a gang meeting orchestrated by the enigmatic Cyrus (Roger Hill). Each gang sends nine unarmed delegates to attend the huge meeting; however, Cyrus is murdered by a thug, who blames the crime on the Warriors. They flee for their lives into the night, and soon every gang in New York City is looking for them.First things first: this movie is cheesy. The beginning is pretty laughable. The musical score is very much late '70s/early '80s electronica.But that is part of the movie's charm. Its polished big budget remake is coming out next year (2006), and I personally feel it will fail because part of the success of this original film is that it IS low budget, poorly edited at times and simply a lot of fun to watch.It is very reminiscent of John Carpenter's 1976 low budget classic ""Assault on Precinct 13."" It achieves its thrills through heavy suspense; as the Warriors prowl the streets heading back to their home turf we never know when a rival gang will appear out of nowhere and attack. The movie is now a video game by Rockstar Entertainment, and it's one of the few movies for which a video game actually seems to make sense - it feels very much like a level progression where bad guys attack the good guys, who have to use their brawn and brains to overcome them.Is ""The Warriors"" a great film? No. From a technical standpoint, it's terrible. In terms of entertainment, it is extremely gripping. I was really enthralled. In recent years, Walter Hill has provided us with some really awful films, but ""The Warriors"" is a strong reminder that he once had a solid vision...it's too bad he's lost that now.",The Warriors
29,Red-Barracuda,Stylish and camp New York City action,9,29 June 2015,"In the early 80's when I was around ten years old if there was one film you had to see on home video, it was The Warriors. Luckily, a friend and I managed to sneak a viewing of this movie and naturally we loved every minute of it. I remember about a decade later revisiting it and being somewhat alarmed to discover that the violent, scary thriller I had seen all those years before was actually decidedly more camp that vicious! But I think that the highly stylised presentation is probably one of the key reasons that this has become such a cult classic, the New York presented here never existed in the first place and the effect is one of hyper-realism rather than gritty-realism. Consequently, it exists in its own reality and, hence, has dated quite well. That said, quite a lot of people end up being disappointed with this film for the above reasons, as there is still an expectation that it is going to be tough and raw, rather than campy and super-stylised.The Warriors was directed by Walter Hill who at the time was in the middle of a very strong run of tough guy movies. Like his previous film The Driver (1978) this one presented its urban action and thrills in a hyper-stylised manner, although The Warriors takes things much further. Although it is never exactly specified, it almost feels like the New York presented here is one set in the near-future. It is, after all, a city over-run by costumed street gangs who control designated areas; these include the Baseball Furies, The Rogues and the Lizzies. It feels closer to A Clockwork Orange (1971) than to an urban drama. Its story is high concept simplicity. A night-time mass meeting of the various NYC gangs is held in a park in the Bronx, organised by Cyrus, the charismatic leader of the biggest gang in the city. He is subsequently shot dead by the unbalanced leader of the Rogues who blames the Warriors for his actions leading to them having to navigate the city back home to Coney Island while every gang on the streets is out for their blood.Shot on-location at night, the mean streets, parks and subways of late 70's NYC are used to great effect here. This was in the days when the city really was crime-riddled and dangerous and the film plays off this perception. No one is out after lights out except for gangs, police and hookers. In fairness, despite charismatic turns by David Patrick Kelly as Luther and James Remar as Ajax, the real star of The Warriors is the city itself. Offset by a pulsating soundtrack by Barry De Vorzon and great cinematography by Andrew Laszlo, the night time New York is presented with considerable style and verve, while it was also nice touch having events commented on by a mysterious disembodied radio presenter who broadcasts the latest situation to all the denizens of the night. All-in-all, this pretty iconic action flick remains a one of a kind movie and I expect it will remain popular for some time because of this.",The Warriors

It is a fantastic story filled with action, some adventure, and an unexpected side-story romance. It's not the type of film that most people would enjoy - yet it is good. It seems to be more of a cult classic these days than a movie that still draws a large crowd - narrowed down the select few cult followers.If you generally have an open-mind to watching older films, crime, dramas and action films then you just might like this flick. It shows the problems of gang-life, troubled young adults, and ghetto living. Some great 1970s era action going on in this movie!

32,theowinthrop,"Believe it or not, a piece of classical Greek history transposed",8,24 April 2007,"I remember seeing this when it came out in 1979. It upset many people for it's nod at the idea of street gangs as good guys. Actually, it is a bit more than that - and the street gangs are definitely not all good guys.If you study ancient Greek literature, there are three classic Greek historians. We met a bit with Herodotus, who was the first with a surviving, in - tact history, . His account of the battle of Thermopolye is the account used in the movie ""The 300 Spartans"" (that I reviewed) and the more recent ""The 300"". Thucydides wrote a classic denunciation of war and imperialist aggression ""The Peloponesian War"", which is still in print. The third of the classic historians was Xenophon, a military man of aristocratic background. He is of interest to us because of a memoir he wrote called ""The Anabasis"" (more shortly), and because of his close friendship as a student to Socrates. He wrote several books about Socrates, which are (with Plato's writings) all we have to know of the Greek philosopher.Now, ""The Anabasis"" is not (except briefly at the start) about Socrates. It's English title is usually ""The March Up-Country"", or ""The Ten Thousand"". The story begins about the year 404 B.C. The long, and fruitless war between Athens and Sparta has ended in Athenian defeat, but Xenophon wants to continue learning his chosen trade of warfare. So he asks advice from Socrates if he should go and join an expedition to support a pretender to the Persian throne in a Civil War there. Socrates looks at the problem and then basically says that if Xenophon thinks it will be of help to him to do it. The leader that Xenophon (who is technically a Greek mercenary) is Prince Cyrus the Younger. Note the name - in ""The Warriors"", the charismatic leader of the attempt to unite the street gangs of New York City is Cyrus. Xenophon has left us a biography of Prince Cyrus, and he appears to have been an intelligent person - possibly worthy of being Emperor of Persia. But we will never know. He was killed in battle. His staff of generals are soon approached for a parlay with the Persian Army leaders (presumably to discuss their leaving Persian territory). Instead, they are tricked and massacred (except for one who manages to get back to Xenophon and the other 10,000 mercenaries to tell them what happened). The Persians then send word to surrender or die.The average army mercenary of the ancient world knew how to obey the orders of whoever paid him and little else. The Persians generals, having forgotten the lessons of Marathon, Thermopolye, Salamis, and Plataea, came to the totally wrong conclusion that these mercenaries would behave like any others, not do anything because their leaders were all gone, and be ready to be slaughtered. But (as Edith Hamilton says in her discussion of the story in ""The Greek Way""), they forgot these were Greek mercenaries - Greeks, no matter what city - state they came from, were more likely to think about the situation and act very carefully.The Greeks took a quick vote, and elected news leaders (including Xenophon) to be the council in charge of their army. Immediately they beefed up security, and started planning a retreat. Here they knew what was the fastest way home - head for the sea. ""The Anabasis"" tells of the weeks and months it took, but the bulk of the mercenaries eventually reach the sea coast and got back to Greece.Now that I have told you the plot of ""The Anabasis"", you can see that in it's essentials (besides the name of the hero they wish to make emperor), Xenophon's story is the story of ""The Warriors"". It has been updated to 1979 New York City (or some screenplay writers idea of 1979 New York City) but it is actually been trimmed.The Cyrus of the film feels the street gangs (with a so-called army of 100,000 total) could take over the city if they unite (under himself, of course). All the gangs meet up in Van Courtlandt Park in the Northwest Bronx to discuss this idea. But among the gangs is a trouble-making one (whose leader is one of those half demented half irritatingly childish idiots that crop up*) which assassinates Cyrus. This gang makes it look like a rival Brooklyn gang called the Warriors is responsible. (*Later, when confronted with his act and asked why he killed Cyrus, this boob only smiles in his vacant eye manner and ways ""Because I liked to!"")Van Cortlandt Park is at the northernmost border of the city of Greater New York. The Warriors happen to be a gang from south Brooklyn at Coney Island (not the southernmost border of the city - Staten Island has that honor - but roughly thirty miles from Van Cortlandt). Note: Coney Island is on the sea (like Greece). To get home the Warriors have to go through the Bronx, Manhattan, and Brooklyn, hopefully speed-ed on subways but mostly on foot. And due to the framing at the murder of Cyrus, every other gang in New York is after them.The film is actually an exciting one, as The Warriors maintain their cool, and fight (literally) all types of gangs and slowly get back to their home turf. There were some problems (I recall one sequence when the production twisted a west side subway with an east side subway stop for an effective fight sequence), but it actually all of it works. A running commentary by an underground/sexy voiced radio commentator encouraging the gangs chasing the Warriors to get them, but noting how well they fight back. I won't say anything further about the conclusion but it is not a let-down.Definitely an unexpected, and good urban jungle adventure film.",The Warriors
33,sol-kay,"Your just part of what's happening tonight, and it's all bad!",8,28 July 2004,"****SPOILERS**** ""Nine guys no weapons"" thats the word going around on the mean streets of New York City about the conditions for the big gang pow-wow up in the Bronx that ""The Warriors"" a Coney Island street gang took the subway from their home base in Southern Brooklyn to attend.Cyrus, Roger Hill, the leader of the city's biggest street gang ""The Riffs"" will be the main speaker laying out the strategy for the gangs of New York eventual take over of the city. Telling the thousands of gang members assembled at the Bronx's Van Cortlandt Park that if they unite and stop fighting with each other they can become the most powerful force in the city, five times bigger that the NYC police department, an urban army that will have the ""Big Apple"" and everything in it just for the taking. Before Cyrus can finish his speech a shot rings out from the crowd and he falls to the ground dead. Unjustly accused by the real killer of Cyrus of murdering him ""The Warriors"" are on the run for the entire film from the upper reaches of the Bronx to their home in Coney Island, the longest trek on the NYC subway. By the time that they make it back in the morning they'll not only be exonerated of Cyrus' murder but will earn the respect and admiration of all the gangs that were out to capture or kill them that horrifying night. But ""The Warriors"" paid a heavy price in their run for freedom they lost three men, Cleon Fox & Ajax, Dorsey Wright Thomas G. Walters & James Remar.One of the best movies ever about survival on the streets of New York City or any other big urban metropolis for that matter with a heart thumping run-for-your-life by the gang from Coney Island through the streets and on the subways of New York while being attacked on all sides by murderous street gangs and police alike. The gangs who got the word from the Riffs high command to waste ""The Warriors"" for the death of their leader Cyrus make ""The Warriors"" long journey back to Brooklyn like a journey through the bowels of hell itself. The movie ""The Warriors"" is more like a movie about a group of soldiers then that of an urban street gang who's trapped behind enemy lines, and being attacked by the enemy forces from all sides, as they try to make it safely back to their home base in Coney Island fighting for their lives every step of the way. There are a number of penetrating and individual stories among those involved. There's Swan, Michael Beck,who took over the leadership of ""The Warriors"" when their leader Cleon was wasted at the beginning of the film. Cool sure of himself and intelligent Swan guided the battered group back home under conditions as deadly as any a group of fighters would face in a real war zone. There's Ajax, James Remer, who's macho attitude as well as his big stud image of himself got the best of him when he was hand cuffed to a park bench and clobbered by the police when he tried to ""make it"", against the advice of his fellow ""Warriors"", with an undercover policewoman. There's Rembrandt, Marcellino Sanchez, ""The Warrior"" artist or marker who saved his fellow gang members from the girl gang ""The Lizzies"" when he realized that they were setting him and his fellow ""Warriors"" up for the kill. And there was Mercy, Deborah Van Valkenburgh, who hitched on with ""The Warriors"" after inciting the gang ""The Orphans"" on them. We soon begin to see, like Swan did, that her yarning for violence and excitement was a cover for the loveless and hopeless life that she led. By the end of the movie with the sun rising over the sands and ocean of Coney Island and ""The Warriors"" back home vindicated and free from gang attacks they come to realize after that night of horrors that thy just lived through things will only get better because the worst that they could have ever imagined to have happened was now behind them. Powerful movie that has reached cult status since it's release back in 1979 and justifiably so; the movie ""The Warriors"" is defiantly a WINNER.",The Warriors
34,Robert_duder,"70's gang story is pure fiction, and pure fun!!",8,4 February 2006,"The Warriors is unique in that it is NOT any social commentary about gangs, it doesn't speak anything about violence in the streets, gang warfare or any of that. Rather it's the story of an almost Apocalyptic New York sometime in the future (undisclosed) where the streets are run by different types of gangs. Now this isn't a story where you'll find Hell's Angels or The Rippers but rather fictional more loud character gangs like The Lizzie's, The Baseball Fury's, The Orphan's etc. Unique characters all dressed alike so you know who The infamous Warriors are up against. The Warriors in this case are nine delegates from a presumably much larger gang. These delegates are making their way to a central location to meet with every gang in the city, and to hear one man speak. He's the leader of the cities largest gang, his name is Cyrus. Cyrus hopes to bring together all the gangs, side by side, no violence, and organize them as the cities largest army (60,000 strong) and overtake the city one block at a time. Unfortunately not everyone agrees and Cyrus is assassinated and the assassination is pinned on The Warriors. They manage to escape although one member is caught and beaten to death so the eight remaining Warriors escape and start their adventure across the city, through different gang territories with every gang in the city looking for them as they try to make it back to their head quarters.The Warriors is just an adventure, nothing more, just made for pure entertainment. The characters are vibrant and real, with big personalities and their world is dark, and violent, and apocalyptic. The idea for the story is great...these dark anti heroes who in this case are innocent of the assassination trying to make their way through this violent city with everyone out for them. James Remar, still a well known character actor, plays the feisty Ajax. Ajax is a crap disturber who wants to take on the world. He's outgoing and a powerhouse and wants to fight first, ask questions never. His performance stands out from everyones as the best. Michael Beck plays Swan, the self imposed leader of the small band of Warriors. He's a thinker, and a strategist and probably saves their lives on more than one occasion. He does a good job also as the leader, has a great quality on screen. Dorsey Wright, Brian Tyler, David Harris, Tom McKitterick, Marcelino Sánchez rounds out the roles of The Warriors. They all deserve mention because throughout the film they draw you into their ""gang"" and you feel connected to them. You root for them in every situation and they make great heroes. They all make believable gang members without being campy whatsoever which certainly this film could have done. Deborah Van Valkenburgh plays the lead actress Mercy who leaves the Orphan gang to follow Swan through the city. Her character is feisty, and fiery and her and Swan have good chemistry and she's the typical eighties type film beauty. The rest of the cast is made of the gangs that they come across on their trek across the city. It's hard for any of their performances to stand out because they all look the same and are meant to be carbon copy enemies for The Warriors to beat. Still the gangs are well written, original, and video game like enemies (considering The Warriors is now a video game...it's ironic.) The Warriors is such a unique adventure film with such high points for it. Unique, interesting, action packed. The fight scenes are brutal and pretty well choreographed with the exception of a few badly placed punches. The fights are still fun and violent with a massively interactive environment (smashing people through doors, windows, stalls etc.) Having them have to fight, sneak, run their way through this city is intense and all the while having the mystery unfold of who did assassinate Cyrus. Also adding to the cast was the voice of the radio announcer played by the late, and very great Lynne Thigpen. Gritty doesn't even describe this film and despite some complaints about the comic book layout of the film which apparently was new to the DVD and the original didn't do it...I thought it was very well done and a great addition and rolled very smoothly. I think a unique special effect like that added a whole new element to it. Director Walter Hill certainly created something original and brutal and a classic. I'm sure it shocked back in the seventies and although it's pretty tame to today's standards you can still imagine the uproar. If it took the Rockstar video game to bring the movie to the forefront than so be it because it's a worthy, entertaining and very original film. One of my favorites from this point forward. Definitely worth seeing for it's gritty and unique adventure. I'm quite surprised that no sequels followed but I'm sure a sub standard remake is right around the corner. Until then definitely see this original and enjoy something different. 8/10",The Warriors

We're talking a film high on 70s cool here, at a time when the decade was drawing to a close, with a brilliant soundtrack and some really absorbing shots of the gangs making their way to mark their territory. Hill shows a touch of the Paul Verhoeven about him with some of his more inventive scenes.We're not talking what could be described as high art here, but we definitely have a piece of cult classic on our hands, unforgettable cult classic at that, like, if you haven't already seen it, get out and see it now. ****",The Warriors
36,paul2001sw-1,The gangs of New York,6,30 May 2010,"New York City is at its grimiest in Walter Hill's 1970s film, 'The Warriors'; but the film is more entertainment than social commentary. In fact, it feels more like the set-up for a computer game than a movie. A number of implausibly mixed-race youth gangs gather in the Bronx to hear a proposal from the leader one of them that they should unify; the gangs are also strangely clean in a certain sense, interesting in clothes, women and fighting but apparently not involved in drug-dealing or other serious crime. Anyway, someone shoots the leader and a gang from Coney Island are (wrongly) suspected; they have travel home by subway right across the city at night, with the resident gang of each neighbourhood they pass through out to stop them from doing so. A lot of this film is frankly ridiculous; yet it is a great B-movie premise, and director Walter Hill was an expert at this sort of tough no-nonsense nonsense. It's certainly not 'The Wire'; but it is surprisingly fun, even from a distance of 30 years.",The Warriors
37,bowmanblue,An old school classic,7,20 November 2014,"The Warriors was quite a daring film when it was released in 1979 and still seems a little daring, even to this day. There isn't that much gore (I think I counted only one shot involving blood, which is a mere red drop in the ocean when you compare the film to the average zombie movie of today which is filled with CGI blood spurts) and the profanity isn't half as bad as you'd hear in a Tarrintino film. However, the fact that the 'heroes' we're supposed to root for are actually pretty unlikeable, consisting of a gang who gets by on thieving and beating people up, it means that there's few truly 'good' characters to identify with.The Warriors themselves are a New York gang who are framed for the murder of another gang leader and forced to go on the run to get back to their part of the city. Some people have criticised the film for being repetitive. To be fair, they do have a point. Much of the film is showing the gang escaping one rival gang after another. However, the film isn't that long and, despite there not being that much in the way of a story, the action is pretty tense.If you're a fan of crime dramas/thrillers (there's not that much here that could be described as 'action') then give this one a go. It's dark and moody and definitely a sign of the time. Would it get made today? Possibly, but the true seventies feel of it gives it some added kudos that a remake would never have.",The Warriors
38,ericstevenson,I'll be sorry for this forever,6,11 February 2018,"Of all the movies I've ever seen in my entire life, this is the most loved film that I did not like. I am so sorry and I truly wish that everyone loves this movie as much as they want, while I just thought it was okay. First of all, it's quite anti-climatic. I mean, we get all of this buildup and it just amounts to one guy getting stabbed? A lot of the movie was fairly boring. I expected this to be an action-packed adventure.Anyway, there were still a lot of good things. The little action it did have was very nice. I love the comic book layout and the panels coming to life. I thought the acting was fine and the sets and costumes were really good. It's just that this had absolutely nothing that unique in it. It's gotten to the point where I've seen so many movies I want to be wowed all the time. **1/2",The Warriors

Lost classic. The kind you do not appreciate until it is too late.The concept .... brilliant.The execution, with direction by Walter Hill ... great by 70s standards but that is also the problem.The film is so 70s it is painful. Street slang, over-acting, monologues, closeups, music, literally if you are not from that era it is impossible to relate to.Hollywood always remakes the wrong movies.

40,CuriosityKilledShawn,A review of the Director's Cut,8,28 February 2006,"As you are probably aware, so called 'unseen editions' and 'extended editions' are pretty common on DVD and are usually lousy films with some extra filler thrown in to fool unsuspecting buyers. This is not the case with The Warriors. This is one of those 'director's cuts' that really makes a difference to the overall film.First and foremost are the comic-book transitions and the new opening. Walter Hill felt that his original presentation of the film was a little lost on the audience of the time and it's subsequent cult status on video. This new cut of the film draws parallels between the Greek legend of Anabasis in the 4th century BC. It was the story of an army of Greek mercenaries who were left stranded after their leader Cyrus the Younger was killed. If they could make it through 1000 miles of hostile territory to the ocean then they would be safe.The Warriors, as you know must make it through all the tough neighborhoods of NY to Coney Island after they are wrongfully blamed for the assassination of mega-gang boss Cyrus. A loose, but truly inspired connection.Back in the 70s there weren't just certain neighborhoods in New York that you avoided. The whole damn city was infested with crime and vermin. The gangs were plentiful and they really did OWN the streets. The scenario of all gangs joining together to form one big Uber-gang may seem far fetched now but if Mayor Gulliani left the city to decay then NYs future could well have ended up this way. But the fact that the Big Apple is a helluva lot safer these days doesn't lessen the overall impact of The Warriors.As I mentioned, the Greek history inspiration is clever. But the film is actually also based on a 1950s novel by Sol Yurick and Walter Hill took a comic-book approach to bring it to life. He was aware of the film's silliness but coupled with the sense of adventure and episodic battles, a pulp fiction take could make it seem believable. But for all we know, maybe there was a gang called the Baseball Furies who went about with painted faces beating invaders to a pulp. They were wild times.This new cut of the film also makes the photography and editing more apparent. Hill frames the movie to look like comic-book panels and, as usual, Freeman Davies' (Hill's favorite editor) cutting gives The Warriors a sleek and fast-paced look on top of Hill's already muscular direction. Walter Hill is an action director of considerable talent who is often overlooked. Films such as 48 Hours (and it's under-rated sequel), Southern Comfort, Trespass and Last Man Standing have never been massive hits, so his hardcore style is only familiar to fans of his work rather than general movie audiences. Which is a shame! Now is the time to rediscover The Warriors and be reintroduced to a cult classic with this director's cut. I know a lot of people are purists and will decry this as a cheap stunt to make more money but I honestly think it's the superior, definitive version. Judge for yourself and might just agree with me.",The Warriors
41,Bored_Dragon,"""I'll shove that bat up your ass and turn you into a popsicle""",7,13 June 2019,"The film's original poster, which stated the film's tagline: ""These are the armies of the night"" and this additional phrase: ""They are 100,000 strong. They outnumber the cops five to one. They could run New York City,"" outraged and scared many people, and some of the film's early showings incited lethal violence and caused gang outbreaks.The movie is full of violence and vulgar language, and if you stand for political correctness I suggest you skip it. Although I don't consider it to be of great cinematographic value, it sure is good entertainment and it has a message to deliver.7/10",The Warriors
42,ironhorse_iv,The Warriors is coming out to play. Can you dig that?,7,16 April 2013,"Warriors! Warriors! Can you come out and play. As a kid, I use to love this movie, and now when I'm an adult, I have a different opinion. It's doesn't hold up as much. Based on Sol Yurick's 1965 novel of the same name. The movie starts out with two different scenes depending on which version, you watch. If you are watching the original, it's starts out with original daytime Coney Island Boardwalk opening with the Warriors gang, War Chief Cleon (Dorsey Wright) talking to his girlfriend about attending the big meeting of all the big gangs in New York City at The Bronx which is a horrible way to start a movie. If you are watching the Director's Cut; the film opens with night with Cleon telling a group of nine gang members about why they are going there. Cyrus (Roger Hill), the leader of the Riffs who wants to united all the gangs into one. Director Walter Hill use the Director's Cut to bring back the comic book origins from a novel by inserting actual comic book-style panels as scene transitions, complete with dialogue balloons and ""Meanwhile.."" tags. It only kinda works, as Hill destroyed numerous legendary scenes by inserting awkward zooms, awkward cuts at pivotal moments, and freezes and transitions into stylized pseudo-comic book panels. The effect of this also completely destroy the pace and feel of one of the best, stylized, urban thrillers ever to be unleashed on an unsuspecting public. He shattered the mystery of the ambient Wonder Wheel opening by inserting an absolutely unnecessary animate reference to Anabasis before it. While, the film is supposedly loosely based on the work of Greek historian Xenophon. The Warriors has nothing to do with that novel. Walter Hill did considered Orson Welles as a narrator for the movie. I think that wouldn't help the film if he did end up getting Welles. Anyways after the opening, when the group get to the Bronx, somebody killed Cyrus and framed the murder of them. Now the group of nine, must made their way back to their own turf: Coney Island while all the gangs looking for them. While, I like the original, I have to say that The Director Cut's opening is more effective beginning at night. Throughout that night, the Warriors meet some interesting looking gangs. Sadly, none of them look menacing or a threat to the Warriors. They all look a bit over the top or silly. The Baseball Furies was off the wall. Dressed in New York Yankee baseball outfits and with multi-colored face-paint, the Furies don't speak and silently chase after The Warriors armed with baseball bats. It's just looks like a bunch of Mr. Mets mascots or WWE Abe ""Knuckleball"" Schwartz trying to attack them. Surprising, they are also based on a real life gang called Second Base who wore Lettermen jackets in the 1970s. Then there are the Lizzies are an all-female gang who seduce the gang so easily. I have to say that the Warriors are just dumb horn dogs to fall for it so quickly. I think the creators name them Lizzies, since it's somewhat sounds close to lezzies. I think that was what they were trying to say with that gang. Another awful gang are the Punks. Honestly, if they went with people normally think of punks, it would be OK. But in here, the punks are wearing brightly colored outfits with dungarees like real life Chucky Dolls. Like the Baseball Furies, this gang doesn't speak and they just sit or stand and stare at their opponents. The leader of the gang wears roller skates and is armed with a flick knife. Wow, how sinister. Not! The Rogues are not as well and they are the arch-rivals of the Warriors. From Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan, The Rogues are led by Luther (David Patrick Kelly) the crazy guy who shot Cyrus just because he ""likes doing things like that"" and then frames The Warriors. Just go with it. They look like a gay BDSM erotic group. The Riffs are the biggest gang in the city and were led by Cyrus until he was shot by Luther are black martial artists who is hunting the Warriors as well. While the movie takes a comic book attempt, I just wish they made the gangs more realism. It's weird in a way that the film did have some real life gangs in the film in the Riverside Park scene like the Homicides and Mongrels. I think film shouldn't allow real life gangs in any fiction movie as it might seem that they are glorified real life crime. Still, I do dig the fiction gang Electric Eliminators bright electric yellow bomber jackets. I didn't like the crew of the Warriors too much as well. Ajax (James Remar) was just unlikeable. Complaining, calling his fellow gang members 'the f-word' and his unhealthy appetite for women. Another character, I couldn't stand was Mercy (Deborah Van Valkenburgh) like the Warriors said, is trouble. She get the Warriors nearly killed, but the Warriors new Warlord Swan (Michael Beck) allow her to tag along. What the hell? I wouldn't allow her to tag along with any reason. I do like the DJ character (Lynne Thigpen). Only seeing her lips in the movie, the gangs of New York listen to the radio DJ to get updates on the whereabouts of The Warriors to assist with the city-wide hunt to find them. I don't like what the Director's cut does to the ending. That single change is so wretchedly disgraceful that it defies belief. Don't get me wrong, I do like the movie. I like the action scenes, and I do like the soundtrack. It's still an interesting movie. I'm just think the movie is a bit overrated. Still, check it out if you can. I still dig it.",The Warriors
43,poe426,A contemporary classic...,10,13 September 2002,"Much better than the book on which it was loosely based (by Sol Yurick), Walter Hill's very linear overnight odyssey is as surreal and stylized as any action movie ever made- and one of the best. If ever the metaphor applied, it's true here: THE WARRIORS is a non-stop rollercoaster ride (via subway) that pounds along to a genuinely moving denouement. The characters are clearly delineated and their costumes as they converge for The Big Meeting lend an eerie, surreal feel to the nocturnal goings-on. Andrew Laszlo's cinematography is simply stunning. I must've seen this one half a dozen times during its initial theatrical release. If you're in the mood for first-rate filmmaking on every level (while at the same time hoping to find a really decent action flick), I highly recommend THE WARRIORS. It ranks right up there with ENTER THE DRAGON as must-see movie mayhem.",The Warriors
44,Tweetienator,Rock 'n' Roll TV,7,29 September 2021,"In my opinion, The Warriors is a kind of US version or interpretation of Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange - lots of bad ass youngsters in gangs fighting for territory and their honor, embedded in something like a future post-apocalyptic looking New York. Good action and its uniqueness make The Warriors still an interesting and entertaining piece.",The Warriors
45,digitalbeachbum,Nothing like the book,6,16 May 2021,"I think standing alone, this is a good movie. It epitomizes the 70's from what I remember. The movie was released in 1979 and by that time I was travelling to New York city almost every summer to stay with my uncle and his family. It was a good time, but I remember the gangs and reports of fighting in certain areas.It is nothing like the book from the 1960's. There are very few similarities and that is a disappointment. The book is far better than the movie because it talks about real life as a gang member in New York city.Again, as a stand alone movie, it's good. The cast are all good. The story however, the script, has a lot of holes in it. There is plenty of deus ex machina to go around. The director screwed up.The biggest hole is the idea that Luther, of The Rogues, shoots Cyrus before the cops arrive. There are far too many people at the meeting in the park and I believe that Luther should have shot Cyrus after the cops arrived. Instead the director has Luther shoot Cyrus before the cops arrive. If you have Luther shoot after the cops arrive, then the confusion has already started. No one knows who is who, what is what, then later Luther calls in to the station to tell them that The Warriors shot Cyrus. This is how the book did it.Aside from this, I think the movie is a good stand alone story, but the book is a far better story than the movie. There are some classic lines and scenes in the movie which still play well four decades later.",The Warriors
46,hellraiser7,Streets of Rage,10,27 September 2012,"This film is one of my favorite action films and films in general. This cult phenomenon has really had a great after life and continues to this day. The film was also a partial influence to comic books like ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"". And Video games like ""Double Dragon"", ""River City Ransom"", ""Streets of Rage"", and heck even had a video game of it's own which was awesome. This film was done on a low budget but it was used well once again a prime example of a budget used right. I love the production value the use of the streets as well as the wardrobe of the gangs. The plot I really love because it is simplistic and feels a bit like a video game, it's the typical one or few against the world and I love those scenarios, it's always fun to think you can fight and flight against the odds.The characters are good their not deep but don't need to be. All of them have unique personas and all have a good friendship and team dynamic, but also like the fact their all not pretty boys and girls (which is a look I'm getting sick of) but everyday people. Ajax (James Remar) he's cool it's true he's not completely likable and that's the point, he's a character that is rough around the edges, arrogant always itching for any fight, but I just like how he's got sort of a charisma, he has some really good lines like he says my favorite line in the film to the leader of the Baseball Furies, I won't say it you just have to hear it for yourself but if I ever had to go against any scumbag in a physical fight I'd like to say cool lines like that.Swan (Michael Beck) he's my favorite character. Not just is he a good leader of the Warriors but I like how he sort of has a passive aggressive type. He always knows when they have to flight but also fight and he's not afraid of doing that. He also has some good lines, he doesn't like taking crap from anyone, but I just like his voice sort of a calm but tough tone to it you sort of get this feeling he a person that's not a big talker but that's fine because he's more of a man of action. He's also just a bit rough on the edges but there is a sense of civility, like he operates on some rules.Rogue leader Luther played well by David Patrick Kelly is one of my favorite fictional villains. He's a fun villain he is a little menacing because he a psychotic with a short fuse but also just has some of the best lines, he's most infamous line no doubt is ""Warriors Come Out to Play."" the way he just says it is crazy but funny at the same time.But it's really the action, music, suspense and the style that is the main star.Style is superb it's sort of a comic book sensibility almost like something out of a Frank Miller graphic comic. It's true each of the gangs do look laughable but personally I think their cool because of how colorful they are. I love their wardrobe because it gives the gangs all a diversity and almost a sense of unique persona. My favorite wardrobe no doubt is the Warriors themselves it's simplistic but that's why it's cool and holds up, I really love the leather vests and that logo with the skull and wings on the back, I wanted one.Music is great that theme song is one of my favorite theme songs ever, some of the music during the movie mainly the battle music which is just exciting really gives you the feeling of wanting to be in the action, even like the end theme from the ""Eagles"" and I'm not a fan of that band but that song is one of the exceptions I make.The suspense is great the streets and their darkness really create a feeling of a world turned against you and that there could be gang members hiding in the shadows or simply on the next street. The action is superb the choreography is spot on, it doesn't look too smooth which is a good thing because the fights look realistic, just seeing them use their fists, feet, street weapons, even their enviorment. I just love seeing them battle in urban settings their my second favorite battlefield because there are just so many areas and colorful enviorments to use and access. Of course my favorite battle is no doubt the infamous bathroom brawl, it was just awesome because it's in such a small space but it is used well and just complete chaos seeing the Warriors beat the crap out of the Suspender Gang.The Warriors is tough enough.Rating: 4 stars",The Warriors
47,Captain_Couth,Awesome cheesy 70's street gang flick!,9,11 June 2004,"The Warriors (1979) was Walter Hill's street gang masterpiece. It's so cheesy and highly entertaining. The Warriors, along with all of the street gangs in the New York City area are invited to a ""street gang ""convention"" headed by the leader of the city's biggest gang Cyrus. Cyrus has a vision, to unite all the gangs and take over the city. Each gang brings their leader and eight ""representatives"" to the meeting. The film follows the gang with it's main emphasis on the Warriors.These are no ordinary street gangs. They're as flamboyant as their names. You have gangs of mimes, baseball playing clowns, greaser gangs, rejects from the ""Wanderers"" (by the way another great film about street gangs), skinheads, kung-fu gangs, a lesbian gang , a redneck gang and one gang that actually ""pays"" to get on the subway! Despite the movie being filled with cartoonish gangs, this movie took a lot of heat for ""glorifying"" the gangs and caused major problems with violence amongst the movie going patrons in several cities.If you're in the mood for a good old fashion cheese fest filled with hard edge violence, bad dialog, over the top acting and blatant homo-eroticism then this movie's for you. Grab some popcorn and a couple a beers cause it's movie time! Highly recommended.P.S. Check out the musical solo by Luther (David Patrick Kelly) accompanied by coke bottles!",The Warriors
48,elshikh4,"Where everybody says ""This is Classic"", and nobody tells why !",2,5 December 2016,"So when you watch a movie, what do you expect? Maybe some fun, or some thing to think about, or both. The trouble with The Warriors is that it has none of the above, AND an army of lovers as well!While everybody says that it's a great movie, they always forget to tell why. And when I watched it, I didn't find it great at all, yet for endless reasons..It has a very thin, fragile, rather nonexistent plot. So someone framed some ones, therefore they're chased by other some ones. In other movies, that could make an action, comedy, kids cartoon, or art house movie. But here, it isn't this or that. It's a desert, full of air, with horrifying silence!Why The Warriors are framed? The movie's ghost of a script answers proudly through the framer himself: ""No reason. I just like doing things like that!"". Smart motive? Nope. It's stupid laziness!Then, who's the movie's ""evil guy""? OK, he was some guy, who looks confident, and does nothing but listening to the news flash every now and then. For me, he was useful only for a good laugh; especially when he shows up wearing sunglasses at night, and in doors!So what about the conflict? Well, it's a loop; where the leads meet one gang, fight them, and then escape, one time after another. The only thing that may change is the gang's name, costume, and gender. I believe that in the lowest movies, video games, or comics, there must be a kind of aggravation; where the conflict's steps get harder, and the fights get hotter, leading to a big climax. This time, FORGET IT UTTERLY. Nobody cared of doing anything like this. Insignificance was the name of the game, and they played it devotedly!What about the characterization? Nihility my friend. The Warriors' leader is the leader for what exactly?! I don't know, and the movie itself doesn't know. There is some rival for him, who's here to call everybody ""Faggot!!"", and doesn't do a thing else, not even being a ""rival"" in anyway. The leads are 8 copies of blank original that has no back story, no clear marks, and sometimes no dialogue!I'm clueless how that movie was criticized for its violence at the time?! Enough to say that it's an action that has no action in the first place. Any Tom & Jerry short had tons of action compared to this sterility!The details are strange for strangeness. I mean an empty city that has only gangs?!! So where are the people that these gangs robe?? Moreover, subway that has no tickets, and no passengers. Police forces, and thugs, that have no guns. And a movie that has no mind!And after years and years of releasing it cinematically, the movie's makers remembered noting on the DVD edition that it takes place in the future. But what did happen in that future to make New York a deserted city, that has thousands of criminals, 1 newsstand, and so vigilant vice squad?!! 2 years later, John Carpenter would fix it up, and do it more correct, in Escape from New York (1981), by turning the whole city into a huge and crowded prison. See, nice things happen when you use your head a little!Does it have a satire? YEAH. In one moment, a group of well-dressed boys and girls, coming out of a prom maybe, run into the dusty leads in the subway. Ahh, the war of classes, the social irony, and the eloquent visual commentary! To tell you the truth, I'm bluffing. Because in terms of intellectual depth, seriousness, or any point of view; our dear movie is between mute and naive!So what's here to enjoy, or to watch?? I'll tell you: Andrew Laszlo's cinematography, the special atmosphere, the different gangs' designing, the songs, the no cheap dealing; by avoiding immersing us in sex, drugs, and cursing (a la today's movies), and the pure ambition of remaking Xenophon's Anabasis in some modern time.It's pathetic that director Walter Hill tried to make a meaning out of this joke on his 2005 Director's Cut DVD edition, when he added an opening prologue to link the movie to Anabasis, and to assure that we're about to watch ""A story of courage"". It takes a lot of carriage indeed to make a movie that bad, and that vapid, then dare to connect it with something surely million times better and richer!I really can't understand how The Warriors is called a masterpiece, a cult classic, a great movie. Actually these allegations are great nonsense themselves. Because this is the worst remake of The Fugitive I have ever seen, one of the emptiest movies in history, and an extremely overrated dud. It may have any meaning though in the context of America in the 1970s. However, I'm not an American, and I didn't watch it in the 1970s. Congratulations for its 70s-American-fans exclusive group then. I just hope that someday, one of them tells us a reason for this movie's greatness. Otherwise they're talking about another movie, with the same title, that I didn't watch yet!Finally, a question: How at one point the leads managed to outrun a speeding bus.. on their feet??!!",The Warriors
49,thinker1691,"""You're Standing With Nine Guys, . . . from a Hundred Gangs""",9,11 July 2007,"History has always been a good source for great stories. One such tale comes from ancient Persia, where a band of Greek Soldiers become trapped behind enemy lines and are threatened by deadly enemy soldiers and obstacles. Their harrowing story is the foundation of an updated novel by Sol Yurick. The book becomes a film by Walter Hill and is called ""The Warriors."" In this modernized version an extraordinary gang leader named Cyrus, (Roger Hill) also called, 'The One and Only' calls for a summit of every important gang of New York. His purpose? The same one which has plagued mankind since history began. Among the hundreds of gangs who are invited are, The Warriors, a unique and particularly cohesive gang from Coney Island. The reason for the success of the film is due in no small measure to the multi-talented actors in it, like David Patrick Kelly who plays 'Luthor' the vicious gang leader of The Rouges. Unlike him, the Leader of the Warriors is intelligent and courageous. His name is Cleon (Dorsey Wright). His chosen second in command for War Chief is called Swan, (Michael Beck). James Remar (Supurb acting) plays Ajax, a tough and brutal fighter with an equally large chip on his shoulder. Together with six other gang members; Brian Tyler as Snow, David Harris is Cochise, Tom McKitterick as Cowboy, Marcelino Sánchez is Rembrandt, Terry Michos as Vermin and Thomas Waites as Fox, journey up to the Bronx for the important item. Once there, they listen to Cyrus, become interested and then suddenly find themselves the target of every gang assembled. Their only recourse is to get back to their own territory, before they are annihilated by the rest of the major gangs. A serious and well choreographed gang movie, for anyone who's been waiting for one. ****",The Warriors

A simple, violent and very entertaining little film.Set in New York, Cyrus (Roger Hill), a powerful, charismatic and intelligence gang leader invites the leaders of street gangs to attend a meeting expressing his idea for how all the street gangs of New York can unite and take control of the city. But before he can for fulfill his dream he ends up getting killed by a random gang member and the Warriors end up getting the blame. The Warriors are forced to get back to safety from the Bronx to their home-tuft in Coney Island, with every gang in New York hunting them, and prove their innocents.It's a simple, but fun idea, a great premise and easy viewing. It set in one night and Walter Hill knows how to make a fast paced film. Walter Hill brings a dark tone to the film, giving it a Clockwork Orange kind of feel. It is a ground level dystopia with society breaking down and violence ruling the streets and the police struggling to keep control. You get some gangs like the Warriors which seem like a normal street gang, whilst have a theme, like baseball uniforms or greasers etc... Some of the acting is a little ropey, but it doesn't matter when storytelling is this good, and Walter Hill knows set pieces. There is also a very good soundtrack to this film.",The Warriors

This is a film that's admirable for its inner fire, and its determination, if not for its execution or storytelling. In a sense, it almost works as a sheer abstract; lingering shots of graffiti-laden subway cars and dark, wet city streets abound, lending it value as something of a time capsule in the modern light. The plot is adorably simple, though, and overacted at every turn. It's no surprise to see this as the first or second film on nearly every actor's resume, although I'm not sure a more accomplished thespian could do more with the script, which left me laughing from its sheer absurdity more than once. It's more of a visual film anyway, reliant upon the cityscapes and quaintly-themed gang ensembles to do most of the heavy lifting. That's a wise decision, as it's generally entertaining to look at, though the aforementioned gangs vary from laughable (an entire syndicate of mimes) to, actually, pretty cool (lots of stylish fedoras in this flick). Unfortunately, there's a serious lack of violence for this kind of picture (flight seems to be the word of the day) and the second act drags on for so long, there's barely any time for adequate resolution at the end. A valiant effort, not to mention an influential one, but not a particularly good film of its own right.",The Warriors

Following Cyrus' assassination every gang member in New York is hunting for The Warriors and they must try to make it back to their home town in Coney Island against seemingly impossible odds...In its most simplest form The Warriors is a chase picture and in its most simplest form this is what makes it fun and enjoyable. This is most evident in the first half of the film with the gangs first escape (which is pretty tense). It carries on in this vein when The Warriors encounter The Orphans; there is still a modicum of tension, but it does lose impetus slightly in this particular scene as it feels more like Wild West than gang-warfare.The speedy pace and intensity in the second half doesn't quite match up to what I witnessed in the first half; when The Warriors become separated the group dynamic sort of becomes lost and undoubtedly the weakest part of the film was when 3 of The Warriors hook up with the girls at Union Square. It's obvious from the moment that they meet the girls who they are and what they are doing so there's no suspense or element of surprise and it's actually The Warriors own egos that results in them being caught short. Whilst The Warriors is a fun film and is fairly enjoyable; it moves fast, it boasts some good fight scenes and some great or maybe not so great hairstyles it sadly misses out on being a brilliant film. There's no real depth to the film and the gang-culture/rivalry isn't really explored; they seem to all be at war, but why? With a bit more effort, this could have been an excellent social commentary. As it is The Warriors is an entertaining film, but it is rather shallow and simplistic and is perhaps not as great as it could have been.There are other weaknesses with the film such as poor/hammy acting and rather poor editing, but in its simplest form this is a fun romp that tickes enough boxes to make it worth watching, but not quite enough for it to be considered a masterpiece.",The Warriors
55,Nazi_Fighter_David,"Patrick Kelly, the best soft-spoken killer since Andy Robinson in ""Dirty Harry.""",9,19 October 2003,"A gang called the 'Warriors,' exhibits qualities characteristic of classical heroes: gallantry, self-pride, loyalty, discipline, and most of all, the ability to fight...It is night in New York city... Nine leather-vested members of this small bunch, board a subway leaving their Coney Island turf and travel to Van Cortland Park in The Bronx...The 'Warriors' are only one of many in New York street gangs who have sent representatives to a unification meeting called by Cyrus (Roger Hill), the lord of the largest and most powerful gang in the city, the Gramercy Riffsa black gang all in their silk pajamas and Kung Fu shirts...Cyrus speaks to the huge gathering, explaining that all the gangs must unite, that together they outnumber the police three to one, that together they can consolidate forces and rule the city... There is wild cheering... And suddenly, out of no where, a mean, small-minded person pulls his gun and shoots to kill... The cowardly little guy of the Rogues quickly yells out that is was Cleon (Dorsey Wright), the Warriors' chief, who killed the legendary leader...In the confusion, and while the police crowds into the park and the congregated gangs flee, Cleon 'get busted' by those who think he murdered Cyrus...Without their leader, the Warriors 'got to stick together, and fight-to-survive.' They attempt to make the long hazardous journey to Coney Island hunted by every gang and cop...Swan (Michael Beck), the cool headed 'war chief,' assumes command... Of his followers only Ajax (James Remar) gives him trouble...Their perilous journey home is filled with considerable amount of risks as they face violent encounters with different gangs in many shapes and colors...'The Warriors' is a film that will make most viewers cringe at times, but you'll forgive the shortcomings and praise the exciting camera-work, the excellent use of music, and the good performance of David Patrick Kelly, the best soft-spoken killer since Andy Robinson in ""Dirty Harry."" The great moment in the movie is when Patrick Kelly, clicking together three soda bottles, coaxes the Warriors out of hiding by whining over and over, ""Warriors, come out and play!""",The Warriors

The Warriors truly is a 70s Classic, an exciting urban Thriller set in the neon drenched night time world of street gangs in New York City. This is a fantasy film but full of reality of the times & the gritty-violent battleground that New York City was back in the 70s & 80s & this movie captures everything & it's actually beautiful to look at with all those colourful gang costumes & glowing Neon lights in the background, the cinematography is stunning.The Warriors gang are set up for an assassination & are basically just being hunted & chased through the dangerous city streets & it's so much fun!!! Great characters such as warriors leader SWAN played with tough intensity by Michael Beck or AJAX played with Anger & a mouth by James Remar!!! A BEAUTIFUL looking movie thanks to Andrew Laszlo the fantastic cinematographer & directed with fast exciting & thrilling intensity by the great WALTER HILL",The Warriors
58,alansabljakovic-39044,A movie for all times,9,24 November 2018,Finally watched this classic and omg I wasn't disappointed. Walter's Hill masterpiece that hasn't aged a day. I have nothing to say but the words of praise. The story is absolutely great about bands of New York and how Warriors try to go back home. Awesome action flick for all ages and you should really see it if you haven't. I don't know anyone that doesn't like this movie.,The Warriors
59,fertilecelluloid,Revolutionary action pic that still holds its own,8,16 April 2006,"In 1979, when I first saw this movie at a theater, it was a very impactful work. It had superb fight choreography, slick night photography (by Andrew Laszlo), and a great anti-establishment, renegade vibe that distinguished it from other films of its era. In the US, some theaters had problems with gangs who attended the movie, so Paramount, responding to these complaints, swiftly pulled the pic -- after it had made some decent bucks already, of course. It was a revolutionary work, and managed to plonk a crown of some sort on the head of director Walter Hill. Previously, Hill had directed the amazing ""Hard Times"", one of the best films ever made (see my review), and had scripted ""The Getaway"" for McQueen and MacGraw. The ""directors cut"" of the movie, now on DVD, adds a short prologue featuring comic book frames. Apart from that, nothing has changed. Today, the film feels a little dated because it was so contemporary at the time, but it still possesses a raw energy and is an exciting urban adventure that deserves a new, younger, appreciative audience.",The Warriors
60,dworldeater,Never forget The Warriors,10,2 December 2014,"The Warriors is an action packed cult hit that really put director Walter Hill on the map. As a big fan of his work, I would have to regard The Warriors as one of his best and most original films. When a truce is called and delegates from all the top street gangs in NYC meet at the request of the leader of the largest gang in the area(The Gramercy Riffs)things go awry as leader Cyrus is shot and The Warriors are unjustly accused. The Warriors are now a target for all the gangs in The Rotten Apple for the death of the most beloved Cyrus. Our heroes must ""bop"" their way back to Coney Island and weather the attacks from every rival gang in their path. While the film looks great and is heavily stylized, there is nothing artsy fartsy going on here. The Warriors is as hard as the streets you drove on to get here. Complete with an atmospheric synthesizer score and primal ultra macho performances, The Warriors is in a class of its own. The fights are raw and realistic. There really is no other movie quite like it and The Warriors stand hard and stand alone. It is no surprise to me that to this day the film is still popular and regarded as a cult classic. Can you dig it? Of course you can!",The Warriors
61,Agent10,Great cult film,7,13 August 2002,"A cheesy action film may have been what was intended with this film, but it turned into a cool cult film that contemporary film buffs like myself can sit back and say `What a piece of crap, but I like it!' I label this film under my personal rating of `brilliant stupidity' which is difficult to achieve under my standards (it joins Repo Man, Buckaroo Banzai, Jack Frost 2, Flesh Gordon and Jason X), which basically means it is so darn silly you can't help liking it. The make-up, the costumes, the often times cheesy action and the cohesion of the characters really makes this an interesting film to watch. I especially loved how all of the gangs had different themes and costumes. Kudos to the costume department. Hopefully, this will remain one of those cool cult films.",The Warriors
62,ShootingShark,"Can You Count, Suckers ?",8,13 May 2007,"The Warriors, nine guys from Coney Island, attend a huge New York gangs meeting in the Bronx, given by a big boss called Cyrus. When Cyrus is shot dead and the Warriors are blamed, they must fight their way fifty miles home, with every rival gang-member and cop in New York looking to bust their heads ...Based on a novel by Sol Yurick, which was in turn based on the Greek legend of Xenophon's Anabasis, this for me is the definitive gang picture. What makes it so good is the style, which largely eschews social commentary and kitchen-sink realism in favour of comic-book action and adventure-story traditions of courage and loyalty. It's essentially one big, long, ninety-minute chase movie, as our heroes race home through streets, parks and subway stations, bruising and dodging all the way, driven along by a fantastically edgy electro-rock score by Barry DeVorzon. Craig Baxley's choreography for the numerous fights (my favourite is the escape from the Lizzies) is superb, and Bobbie Manix' costumes are just absolutely sensational - forget about All That Jazz, if ever a movie should have won an award for costume design, this is it. Each gang wears wild, garish colours - denim and leather, panama hats, baseball strips, mime outfits, yellow jackets, tan waistcoats, black kimonos - allowing us to identify our protagonists and adding bags of style to the picture. The young cast are varied but all iconic, and sultry Van Valkenburgh, ferocious Remar and loopy Kelly come off best, with a fine little bit by Hill as the short-lived Cyrus. Some view this movie as superficial, or glorifying its violence, but they're dead wrong. The gang kids aren't simply punks, they're archetypes, surviving through courage, intelligence, self-awareness and friendship, and we want them to get back home. As well as all the frantic action there are lots of poignant moments too, like the one where Van Valkenburgh looks at the preppie couple opposite her, starts to brush her hair, only to have Beck stop her. Beautifully shot all over New York City by Andrew Laszlo and extremely well directed by Hill, this is a thought-provoking action cult classic. Trivia - talented actor Waites, who plays Fox (the shooting witness) appears unbilled. This review is of the 2005 Ultimate Director's Cut DVD version, which adds a little opening narration and some stylish animated cut-frames to the original movie, making the historical and comic-book origins more explicit.",The Warriors

Can you dig it? The plan fails immediately when someone shoots the leader and then blames The Warriors for the assassination. Our heroes then have to fight every gang between Central Park and Coney Island in order to get home. Gangs include the bat wielding Baseball Furies, the school bus riding Turnbull AC's, the all-girl Lizzies, the overall-wearing Punks, Chinatown's Savage Huns, and many, many, more awesomely costumed and colorful gangs. This film is likely one of my desert island films, as in, if I were trapped on a deserted island and could only take ten films with me, what films would they be? For such a list, you might not jump to Ingmar Bergman or other heady fare, but might rather seek pure escapist entertainment, and that is exactly what this film excels in. ""The Warriors"" is a film that I have lost all objectivity on. I don't know how many times I've watched it and can probably quote almost every line. I love the film's gritty, grimy 1970s pre-Giuliani NYC feel. It's not necessarily a realistic representation of the city, as was ""The French Connection,"" but is a comic book version that is utterly enthralling. ""The Warriors"" was notorious at the time of it's release for incidents of gang violence breaking out in the theaters, which were attributed to the level of violence in the film. Though the violence is comparatively tame by todays standards, it none-the-less remains wildly exciting even by modern standards. Action sequences don't get much better than James Remar taking on a face-painted Baseball Fury, or the subway bathroom fight, or the shootout at the Lizzie's hideout. Producer/writer/director Walter Hill knows his way around an action sequence better than most directors and those talents are on full display here. The film has a deceptively simple story, but Hill gives the film an epic feel that I'd argue taps into Greek mythology, much like Odysseus as he faced his series of trials on his long journey home (no, really, I think it's there). Michael Beck is terrific as the leader of The Warriors (actually the Lieutenant, who's forced to take over after their leader is killed), as is the always great James Remar in his first of several appearances in Hill films.

Taking place entirely within one night, the film never slows, has an amazing soundtrack and an even better filmscore by Barry De Vorzon, and features gorgeously photography of a gritty yet comic book version of a crime ridden NYC. ""The Warriors"" is an undeniable classic that in my mind cannot be improved upon.

64,a_chinn,Original 1979 version is a classic (avoid the director's cut),10,7 August 2018,"I've seen this film many times before, but this was the first time I'd watched the new director's cut where writer/director Walter Hill added a prologue about a about a small group of Roman soldiers being trapped behind enemy lines, which I though was too on-the-nose and completely unnecessary. The film already contained subtle references to stories such as the Odyssey and the Iliad and adding this prologue gives the film an unwelcome self-importance that I found off-putting. Hill also added comic book panel style transition instead of the grainy screen-wipes he used in the original film, which had the opposite effect of the self-important prologue and instead highlighted the film's cartoony/comic book nature, and had the impact of making the film seem less serious (not to mention that the animated transitions simply looked cheap and amateurish). Hill's tinkering with his film 25-years later is worse than Ridley Scott adding the unicorn dream sequence to ""Blade Runner."" Hill's additions very nearly ruined my enjoyment of the film. The next time I watch ""The Warriors"" it will be my DVD copy of the original theatrical cut. Below is my review of the film from the last time I watched the film on 8-23-2017.The Warriors are a red leather vest (with no shirt) wearing 1970s street gang from Coney Island who travel to Central Park where the city's most powerful gang leader, Cyrus, wants to unite all the gangs of New York City.

65,Samiam3,A plot less but evocative and entertaining vision of the city that never sleeps,8,4 June 2010,"Much of what I saw in the Warriors reminded me of S.E. Hinton's once praised novel 'The Outsiders' (adapted for the screen by Francis Coppella a few years after this). However, in terms of how extensive the plotting is, these two stories could not be more different. The Warriors is so thin on story, that feels like a baby step away from a video game. The majority its ninety minute running length is made up of three things, Fighting gangs/cops, running from them, and kissing girls. This would make a very good game actually. I haven't read the book, but as a motion picture, it is surprisingly entertaining, despite some little holes along the road in need of plugging. On top of that, it functions as a fairly convincing portrayal of New York's darker side from thirty years ago.One night, every gang from every borough of New York (which is about sixty thousand people) goes to the Bronx to hear the words of Cyrus (da boss). In the middle of his speech, someone guns him down and in the chaos, points his finger at nine boys dressed in identical brown leather vests; the Warriors, a gang from Coney Island who spend the rest of the night on the run trying to get back hope. If I had to guess, I would say John Carpenter's vision for Escape from New York maybe have been influenced in part by this. the Warriors is not a pretty place to be. This motion picture shows the darker more dirty side of New York. There are no Broadway lights, fancy dressers, or bright yellow taxis here. I didn't watch the Warriors on a very big screen but even still, It felt frequently evocative and spooky.There may be some room for improvement, and there are indeed (among other things) a few shots which could have been framed better. In one, you can see half the film crew standing on the side of the road. Anyway, The Warriors is worth a watch, because it's neat and if nothing else there are not too many films like this.",The Warriors

The whole movie was exciting, the chase scenes were suspenseful(and I don't normally like chase scenes), it was tension provoking but in a good way, I wholeheartedly agree with other reviewers who say you'll feel like your right there on screen, it's true and that is what I look for in movies. Warriers is a non stop adventure where you'll feel like your right up there on screen fighting for survival. I did not see this back when it first came out, saw it more recently and was surprised at how swept into the action I got.The atmosphere was great to-gritty, non stop camera action-this is the type of movie that's pure entertainment-it'll have you on the edge of your seat which is what a good action picture is supposed to do.

It would need very stylish camera work (The Crow) to overcome it's problems, or more energy. Having no style and no energy (and a script written in at most twenty minutes), the movie just sits there as it switches between 30 equally uninteresting vignettes. All of which are supposed to be hip, but are just half-hearted. This is a young square man (Walter Hill) and an old square studios idea of ""cool."" It's at least as corny and desperately uncool as Saturday morning cartoons; the warriors are about as threatening as Captain Kool and the Kongs. The movies ideas of what is cool is howlingly bad. As in John Carpenter's equally grasping and lame The Fog, a radio DJ plays public-domain mediocrities, while attempting to be audibly cool. ""Boppers?"" Let me assure you, this word never came close to the world of cool in 1979. The only way to get through this movie is to imagine a list of edibles that would be enjoyable to lick off Michael Beck's chest.What on earth do people think this movie influenced? Streets of Fire? It's a dead end, and no achievement of any sort. It has no filmic or entertainment value.

72,winner55,"entertaining, but no classic",7,14 February 2009,"The major plus of the film is its referencing of ancient Greek legend, so that this doesn't simply inform the theme but really becomes the theme - when the Warriors finally have their moment on the beach in Coney Island, you really do get a glimpse of how Xenophon must have felt like the day he and his men at last came to the Aegean after their harrowing retreat through Persia.The comic book references are also a plus. Apparently Hill went in this direction because the studio insisted that a gang would have members from different ethnic groups, which is wholly unrealistic - gangs form in ethnic neighborhoods, and ethnophobia is one reason they form. So Hill chose a look that would emphasize the fantasy element the studio insisted on.However, the grand comic book approach is not really in Walter Hill's range. I couldn't help thinking how much better a film this would have been had John Carpenter directed (especially since Carpenter stole moments from this film for his ""Escape"" films - and improved on them). And the comic book approach also determined Hill's direction of his young cast - and let's face it, none of them crest the margin of professionalism here.There are awkward moments throughout the film. Much of it is anachronistic, almost embarrassingly so - the gang structures depicted in the film are pure 1950s; the clothing and hairstyles are late 1960s. the dialog is an off-setting mix of '50s and '60s. Within five years of the making of this film, most street gangs were becoming big business, thanks to the introduction of crack cocaine; in fact drugs are almost never used in this film, which is ridiculous. Finally, there's the music - nothing any gang member would be caught dead listening to, ever. The comic book/fantasy element simply doesn't justify or excuse these decisions, and they come off feeling like mistakes.The fight scenes are pretty good for the day but are just begging for some real martial arts to tip them over the edge. The suspicion popular in the movie's era, that this film could inspire violence among the audience, is simply hilarious now. Obviously anyone committing violence after watching this film was going to do so anyway.So we have an interesting reflection on an old Greek legend, a rapidly paced fantasy action film, and some unforgivable misfires in execution.An entertaining if sometimes silly viewing, but hardly fulfills the criteria of 'ultra-violent cult classic.'",The Warriors

I mean, that man who wears the overalls and rollerskates his way around town?  That was a little over the top.  One would think that it would be hard to rollerskate and have a FIST FIGHT at the same time.  But again, it was 1979.  Also, those gang members that dressed in baseball jerseys?  Are those guys taking steriods? I don't think I have ever seen a chase scene last so long.  They were chasing The Warriors at FULL SPRINT SPEED for like 10 minutes (movie time). Even Jesse Owens was not in THAT GOOD OF SHAPE.  Despite the strange 1979 quirks, this movie delivers the goods on many levels.  It's simply great entertainment and I would not mind buying this movie.",The Warriors
74,xredgarnetx,Great action flick,7,23 December 2007,"THE WARRIORS, a tale of gang warfare spread across New York City, is derived from a Greek story about a Spartan army battling Persian forces to get to the sea. Walter Hill, the best action director of his time, treats this basic tale with reverence, in the same way some Shakespeare plays have been updated to modern times with little or no harm done. One gang, the Warriors from Coney Island, is wrongly accused of killing a gang leader who sought to unite all the gangs. The Warriors must fight their way from the South Bronx back to Brooklyn with all sorts of colorfully named and dressed rival gangs, plus lots of cops, in hot pursuit. Hill employs a legion of mostly unknowns, some of them clearly nonactors, which obviously saved a lot of money, and he shot the movie in the gritty, garbage-strewn, pre-Giuliani New York City of the late 1970s. THE WARRIORS is hindered only by the time frame in which it was filmed, the late 1970s. It is downright cartoonish and not one of these so-called gang members would last one minute on the actual streets of New York. If you don't believe me, check out the Web site that lists all the gangs of the time and just look at their members. Very scary. On the other hand, if the gang members in the movie looked like the real gang members of the period, no one would watch this film. The movie can be viewed as a drama, and it does get pretty intense at times. But it can also be viewed as little more than a comic book, as there is virtually no blood spilled and few characters die or are even hurt. Hill employs comic book freeze frames from time to time throughout the movie. You might think you're watching a graphic novel, if there had been graphic novels in the 1970s. Talks of a remake mercifully have fallen apart, although it might have been interesting to see some of the fights redone with modern choreography and technology -- and a larger budget. I'm thinking mainly of the fight in the subway men's room, the highlight of the movie. Of course, you couldn't remake this film without keeping it in the same period. Every gang member today would have a gun. Guns are largely absent in this film, which even then makes it pure fantasy. A must-see. A young Michael Beck and James Remar are the closest to stars in this huge team effort.",The Warriors

It's entertaining, tough and tight, the story is both emotionally gripping and visually stunning, a dirty piece of pure violence and adrenaline. Certainly one of the greatest cults of all time, among gang (not gangster..) movies shot in the seventies and eighties. It doesn't star any famous actor, but it is a pleasure to watch regardless. Wonder why a decent sequel of this notorious film, among many stupid sequels, hasn't been released yet coz this film was really successful. In conclusion a must-see movie, in spite of the quality filming not that great",The Warriors
76,TheUnknown837-1,"An over-the-top, slaphappy yarn whose cult appeal unfortunately flew over me",6,19 November 2010,"Walter Hill's ""The Warriors"" is a film that I am so surprised that I did not enjoy. It comes from the 1970s, after the era of the silly disaster flicks like ""Earthquake"" of which I am so guiltily fond of. Very much like that film I just mentioned, it is an enthusiastic, well-produced (and corny) Sunday morning satire, this time about New York City street gangs.The movie opens up with a congregation of gangs in Brooklyn. A well-respected hood is standing above his slaphappy peers as if he were a hoodlum's savior, trying to extend an olive branch and bring peace using his pseudo-hip lingo. Then, not unexpectedly, he is assassinated and the blame is pinned on a certain Coney Island gang called The Warriors. The rest of the movie consists not of their attempts to clear their good name, but running for dear life as every other gang in New York tries to hunt them down.""The Warriors"" is silly, uncontrived, and purposefully devoid of logic. It's like a satire on ""West Side Story."" It's usually the sort of picture that I enjoy, particularly on a rainy afternoon. However, rain is not necessary to make me enjoy a cornball movie and I did not enjoy ""The Warriors"" very much. What was my problem with the film? Well, as much as I appreciate good trash and enthusiastic trash, ""The Warriors"" is just too trashy, too cornball, too slaphappy, and too unrestrained for me to honestly enjoy. After a while, its grim photography, hilariously laughable dialogue, and moments of action that are badly contrasted with the would-be-tough dialogue just wore me out.There's just so much I can take, I guess.I didn't care for the execution of the movie's plot (I won't say story, because there is none) and I certainly didn't give a hoot about the drab photography by Andrew Laszlo. Mr. Laszlo, who shot beautiful moving pictures in David Kotcheff's ""First Blood"" is instructed by director Walter Hill to paint the screen with hideously dark shadows. It's almost like looking through a dirty window? Hey, hey. Hold on a moment. Maybe Mr. Hill and Mr. Laszlo intended to make us feel like voyeurs in this grimy city, looking through our dirty windows at the street gangs chasing each other? Whatever the case, I didn't buy it.Mr. Hill is a talented director and he does what he can. He keeps things on the movie and his action sequences are, as in all his pictures (""The Long Riders,"" ""Wild Bill,"" ""Last Man Standing"") commendable and exciting. However, ""The Warriors"" is crippled because it is ultimately dumbed down too much by a bad screenplay, atrocious dialogue, and a real lack of joy that we typically expect from this exploitation flicks. You know, cult films usually happen on accident. The 1970s disaster films were meant simply to entertain for a summer, but went onto become something more. Maybe Mr. Hill intended to make a cult film on purpose and that's why it doesn't quite work. Maybe intending a movie like this to last more than a summer was the fatal move.But again, that's just my opinion. Elsewhere, ""The Warriors"" has quite a good reputation as B-movie exploitation with an A-grade director. It just did not work for me.Oh, and as a side note, I frankly did not care if The Warriors lived to lean on more fence posts or if they were all encircled and shanked.",The Warriors
77,DunnDeeDaGreat,Great action movie,9,28 October 2001,"The Warriors has everything a action movie should have, fight scenes, action , and good pacing. The Warriors is one film every hip hop head should see. I love this movie and highly recommned it. Warriors come out to play.",The Warriors
78,mentalcritic,A simple adventure tale,7,21 April 2005,"Everyone has stories of adventures from their youths. Some writers have even turned this into a living, with Stephen King in particular making a good quid out of building archetypal tales of what boys get up to when their mothers' backs are turned. In The Warriors, Sol Yurick constructs a tale of these little boys running about in the bodies of young men, playing with guns, bats, or knives rather than skateboards. In spite of the major cosmetic differences, the film adaptation is really little different to an old Stephen King adaptation by the name of Stand By Me. In both films, a group of boys go out into the woods searching for adventure, confront something most adults would not want a part of, and are changed forever as a result. At least, that is how the archetype goes.The Warriors begins with a group of youths in a gang, no prizes for guessing what they call themselves, going to a meeting. Under a flag of truce, one man has unified the many gangs that roam the city of New York, rightly telling them that when they stop fighting one another, they can better fight their social situation and ""the man"". The meeting that the Warriors are taking themselves to is essentially nothing more than a rally for these gangs. Things go awry, however, when a particularly psychotic member of one gang assassinates the Ghandi-like figure who is coordinating the gangs together. Of all the witnesses, the first to make any sound tells all and sundry that the Warriors are responsible for this act. From this point, the Warriors struggle to get back to their home ground at Coney Island, and have a myriad of sometimes-fatal adventures along the way.Originally, the film was to feature an all-black cast as the Warriors, but the producers felt a mixture was a better idea. The result firmly vindicates the producers, as it raises the gang above an ethnic stereotype. It helps to promote the message that when one has the entire criminal element of New York City hunting them down, a dozen men of differing origins may as well all be the same colour. Hatred is not a racist entity, after all, only human beings are. It is this element that elevates The Warriors above the status of being just another blaxploitation film, and makes it universal. As John Lydon put it so well, nonsenses are not to be tolerated in this kind of poverty. Nobody who actually lives in the ghetto benefits from a race war. This is the one thing that The Warriors manages to tell without getting preachy.Most of the cast are complete unknowns, or have become such over the course of time. A young-ish Michael Beck makes an appearance here as the de facto leader of The Warriors, in spite of being around fourteen years old for the part. Unlike a lot of actors called upon to play parts significantly younger than they themselves, Beck had aged well at the time. Indeed, the costumes of The Warriors themselves, along with the rather buff, muscular bodies in them, could almost be classed as homoerotic. Not that the other gangs have the most dignified costumes. The Baseball Furies in particular look as ridiculous as some of the self-proclaimed ghetto warriors in some of the blaxploitation or urbane cult films that would follow in the twenty years after. Given that the film is one long chase sequence after another, however, the garish costumes help the audience discern the heroes, and the differing lots of antagonists, from one another. Unlike some films of this nature where the cast never did anything since, some of the cast here are truly missed from the silver screen. It is a shame that Michael Beck in particular never did anything of great note, Xanadu aside.If I had to give The Warriors a rating out of ten, seven would be my vote. It could have done with another fifteen minutes to let the cast show some character, or a little refinement in the screenplay, but it is head and shoulders above many another film that professes to depict the gangland struggles common to big cities. Fans of Michael Beck or those with ninety minutes to spare cannot go wrong.",The Warriors
79,hnt_dnl,Walter Hill's cinematic triumph,10,13 March 2019,"I'm going to be THAT person and just say that most current movies just aren't very good. The 1970s boasts the most gritty, edgy film classics in all decades in the history of film. There was a richness in the style, atmosphere, writing, and acting that just holds up to this day more so than any other decade imaginable. A lot of people will say the 1990s, but I feel like there's a more ""style over substance"" in that decade than most people would care to admit. Sometimes, you can have both. And you need look no further than this masterpiece of a film, director Walter Hill's crowning achievement THE WARRIORS (1979).
The Warriors is Hill's foray into the gritty gang life of New York City, but set in a surrealistic, dystopian ""future"" where being in a gang is all that matters. Our heroes are the title gang and are led by Swan (played with cold-blooded confidence by Michael Beck), a tough, take-no-crap, world-weary gangmember who is trying to lead his boys to safety. The plot of the film involves the Warriors having a bounty on their heads after being framed for the assassination of Cyrus, the leader of the city's primary gang, at a summit meeting, and then being compelled to navigate their way through the night all the way back to their home on Coney Island. The real culprit was Luther (creepily played by 80s stalwart David Patrick Kelly) in an attempt for his gang to gain control.The gang includes the hotheaded second-in-command Ajax (wonderfully played by James Remar) as well as Cleon (Dorsey Wright), Snow (Brian Tyler), Cochise (David Harris), Cowboy (Tom McKitterick), Vermin (Terry Michos), all of whom are varying degrees of being the group's smarts, heart and muscle, and the runt of the gang Rembrandt (Marcelino Sanchez). During their nighttime journey, the boys pick up a groupie named Mercy (played with fierce sex appeal by Deborah Van Valkenburgh).
Together, this motley crew encounter a series of other gangs The Furies, The Lizzies, The Orphans, and The Punks. The film is carried by an ever-present sense of dread and atmosphere. The dialogue is very spare, with a lot of brilliant non-verbals of characters relaying their emotions through expression. Hill opts for the ""show don't tell"" method of storytelling and it works. Great visuals, cinematography, and soundtrack underscore the tight pacing and action-thriller atmosphere. I don't think Hill ever came even close to achieving in any other movie what he did here. The Warriors is a lightning-in-a-bottle classic that can never be re-made or copied.",The Warriors
80,sharky_55,No reason.,3,29 April 2016,"This is a review of the 'Ultimate' Director's Cut. It's in air quotes because there is nothing ultimate about this film at at all. The story takes place in some vague era of New York City where the gangs outnumber the police five to one and rule all over. Hill has bathed the subways with a neon glow that feels decidedly futuristic as the train speeds by and the bloody red open credits appear. It looks okay enough. And that is about as much world-building as you will get from this film. The low budget betrays itself; most of this just seems to be shot in dirty, downtrodden and abandoned urban settings that you might see if you just drive a little further. Do the gangs really want these territories? Hill has also used two techniques to supposedly boost the mythic quality of the narrative, layering it so it becomes less reality and more ancient tale of heroism. The first of these is the comic book aesthetic which has the narrator regard them like old Greek heroes and the screen constantly shifting from cartoon drawings to live-action. This is all flash and gimmick and does nothing for the film at all; it reminds me of another abysmal attempt by Ang Lee to introduce comic-book elements into film, not for any narrative purpose or effect, but just for the sake of it. The second is the sultry radio caller who provides running commentary of the film's events. This fails because the story is simply terrible.Hill has gone for the concept instead of the character. He has created no less than 21 different gangs each with their own distinct uniform and ...and ...and that is really it. There's nothing that actually defines these gangs other than the colour and style of their clothes (and sometimes, their weapon of choice). We know nothing of their rivalries or moralities; they stare each other down in packs, and fight sloppily. The action sequences are lacklustre. The acting is atrocious; these characters are like robots that articulate their lines at the given time, and then go back to their default stances, which are stilted and emotionless. The dialogue is showy as it should be; the gangs are all about macho posturing, attitude and reputation, but this nosedives into an painfully over-theatrical pretense full of self-important pauses and intonations. It's as if the film takes a moment to unironically admired its coolness after every line. It is hard to remember these names, let alone believe a whirlwind romance. And when the final 'villain' admits he just committed the assassination for the heck of it, the whole thing becomes a farce. The Warriors has become a cult film, and it is easy to see why. Dredd is another similar movie that has no doubt attracted the same audience; the appeal is in the tight plot with no excess or loose ends, a vaguely dystopian vision, and more action than we can ask for. A viewer knows exactly what he is going to get with these types of movies. Only in this case, they get a juvenile, adolescent wet-dream.",The Warriors
81,TOMASBBloodhound,Can you dig it? I sure as hell can!,9,8 May 2005,"Twenty six years old and still packing quite a wallop, The Warriors is a film that put Walter Hill on the map and caused a good deal of controversy when released. The film is clearly not to be taken seriously, but try telling that to real-life gang members looking to bust heads at a theater! A Clockwork Orange is obviously a big influence in terms of the visual style, though the story is a rehash of an ancient journey made by a warrior clan many centuries ago. We have a nine-member delegation from a Coney Island gang heading all the way up to the Bronx for a big convention in which the leader of the city's biggest gang will try to unite all the city's gangs into one army! This gang leader known as Cyrus is a very charismatic figure. He simply states that ""The future is ours if we can count!"" If you add up all the gang members in NYC, there are a hell of a lot more of them than police. Most of the crowd really gets into his speech until a complete idiot leader of one of the gangs shoots him! Why? ""I just like doing things like that,"" he explains in a later scene. Anyway, this creep blames our heroes The Warriors for the murder, and every gang in the city becomes their enemy. They have to make it all the way back to Coney Island from the Bronx without getting wasted, and even a guy from Nebraska knows that's one hell of a long way to go! The film is filled with outrageous fight scenes, some comedy, and a good deal of suspense. Some of the gangs are dressed up like it's Halloween, and that adds to the imagery. Some just wear the same type of clothes, but all are pretty mean. Even an all-girl gang gets in on the action and nearly takes a few of the Warriors out. There are some unintentionally hilarious scenes along the way. I howl with laughter when James Remar slugs a cop with his free and while cuffed to a park bench. And how about the makeshift Molotov cocktail the Warriors use to fight off the Orphans? When it goes off, you can actually see a couple of their members get knocked off their feet.The film suffers from some PC even back then, however. Director Walter Hill wanted the Warriors to be an all-black gang which in reality they probably would have been. But the studio apparently wanted to throw some white characters in to remind the world that whites do in fact commit crimes, also. The Death Wish films also suffer from this PC attitude.Michael Beck is terrific as Swan, the gang member who finds himself the leader after the original leader Cleon is killed early. Too early, if you ask me! That scene always frustrates me to no end. I really wish Cleon could have stuck around a while longer. That guy WAS a leader, and he could whip some serious butt! Too bad Beck's career didn't go much further than this film. Xanadu really killed his momentum as a big star.I hear a remake is in the works. This frightens me dearly. I see Tony Scott has been penciled in as the director, too. That means the film will at least look good, but the quality of the film may suffer if Bruckheimer gets involved! 9 of 10 stars for the original.The Hound.",The Warriors
82,jluis1984,Brilliant Action-packed urban adventure!,8,9 March 2006,"Walter Hill stylized take on Sol Yurick's novel ""The Warriors"" has overcome the test of time and is now a cult classic and not without a good reason. This action-packed movie is roller-coaster ride that never gets slow or boring. Set in a stylish semi-futuristic version of 70s New York, Yurick's novel perfectly mixes his own experiences with gangs and the Greek 4th century story known as 'Anabasis' to create a modern urban-fantasy adventure.""The Warriors"" are a gang that has its home in Coney Island. One night, Cyrus, the leader of the biggest gang in NYC, the Bronx-based ""Grammercy Riffs"" invites 9 delegates of each gang in NYC to a meeting hoping to establish peace & collaboration between gangs. During the meeting at the Bronx, Cyrus is murdered, and soon everyone blames the ""Warriors"". Knowing they were framed for the killing by another gang, the ""Warriors"" must return to Coney Island before the cops or the members of the other gangs catch them.The story is very exciting and never leaves the audience, the movie moves at a good pace and there is always something happening. Just like in classic odysseys, the group must endure several obstacles as the many gangs of NY are trying to kill them. Like the novel it is based on, the movie feels like a modern retelling of those ancient fables and the stylish visuals only add more to that feeling.The powerful image of Walter Hill's New York and its gangs, is both thrilling and exciting; and while not realistic or accurate, the gang sub-world of the movie is the perfect setting for this now legendary tale. With its gritty and dark look, the movie is a visual fest that not only is appealing, it also fuels the imagination and leaves you wanting knowing more of this marvelous sub-world.The acting is remarkably good, considering the young age and lack of experience of those involved in the project. While every member of the ""Warriors"" is important for the movie, Michael Beck as Swan and James Remar as Ajax shine in their roles and easily catch the attention when they are on screen. David Patrick Kelly as Luther, member of an important rival gang also has a lot of great scenes in the movie and he makes the best of them.Walter Hill's direction and vision in this movie excels and every episode in the ""Warriors""' journey becomes classic. Music plays an important role in the film, and the score by Barry De Vorzon fits perfectly the movie gritty yet fantastic mood.""The Warriors"" is an action-packed ride that will please not only fans of adventure films, but any film fan in general, as it has the characteristics of an instant classic.

83,eminkl,Not a particularly good film of its own right,4,18 April 2020,"Gang warfare in the boroughs of NYC, seen at their absolute grimiest. This is a film that's admirable for its inner fire, and its determination, if not for its execution or storytelling. In a sense, it almost works as a sheer abstract; lingering shots of graffiti-laden subway cars and dark, wet city streets abound, lending it value as something of a time capsule in the modern light. The plot is adorably simple, though, and overacted at every turn. It's no surprise to see this as the first or second film on nearly every actor's resume, although I'm not sure a more accomplished thespian could do more with the script, which left me laughing from its sheer absurdity more than once. It's more of a visual film anyway, reliant upon the cityscapes and quaintly-themed gang ensembles to do most of the heavy lifting. That's a wise decision, as it's generally entertaining to look at, though the aforementioned gangs vary from laughable (an entire syndicate of mimes) to, actually, pretty cool (lots of stylish fedoras in this flick). Unfortunately, there's a serious lack of violence for this kind of picture (flight seems to be the word of the day) and the second act drags on for so long, there's barely any time for adequate resolution at the end. A valiant effort, not to mention an influential one, but not a particularly good film of its own right.",The Warriors

What I find in them is the bizarre energy to do anything that our typical summer blockbusters don't have.  By comparison to this, 'Troy' was a huge and depressing shot of Ritalin.  I haven't had this much fun with story construction in a long time.  This is totally Greek in structure.  Consider:--The story is based on ""Anabasis""--The framing of Coney Island (similar to Homeric work where the origin is used as the finale)--The character of Ajax--The Medea-esque whore that assists and follows the heroes--The Chorus provided by the DJ--The Temptress on the park benchBy simple entertainment, this has faded.  However, look at the bathroom fight--very reminiscent of 'Gladiator' battles, hmm?  The pace has been borrowed by 'Terminator' and 'Lola Rennt.'  All they've done is kick the story notches up in different spots.  Hill is more streamlined, not wanting to sit still.  That's what he relies on, movement and conflict.  He apparently succeeded since IMDb voters made this his #1 film.But while all that's interesting, it's superficial.  What makes this deeper is that the film is self-conscious (and I'm not talking about the gang slang).  Watch the transitions: entirely self-aware that this is a ridiculous movie, unlike 'Star Wars' which used the same art for sheer plagiarism.  Here the wipes divide our Scenes and Acts just like a curtain close.  Pretty nifty albeit basic.'Warriors' further mixes theatre and film concepts together.  Look at the costumes worn by different gangs, 'Clockwork' all over again.  Cyrus speaks on a stage.  I just wish that the ""train transit"" motif could've been infused a little better.Watch this with 'O Brother' and Luhrmann's 'Romeo+Juliet' to see these ideas mixed again.  Unfortunately here, by comparison, the camera is all low angles and diagonals.  The magic rests in speed and cutting.

It's more accurate to say that they don't need to act. Everyone reads their lines as if emotions simply don't matter to them one way or another.

93,Bogmeister,Adventure Odyssey Transposed to New York City,9,5 October 2005,"""The Warriors"" is unlike any other film and does not fall into any particular genre. At first glance, it can be mistaken for a 'gang' picture, but what's that anyway? Director Walter Hill meant for the story to take place 'some time in the future' so one might note similar intentions between this and ""A Clockwork Orange"" - but even so the similarities are very few. In another sense, this is a video game come to life, before there were such video games, and is so way ahead of its time; but it's 'real' - you don't have that disconnect with make-believe video characters. You don't have the power to manipulate the swiftly-moving characters. Their actions enthrall you and mesmerize you, to the point where you're on pins and needles, waiting for the next move.The story concerns a group of nine warriors, emissary-members of a much-larger gang (about 100 members), sent to the other side of the city to take part in a special meeting of all the other important gangs in the New York area. Right from the start, the world presented here is a fantastik version of the real one. Each gang wears their own distinctive, specialized costumes, reminiscent of various super-hero or super-villain groups (teams) in comic books. The plot is incredibly simple: once the nine heroes get to point B, they must spend the rest of the movie trying to get back to point A (Coney Island,their turf). There are basically 2 types of obstacles in their way: other gang groups and the police group, which is against everyone. Any other types of citizens, such as everyday bystanders, make only fleeting appearances during the film and are completely irrelevant. Most of the film is shot at night with empty streets as the backdrops, with only the gang members or police showing any constant signs of life. There is no mention, even, of other characters such as parents or the government.This all results in a surrealistic and exciting trip among the eerie canyons of the city. Movement is the key; it seems more than half the film contains scenes of someone being chased. The best, most memorable moment is the appearance of the gang named the Baseball Furies. These gang members have the most eye-catching make-up and costumes. Their sudden appearance at the midway point just emphasizes the eeriness, and the subsequent chase makes them look like demons trying to catch the tiring heroes. The fight scenes, like all else, are dramatically choreographed and ideal for such a stylized action adventure.In the latest DVD version of this film, released in October '05, director Hill re-tinkered some points to stress the comic book and Greek origins of the story. I don't really think this was necessary as it impeded the smooth flow of the tale, but it's an interesting variation on the archetypal nature of the work.",The Warriors

They rush home to Coney Island, with every other gang, plus the N.Y.P.D. on their trail. For all the violence in this movie, there is a high camp factor. Most of this comes from the various colorful gangs. There are the High Hats, the Boppers, the Punks, the Orphans, and of course, the Baseball Furies. It's not easy to see ""The Warriors"" as a seriously gritty gangland drama with street toughs on roller skates or in clown makeup! For the camp factor alone, ""The Warriors"" is worth seeing.",The Warriors
96,dragokin,more than a movie to me,10,26 May 2013,"The Warriors is one of the first movies i consciously remember watching in a movie theater. I learned about the reference to ancient Greek scripture Anabasis by Xenophon a couple of decades later when i rediscovered it. But even the DVD was able to invoke the feelings i've had as a child being initiated to the mysteries of cinema. Therefore my note doesn't reflect only the movie's qualities, but it's impact to my love for film, as well.The Warriors follows a Coney Island gang fighting it's way home through the whole New York City in one night. The danger comes from rival gangs, as well as from police. In it's essence this is a kitschy and campy movie, but there is a certain chemistry that sets it apart from other B-movies. But above all, it is a piece of fiction and should regarded as such.",The Warriors
97,khunkrumark,Awesome classic!,10,5 October 2018,"An absolute classic of a movie... and the updated version makes it a whole lot BETTER, too.Lots of famous faces, memorable scenes and lines... great music and a silly story. The only fans who do NOT like the updated version are the one's still buying vinyl records ""for the sound, dude!""Yes, it's a bit silly, but think of it as a cartoon come to life. Too many good bits to name but other reviewers have already done that anyway...Can you dig it? Oh, yes!",The Warriors
98,danielcereto,Cult classic,8,4 April 2020,"Just rewatched this movie and feel it like a cult classic. People at Hollywood should remember how to create a great movie with a weak script and acting but a superb cinematography and camera direction. Last, no cheap CGI here. Old school movies rules.",The Warriors
99,PeachHamBeach,Urban Fairy Tale,10,26 March 2013,"I first saw this movie in 1988 when it was only 9 years old, and now the damn thing is over 30. The weird thing is, though I immediately loved this movie and story, I thought it was ""dated."" It was made in the disco era, and in 1988, everyone was into electronic pop/new wave. The clothes seemed dated, and of course, in the years before the DVD or Blu-Ray came out, VHS movies were grainy, and old movies looked older.Now that we have DVDs, and with the picture and sound restored to crystal clear beauty, this urban fairy tale is ageless. It really is one of my all time favorite movies, and if you don't mind a surreal and admittedly violent parable (I don't when a story is well executed), it's almost perfect. Fun characters, great nocturnal settings, good music, a cool list of ""before they were famous"" actors, and even interestingly choreographed fight scenes. It's a very simple morality story wrapped up in atmosphere and surreality. The Warriors, a gang based in Coney Island, NY has been invited to a huge conclave hosted by the Gramercy Riffs, the most notorious and influential gang in the city. The leader of the Riffs, Cyrus (Roger Hill), has called the meeting to propose an outlandish and ambitious idea: to take over the city one borough at a time, tax the crime syndicates, and get rid of law enforcement. Whether or not it's a pipe dream (while many of the gang members are experienced criminals well into their 20s, many others are mere kids, disenfranchised from society and looking for their true ""family"" within the Riffs' umbrella network), Cyrus' aspirations are short lived when he is gunned down by someone within the crowd. The Riffs are the wrong gang to screw with, and though you learn right away who the real killers are, the Coney Island gang becomes the accused, and from the moment of Cyrus' death, the Warriors are forced to fight their way back from the Bronx to their home turf. The characters are many and all memorable, including the ""War Chief"" Cleon (Dorsey Wright) whose demise puts the levelheaded Swan (Michael Beck) in charge, although hot- headed Ajax (James Remar) thinks he's the better man for the job. With a price on their heads, The Warriors are targeted by every gang within the network, including the eerily silent, creepily painted Baseball Furies, the seductive and sinister Lizzies, and the unscrupulous, trashy Rogues (headed by one David Patrick Kelly, who is obviously having the time of his life in this role! In fact, this HAD to have been a blast of a movie to make for all involved!). Among supporting characters in the Warriors gang, there is also the introspective Rembrandt, who paints the Warriors' logo everywhere they go ""so they know we've been here"", lavishly decorated Cochise, who shares Ajax's love for communicating with his fists, the reckless Vermin (Is it me, or does this guy remind you of Beaver Cleaver?), and Mercy (Deborah Van Valkenburgh), a gang groupie who decides that her neighborhood ""Orphans"" are boring and wimpy, and would like some ""real action."" Although a ""love interest"" thing would normally be obnoxiously out of place in a story about gangs, Mercy makes for an interesting way to show another side of Swan.I was quite happy with the original cut of the film. The newer edition, with an introduction referencing the story ""Anabasis"" which accounts the battle at Cunaxa (Babylon 401 BC) by Xenophon, seemed weird until I learned that the author of the novel upon which this film was based simply modernized that ancient Greek history. I disliked the ""comic book"" motif at first, saying to myself, ""Aw, s***...when will Hollywood get over this graphic novel craze?!"" But now that I know about the Xenophon connection, I'm okay with the new stuff. Unlike director Walter Hill though, I also like several of the ""deleted"" scenes, especially the one of Cleon's girlfriend Lincoln expressing her misgivings about the Riffs' meeting.I'm not a fan of gang culture or violence, but there are a few movies that I watch without being offended, mostly because good stories and good filmmaking are involved. A great score by Barry Devorzon adds to the fun, and the Joe Walsh song at the end is perfection. This one is a real classic.",The Warriors
100,theknownames,Held up over time,9,10 December 2020,"This loosely futuristic movie was one that we had to sneak in to see. It was based on some old Greek something I recall and not actual gangs . More of a stylization of the misunderstood . But mostly parents felt it was too dangerous to go see it. When did that stop anyone though ?
Some of the scenes are with me still . I found that it still delivers after watching it twice more over the years. I still feel it did its job on many levels for its time. Being a bunch of 9 years old I admit it heavily influenced our fashion choices for the next several years . Take the the vest off for no one lol. I also recall that it also solidified the Eagles being more then just peaceful and easy for our generation.",The Warriors
101,bsinc,I DIG IT,9,20 December 2002,"Wow, I haven't been this amazed in a very long time. Where was I living all this time that not once did I hear anything about this movie. ""The Warriors"" is one of the best moves of the 70's and it definitely deserves more recognition than it apparently has. There isn't a single thing in this movie that disappoints, on the contrary, everything in it is brilliant. The acting, the very cool costumes, the amazing photography, the great adrenaline music, the fight sequences, the minimalistic plot, and of course the memorable one liners. From the moment it starts ""The Warriors"" just never loses its fast pace and we're not able to rest until the end. There are very few movies I wish would have last longer, there are even fewer that ended perfectly and ""The Warriors"" is one of them. If people though ""Taxi Driver"" was controversial they probably didn't see this movie. Cop bashing, interracial skinhead gangs, pretty girls that put out on every other corner; man, I'm not the least bit surprised that people wanted to imitate the Warriors. I felt like it today and I thought I was past that faze. All the praise to Walter Hill for helping make one of the best movies I've ever seen. The photography, that can only be surpassed by individuals the kinds of Kubrick and the shere minimalism of just about everything, even the deserted streets of New York, have never been more powerful. This is cult at its best.  9/10",The Warriors
102,willcundallreview,A Very Good movie with a great plot,8,11 April 2014,"Rating-8/10The Warriors is a film that carries a cult following and for good reason, with a thrilling story and a race to get back home, this film mixes all the elements that a gang film needs to have too. With an also godo mix of OK acting and fun visuals and fight scenes, the film is also very enjoyable to watch and although you may want the gang to survive all the way through, it is still hugely fun. I felt this film was just about a very good film and here below is why I felt that way about it.The story is great and works well and also very smartly too with a fun plot that over time(in which this film is a good length) become even more fun. With lots of great characters running around and of course the gangs, it makes for a good film to look at too story wise and the mean faces we also see throughout are just kind of menacing. Finally on the story I really enjoyed the fighting seen because they make the film's plot more like a plot with levels, where they have to beat the boss, a bit like a video game.The entire Warriors gang do a solid job and have superbly varied performances, for example the character of Swan is calm and has good leadership skills, where as someone like Ajax is a bit more haywire and would lead the gang into certain death, this is makes for a gang that each have unique skills and personalities. I did think the acting was done OK by everyone on the film, very similar from most as they are all being gang members but nevertheless it is very fun indeed.Walter Hill directs well and also contributes to the writing to create a film I did feel was directed well, not the best script I have ever heard but makes up for it with big fight scenes, and with them see they are fun and kind of cool at times with some crazy fighting moves used by all, but manages also to not be over the top either. One last thing about the more technical piece well it comes in the directors cut released mid 2000's, in this it changes scene using a comic book style cutting programme and it works so well to remind you what everyone is doing at that time and also looks kind of cool to match as well.It isn't without criticism it is kind of fair to say, with some less than savoury scenes that are a bit dull, to parts which seem to use violence when talking was the most useful tool. The film doesn't get super affected by these kind of things but still is a point that makes it kind of annoying at times, I also mentioned the script not being great, and with some very cheesy lines it can also be less than fun but yet again, you completely forget about it in that sense and remember the better parts.I think those who enjoy a gang movie with a twist will love this as the film never really tells you what type of gang activities they do, but the police don't like them either so they must do something. Film watchers who like some good old fighting as well will like this and it is full of fun fight sequences and chases etc. Same goes for those who dislike violence because it is full of it and sometimes mindless so stay away if you dislike it in that way.Overall I give it a 8/10 and that means it is a Just About Very Good film, go watch it and see what you think of it, you may just like it, you may not and I can see some might think the film is stupid and overly aimed at a male audience, but some may thoroughly enjoy it also, just give it a chance and try and make yourself thrilled and it is pure fun.",The Warriors
103,rdoyle29,A beautiful action film,9,19 August 2017,"Walter Hill's films in his prime combine a very simple, tight film making style with a mythic quality to his characters. They are not exactly stereotypes, but they're broad, simple archetypes. This is the best film he made in this mode. It manages to be simple and gritty with a completely unrealistic, heroic tone. I love this film. If you can avoid the newer version with animated comic transitions dropped in, do that.",The Warriors
104,theshadow908,An awesome cult classic.,8,7 January 2007,"The Warriors begins with Cyrus, leader of the biggest gang in New York City, the Gramercy Riffs, calling a meeting for every street gang in New York. Cyrus wants all the gangs to work together to take over the streets. Luther, the leader of the Rogues, assassinates Cyrus and blames a Coney Island gang called the Warriors. Now the Warriors have to march 50 miles across dozens of rival gang territories to get home. They are forced to run, hide, and fight for their lives. The Warriors is a very entertaining action movie that is definitely worth the hype it gets.The Warriors is a modern day retelling of an ancient Greek story called ""The Persian Expedition"", where the Spartan army had to trek across miles of enemy land to get back home. Ancient Greek tales usually make great entertainment to begin with, and to give it a modern day twist was definitely a good idea. This movie is just about a bunch of guys trying to get home and having to fight along the way. They meet some of the strangest gangs New York has to offer. The bad guy of the story, Luther, is great to watch, basically because he's a violent psychopath, and you never know what he's going to do next. The best fight in the movie comes with a gang called the Punks, who corner the Warriors in a subway men's room and attack. The Warriors is a purely entertaining film, don't expect anything less.The direction and the use of music are really good for the movie. The acting is pretty good for a cast of small time actors.The Warriors is a vastly entertaining cult classic that truly deserves all of the positive hype it gets.8/10",The Warriors

They're bopping their way back to Coney Island from the Bronx while being hunted by gang members who ranged from mean bald headed ex-cons to being plucked from Michael Jacksons' video ""Beat It"". The New York City subway system holds their path to freedom, but it's filled with the NYPD and rival gangs. One looks like the NY Yankees in KISS make up! Another like stole their outfits from Pam Dawbers' ""Mork and Mindy"" wardrobe. Much like ""West Side Story"", once you can past the obvious gang creation by dance casting and make up, the rest of the story contains the appropriate energy and delivers the intended story. The screen play covers the young men's conflicts both externally and internally which deepens the waters a bit. The performances are equally fine as you feel for the gang of nine from the beginning as this thriller ends on the sands of an amusement park. I saw this in the theater the second day of its release with amusement when the main gang appears ready to fight with hockey sticks. Like ""Slap Shot"" released about the same time, you just can't take things too seriously in the late 1970's, so sit back and enjoy the ride.",The Warriors

107,buckikris,Warriors Come Out To Play,8,13 June 2015,"I had never heard of this movie when it first came out in the late 70's, probably because I am a huge Star Wars freak. I was watching a movie, with The Warriors as part of the trailer, and thought this looks like a great film. I took a chance and bought it through EBAY for a great price. The movie is about gang life in New York City in the 70's. A meeting is called by the head leader of all the gangs, Cyrus. When most of the gangs arrive for a trues, Cyrus is fatally shot. A member of another gang, The Rouges, shoots him; and the blame is put upon on The Warriors. The Warriors home is Coney Island; and they are about 50 to 100 miles from their territory. Once they are blamed for something they didn't do, every gang is after their heads. They have to fight their way back home; and it isn't easy. A couple gang members get killed, one gets arrested, and a few have a close call with an all female gang called The Lizzie's. Once the remaining members get together. The only thing left in their way is the truth, and a showdown in the men's bathroom with another gang. The bathroom rumble was one of the best parts of the movie, I thought. When they get home the truth comes out, and The Warrior's name gets cleared; justice comes swift for the responsible party. I really liked this movie, a lot of action in it, and a great plot. One thing I didn't know about Walter Hill, he was a producer for on of the best film's of the 80's Aliens. It comes down to this. Do remember when you were a kid and you thought it would be cool to be part of a gang, I did; but thankfully found sports instead. This film does not glorify violence, or gang life. Too me it's a film that's plot is simple; good triumphs over evil from a gangs eye view.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",The Warriors
108,jtncsmistad,"""The Warriors"" packs a helluva wallop of action and tension.",7,10 September 2016,"Hard to fathom that a flick about a ration of reprobates running for their lives from an onslaught of equally as reprehensible New York City gangs circa the late 1970's would have you pulling for the former. Yet somehow ""The Warriors"" pulls it off.The lion's share of the credit for such goes straight to the deliciously down and dirty vision of director and co-screen writer Walter Hill (""48 Hrs."", ""The Long Riders"") and his brilliant utilization of on-location street and subway venues immersed in middle of the night, dimly lit shades throughout ""The City That Never Sleeps"". Hill maintains the tension at amped up assault levels with enormously enthralling action sequences combined with expert orchestration of fight scenes both brisk and brutal. There is even a well executed moment of poignancy squeezed in here as Hill allows us to catch our breath while we witness an interaction on a train between those kids who get all the breaks and their peers who know only that which is irrevocably broken.Toss in the fact that this may be, if not the first, certainly ONE OF the initial instances of an electronica rock music score serving as the soundtrack for a feature-length film courtesy of some guy named Barry De Vorzon. Hey, dude did compose the theme music which the TV soap ""The Young and the Restless"" has used now for nigh on four and half decades. So let's not be dissin' the man, awite? And I simply MUST, as one of his biggest fans on the planet, recognize the great Joe Walsh for his rousing riffs providing a sonically stalwart serenade for the film's finish. ""In the City"" (De Vorzon strikes again, kids-he co-wrote the tune with Walsh) punctuates the closing credits as they roll over ""The Warriors"" strolling along Coney Island beach in the early morning, having miraculously cheated death all through the night. And yet, as the rising sun shines on these wayward and woebegotten lads, indications are that this may very soon become an erstwhile home.And, once departed, one to which none of them are likely to ever return.",The Warriors
109,Cinema_Fan,Messed up gangs' rebel against change.,10,20 October 2005,"I have just seen the new release of The Warriors DVD and what a different movie it is. The Warriors, the best known, is one of the original movies of 1970's gang land culture. It contains tension, grit, pace and a fantastic soundtrack by Barry De Vorzon, that personally hasn't been surpassed. The lack of known actors was a good, if not cheaper, move. In comparison to the first release this new version has been buttered up. Filled with a new style of ""scene connection"" (or wiping as it's called) with the style of a comic strip, similar to the 1980's Fright Night movie. Now we are being told before the film that it is possibly based on an old Greek fable. This style of comic stripping and wiping has now deflated this movie, where as before the tension etc, was always constant, at one level, now its being distracted and has now been moved from heavy weight and down to middle weight.Paradoxically, the sound track has been up graded to a 5.1 DD where as before it was in 2.0 Stereo. We seem to have lost visual tension that was present before and gained a descent sound track, it has now turned full circle in the opposite direction. The added scenes are hardly noticeable, the colours on the screen are sharper and the extras are informative, the 5.1 does do a very good job. Given the choice over the first or second version I would still choose the first. This movie is a classic that I never get tired of watching, it really is how a movie should be done, hard work, proper location's, real people used as extra's, and a complete feeling of the lack of pretentiousness, the cast and crew have been involved in movie history, and have done themselves's proud.Let's hope that, like the original Star Wars, it doesn't get placed or lost in the vaults of Time forever, because it would be the biggest crime off all not to have a choice. Great movie, let down by just a little too much.change.",The Warriors
110,jcbutthead86,Walter Hill's Best Film. An Absolute Classic.,10,25 July 2012,"Walter Hill's The Warriors is one of my favorite movies of all time, Walter Hill's best film and a classic that brilliantly combines Action,gangs and comic book style. Although controversial at the time of it's release,the film has gained a huge Cult following because it's great and unique and has stood the test of time. Set in New York,The Warriors tells the story of a Coney Island,Brooklyn gang called The Warriors who are heading to the Bronx for a big truce meeting of every gang in the city hosted by Cyrus(Roger Hill) the leader of the biggest gang in the city The Riffs. When Cyrus is assassinated,The Warriors are framed for the killing and The Riffs want The Warriors dead or alive. The Warriors have to get back home to their turf,but have to deal with other gangs and the cops and it's not going to be easy.There are many things I love about The Warriors and one of the things I love about the film is it's surreal storyline and style. The Warriors is a film that feels like your in a gangland comic book nightmare where you feel like your in a different world where everything is over the top or dream like whether it is the gangs,fight scenes or characters. The Warriors is a film that takes place mostly at night and when watching the film you feel like you're with The Warriors and their bizarre and very weird journey where you feel the night,darkness and beautiful neon lights. You would think The Warriors were in the desert trying to get out of the hot sun,but they're in the city of New York trying to get out and away from other gangs,cops,the night sky and rainy streets. The main characters in The Warriors have a larger than life persona with their names with their names, (Swan,Ajax,Cochise)dialog and their Actions are over the top but at the same time you still care about the characters and what they go through. I also like the Humor in the film whether it was intentional or not. I think the funny Humor works because of the wild and insane and sometimes weird and wacky situations,dialog and performances that I think it adds to the film's over the top nature. The Action and fight scenes are so brutal you would think that The Warriors and other characters would in the hospital,but when a person gets beaten up they just have one or two bruises and get up like nothing happened. Walter Hill wasn't interested in making a realistic gang film,Hill wanted to make a great film that was original,stylish,unique gang different from any gang we had seen before and Hill definitely achieves that with this film. One of the other great things I love about this film is that the gangs in the film were unique and original. Other than The Warriors my favorite gangs in the film are The Riffs,The Baseball Furies and the all-girl gang The Lizzies. The Riffs are the biggest and largest gang in the film and are keeping a close eye on The Warriors' every move and where abouts and are so mysterious that you feel like The Riffs could be anywhere at anytime in the film and the presence of The Riffs is haunting and eerie. The Riffs leave a lasting impression in the film and add to the movie's nightmarish tone. The Baseball Furies are amazing because of the Baseball uniforms and great face make-up and the way The Furies use their Baseball Bats like Samurai swords and how none of The Furies say a word. I love the fact that The Lizzies were the only all-girl gang in the film and that they use looks and sex to their advantage. This movie is an adventure that is original and truly unforgettable and will punch you the face when you watch it. The film moves at great pace and never slows down because the film is one big chase. The Action and fight scenes are great and are stylized and are true to the films outrageous and surrealistic,Comic Book tone. The ending of the film is a classic finale and is one of the things that adds to the surreal style of the film and one of things that makes this film a classic.The actors do fine jobs in their roles. Michael Beck is great as Swan, The Warriors second in command bringing leadership and smarts when needed. James Remar is amazing as Ajax,with Remar bringing life and toughness to the role. Remar's scene with the Baseball Furies is excellent and iconic and the character's high point. Deborah Van Valkenburgh is wonderful as Mercy,the girl who joins The Warriors on their journey and falls for Swan. David Patrick Kelly does a great job as the leader of The Rogues and is very believable. Roger Hill is brilliant in his small but very unforgettable role as Cyrus. Hill's speech as Cyrus at the big meeting is one of the films iconic moments. Lynne Thigpin is fantastic as the Radio D.J,with Thigpin letting her mouth and smooth voice do the work.Walter Hill's direction is excellent moving the camera fast and never letting up while also giving the the film a great visual style. Hill's action scenes are exciting,tense and over the top and I also love the way he uses slow motion to great effect. Great job,Walter.The score by Barry De Vorzon is great and fits with the film's over the top,Comic Book style. The film has great songs too including In The City by Joe Walsh,a great version of the classic Nowhere To Run by Arnold McCuller and Love Is A Fire by Genya Ravan.If you love Walter Hill,Action films or movies like Escape From New York,Assault on Precinet 13,Southern Comfort or Streets Of Fire I highly suggest you see The Warriors,an amazing,unique classic film that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",The Warriors
111,mgd_m,Masterpiece,9,22 August 2020,"I have read some negative reviews here, probably made by some millennials who can't understand movies before the 90's. But it was, and it is, a great movie. The key to enjoy it (along with some taste for 70's moviemaking) is understanding that The Warriors is an epic tale about grit, dignity, brotherhood and poverty, displayed on a straight line that goes 40 miles from Bronx to south NY. This is the backbone of the movie, and it's quite interesting in itself.Then, add how this tale is told. The opening sequence is one of the best in history. The electro-rock score is good enough to pump you up for 90 minutes, while guys are running and fighting. Guys and gangs are all cool and tough. Beck is outstanding. When he stops the girl from combing her hair with her hand... well, it's a pretty intense and meaningful moment. The ending scenes are history. Also, it was the first movie almost entirely shot at night I believe. Some telephotos and other shots are beautiful. Add to that the Baseball Furies, and you have a masterpiece in popular moviemaking.",The Warriors
112,Emerenciano,Fantastic,9,3 May 2003,"I was just a kid when I first saw this movie on TV. It really surprised me when I saw how good this film is. When we think of a story about street gangs an empty plot may come to our minds. But it is not what we find in here. It's just brilliant! Walter Hill made a breath-taking work of art where hundreds of actors are directed in impressive action scenes. I've never been to New York, but I believe the things we see on the screen is something very close to reality.

113,Greatornot,Warriors Come out to Play,9,14 July 2010,"This film was just an underrated winner. Simple enough plot and very suspenseful. Basically, It is a film about a gang trying to make it home to Coney Island in the midst of the New York City darkness. After being framed for the murder of the GODFATHER of the gangs,at an informal gathering of relevant NYC gangs ; The Warriors are in for a rude awakening, an adventure above and below the city, trying to make it 25 miles or so. With a bounty on their heads , so to speak, every gang is after The Warriors. This is an adventure, with lots of action and some wonderful catch phrases along the way. The late Lynn Thigpen as the DJ/narrator through out the film was awesome, as well as some great music , featuring Joe Walsh. Look for a young Mercedes Ruehl adding to this mostly non-descript, but well acted cast. In short this is a film of inspiration and adrenaline. A roller coaster ride through out, but well worth the time invested to see this film , without having to make the trip to 6 Flags. A movie mostly under the radar, but well above expectations.",The Warriors
114,WalkdenEntertainment,Movie Lovers...Come out and play!,9,8 January 2019,"Set in the future, the city of New York is full of street gangs. On one night, the leader of a gang, ""Cyrus"", calls a meeting gathering every known gang to one meeting place. As Cyrus speaks to all the gangs present, he is shot and murdered. One of the street gangs known as ""The Warriors"" are wrongly framed for the murder and now they are on the run from all the other gangs and the police of New York City. The Warriors will do whatever it takes to survive the night; running, fighting, hiding and travelling to get home.Can The Warriors survive the long night and prove their innocence?This is a film that I never saw growing up. While working in a video store as a teen, I was curious to watch the film. I'll confess- my Bluray Edition of this film has been sitting on shelf for some time now, just waiting to be watched. Recently I had an evening to myself and I was in the mood for a classic film that I hadn't seen before.Within the film's opening sequence, I was invested. The film gives its audience a great introduce of each member of The Warriors with short and quick dialogue as the credits roll with a funky, futuristic type soundtrack. With very little effort from the viewer, I was surprised at how much information we gained, such as where The Warriors are heading, why, and what type of characters they all are within the group. The film doesn't go back to tell backstories of each member or the world they currently live in. Instead, as the audience, you are thrown straight into their world with fun and snappy pacing which bring me to my next positive point.The Warriors' duration felt like a quick one. The reason for this is film's snappy pace and the fun transitions in the style of comic book. Considering this film was done in 1973, it still feels modern and provides many fun elements we can still connect to in 2018.The film's costumes design are also cool. Sure, some may disagree as some outfits are bit out there. As The Warriors encounter other gangs to fight, each gang has a gang name with matching outfits and a reasoning for their groups' names. Some gangs are just thugs, criminals or worse- insane violent murders. All of the mixed characters presented in the film are fun creations.As The Warriors travel and survive I found myself supporting our leads and wanting to see revenge as well as a final showdown. The end results are very rewarding and yet unpredictable.I felt the film's soundtracks also deserves praise. The film's funky techno track sets the film's pace and tone. People running around and a story that jumps from bad guys to bad guys can be boring, but put a great soundtrack over it and suddenly it's very entertaining.Overall, The Warriors is without a doubt a great classic film. With a basic concept and snappy plot, the film is loaded with brainless fun, entertainment and violence. My only true regret is I didn't watch this film sooner.8.9/10

115,jonathanruano,"""The Warriors""",8,18 September 2014,"The plot of Walter Hill's ""The Warriors"" is very simple and in some parts illogical. Falsely accused of murdering a charismatic gang leader Cyrus (Roger Hill), the Warriors gang make their perilous journey back to Coney Island. Why would this gang go back to Coney Island, rather than leave New York City? How do the different gangs and the police know where the Warriors will be at any given time? How can gang members outrun a bus? Any would it not make more sense for the Warriors to remove their gang jackets to avoid detection? These are not the sorts of questions that should be asked about a film like this, because you're having too much fun enjoying the quirky dialogue, the ridiculously hilarious gangs (my personal favourite is a gang that dresses up as baseball players with painted faces, who is led by someone who looks a lot like Marilyn Manson), and the fact that a radio station is being used to urge all of New York's gangs to hunt down the Warriors.""The Warriors"" plays like a great Odyssey through the aggressively grim looking streets of New York. What is important is not so much the set up or the plot, but the unexpected and often ludicrous situations that the Warriors get into along the way. Even though some of the acting sounds like it comes straight out of an amateur theatrical, this film is remarkably entertaining because the characters are fresh, the situations are often imbued with an frantic energy, and the visual style is highly original (colorful characters against shady and austere looking backdrops).",The Warriors

What people don't understand about The Warriors is that it's not just a great action movie, or a super cool movie (It's both of those things) but what really makes this such a haunting movie is it's dream-like approach in which a seemingly easy task is made absolutely difficult by hurtles which keep coming up. The fight scenes are sharp, the cinematography is intense and the whole movie comes off as ahead of it's time. In closing, this one's a classic.5/5 Matt Bronson",The Warriors
117,MarcoParzivalRocha,A cult film from the 70's,8,7 August 2020,"The Warriors, a group from Coney Island, is accused of breaking the truce between the gangs, and sees their members trapped in a race against time to reach their territory safely. A cult film from the late 70s, which fantasizes, in a kind of fable, the daily life of young criminals in New York City. The aesthetics of this film are absolutely incredible, from the gangs' strips and clothes to facial paintings, to the photography, which shows a city even darker and more terrifying than usual, when chaos reigns among the streets. It is violent, at a physical level, and you will hear a lot of dirty words that nowadays could be consider politically incorrect, but it is undeniable that this film is a landmark within the genre.",The Warriors
118,Jared_Andrews,"Stylish, Exciting and Endlessly Fun",8,16 November 2019,"Explaining what makes ""The Warriors"" a good movie and one that is so enjoyable to watch is simple. It's the style.The style announces itself loudly in the opening scene/credit sequence. Each credit appears in the custom text style then recedes into the depth of the screen like a departing train disappearing down a tunnel. Characters engage in excited exchanges about a deity-like leader, Cyrus, who commands the city's most powerful gang, the Grammercy Riffs.Everyone is heading to see him deliver a speech. And, boy, what a speech it is. He captivates the crowd of thousands by using his striking charisma and booming baritone.Then the gathering is abruptly interrupted by an act of violence for which the Warriors are falsely blamed. Acting on this inaccurate information, all gangs seek to capture and/or kill the Warriors. Now the Warriors must brave the dangerous streets on a 28-mile journey to safety.Queue the action sequences. We see a lot of fights and running. A LOT of running. It's all delightful and stylish.Director Walter Hill boldly leaves his fingerprints everywhere, shaping the aesthetic and creating something unusually special.He creates a world of gang warfare that has undertones steeped in reality, but none of the characters of the world they inhabit ever feel real. The movie much more closely resembles a comic book. At times this is played subtly, and in other scenes Hill makes this readily apparent by pausing certain frames on screen to make them look like boxes from a comic book.Dialogue continues the comic book theme. Characters say strange things that no one in real life would ever utter. The camera even moves in an unnatural manner. The action sequences contain exquisite energy, yet they feel completely rehearsed. Viewers are constantly fed reminders that they are watching a movie. It's never meant to be a realistic experience.None of that is to say that this movie isn't enjoyable or that it is poorly made. It's purely a stylistic choice that Hill makes, and it's an overtly intentional one.Within the first few minutes, you will have a pretty good sense if this movie is for you. If you like the vibe early, you'll enjoy the movie. At the very least, this one is worth a shot.",The Warriors
119,kingofdanerds,Watched the director's cut (theatrical cut is probably the better way tongo here),8,19 July 2021,"Of all of the cult films that I have heard about but haven't had a chance until now to see, The Warriors is one of those films. Based off of the book of the same name (of which I have not read), The Warriors was released in 1979. The film was directed by Walter Hill and stars Michael Beck and James Remar. The film was a financial success but so much as a critical success at the time but has since been a cult classic. The film would receive a Director's Cut (of which I saw and to my knowledge is the most common version available now) and a video game adaptation.All of the gangs of New York are coming together to meet in one place. When the leader is killed, a gang called the Warriors are wrongly accused and are being tracked down by the police and other gangs. To survive, they must return back to Coney Island.So for those wondering, the only thing that the Director's cut of this film does is add comic book style scene transitions and add an introduction with the director. To me, this is not very necessary. Does not add much to the original theatrical cut. Now this film is touted as a sort of action flick but let's keep in mind this is before films like Die Hard, Rambo, and The Terminator. Compare it to a film like Escape from New York which is often touted as a great action film. Well, lets be honest and say the weakest part of that film, and this film, is the action. With a film that portrays New York as gritty, I would have loved to see some more violence out of this film. Yet this film is more about the atmosphere and environment. The gangs portrayed here are not very realistic in the least bit, but that is not the intention. Though, I would like to see a remake, perhaps another adaptation of the book, to be more realistic and violent. With that said, don't expect this film to be saying anything about gangs and violence, which I would have loved to see. Yet this ""fantasy"" type gang film, is stylish and unique and oddly interesting. I always liked the ""journey to home/safety"" kind of story. Typically in a story like that we would get some great character moments but in this film, the characters are the same to me with the exception of Swan and Ajax. The acting is not great, there are some weird line deliveries. Otherwise, the film is great to look at with sark and gritty set pieces.The Warriors is a good film. I had fun and whether you liked it or not, I cam imagine that there was fun in it nonetheless.",The Warriors

121,KoolCatReviews,Warriors fight hard but couldn't land knock out blow,6,4 April 2020,Opening has some great shots the story we are introduced to is intresting. Pretty soon we feel danger from start to finish. The action scenes were good but I was left wanting little more. Some of the characters are little strange there motivation are hard to understand and it leaves the main story abit un-clear. However some character designs from the rival gangs and some of location shooting is fantastic. The pacing can feel alittle off. When the action gets going it feels great but it was dull at points. Not quite a cult classic or a re-watch but I'm glad I've seen it.,The Warriors
122,Rathko,"Yes, I dig it!",8,23 November 2005,"'The Warriors' is a thoroughly entertaining 90minutes of complete nonsense. The story is simple; the Warriors  the skinniest, most effeminate gang in New York  must fight their way from the Bronx to Coney Island evading the cops and rival gangs that are out to get them. The whole thing comes across like a cross between 'Assault on Precinct 13' and 'After Hours', and it's always nice to see some vintage, pre-cleanup NY locations. Sure the gangs look like something out of Cats, the dialogue is hilarious (the 'tougher' the funnier) and the performances pretty amateurish, but the tight plotting, Hill's focused direction and some genuinely interesting visuals more than make up for the shortcomings.",The Warriors
123,dusan-22,"Warriors, you are the best",10,5 August 2010,"One of the best action movies ever made. With IQ over 20 you will find the IMDb rating ridiculous. Many copycats have followed the steps of Walter Hill since 1979 and none even got close to Warriors. Camera, plot, movie rhythm with constant intensity + great soundtrack, everything we haven't seen for last 30 years. Film had become a cult before many generations of today IMDb users were born and most of the people therefore are not aware of the idolatry that this film spread around young generations round the world at that time. At the time when movie posters were still hanging on the doors and walls of the teenager's rooms Warriors were regular choreography. It would be such a shame that some wise guy ruins this epic movie by making its remake.",The Warriors
124,Ozzy2000,Gay film,4,19 April 2008,"I have recently watched this film after reading many reviews and can start off by saying this is not a classic film. It is offensive to compare this in any way to the Masterpiece ""A Clockwork Orange"" which was serious work on the pitfalls of modern Psychiatry in particular behavior modification of the criminal mind by means of ""Aversion Therapy"". Certain theatrical aspects of gangland fashion may have been lifted from the it that's about it. having lived in New York and having had first hand encounters with its gangland in 1980 I can tell you that this film has no resemblance to reality. The music of the times in particular this soundtrack is great but I can see the Eagle's Joe Walsh cringe every time he is reminded his music was used in this film. The rain soaked streets-capes of New York and the reflections of colored and normal street lights and the costume art direction enhance the great action cinematography of the film. The story about New York Street gangs uniting and then one gang being accused of shooting another gang and then struggling to get to their homebase through the exaggerated numbers of gangs is almost laughable. The constant use of the term ""faggots"" as an expression of homophobia in order to assert the masculinity of the gangs is also very funny as this is clearly a homosexual film. The lesbian dancing scene of the female Lizzy gang also highlights the film gay theme. But the fashions and the very gay looking and behaving male gang members are distinctly homosexual. Walter Hills idea that this is based on Greek mythology is not substantiated by the film only its homosexuality.I strongly recommend this film to all gay men, retro hippies and soul music loving dope smokers. The fight scenes are not really that violent their more like a scramble in a musical like ""West Side Story' and perhaps a musical approach would have helped in making this film a real classic. The Bee Gees would have made a better sound track like ""Staying alive"".",The Warriors

For a short time there was a hype about youth gangs.
It started with The Warriors.
Only a few like that movie still are still remembered, because at that time every genre was fast swamped with cheap Itallian copies.
So The Warriors...the story is simple. The biggest gang of NY holds a meeting with members of 100 other gangs. During that the chairman gets killed and The Warriors are wrongly blamed for it. Now they must get back to their own turf, fighting with every other gang on their way home.
If you look at it without nostalgia than the movie is bad. Bad acting, bad fighting, bad story.

The leader of the largest gang in the city, the Gramercy Riffs has called a meeting and a truce. Cyrus the gang leader, has a plan to unite all the gangs in the city, to form a sort of super crime family. Even though they will be going into hostile territory, the Warriors abide by the tenants of the truce and bring no weapons and only 9 members with them to the big meeting.While Cyrus pumps up the crowd with his oratory about taking over the city ""can you dig it?"", the gangs cheer in jubilation. As the police slowly and silently work toward the gathering a shot rings out. It appears not everyone is thrilled with Cyrus' plan to unite all the gangs. In the confusion, as Cyrus lays dying, the perpetrators (the Rogues) point the blame at the Warriors. The warriors leader Cleon is quickly overcome by the multitudes of gang members and beaten to death. As the cops sweep in and start beating and arresting gang members, the remaining 8 warriors in attendance, try to escape from the park while being chased by the police and rival gangs.War Chief Swan now finds himself in charge of the gang, and attempts to lead the remaining warriors, out of the city and back to their home turf in Coney Island. Along the way they will have to outwit and escape from an assortment of New York's finest. In addition, every gang in the city has been put on alert that the Warriors have killed Cyrus. The first gang to get the Warriors is sure to move up the ranks of gangs in the city and gain favor with the powerful Gramercy Riffs.This is a pulpy and violent film, with depictions of highly stylized gangs in New York City. The fight scenes in the film actually have excellent choreography, and although considered super violent at the time of its release, they seem a bit mild by todays standards. One of the more memorable parts of the film are the outrageous costumes that the various gangs wear in the film. Be it the vests that the Warriors wear or the baseball and face paint of the Furies, you're going to have some new Halloween costume options for next year.Despite the fact that this film is over 30 years old it has aged surprisingly well. The soundtrack, is fairly solid, and the characters are nothing if not memorable. If you like your films to have lots of stylized over the top violence, this film is certainly worth your time to check out. The Warriors is one of the those films that has achieved a sort of cult status, and you will be able to understand why after a viewing. While I cannot recommend this film for everyone due to the violence and subject matter, if those sorts of things don't bother you, check out The Warriors.Like what you see here?

Once it's established that we're in an alternate universe and the plot is nothing but a simple problem (something this director does better than anyone else) of getting from point A to point B while eluding all sorts of gangs and cops, it turns into non-stop action and suspense. It's basically what ""Escape From New York"" wanted to be, only the action is tenser, the pace is faster, the music is cooler, and the bad guys are more menacing (the Baseball Furies will give you nightmares!). It features some of the most original characters and dialog in movie history, and you'll be rooting for the heroes all the way.

Each one presents a unique challenge for this resourceful bunch. The largest, and most deadly gang in the city, the Riffs, are kept out of things, hovering throughout the movie as a dreaded threat, until the end, when they inexplicably come to the Warriors' aid. This seems to come from respect; that the Warriors were able to make it back home. The Riffs weren't about to annihilate a gang that had made it through an impossible journey. Not to mention that they weren't guilty of a shooting they had been set up for.The movie features a fantastic soundtrack, and a thrilling tone as the gang barely escapes various threats from rival gangs throughout the city. The cast is rather unremarkable, but very effective. James Remar is probably the best known actor among them, and he is a scene stealer as the emotional, angry, ready-to-rock-and-roll Ajax.

It's an old movie, so maybe the lines ran differently back then, but I swear there were continuity errors throughout (if they're going down the west side, why did I glimpse a sign for the 4 train?). However, I can vouch that it does indeed take f***in' forever to get to Coney Island by subway from anywhere outside Brooklyn.

The acting is decent, although the lead, Michael Beck, had a flat performance. This story basically starts with the arrival of all New York City gangs to a truce in central park. The distant Warriors gang, from Coney Island, are forced to make a long trek. At the rally, Cyrus, who is the host of this meeting, is gunned down by the Rogues gang, violating the ""no weapons"" order. David Patrick Kelly plays the assassin of the Rogues, who is an unstable and disturbed person. The Warriors are blamed by Luther because a member of the Warriors saw him do it. Next, members of Cyrus's own gang, the Grammercy Riffs, are now on a vendetta against the Warriors as well. The Warriors have to ""bop"" their way back to Coney Island alone now, with every gang in the city looking for them. Along the way back to Coney, Ajax, the muscle behind the Warriors, get arrested on a park bench for attempting to rape an undercover cop. The Warrior who saw Luther execute Cyrus is himself killed when he is thrown down into an oncoming subway car. Along the way, they gain a member: a prostitute from the Orphans gang who tags along. Their biggest fight takes place against the baseball Furies, whom they quickly dispatch. About 3/4 of the way through, the Riffs find out through an informant that it was the leader of the Rogues, and not the Warriors, who shot Cyrus. The Riffs then go to Coney and lie in wait for the real assassin. Along a beachfront in Coney Island, the Warriors finally confront Luther, who gets disarmed by Swan with a thrown knife, disabling Luther's arm. The Riffs then surround Luther and the Warriors agree to let them kill Luther themselves. The film ends with the Warriors and Mercy, the Orphans' prostitute, walking along the beach. The novel and the movie are just adaptations of The Anabasis, a story of ancient Greek soldiers fleeing the Middle East running from the historical Artaxerxes II of Persia.

143,ALauff,Expressive violence,8,18 September 2006,"Although this has sustained a reputation as a silly artifact of late-'70s kitsch—full of quirks like a Homeric DJ (whom we only see from the mouth down) who narrates the story, rival gangs marked by the most innocuous of characteristics (a gang of mimes!), and the comic book layout, which lends poignant counterpoint to the often gripping violence of the eponymous crew's wistful journey back to Coney Island—the most potent moments in the film are those in which this band of quarrelsome, loyal rejects are on the brink, backs against the wall and thrust into violence. The enthusiasm and brutal ingenuity with which these young men inflict and endure pain makes it impossible to dismiss the sensuality of this essential element of their way of living. Hill's strengths in this regard are those of mentor and predecessor Sam Peckinpah. Whereas Peckinpah was eternally preoccupied with violence as the unshakable defining truth of human interaction, Hill is concerned with violence as an expression of identity among the clashing gangs. Consider the feeble but strangely touching attempt the Orphans make of subduing the gang by force with their cosmetic razors or of a gang of women trying to make their name by bringing the Warriors to justice by the gun.This violence appears as an almost benign dance of slow-motion bodies crashing through glass, well-placed strikes and lashes of weaponry, better to admire the composure and forceful will of the participants. It has become a cliché to call such grandiosity balletic, but the nobly processional quality of these conflicts, each minimal gesture heightened, lingered upon and made iconic by Hill's camera, bear stark contrast to the swiftly paced chase plot that forms around them. Ultimately, he is not as concerned with the consequences of violence as much as how the will to harm can come from an honorable place.Among these central preoccupations lies a brilliant scene aboard a subway car as the gang, bedraggled from a night of fighting and fleeing, sits exhausted, contemplating their journey's end. A set of nicely dressed couples enter carelessly joking, dressed for the ball, as if dropped there from a different planet. They sit across from the bloodied Swan and the prostitute he's picked up for the ride. They silently consider each other. The revelry slowly dies. The newcomers look away, affected by their passengers' shoddy appearance. They soon exit. It's a rare close encounter with the ""other half,"" the only glimpse the Warriors get of a different world—coming as it does before the thudding disappointment of their impending Coney Island reality, it's yet another endorsement of life's transitory moments when any truth about reality one can imagine seems tangible.",The Warriors

147,filmbuff-36,Hit the Streets with the Warriors!,9,18 January 2000,"The very first time I saw this movie was on TNT's Monstervision of all places.  Joe Bob Briggs' explanation of this film was it took to make me a fan.This is an awesome movie about a gang from southern New York City that goes all the way up to the Bronx for a ""gang convention"", but ends up getting blamed for the murder of another gang's leader.What follows is literarly ""a night of hell"" for the nine members of the Warriors, who must now battle their way back to their home turf.  They have to work together if they want to make it back to Coney Island alive.The atmosphere of this movie is remarkable.  It never feels real; rather, it's more like a live action comic book.  You will be drawn to root for the Warriors as they go head to head with different street punks.  I recommend you watch the tv version, since their is an added scene at the beginning before the credits that has the gang leader handing out the tasks to the other members.I give it a 9.  No-holds-barred action to the extreme.",The Warriors
148,CaressofSteel75,One of the Best Action Movies Ever,8,6 December 2017,"The Warriors still stands up decades later as adrenaline fueled action in a tense, dark urban landscape that almost looks like a sci fi backdrop due to the great direction and cinematography of Walter Hill and Andrew Laszlo. The Warriors are a racially integrated gang from Coney Island who get implicated in the sudden assassination of a gang overlord. They have to make their way back home to Coney Island and become the target of every underworld outfit in New York City.It's been said that the theater lobbies would break out into fights after this movie was shown, and it's easy to see why. The action scenes are almost lyrical- every bit as good as the martial arts classics from earlier in the decade. I can easily see how impressionable people could get totally caught up in it back then.This movie launched a few decent show biz careers including James Remar, Michael Beck & Debra Van Valkenburgh. Rumors of a remake a few years ago proved unfounded, and they shouldn't even try. They'll never be able to create anything close to what they made here in 1979.",The Warriors
149,joncheskin,Entertaining and Interesting Gang Thriller,7,16 December 2015,"The Warriors is one of those movies that you walk out of and you don't quite know what to think. The premise is that a large conference of New York street gangs is being held, primarily for the purpose of organizing mass mayhem. The Warriors, a Coney Island gang, is in attendance, when suddenly the charismatic leader, Cyrus, is shot. The Warriors are blamed for the murder which they did not commit, and have to fight their way back home from the Bronx with every street gang in the city in hot pursuit. The story is from Xenophon of Greek Mythology about a small group of soldiers trapped behind enemy lines.This movie works for a variety of interesting reasons. First of all, it is topical--gangs are still tearing the country apart, and back in 1979 when the film was made the problem was even worse. However, this film does not remotely try to be realistic. Rather, it is simply a thriller that affords the audience a sort of weird vicarious enjoyment that they might get from being in a gang. The movie takes us through rumbles, car bombings, fist-fights with cops, stings, and other ""exciting"" things. The movie features crazy costumes, including gangs with baseball uniforms and bats, gangs on roller skates, female gangs that seduce then murder, large imposing gangs of African-Americans whose discipline seem to invoke the image of the Black Panthers. This is really comic book or graphic novel stuff, and it is done with great pizazz.And you do enjoy it. The treacherous journey through the city is really hair-raising, and the ending is satisfying. There is a visceral quality to the movie--somehow, it really helps us process the whole tragedy of the gang phenomenon. Most films will do this through a realistic drama. The Warriors does it by transforming the phenomenon into something else, something like a dream-like fantasy.Some people won't like it--it is violent and pretty preposterous. If you are into that sort of thing, however, the Warriors is a must- see.",The Warriors
150,nafps,Succeeds in Spite of Walter Hill Being So Awful,7,12 September 2021,"The film exists in its own world, one where being a gang member is all about looking cool. Where gangs look closer to what's in Batman comics than real life. And where gangs don't deal with being washed up and working at a car wash at 25 or 30, or dead or in prison.Most gang films show gangs as a problem. Warriors gives a fantasy to gang members of being not just cool, but having the power to take over. ""Can you dig it!?"" Gangs really wish this was real life.Hill is an awful film maker. Streets of Fire was junk. 48 Hours only succeeded because of Eddie Murphy. And this film works because of the fantasy.Not because of Hill's amateur directing, no different than a teen who might have his first camera.This film was a cult classic for a reason, a lucky accident that no one expected.

151,Squrpleboy,The Best Use Of Baseball Bats Outside A Ball Park!,7,17 January 2002,"I generally don't like action movies but The Warriors is anexception to the rule.  For good straight-out action and fun, I highlyrecommend this film.The movie is tense, with the title ""heroes"", The Warriors, constantlykept on the run by rival gangs, and full of hard-knuckleconfrontation at every turn.  The film looks quite dated now due tocharacters with big afros, packing switch-blades and baseballbats instead of  guns, graffiti-covered subway cars,  and gangswearing matching outfits (as opposed to a red or blue hanker- chief, gold chains and butt-hanging pants!), but for plain ole', kick- @$$, gang fights, this ones got it all!  You'll never see so manybaseball bats being swung, cracking heads and being brokenover someone's stomach or back in your life (if you enjoy that sortof thing!).  And the fighting in this film is the realistic kind, none ofthe computer enhanced silliness of combatants dueling in mid-air,or running up walls and flying across the room, that we constantlysee in today's schlock!The acting, particularly certain characters' deliveries of some of thedialogue, is a little cheesy sometimes but over-all good.  And thesoundtrack, the main theme in particular, is driving and adds to thetension set by the pacing of both the plot and editing.  Also thecinematography and lighting are superb; for a movie that takesplace almost completely in the dark (night) it is always clear and litwell enough to see every detail.  Just generally well directed andwell made.7/10  A good-time, pop-corn, action flick!",The Warriors
152,copper1963,For sale: Deno's Wonder Wheel.,10,1 October 2007,"Now that the graffiti is painted on the seawall, and the demise of the old Coney Island is inevitable, we still have Walter Hill's fabulous gang opus, The Warriors, to enjoy. The movie pulls you in from the opening shot of the Wonder Wheel at night, its box-like cars crashing like dice on invisible wires. A nightmare of neon, wet streets and gimmicky gangs rushes the viewer forward like an iron horse speeding off its tracks. Cyrus, the leader of the largest and toughest gang in the city, has his sights on taking over New York City ""one borough at a time."" His ambitions are a tad out there, but you have to admire his gumption. The gangs' pow wow in The Bronx (actually Riverside Park in Manhattan) reveals one thing: the gangs can ""soldier"" and not kill each other. No small task. Some of the gangs do fall out of the comic books, but, overall, the gangs strike some frightening poses. And no one will forget the entrance of the Baseball Furies into the game. The Orphans are a bit weak, ""minor league,"" but the Turnball A.C.s would send most of the population scurrying away to the nearest precinct. My favorite (when I first saw this film) gang, however, was the men's room nine: The Punks. The lad on the roller skates, moving through the underground tunnels, past a lost arcade, reminded me of a hungry rat. When his buddies, clothed in rugby shirts and overalls, join him in the classic rumble in the last unlocked restroom in the entire subway system, we, the moviegoer, are in store for a treat. They don't disappoint. The final showdown--between the Warriors and the Rogues--on the beach arrives with a burst of sunlight. Everyone squints. Enjoy the quick shot of the old Thunderbolt Roller Coaster--now demolished. Swan versus Luther is not an even fight: one has a knife, one has a gun. Then Cyrus' black-clad gang shows up armed to the teeth. I always get a chuckle seeing that a couple of the brothers bring hockey sticks. The movie is steeped in more reality than most critics give it credit for. The 70's WERE turbulent times in The Big Apple.Warning--beware Hill's Director's Cut. He somehow does the unthinkable: he spray paints his own work of art with a tone death brush. He lops off scenes with freeze frame cuts to the funny pages. And the final credits sequence, a slow walk across the sands, is eliminated entirely. An awful tinkering job.",The Warriors
153,KillerLord,"Straight, Simple and Pretty Realistic!",8,16 October 2008,"If you are looking for a movie with tons of action, the kind of which you see in the Arnold and Stallone movies, then this movie is not for you. Many a times we really enjoy these movies where there is not a trace of realism and all that is shown is one man tearing apart a complete army. Of course, the other extreme of movies is where everything is realistic and there is something called a story, plot and a climax. This movie fits neither of the categories and that is what makes this movie really special and unique. This movie starts out with a gang meeting. A gang leader wants to unite all the gangs to form one big crime empire. No sooner has he finished delivering the speech motivating all gangsters to unite than he is shot by a gangster in the crowd. He immediately shouts out that a member of the Warriors gang did it. And now, everyone is convinced that The Warriors are to be blamed and start hunting them. This story follows the attempts of the Warriors as they try to escape from all the rival gangs and the cops as well. Most of the movie happens in the dark of the night. And there is nothing unbelievable that happens throughout the movie. The Warriors are not super humans and quite many gang members succumb to traps of temptation and some lose their lives. The streets, stations and the alleys are all convincingly realistic. So, one thing we know about the movie is that it is not a typical action movie. It has a tone of realism. Yet this realism has its limitations. It is not meant to show you how gangs work in actuality. No. The methods of the gangs are made-up and the movie is not meant to be a documentary on gang wars. The movie is a weird but good balance between the thematic tones of action movies and reality based movies. An enjoyable movie overall though time and now, one tends to lose interest here and there as the movie slows down a bit. A very important point about the movie worth nothing is that this movie was made in 1979 and yet there is nothing about the movie that feels outdated. The movie is really made well.",The Warriors
154,varundelpiero,Come out to play...,7,2 November 2008,"It's easy to see why THE WARRIORS remains a cult favourite even 30 years after its release, as it has all the necessary elements of one. While the movie itself is decidedly 'not great', and lacking in mainstream appeal, it does feature a gang of likable, wrongly-accused characters running a gauntlet, trying to evade a number of colourfully-depicted rival gangs in order to make it back to the safety of their base, Coney Island. And what's not to like about that?THE WARRIORS creates a somewhat tribal feeling of entering battle together as one (not unlike the recent 300), while focusing on loyalty and brotherhood. The story is decent, and is filled with memorable scenes, most notoriously, the ""Warriors, come out to play!"" scene, and the commentary provided by the Radio DJ.This film is not a literary masterpiece. The acting is not exactly top-notch. It is not a film that will be decorated with accolades, but one which will live on in the hearts and memories of many viewers. Like I said, a cult favourite.7/10. 3 stars (out of 4). I find it hard not to place this in my 'Honourable Mentions' list. Recommended.",The Warriors

156,renofhate,One of the all-time greats. A classic.,10,19 September 2016,"The 1970s was a fantastic decade for movies. But most people, or at least, so many people either don't know about this golden gem, or they do but they're yet to see it. Personally, this and Star Wars are, in my opinion, the two greatest movies of the 1970s.The movie is about a New York Gang called The Warriors, who are framed / falsely accused of the murder of a very respected, high-up gang leader named Cyrus. The film sees the Warriors try and make their way back home as every other gang is set out to capture and kill them. It's one hell of a thrill-ride from start to finish.The Warriors is a movie that is, in a word, unique. I mean sure, its main genre of film is action, and there are tonnes of action movies out there. None of them are like this though, and if they are, then they're either bland or they're missing that beautifully original, strong essence - that, that spirit! That strong, glowing soul and spirit, you know? It's a movie of its own, and a damn good one for that matter.There's action, there's adventure, there's even some laughs, and not to mention there are so many great quotes. It's yet another very approachable and quotable movie. There's a lot going on in the film. The acting's pretty strong, and the characters are brilliant. Particularly, as it seems, Ajax is the one of the Warriors who people like the most, or so I believe anyway. He is quite possibly my favorite too, either him or Swan. But they're all good.A cult classic, The Warriors is one of my all time favorite movies. I think it makes my top 15 actually, that's how good it is. And it's one of the very few movies I rate a perfect 10/10. It absolutely deserves that rating. Loads of people have seen this movie, but it's not as big as it could be. It's kinda underground, to an extent.Either way, not so known or not, The Warriors is definitely not a hit or miss film - it's instead, a must see, for sure.10/10",The Warriors
157,kevandeb,What a Cult of a film!!,10,18 January 2006,"From 'Can you dig it suckas' to 'warriors come out to play' this film exults the brotherhood of belonging. many films have tackled gang culture, many films have been more realistic, many films have been more dramatic. So 'Who are the Warriors?' A mixed bunch from Coney Island making their way way to a clan gathering. 9 members allowed from each gang to hear Cyrus speak, like Moses coming down from the mountain, but Moses did not get shot!! panic ensues and The Warriors now find themselves a long way from home and not knowing they are blamed for the death of the leader of the biggest gang in New York - 'Riffs yeah' a strange mixture of current life depicted with a futuristic edge (Bladerunner?) So with all the clichés, patchy performances and unrealistic scenarios why does this film succeed? The answer? - God knows but i love it. i have seen this film over 30 times and i still want to watch it time and time again. i am dumbfounded with myself for seeing this film more than so many great films. At the end of the day i can only assume that in Swan's place i would as cool as him.... gotta get me a leather vest like that!!",The Warriors
158,nathanschubach,"Good for a curious watch, but I doubt I'll buy the movie poster",5,16 July 2011,"I just watched this movie for the first time, and I'm 30 years old. I don't know why I've never seen this before, but after actually playing the Xbox video game based on the movie, I found myself wondering what this movie is actually likeand I love gangster/street gang movies! So from the beginning, the premise seems pretty odd: a street gang Messiah named Cyrus (member of New York's Gramercy Riffs gang) is gunned down by a one individual, a member of one of the21 (?)gangs in New York called to a meeting of the minds to overtake the city all as one unit instead of dividing into their individual gangs. The blame is put on a member of The Warriors (just a street gang in the wrong place, wrong time) to cover up the real shooter. Somehow Cyrus has enough clout in the city to make every gang in the city fight on Cyrus' gang's side, so they are all ordered to find and bring The Warriors back to The Riffs alive or ""smashed."" There's some Greek storyline that ties this whole story about reaching the water (or the beach) which acts like The Warriors ""base"" or something.I have a number of problems with the movie. As original as the gangs and characters are in the movie, the premise is ridiculous. I feel that Walter Hill (the director) and whoever adapted the screenplay from the 1965 novel were pretty much trying to make what we saw in the movie ""300."" The comic-book-style effects were interesting, but the story really sucks in my opinion. You can't tell me all of these street gangs are zombified cult-members of Cyrus out for Warrior blood and play it off, as the director does, that this is another planet being represented and not real-life. Sure. Whatever. Cop out is more like it. Most of the movie is about street gangs, ""street"" meaning Earthly, neighborhood- defending gangs. So why were The Warriors so far out of their element to come to this meet-up? They were practically a thousand miles away from their base? Why does this Cyrus-meeting concern them then? And the beach is your turf? Good luck ""patrolling"" that area with 27 members.I did like the music created for the film, which was mostly done as a score with a few prerecorded songs added in, including a Joe Walsh tune recorded before it was done with The Eagles. The cast that played The Warriors and their ""found"" girlfriend for the movie were all excellent with their own traits and personalities. The direction of the park fight between the Warriors and The Baseball Furies (nearly the winner of the dumbest gang name in the movie, the winner going to the Xylophones) was supposed to remind the audience of a Kurosawa Japanese samurai-film according to the director and editor, but I don't see itit wasn't that amazing.Overall, worth the watch but I doubt I'll watch it again unless there is a director commentary track or something worth reliving the simple experience that watching the movie is. It doesn't really excite me at anytime in the film, and the movie seems to bank on the catchphrase ""Warriors, come out and plaaa-aay"" way too much.",The Warriors

161,srobi280,Be lookin' good warriors.... all the way back to Coney...,10,4 April 2006,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. A gang from Coney Island called The Warriors travels to the Bronx for a big gang meeting. Only 9 members of every gang are allowed to attend the meeting, unarmed. Over a hundred gangs show up. The leader of the biggest gang (the Riffs), a guy named Cyrus, plans on uniting all the gangs in the city. His plan is cut short by a bullet when a gang member named Luther shoots him. He quickly blames it on the Warriors, who then have to flee the scene along with the other gangs. Not knowing whether the truce is still on, the Warriors head back to Coney. Along the way, they soon discover that every gang in the city thinks they shot Cyrus, and everyone is after them. They have to make it past the crazy Turnbull ACs, the wimpy Orphans, the menacing Baseball Furies, the charming, all-female crew the Lizzies, the Punks, and finally Luther himself, all while constantly dodging police.The Warriors is a masterpiece that is simply ahead of it's time. The tense atmosphere of the movie makes for a great viewing. The gangs are comic-book like, the fight scenes are the most realistic I have ever seen in any movie, and it contains tons of catchy lines. It is not a realistic portrayal of gang life in the 70s, and it isn't supposed to be. The whole movie is surreal. It isn't totally believable, but it isn't impossible, and I like that. The casting couldn't be better. And the characters are most memorable. Ajax, the big muscle-head; Swan, the leader; Luther, the insane villain who shot Cyrus for no reason because ""he likes doing things like that""; Rembrandt, the new blood; the baseball furies; Mercy, the annoying big-mouthed whore; etc. And to top it all off, the music goes incredibly well with the movie.

When he is murdered in cold blood, a street gang from Coney Island called the Warriors is blamed. They must now fight there way home through deadly gang territories, through rival gangs and through police.A cult classic, though not the best film one that for some reason resonates with the viewer. The fighting sequences are a bit cheeses but the characters and the different styles of gangs make this movie a charming little action adventure film. How its gained pop culture status can be attributed to many different factors. Made in the late 70s its a film that is far ahead of its time in its pacing and its content. Not overtly violent or bloody, this film is a pure joy and pleasure. The more you view it the more it grows on you. The acting in this movie is decent as is its somewhat clichéd story but overall it is an enjoyable film.

163,KingBrian1,The Night of the Warriors,9,20 December 2014,Alive with the sound of the streets a gang meeting is being held in the Bronx called by Cyrus. Word reaches Coney Island that the truce between the gangs is in place and that gang members are to attend at his behest. Not wanting to disrespect the new gang lord the Warriors decide to journey deep into enemy territory. Cyrus presents his grand plan to unite the gangs all under his leadership. A vicious gang takes him out and blames the assassination on the Warriors. Now they must escape from this urban jungle of gangs and police officers sent to kill them or arrest them.This movie based on a Greek army that was stuck in Persian territory and is a modern take on a legendary battle. The Warriors must face a number of armed thugs sent by Cyrus's gang seeking retribution. Disseminated through the radio they command and coordinate subordinates to eliminate the Warriors. Facing their own internal problems the Warriors get separated and loose three of their members while also gaining a new female gang member. They eventually ride the train home to freedom but discover their foes have followed them home.It could be claimed that this movie glorifies gang culture and there is some truth to that argument. It is difficult to excuse the behaviour of the gangs but let's being clear this was set in 1970's New York. This was a very dark period in US history. This film merely depicts an authentic portrayal of gang life. Nothing alluring to gang life is shown in this film. If anything it does a lot better in showing the damaging side of gang culture.I thought it was a really good movie.,The Warriors
164,Baldrick44,"All right, but dated.",7,6 July 2007,"The Warriors is certainly a movie that is both defined by its time and also ahead of it. So it can't be called a movie which summed up an era ( like Saturday Night Fever ) nor can it be a movie which opened up new worlds ( like Star Wars ).This is set in a sort of dystopian world in the near future, where gangs of young men/women are rife. Enter Cyrus, a an with a vision to unite the gangs to help take over the city of New York. To this end he invites hundreds of gangs to a sort of rally during a truce. However, this is broken when he is assassinated by a member of the Rogues; after which the Warriors are framed and they have to find a way to get back to their home turf whilst being targeted by every gang in NYC.The premise for this is quite good and although this has an R rating in Australia ( lord knows why ) there is actually very little violence. Instead there is a great amount of tension as the gang try to scrap their way back home. However, there are a couple of problems. One of them is the fact that the dialogue for a dystopian future still sounds like the dialogue for two 70's kids in a pinball arcade and sometimes it really seems clumsy. Secondly is the 'villian'- who shot Cyrus in the first place. He's just a nothing character that is pathetically boring to watch. One wonders how in the world he became leader of the Rogues.Overall though the Warriors does have some good scenes and the comic book shot-to-shot idea is incredibly original. These pros outweigh the cons enough to make this worth a look.",The Warriors

I have given it a 3 out of 10 score to reflect this.It kinda just seemed like every scene was exactly the same. ""Hey, let's stay here."" ""No, let's keep going."" ""Ok."" That's it! That was every scene.And it didn't really make much sense to me why they ""had"" to get to Union Square, or anywhere else for that matter. I guess it was to get to their home turf or something? But why would that be important? Why wouldn't they just hide if they were being chased?! No, go out in public where the police and other gang members can get at you, it's worth the risk.The 7.7 rating blows my mind. I think a 5.0 rating would be kind, a 4.0 rating a little more accurate. Like I said, I gave it a 3 because it was just a ho-hum movie. Big deal. It isn't unique either, there are lots of other movies with the same plot.I do like Michael Beck though. He was pretty good in the movie, the only thing in the movie I would say was ""good."" He was in some sweet episodes of Murder She Wrote, I recognized him from those.",The Warriors
171,Bigweight66,You come out and play!,10,4 January 2021,"A cult classic movie and a great action movie. A huge and fierce inner city gang called the Riffs, come up with a plan to amalgamate all the gangs from the city and suburbs, and take full control over their areas. A big meeting takes place at night with 9 delegates from 100 gangs that attend the meeting. As expected with gang mentality something goes very wrong. This results in the Warriors, a Coney Island gang being hotly pursued mostly at night, by numerous violent gangs. The Warriors are kind of a likeable bunch with maybe Ajax (James Remar) being the exception. Ajax is a bad tempered street thug, Remar plays the role well. The Warriors leader soon becomes Swan (Michael Beck) who is a stone faced serious kind of a guy. The other gangs in the movie are an assorted bunch with their own unique looks. The sets and scenery very much reflect the era when this film was made. There is plenty of action and tense moments with chases, fights with The Warriors trying to find a safe way back home. I was 16 in 1979 when this movie was released and it hit a chord with me. I remember the train stations and travelling by trains at night being a bit risky because of the gangs. Since 1979 I must have seen this movie well over 10 times now, and I still enjoy watching it every few years.",The Warriors
172,charlietuna,Middle Class Punk,9,25 January 2001,"In ""79"" I was 14 and a west coast middle class punk.  This movie was considered so ""dangerous"" that it played on one screen out in the lower class section of town.  Needless to say, I loved it.  It captured that whole angst of the us versus them mentality of the day.  The dark lighting, the portrayal of homosexual characters that resembled reality all gave it a sense of refreshing realism for me and my crew.  Walter Hill has not matched it since.",The Warriors
173,ctrout,A Definite Cult Classic,10,22 February 2006,"The Warriors is the story of a small time gang from Coney Island who's mistakenly accused of killing a rival gang leader during an enormous meeting of every gang in New York. Now the Warriors must fight for survival as every gang is looking to get revenge while they try to make it back to their home turf.The film seems like it would have been forgotten over the years because of its little known cast, but that didn't happen. It developed a cult following just like so many other great films that were overlooked when they first came out. This is one of the best of those cult films.Not only is it about gangs and fighting, but also about loyalty, trust, and friendship. Of course, a movie like this disguises those things because of its tough look and rough feel. You just have to really watch a movie like this and study it to get those little qualities that it gives off.That's not the only thing that makes this movie so great. I guess it's because I love the '70s, but I just thought that all of the campiness and that decade's look and feel were so well captured in this film. From the music to the sayings and everything else, this movie is so '70s. Which is why it could never justifiably be remade. It does work as a video game though, which is what it was turned into last year.I guess I'll sum up this film by saying that it's just really cool. If I had to give the definition of what that word meant, this film would be that definition. Not only are the Warriors cool, but every other gang is too, especially those intimidating Furies. If you ever wanted to feel like you were part of a New York city gang, this is probably the closest you'll come. The Warriors is definitely an amazingly fun and excellent movie.",The Warriors
174,Whythorne,Bumble in the Bronx,1,4 November 2009,"On IMDb, it is commonplace to run across negative reviews that include a statement such as ""one of the worst movies I've ever seen"" or ""worst movie ever made,"" etc. Those statements sometimes come off as knee jerk reactions to a sub par movie that doesn't deserve such lofty discrediting. In the case of ""The Warriors"" however, one can trust that such comments are well warranted.Ironically, the premise for the movie - a gang trying to return to its home turf with every other gang in NY hot on its heels for revenge - is not bad, and I hope the remake of this is far more successful at realizing that premise.It won't be hard to do so, since this movie is a disaster in every aspect. The script is grade-school level and performed amateurishly by a ""never heard of 'em"" cast. The styling of the gangs is remarkably silly. And this all takes place with a cheap-sounding electronic soundtrack that sounds like it could have been an experiment by John Carpenter, when as a kid he got his first Casio for Christmas.One would think that a gang film like this would be high in impact and tension, but the presentation of the gangs and their individual members are more humorous than anything else. I don't know who should get the booby prize for silliness...my vote would go to either the ""Baseball Furies"" who look like members of Kiss that had just raided a Little League locker room, or the gang that looked like hillbillies on skates who took a wrong turn on their way to the Roller Derby. But they all look like rejects from Saturday Night Fever, reinforcing the notion that the seventies could very well have been the worst decade of style in human history.The lack of graphic violence, which although gratuitous in ""Kill Bill""-type films, but essential to films like ""Saving Private Ryan"", detracts from a film like this which is already lacking so much in gritty realism.The script seems to have been written in an ad hoc style, and if you read some of the trivia about this movie, that seems to have been the case at times, as dialogue and situations had to be invented on the spot to account for behind the camera incidents.However, the fact that there are no characters to root for, since every character in this film is an annoying jerk, may be the biggest detraction to a film that is without a single edge-of-your-seat moment. Once again, who cares if some Warrior gang member gets the snot beat out of him and doesn't make it back to Coney Island if he is just as obnoxious and unlikeable as any other rival gang member?If there is any entertainment value in this film, it's that it can provide plenty of fodder for sarcastic and amusing comments from the living room peanut gallery. Other than that, the cult status and ridiculously high IMDb rating for this film is absolutely inexplicable.",The Warriors

176,yellowtail_tuna,Gang fight action in the late 70s fashion,9,31 August 2020,"After a gathering of gang groups goes wrongs, a group called the Warriors has a hard time just to go back to their hometown because they are falsely accused of the murder of the leader of the most powerful group and chased by the gang groups.This film has almost no meaning, but it's cool and fashionable. All we see is the Warriors just traveling midnight from the north end to the south end of New York City. In the way are the various types of gang groups. It kind of reminds me of action video games, where you are given the goal to go and fight various types of enemies on the way.One of the best parts of the film is the costume design. Each group has a uniform. A group wears martial art uniforms, while another group is in Nazi-like leather jackets. Baseball uniforms with painted faces, or denim overalls with colored shirts. It's exciting to see the crowd of gangs in different uniforms run around in the midnight city.I was impressed by every character in the film, Swan, other members of the Warriors, and Mercy. The main antagonist Luther, the true murderer in the gathering, persistently chases Warriors. He is psychopathic and always exhilarated in aggression.It's also interesting that the most powerful authority is not the police but the largest gang group. They even rule the local radio station, and the DJ, with her elegant voice, announces the current situation to the gangs. The songs played by the DJ are part of the film's soundtrack. The songs are in the late 70s post-punk vibes, which make the film very exciting too.",The Warriors
177,jb-448,Best Street-Gang Movie Ever,9,19 August 2007,"This is a great movie. The scenes are great particularly the fight scenes. The grittiness of them is extarordinary. The gangs are excellent as well. My favs are the Gram Riffs, The Baseball Furies and of course the warriors. Its a shame Fox died as well. He was one of my favs. And the way he died too. I hope i never get hit by a freaking train. The Warriors has some of the best quotes too. I constantly say CAN YOU DIG IT! It's sweet. But the best of the best is of course Warriors, Come out to play. The way that line is delivered is brilliant and if you were faced by the Rogues and they threatened you you better haul ass outta there. In summary one of the best movies of the 70's",The Warriors
178,silva-w-pius,A cult classic,8,11 August 2013,"Is the Warriors one of the greatest film ever made? Hold on that's a silly question! It's not ""one of greatest"" it's more like ""The greatest film ever made"". There was me, in my room motionless. My mind was blank... I knew I wanted to watch an extraordinary piece of filmmaking, but what film was worthy of such a title... then it hit me, the ceiling parted way, and from the heavens, the film gods bestowed on me, one film title... The Warriors! It provides a potent mixture of love, heart pounding action and the strong bonds friendship. It puts the kick in kick a**, the heart in Braveheart and the swan in Black swan, as it tells the story of a small gang named The Warriors, who are framed for killing the leader of the biggest gang in new York, and in turn have to avoid hordes of other gangs as they bid to ""waste"" them before they reach Coney island. What give it the kick? Amazingly choreographed fight scenes, which leave you on the edge of your seat, fast paced editing and great angles; helping you feel that your part of the action, which made me personally feel as if I was also wearing that awesome crimson, vest jacket myself. As if I was the 10th member of The Warriors. The film is also blessed with flawless cinematography that lights up and electrifies the dark cauldron of the dystopian inner city backdrop. What give it the heart? Amidst all the violence and chaos, some may argue that it also exploited and glorified gang violence. But on contrary, felt that the core theme of the film, was a sense of togetherness and loyalty, and that's the only reason that the warriors where able - on the most part, to avoid the other gangs to get back home. This is best represented in the scene where Ajax, played by James Remar defies the gang and arrases a women, they leave. But they still try and go back for him. And that's what the warriors are about, family and friendship against anything, so ultimately nothing to do with the coolness of gang culture. What give it the swan? A tense and eerie score that sores majestically through scene to scene, placing a almost hypnotic trance on the audience. I personally thought it was perfect for the film, as it matched the pace of the action and almost felt as if it was a slow chime acting as an ever present warning that time was running out on the Warriors, so they had to stay alert, and reach Coney as quick as possible. Swan is also happens to be the name of the leader, played by Michael Beck, giving a solemn yet poetic performance, as he added patients and smarts, to the rag tag gang of hot heads. So why waste your time watching sub-par films, when you could go straight for the top and watch the greatest film of all time. An amazing score that echoes throughout, captivating any audience. Astonishing fight sequences, that provide more thrills then any theme park, ever created. And a story of love and friendship, that tugs so gently on the heart strings. At times this film left me speechless, 3rd time watching, it still gives me the same expression, this reaction is defiantly contagious. A must watch for you film buffs! That's if you can dig it sucker!",The Warriors
179,edwarddowney-16335,The ultimate gang film.,10,17 April 2021,I first saw this film on its release and was blown away. This film was ahead of its time the gangs the fights it wast one of the best films I had seen and still is..10/10.,The Warriors
180,mjhalta,If you don't love this movie then your a socio path,10,21 July 2006,"Absolutely perfect. All movies are made up of scenes that either work or don't work, are memorable or forgettable. This movie transcends individual scenes and becomes something more than the sum of all it's parts. Very few movies achieve this. The best movies also disturb your complacent Psyche and leave you thinking about them for days after. Yes by the end of this movie I wanted to join the Warriors and their daily struggle for respect and a little piece of turf. I realized just how easy and middle class my life had always been and it somehow made me restless. The ""Fight Club"" had the same effect on me, making me feel like I was missing something. Perhaps I was after all just a momma's boy, incapable of summoning up the courage to take a chance on getting my pearly white teeth knocked out in a fight.",The Warriors
181,dgl1199,Can you dig it?,9,21 April 2005,"Let's face it, The Warriors is no strain to the intellect. The story is fairly straight-forward: Nine members of a NYC street gang, the Warriors from Coney Island, are wrongfully accused of a murder they didn't commit and must fight their way from one end of the city to their home at the other. For anyone unfamiliar with New York geography that's about 27 miles from the Bronx to Coney Island. Along the way they have to ""bop their way"" past a colorful patchwork of New York street gangs as violent as they are flamboyant. Skinheads, Lesbians, Mimes, even a Baseball gang. The story is loosely based on Anabasis, the ancient tale of Greek mercenaries forced to fight their way home through hostile territory during the Pelopenissian War.The simplicity of the story lends itself to the development of the protagonists throughout their little nocturnal adventure. What started out as a gang of thugs ostensibly no different from any other on the streets evolves into a story one might define as humanistic, even heroic. You quickly discover that this is no garden variety street trash, these guys are good. They fight better than anyone else out there and you can't help but cheer them on from one bop to the next. It's what I would categorize as a ""guy's movie"". It's violent, it's raunchy, it's at times just plain stupid. But you can bet you'll be sucked into it as easily as I was, if for nothing else, it's sheer primal value.I have to say this film stretches things a bit. No doubt the streets of 1970's New York City were populated with gangs preserving their territory. The crime rate back then was astronomical. But I grew up right outside NYC in the 70's and never once do I recall seeing anything remotely resembling some of the cartoonish gangs depicted in the film. Oh there were gangs, just not like this. And some of the gangs they encounter are laughable, others not so much. It was said there really were gang members used in the film and it's not to difficult to pick them out.Overall Walter Hill did an amazing job with this one. The film is shot almost entirely at night which gives it an eerie, almost macabre edge to it. The fight scenes are very well done and incredibly realistic. There is a sloppiness to it though as film crew and equipment are visible multiple times, editing mistakes are rampant, and some scenes are so bad they just scream ""one take"". But it has a flow and pace that keeps you locked in. Michael Beck and James Remar are hands down the best acting in the film.If you're looking for a fun, fast paced, adrenaline rush of cheese and sweat, you gotta see this one. It remains one of of my favorites.",The Warriors
182,stuprince,"Dated, but great gang film",8,3 May 2003,"Although some of this film looks very dated, and the portrayal of gangs, somewhat accurate for the 1970s, looks a little silly today, The Warriors is one of the best movies about street conflict ever made.  If you are trying to make this into ""Boys in the Hood"" you will feel a little lost, but the idea of gangs having to fight their way through a big city to get home is exciting and action filled.  Plus, at the end you see real, glass Coke bottles and they can make an erie sound!",The Warriors
183,MikeMvrd,A journey of righteous,9,21 November 2020,"A gang film about a gang The Warriors who was invited to a meeting up state where Cyrus leader of the Riffs gives a speech to unify the rival gangs in the city and reclaim it themselves.I really enjoyed that this was in the time era 1978, 1979 period giving a rawness feel of the film that didn't have the technology film makers use now. Everything was on location and jammed with action sequences.The cast is low key where you see the future potential in their careers would take them, this film stood out different because it didn't involve guns, car chases, sexual scenes such as nudity etc. Or star studded casting to hype up the roles.This was about unity, honor, respect to it's decree. The Warriors making a journey back home facing the threats such as the police and rival gangs in the city. It makes you wonder rather The Warriors could make it or who will be the last man standing.The gangs are also interesting with what little role background they have we can get a vibe that these were heavy hitters especially when the Riffs include them on their network.This is a great gang film that has alot of action a little love and glory.",The Warriors
184,peter-ramshaw-1,A wild ride home,8,5 February 2007,"'The Warriors' was a very pleasant surprise. I'd put off seeing it for so long thinking it'd be a sort of unintelligible Spike Jonze sort of black gang movie. Why, I don't know.I couldn't have been more wrong though. While the plot is very contrived (yeah, like all the gangs in NY are going to even try to get together to run the city) this is a good chase yarn. That's all it is, mind you but it's done very well. The acting is terrific and, while the fight scenes seemed a little over choreographed to me I'm willing to this that was a stylistic thing rather than a mistake (this was about the time, 1979, when kung fu type movies were all the rage after all).There's a lot to like about this movie. Why it's still rated R is beyond me given we see M rated movies with more violence and language these days. That only re-enforced the need for the Australian censorship board to routinely re-classify all films every ten years to update the ratings to relevant community standards. While we are at it, censorship board, if your reading this, it's about time you classified all books and CDs as well.",The Warriors
185,rcoates-661-22249,Escape from the Bronx,10,7 March 2010,"Walter Hill's The Warriors is one of the best action films of the 70s, full of drive and heart and adrenaline straight through to the end credits. It reminds me of two John Carpenter films, Assault on Precinct 13 and Escape from New York, with its outnumbered heroes, tough-talking romantics, weird multiracial gangs with mysterious vendettas, and nocturnal pursuits through urban wastelands set to tense, unsettling synthesizers. Seamlessly bridging past and future, The Warriors is a rare film that actually lives up to the cliché compliment of being timeless.Sadly, the ""Ultimate Director's Cut"" on the 2005 DVD release is, as others have indicated, an utter botch job, totally wrongheaded, and tantamount to auto-vandalism on Hill's part. I felt dirty having it in my DVD player and immediately sought out the discontinued 2001 edition. Any true lover of 70s cinema is going to feel the same, and is advised to avoid the Ultimate Director's Crud even at the cost of paying more for the out-of-print original DVD release.",The Warriors

What is this, Gangs of Theme Park Land? Many of these different gangs dress up like clowns. In the beginning they all worship this messiah guy who speaks in this hilarious manner and shouting out ""Can you dig it?!"" and ends up shot dead. Nobody has a bloody clue who shot him and all the other gangs are chasing down the wrong gang being the movie's protagonists the Warriors. The movie is OK and is watchable but it's nothing special.So no, I don't dig it, it's a very poor movie that's got cult following people blinded by it's own nostalgia factor.

Filmed with a low budget and a cast of no-names, it has held up pretty well over time.The plot follows the framing of a gang known as the Warriors, who are at a huge gang summit when the big boss gets assassinated. With all the other gangs notified to hunt them down and kill them, The Warriors must try and stick together and make there way home to their 'territory'.Essentially, this is really just a B grade movie, with a great deal of well choreographed fights making up most of the film.

In reality, this is a microcosm of everything that is destroying America: (1) Obsession with New York City, which for the past 50 years has degenerated into the most pathetic cesspool in America, although it still fancies itself the ""Big Apple,"" (2) romanticizing thuggery and debauchery, (3) silly obsession with the lowest and most idiotic people, who have about as much in common with ancient Greek heroes (see opening sequence) as Homer has with such frauds as Jack Kerouac or Maya Angelou.

191,MovieManiacX,Warriors....Come Out To Play!!!!!,10,25 March 2005,"I absolutely loved The Warriors. It's a very gritty, depressing movie that has a gang of (mostly) likable characters that basically have to fight and escape the many different gangs on their way back to their home turf. It's a relatively low budget flick that's a helluva lot of fun.All of the gangs that The Warriors confront (or are confronted by) are great. The Turnbull AC's, The Orphans, The Lizzies, The Gramercy Riffs, The Rogues, The Punks, and my personal favorite, The Baseball Furies are perfect. They're all different in their own ways. The Baseball Furies are the most flamboyant, but are very cool and very threatening.The Warriors themselves are great. Swan is excellent as the gang's quiet and sensible leader. Ajax is the typical loudmouth of the group, but hey, I liked him! I also liked Rembrandt because he was the innocent kid caught in the middle of a gang war, but held his own. Everyone else is good as well.The setting is used to great effect. The dark city streets feel very claustrophobic and menacing. The feeling of an ambush lies around every corner. This depiction of New York is also very similar to John Carpenter's Escape From New York, which I think practically mirrors the look and feel of the dirty, grimy, run-down New York City.This is the film that uses the infamous and highly quotable line: ""Warriors.......Come Out To Play!!!!!!"" Trust me, after you see it, you'll be saying it too. The Bottom Line:This flick is a lot of fun for everyone! An interesting premise, enjoyable characters, a great setting, and much more makes this a great movie. This classic film deserves more recognition from the public!",The Warriors
192,TrickTaylor,After all these years...,7,5 July 2007,"Every so often a major slice of American pop culture just passes me by. Such is the case with The Warriors, a movie that took me almost 30 years to see. Luckily I watched the Director's Special Edition with enough little documentary features to let me know just how big of a stir this little gem caused.Having never seen the original, I have no idea how the Director's cut differs. Seems strange that the original wouldn't try to lead the audience to the belief that this takes place in an alternate future. It clearly is not meant to represent real life in any way.What strikes me the most about the Warriors is how it is shot, using locations that give the viewer the ultimate glimpse of New York City in the late 70's....a dark, dirty, violent place with an energy all its own.Funny how the leader of the fight home is an Andy Gibb look alike. Maybe the gritty realism has been lost over time, but I saw this movie as nothing more than a cartoon. The situations were grand, but the lack of detail and intelligence within the script often frustrated me. For example, the whole city knows the Warriors have to take the train home...and none of the rival gangs can read the map good enough to head them off? I'm sure the finer points of this epic have been hashed, bashed, and re-heated within these comments. Yes, it a fun slice of scummy movie making... an art perfected in the grindhouse 70's. Unfortunately, I never had a chance to fall in love with it before the silliness of it all came through. Glad I saw it, but no need to go on and on about it.",The Warriors

But one gang dosen't want that at all. So they kill him at the rally and blame it on THE WARRIORS, a small neighborhood gang that's not that bad looking or menacing .But looks can be deceiving. Now on the run for the cops and rival street gangs for around the world, they see only one way out.... HOME.Now the plot may or may not sound all that, but trust me it is. The movie in reality itself is just like life. The reason why I say that is not because of the gang violence, but because of the stories that intervene in our way of our goal. Their goal is to get home, on that journey people and places stop for a reason. Sometimes it is because of the plot and a lot of times it is for their own. And the way it resolves is amazing. Walter Hill has made a movie that will stay in my heart forever, He will tease you, scare you, and even thrill you with his direction. You have to see this film, you'll love it.

The Warriors have to make it from the Upper Bronx to Coney Island with every gang in town trying their own unique ways of knocking them off. Baseball mimes, Roller Skating posses, chick gangs, and of course, the ""Riffs"" do their darnedest to knock off the resilient Coney Island gang before they can make it back to their stomping ground. A local radio announcer (the woman from ""Where in the World is Carmen San Deigo?"") narrates their progress downtown, tipping off rivals and setting up further confrontation.

200,lonnielongino,Don't get the love,2,19 June 2020,"I just can't for the life of me figure out the amount of love The Warriors gets. It is a truly bad movie. It is laughable in many points that are supposed to be serious. The plot is nonexistent. The acting is sub B movie. There is no blood in any of the violence. It looks like a bad TV movie. The so called street gangs were so cheesy it ruined any credibility the film has, i mean baseball unoform wearing clown face painted gangs & roller skaters in overalls, really!! Plus the whole plot was this gang the Warriors got falsely accused of killing a gang lord by another gang. They try all night to get home , running into these comic book gangs. And when the final battle comes about, we are waiting for a reason as why they were wrongly accused and the answer ""i don't know i just do stuff like that""....What????? Lazy writing! Just don't waste your time if you expect a serious movie, if you don't mind a poorly acted comic book, have at it!",The Warriors
201,lukalele,Still good,7,5 April 2007,"Here are the reasons I decided to see this film: I've heard a lot about it from cult fans. I've played the game. I remember seeing the scene and catch phrase made famous by DPK in my childhood, and it's always stuck in my memory. I know there's a remake coming out, and I wanted to see the original before it did. And lastly, it's the kind of film I generally enjoy. I thought it'd be showing it's age by now, and it did in certain ways, but not nearly as much as I thought it would and overall I thought it was great. I can understand why it's a classic and still has a huge following today. Throws you right in at the deep end from the start, moves along at a cracking pace, never lets up. Remakes don't often do the original justice, but let's hope they get it at least half right, and they'll be doing well.",The Warriors
202,JacksonW0523,"excellent film, a cult classic!",9,2 April 2020,"The way NYC is depicted in this movie has a certain unique style to it. It pretty accurately depicts how NYC was in the 70s. I live in Brooklyn so this is like a historical film of the city. The different gangs have their own uniforms that stands out from each other. The actors have good chemistry between each other. The pacing and the storytelling is great never did it slow down to the point where it felt boring or dragged on. The fight scenes were fairly well done for its time. I only have one little issue and that is I wanted the main villain guy, Luthor to have more to his motive of killing Cyrus than just I wanted to kill him for the sake of killing him.",The Warriors

Of course the favorite gang in the whole movie is The Baseball Furies.  I actually went to a Halloween party last year (1999) and there were a group of 5 guys dressed up as the Baseball Furies.  That right there should tell you how monumental this film was/is.  It's dark. It's packed with action. And there are some very interesting/entertaining characters and character situations to watch.  The whole atmosphere of being chased and 'on the run' is perfectly captured by Hill.  I still quote many of the phrases the Warriors use when I'm hanging with my friends.  Let's just 'soldier' through there, 'you guys are acting like faggots', etc.  Not that I'm a homophob, it's just fun using some quotes like that around my friends and seeing what response I'll get.",The Warriors

208,morganmpoet,"""Who are...the WARRIORS?!""",8,18 September 2015,"A great 70's cult classic that stamps itself onto the consciousness of many with it's classic themes & noir look. Really near perfect in terms of concept & execution. Ya Joe Bob Briggs featured it on Monster Vision & his intro was hilarious, for instance he wonders why these guys didn't just steal & hot wire a car but NO they only travel by subway! Har...yes the plot is not realistic....but the themes are well played out. Just suspend your disbelief & enjoy 'the journey up'.On the original release with the introduction & speech by the original war chief on Coney Island before they get on the subway I actually preferred that as he outlines the mission and in reference to the Director cut that jettisoned this entire prologue, I prefer the original as well I do not really care for the cartoon animated swipes but even that cannot mar this classic enough to make a difference to me. It's still a cult film of the highest order.Michael Beck & James Remar are the 2 primary forces here & they both do well within their characters. Highly recommended classic 70's, one of Walter Hill's best.Finally, as to the director's cut & the complaints, a few more observations, it's his film, he can cut how he wants & we can prefer whichever version we fans like. I am sure the older versions are out there. I had one on VHS with the original prologue. Nowadays I am not sure if that version is available. I wish it had been included in the director's cut as a bonus material addition.",The Warriors
209,Mondo-Cane,Can You Dig It!!!,10,6 January 2002,"Tell those Hollywood big shots that THIS is how you make a film.  I love this film because of all the different gangs you see and the action is non stop because The Warriors are fleeing from the cops and other gangs for a murder they did not commit.Too bad kids today that are too easily influenced by the media are imitating the boring gangsters and villians put out by modern media.  Just once would I like to see a gang of hoodlums dressed up like The Baseball Furys weilding baseball bats instead of the baggy pants and guns type gangstas you see all the impressionable misguided youth imitating.

It has some great directing by Walter Hill, and this film has been a great success for Walter Hill. It is about a gang called The Warriors that go to this truce and the leader is shot. So the gangs think The Warriors shot him, but it's not true.So The Warriors come across some gangs while they try to get home by subway. So, when you watch the film, it has some great action in this gang film. It also stars one of my favorite actors, Michael Beck. This film was his best known film too. He also starred in Xanadu, Megafoce, and few others. But it also stars James Remar, Terry Michoes, and other great actors.This is one great film to remember. It will probably always be my favorite film to watch.",The Warriors

And it was, the film was rather good.What made the film so good was that the plot was nice and simple, the actors wern't too bad, there was plenty of fight scenes and also what I think makes a movie a good one, was some good soundtracks behind the movie.I would certainly recommend this movie, - 8/10",The Warriors
212,RUKIA22,A cult classic of the 1970's,9,15 February 2005,"I remember what an overlooked gem this was to the overrated Escape from New York but this one's much better. One of the coolest and best films of the late 1970's. I saw this cult film when it came out in the 80's on VHS.The characters are real and I thought Michael Beck's portrayal of swan a tough no- nonsense leader of the Warriors gang was excellent he was definitely the star of this film. I also think Mercy played by (Deborah Van Valkenburgh) was feisty with an attitude to match and a girl who took no crap from anyone was really amazing in this role. This film is about a gang trying to get home through New York's subway but spend the rest of the movie fighting off other gangs who follow them and who think the warriors were in on the killing of Cyrus. The Warriors didn't hurt anyone but in many of the fight sequences they used knives but that was only in self-defence.One of the best effective moments I remember is in the 'Train Home' scene where the gang are heading back home to Coney Island New York. Mercy is sitting aside Swan and there just looking out like theirs no care in the world in that moment these four high school couples who've just come from a prom sit opposite Swan and Mercy. They're laughing and talking among each other but soon stop and look towards Mercy and how she's dressed I found this scene to be really sad and nasty. Mercy was thinking how dirty she looked and I felt it was so sad. In that scene I really felt for her she was just about to fix her hair up neatly but Swan stopped her he was just saying 'don't do this because of them she tried to ignore it but couldn't. I liked it when he scared off those high school prom nerds in their next stop they got off the train. Swan had said he didn't like what she did for a living because she's a whore. But towards the end he accepted her and she wanted to be something better Mercy didn't care how she earned money to her she had nothing and that's the only thing she's got to survive on.I liked this films setting with its dirty looking streets filled with an array of different looking gangs but one gang stood out from them all The Warriors. The fights, classic one liners, and the dark atmosphere were perfect. An exciting and adrenalin rush of a great film you'll enjoy watching this because it's a classic. The music is excellent and so is the plot. If you haven't seen this film yet than you are missing out on something really special. 10/10",The Warriors
213,Dolf,You Warriors are good... real good.,9,2 July 2001,"I was only 10 when The Warriors was released, so I didn't even see the movie until it aired on HBO or something.  I was hooked from the first showing. To this day, when it comes on one of the cable channels at 1:00AM I end up watching it 'til the end.  It's honestly that gripping.The dark visuals really make this tale of urban gang violence feel real - and it honestly stands up well today (if you can get past some of the clothing and hair styles).  The acting performances are all pretty good (although occasionally a little wooden) - I'd give the acting a solid B or possibly b+.  Actually surprising considering the actors were all unknowns at the time, although watching it today you'll notice a few familiar faces (Deborah Van Valkenburgh - remember her as Jackie Rush in TV's ""Too Close For Comfort""? or James Remar - recently appeared in ""What Lies Beneath"" and back in 1986 was in another cult-youth-violence flick ""Band of the Hand"".) About the only disturbing thing about any of the actors is that Warriors gang leader Swan (played by Michael Beck) looks alarmingly like one of the Bee-Gees.Of course some of the gang ""themes"" are a little bit over the top, but somehow it all seems perfectly natural in the setting.  The subway scenes are a great backdrop to a film that is still visually appealing today, and must have been ahead of its time back in 1979.All in all, a fine film that has held up to the years remarkably well in its story, theme, and visuals.  Definitely worth a look - but be warned - once you get hooked, you just can't stop watching this flick every time it shows up in the wee hours of the morning...",The Warriors

Perhaps that was good, because I was thoroughly impressed by it! I was totally caught by ""The Warriors"" because the plot of this film is so original. The cinematography combined with the excellent music and that most of the film takes place during the night creates a perfect combination.The action is almost non-stop and you just can't stop watching it. I also think the costumes that the different gangs wear adds to the story. The soundtrack is really good, especially the song ""In The City"" that is played in the end! And the ending itself is absolutely perfect.This cult film is an absolute must and can't be missed. It's also one of my all time favorite movies.This is one of the few movies I will be able to watch over and over again. It deserves no less than 10/10.",The Warriors

216,Newguy,A Cult Classic - Some Films Are Timeless,7,5 October 1999,"I'll spare you the plot, lets just say that this is a great film.  It has all the elements, and I think that the one thing I love most about this film is that NO SEQUEL WAS MADE.  BUT, I mean this in a good way.  In typical Hollywood fashion a sequel would accomplish nothing else but to retract from, and ruin the original (a la Highlander).  The acting is good enough and the dark mood and tone that director Walter Hill sets is perfect.  The script, if anything, shows the ""unseen"" side of gang life in the seventies. While in reality gangs on roller skates, or wearing baseball uniforms and make up would get beaten down in a heartbeat in NYC; in ""The Warriors"" these groups are highly effective in developing the overall look of the film.  In addition, the fight scene in the subway bathroom is one of the best ever filmed (you gotta love a good old fashioned ""beat down"" complete with guys getting tossed into mirrors, bats, chains and switchblades galore).  The love interest aspect is something I probably could have done without, but its not overblown and actually helps the viewer identify with a gang's ""groupies/female hangers on"".  Overall the film moves really well, never lags and provides some high powered action.  I agree with the sentiments of some of the other reviewers in questioning how the hell Rembrandt ever made it into the Warriors? (in not so many words).  He's obviously not tough, can't fight and he actually whines (there's no room for that in a gang). Nevertheless, The Warriors is an integral part of anybody's video library. You don't see it in the non-butchered form on cable very often, and it serves in passing the time well either before, or after a night out.SSB - October 5, 1999 - NYC",The Warriors

Top that off with an unforgettable cast of characters. Even though many of the actors in this movie are no-namers-the acting is superb-total ""A"" material. Ninety Three Minutes of FUN- Action fans-this movie grabs your attention and holds it until the final credit. Bottom-line: A magnificent piece of film-making and triumph for anyone involved with the film in my eyes. The movie is nothing like the book.

218,sunset-at-night,Can You Dig it? I Did!,10,19 October 2005,"The Warriors is excellent on so many levels. Music, the camera work, story line, acting, the scenery of New York etc. The Warriors have a simple premises. The Warriors is about an Coney Island gang (Warriors) must now try to make it back to their turf in Brooklyn from upper Bronx when they are falsely accused of killing the head leader of the Gramercy Parks (one of the biggest and most powerful gangs in New York) at an all gang meeting with hundreds of gangs from all over New York. Ironically, the meeting was to stop the violence between gangs and bring all the gangs of New York together as one to be 100,000 strong against the police. The Gramercy Parks set the word out. If you see the Warriors. Bring them back to me alive... if not alive than dead. So all the gangs of New York know they are trying to make it back home and all want a piece of them.The cool thing about this movie is the gangs. Each gang has their own personal style. One gang looks like a baseball team with the baseball uniforms and makeup and baseball bats. One gang has on jean overalls with roller skates and one gang (the Orphans) has on gray shirts with blue jeans. The warriors style was a vest with no shirt underneath.I was not born when the Warrriors first came out in 79. So I do not know how much it impacted the gangs and such when it was in theaters but I remember seeing it for the first time on TV in like 89 or 90 and it impressed me as a child then and still does now as an adult.",The Warriors

There ae many moments that were originally intended to be serious or even ""deep"" but they were lost into the cheesiness of history. The female love interest has a mustache, for crying out loud! All in all, I did enjoy the movie. It becomes a feel good movie, and you root for the Warriors. Swan, the main character, is pretty good looking overall. I really liked his character - he was the noble one, but he wasn't a rule-following pussy as so many others. The opening speech, where the tagline ""can you dig it"" comes from, is one of the funnier moments. The villain in his car at the end is one of the funniest things ever put on film.

222,Seikan,"A Wildly Entertaining, Vivid Retelling Of Greek Mythology Spoonfed With Modern Ganglife.",8,12 February 2006,"The Warriors was undoubtedly the biggest Cult phenomenon of the 70s. It was unheard of and unappreciated for many years until it was discovered on the shelf of forgotten treasures and re-released in the brilliantly crafted and extravagantly superior Director's Cut.The film is based around a Coney Island gang, The Warriors, as they join multiple other gangs at a city-wide meeting with a Modernized peacemaker, Cyrus. He gives a thunderous speech that convinces all the gangs in the city to band together. But the moment the cheers hit a climax, a gunshot seals Cyrus' fate, and the perpetrator immediately swaps the blame over to The Warriors.The leader of The Warriors is swamped by the onslaught of vengeful hooligans as the rest of the pack rushes off, unaware at the time that every gang and every policeman in the city is after them. They battle their way home, with the odds stacked against them, and as they are double-crossed and toyed with by gangs the whole city over, we are treated to a number of entertaining scene bridges consisting of a radio announcer declaring the latest news in the hunt for The Warriors.Without a doubt, the flashiness and the fast paced action is let down by some questionable editing and extraordinary repetitiveness in the spontaneity of the gang running into police at the countless train stations they infiltrate attempting to get home on.This is independent film making at its finest, no doubt, and the performances hold up rather well. Though, the villain of the story, who shall remain nameless, is without a doubt, the most convincing. With his guttural undertone in his voice accentuating his cheating, conniving manner as he hunts The Warriors not to gain revenge on Cyrus, but to keep them from telling the truth about who really did it...A film with some indy flaws, ultimately held together by the sheer fun of it all, The Warriors is ""A Wildly Entertaining, Vivid Retelling Of Greek Mythology Spoonfed With Modern Ganglife."" I thoroughly recommend.",The Warriors
223,lolbleachfan,Can you dig it? I can dig it,8,10 March 2013,"Stylistic, action-packed and a hell of a memorable movie. That is The Warriors in a nutshell.Sometime in the future, the leader of Riffs, the biggest gang in New York City invites nine representatives from each gang in the city for a huge meeting in the Bronx to unite all the gangs and take the city themselves. Among these gangs are the Warriors from Coney Island, one of the toughest gangs in the city. The Riffs' leader is then assassinated by another gang's leader and the Warriors are framed. The Riffs put out a huge bounty on the Warriors' heads, dead or alive, and soon every other gang in the city is after them while the Warriors try and fight their way across the city with little to no weapons to get home safely.The first thing that really caught my attention was the atmosphere of the movie. It's night-time throughout most of the movie and it really feels like the street gangs run the city, like the Warriors could be attacked at any moment. It's legitimately eerie and brooding.The action is also very well done. There are hardly any guns in the movie (I believe we only ever see two) so the fights are up-close and personal and they are well-choreographed and shot, everything can be seen clearly and you can identify who's who easily.The characters are very memorable as well and are all very well acted, my favourite being Luther, the main villain, who's delightfully over the top and a real scumbag. Even the random members of the gangs, most of which only appear in the opening sequence, have a very memorable and colourful look to them, such as the Hi-Hats, all dressed as mimes in top hats yet are only on screen for a few seconds, really leave an impact on me for some reason.The Barry De Vorzon's music isn't bad either, perfectly complimenting the atmosphere.So, if you like thrilling action with plenty of close up fights wrapped around some great atmosphere, great characters and a great musical score, then the Warriors in a must-see.",The Warriors

228,melweisbaum,Should be Remade,7,13 January 2014,"The Warriors was a decent violence exploitation movie from the mid to late seventies. Basically it is about a gang called The Warriors in New York City, where Cyrus, the leader of the city's top gang and a very charismatic leader, has called a meeting of all of the gangs to discuss a truce and carving up the city peacefully among themselves.Each gang agrees to attend by sending nine members per gang, and all of them agree to not carry any weapons.During his speech, Cyrus is killed and The Warriors are blamed for his murder. They narrowly escape but then are faced with the difficult task of somehow sneaking through all of the rival gangs, who want them dead, as well as the New York City Police.It's got some pretty good tense scenes as well as some nice action and fight scenes. The acting is also marginally better than you would expect of a film of this type even though nobody really famous is in this movie.Worth seeing and I wouldn't be surprised if this idea was remade sometime soon.",The Warriors
229,cuz,A classic tale of gang warfare,9,15 December 1998,"Few movies have done so much with so little. ""The Warriors"" doesn't have big-time special effects, fancy sets or even a big name cast. It's set in New York, and makes incredible use of seemingly ordinarly locations such as the subway, city streets and even Coney Island. It's a tribute to director Walter Hill's skills at setting the mood, and choreographing great fight scenes. The movie starts out at a gang rally of sorts. A member of one gang kills the leader of another, and pins the blame on the Warriors. Then the chase is on. The falsely-accused gang members have to fight their way home, and every other gang is out to get them. They encounter one bizarre gang after another. Michael Beck is perfectly cast as Swan, the leader of the Warriors. He's tough, showing little emotion, even when fending off the feminine charms of Deborah Van Valkenburg (who would later play one of Ted Knight's daughters on ""Too Close for Comfort""). They make a good pair. As he's proven in countless other films, including ""48 Hours"" and ""Streets of Fire"", Hill is a master at staging the big battle. His punch-ups are gritty, yet they're done with style and flair. You root for the Warriors to succeed, not just because you like them, but also because you wonder what kind of conflict they'll face next. You know they'll clear their names eventually, but the action-packed journey home is what makes this film memorable.",The Warriors
230,prfrmr,The Warriors...kick A**,10,15 May 2005,"What can I not stress about this genius film, produced in 1979, and so entirely, historically accurate? There I was, browsing the video store ""Action"" section, looking for an interesting Eastwood movie. My eye suddenly caught a title, 'The Warriors'. The film cover looked interesting enough - Gang warfare -- based in the late '70's. Off to a good start so far. Okay, so I've seen previous TV movies about 1970's gang life already. Wait, hold on ----So I flip the box over, and read the caption synopsis. My rental interest suddenly forgets about Eastwood, and I take home 'The Warriors' instead.I never regretted it. In fact, I was completely blown away by this film(no exaggeration). I certainly did not expect this movie to be of much quality, mainly in basis that I'd never even heard of it before. Even much less that none of the actors were all that familiar to me, with the exception of Michael Beck (Xanadu). Boy did my attitude ever change - quickly.This genius film is very well-acted and produced, far better than most other somewhat similar gang films I have previously seen. This credit, for starts - I give to the basic fact that director Walter Hill chose to film this movie at night, and right on-location (NYC) -- instead of in some phony, makeshift Hollywood backdrop - like a West Side Story movie set. This brilliant decision made the movie action experience all the more authentic. And casting a clan of REAL actors, and virtually unknowns -- who could actually ACT, especially in authentic-looking gang attire, was a double plus. There is no phony, gamey gang-stuff in this film, unlike what we all have seen in other modern day ""gang"" films like 'Fight Club'. No, no. These actors were the REAL THING. Every single one of them, even down to the gang Extras'(non-speaking). Unbelievable. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film.Actor Michael Beck impressed me most with his uncanny portrayal as ""Swan"", assumed war chief after the lead war chief character, ""Cleon"" goes down. Now I've heard about writer/author Sol Yurick's criticism of Beck's performance as ""Swan"". He claimed actor Beck was not even close to doing justice to the part, not the original first or next choice, mainly because of his age - at the time (Beck was 26) and his look. Obviously director Hill thought differently. Hill allotted Beck full use of his actor talents to become the full rounded, smooth, yet street-tough, tough-guy, leader, stronger muscle side of himself to fulfill the demands of ""Swan"", which Beck does wonderfully. (A privilege many other such actors have struggled with in their careers.)And what more can I not stress about James Remar (Ajax) -- the careening, muscle-flexing, rebellious womanizer, always on the alert for a good fight? He was absolutely superb, not too mention, damned darned sexy too. I shamefully admit, I drooled (or at least foamed at the mouth) every time he was on screen. Remar not only delivers his lines deliciously well, but his action shots are right on-target. His most memorable movie line in the film: ""I'll shove that bat up your a** and turn you into a Popsicle"" (to the Baseball Furie)--- was priceless.Basically, the synopsis: In urban lawlessness of New York City, 1979, a gang leader is shot during a meeting of all-city gangs, and the blame is unjustly pinned on a Staten Island area (Coney) gang known as the 'Warriors'. Before too long, they face a night of terror as they try to return to their Coney Island home -- with at least every other gang in the city, now hot on their trail. It's a long way between the Bronx and the River, with the subways --- and anything can happen...Even the most violent scenes: subway men's room and Central Park, the action and acting both were incredibly directed and performed by the mainly entire cast of the remarkable unknowns.The only really part of this film that truly annoyed me was actor Terry Michos (Vermin). I really couldn't tell if it was the actor himself or the gang character he played. Perhaps it was director Hill's idea to create 'Vermin' as the brainless hunk. But I sincerely wanted to can his a** back to the Geek farm --- real quick----especially during the subway scene where his character and 2 other 'Warriors' run into an all female gang - The Lizzies. The Lizzies lure the Warriors back to their 'girl pad' for an assumed night of romp and romance. (Vermin) flirts with one particular 'Lizzie', then later on, they end up making out. My skin just crawled. All I could say was 'Eeeuuuwww'---'Don't kiss him...!. Outside that, this film is an ABSOLUTE ""must see"", for all Action film fans. While I am no big fan of expletives, the over usage in this film made it even more authentic. Peanut",The Warriors
231,derlaninktown,One of the best action films EVER done!,9,23 August 2006,"What can one say? This is, without a doubt, one of the best action films of all time. Sure, the dialogue and acting could have stood some improvement but with what has to be the best collection of realistic fight scenes in any movie one can forgive that.The fights are quite brutal, though. Hardest to watch is the guy getting hit across the stomach with a baseball bat that breaks. The fight with the Baseball Furies in the park is more realistic than anything I've ever seen. And the stretches between fight scenes never seem boring or long. This is an almost perfect popcorn film.If you're looking for an action movie with a social commentary, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a well made, stunning film that will keep your eyes glued to the screen, watch the Warriors. Over and over, cause I'll guarantee you'll never get tired of it.",The Warriors

A classic that should have been followed up with another but it does have that one off status of course. If you can take the violence then you will enjoy. There is also a degree of humour present. Look for the scene in the park where one of the gang picks up a prostitute. You also have to realise that this kind of gang warfare still exists and at the release time was very true to life. The story focuses on a seemingly small time gang that are wrongfully suspected of murdering Cyrus, a major gang leader, I say seemingly because.........!

Hmmm, let's see, 10+ tatooed menacing looking men dressed in gangster colors and armed with weapons walking down a run down stretch of neighborhoods in the depths of the night hoping to stop a cab driver who must have a death wish to even drive in that area so late, let alone pick up these guys, for a ride home to desolated Coney Island??!!! in NYC????

237,FigNewton,I Want Them All!...I Want All THE WARRIORS!,8,28 September 2001,"I am truly amazed at the following this movie has!  I thought I was the only one and my brothers who love this movie!  I first saw ""The Warriors"" when I was 10 and it hooked me then and still to this day, whenever it comes on t.v. I can't help but be hooked all over again!  This is one terrific movie!From the very opening scene to the last, your eyes are glued to the screen. It's a shame that edited versions have taken out the opening flash sequences where the members of The Warriors are given instructions before going to the big meeting.  It sets the movie up perfectly, because it gives us a glimpse into the importance of the big meeting for these men.I won't go into details about the movie because many of the posts here have covered the plot.  But I will share what made me fall in love with this flick.  First off, the notion that a city like NY had so many gangs!  That was really cool.  The thought that all these gangs comprised together could overtake the city was very intriguing.  The finger pointing to the Warriors as having committed the unspeakable act and the chaos that ensued was so superbly orchestrated and filmed, it still leaves me wide-eyed.  The Warriors' cluelessness as to why the gangs are after them is great because they are fighting for their lives and don't know why they're the main targets.One of the best sequences was when our guys meet up with the very intimidating, scary Baseball Furies, (my favorite gang besides The Warriors) which are the badest looking bunch you'll ever see.  The face paint alone scared me, not to mention those bats!  The fighting in this sequence was also the best!  Don't you just love Ajax and Swan in this part?  Totally cool dudes!The radio announcer added so much to the film by making their trip that much more difficult.  I always thought just when things can't get worst they do as she updated the city gangs to their whereabouts.  I loved it when she apologizes so cooly in the end: ""Sorry 'bout that.""And...who can ever forget the famous chant:  ""Warriors, come out to plaaaay.""  How cool was that?!I tell you this movie rocked then and it rocks now!  It is one of the best movies of the 70's!  The characters were cool, you rooted for them from the very beginning and hoped they would all make it in one piece back to Coney. Loved Swan's words:  ""When we see the ocean, we know we're home.""The sceneries were amazing, the park, the subways, the grungy ghetto streets.  The music was fantastic.  How can you not sing, 'No Where to Run, No Where to Hide'  How can you not remember that great bathroom fight?! And all the running!  The filming was just overall amazing!If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend it.  If you haven't seen it in awhile, go back and get acquainted with an old friend.  You won't regret it!",The Warriors

242,RyanCamplin,One of all my all time favourites.,9,4 February 2015,"The warriors is an amazing movie. It has so much action and such a great story. The film, interestingly enough, is based on the exact same story that '300' is based on! A story dating back to ancient Greece about a small number of Greek warriors, fighting against a large number of Romans. In the film, The Warriors are accused of killing an almost messiah figure among New York gangs and as a result are the target of every gang in the city. They must run from and fight their way past every gang that tries to kill them, so they can return to their turf on the other side of New York. The film was done in a comic book style, which really makes the film what it is. You can see the comic book style clearly in the transitions between scenes. It doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time it's serious enough to be a believable story you can throw yourself into. The gangs have extravagant costumes and this really adds to the enjoyment of the film. I mean, who wouldn't love a group of baseball bat donning hooligans dressed in pin- stripes and face paint? The whole thing is bizarre but brilliant. The soundtrack is one of the best things about this movie. The radio show throughout plays some amazing songs and the score is probably one of my favourites of all time. The only reason, and I really do mean the ONLY reason, I can't bring myself to give this film a 10, is the acting. Some of it really is quite bad. But if you can look past that, which I hope you can, this film is brilliant. Swan and Ajax are such brilliant characters, as is the villain, Luther. There are a handful of great quotes and some of the camera angles are absolute genius. I can't recommend this film highly enough.",The Warriors

244,wogsurfer,Warriors....come out to play-ay,9,27 May 2017,"The one thing I love about building up my film knowledge is discovering little gems. The Warriors is a great example. A simple story, well acted, and ultimately very well told, The Warriors is everything a good cult flick should be.Based on the story of a battalion of 10,000 Spartan mercenaries who join a Persian emperor for war in Asia Minor, The Warriors tells the tale of nine gang members of The Warriors from Coney Island who reluctantly go all the way to the Bronx to join a meeting of all the NYC gangs. When things go awry due to the shooting of the gang leader of the powerful Riffs who was professing the need to join forces and rule the city, the out numbered Warriors make haste to get back on the subway and back to home turf.Along the way they encounter a myriad of hurdles in their quest for home, including the NYPD, rival gangs who blame The Warriors for the shooting, and also being separated from each other after their various escapes.The soul of this film lies in character Swan (Beck) who has the task of regrouping his fellow gang members after the abrupt end of the meeting, and loosing their leader Cleon in the ensuing confusion due to the shooting. Beck's performance as Swan is a study in control and keeping one's cool in the face of a crisis so far from home.The use of transitions between scenes and character arcs is beautifully done in a comic book style, this was added in post when the movie was given a Ultimate Director's Cut when released to blu- ray in 2007. The HD transfer has been beautifully executed, and many scenes that aren't even a comic book transition have the look of an establishing frame in one.",The Warriors

On a fantasy level, it's sort of like the Wizard of Oz, in that you realize the world they're presenting is fake, the effects aren't anything to boast about, and yet the amazing story line, conveyed by acting that is merely sufficient (unlike the Wizard of Oz), totally suspends your disbelief.

Sure, totally believable. And every gang member pays their fare in the middle of the night and doesn't hop the turnstile. Of course not! Who could imagine such a thing?

253,DoctorMartin,A cult classic,10,8 July 2002,"Why a classic?  Well, from a purely technical standpoint, THE WARRIORS has outstanding cinematography and editing.  The use of various genres of pop music as counterpoint and atmosphere is at least the equal of AMERICAN GRAFFITI.  From a writing standpoint, the film has an intriguing and fast-paced plot, interesting individual scenes, and memorable and often witty dialogue.  The acting is not Golden Globe-quality, but for the genre it's very very good.  And the fight scenes are probably the best ever choreographed for an American film -- and they are fight scenes, not gunfights.Why cult?  Because this movie is the premiere example of the urban fantasy adventure, with the emphasis on fantasy.  Reviewers who deride the film for its lack of ""realism"" miss the point; you might as well sneer at WEST SIDE STORY because real gangs don't dance.  If you enjoy good guys-and-bad guys action, and you can suspend your disbelief long enough to accept Hill's fantastic view of New York, you will find yourself agreeing with the Warriors' leader that THE WARRIORS is indeed ""the best.""",The Warriors

255,TouchdownGlenn83,The Warriors...a cult following for many reasons!,10,28 October 2005,"I won't discuss the plot of the Warriors since many reviewers have posted much about the film. What I will tell you is why I like the film. The Warriors is a great film, pure and simple. The only negative about the Warriors is that the film is dated since it was made in the late 1970s. But that is trivial and it should not deter you from watching or liking the film.The reason why I liked the Warriors is because the characters were real and relatable. I cared about and was deeply interested in the Warriors. A more diligent examination, I discovered that the Warrors were more than just ""gangsters"" or ""thugs"". Looking at the various members of the Warriors it was clear that these young men were a microcosm of conflicted men in society. All the members of the Warriors wanted to belong and as the Warriors they did belong. By belong, I mean these men were looking for or wanted from life and society what they themselves or as individuals did not have and these things were love, respect, loyalty, admiration, power, strength, and identity. I know you can add more attributes to the Warriors...but in short, those are some of the traits that gangs generally offer to young men, whether in reality it is true or not.Moving moments in the film was when Swan and Mercy were riding the train and the students coming from the prom were giving them dirty looks because of the way both of them looked and ""their place in the social ladder""(lower class). The other special and real moment for me was the ending when Swan finally arrives home and he subtly realizes that the ""gang life"" was not going to give him happiness. I am paraphrasing what Swan said: we fight to come back home, but, for what, for this(shows a working class and gritty NY neighborhood). For Swan, it was clearly of him coming of age and probably leaving the ""Warriors""....The Warriors is a guy movie and what guy movies are all about!!",The Warriors
256,Dan_the_DutchMan,Very illegitimate cult classic - Actually a block of old cheese,3,19 July 2009,"Yesterday I saw this movie for the first time. I expected lots of cool gangs fighting their street wars in a gritty urban tale. What I got was a laughable travesty of incredibly gay looking and acting groups of cardboard cut-outs. No names (a few nicknames) and all dressed up in the same ridiculous Halloween fashion.The plot of this smelly block of cheese can easily be summarized in a single sentence. ""When an important gang leader gets assassinated at a large meeting meant to unite all gangs, The Warriors of Coney Island are accused of murder and forced to make a long run for it, back to their turf, meanwhile having to fight off several gangs chasing them, in the end to face off against the actual killer."" That's it.Michael Beck plays Swan, the leader of the bunch. He gets the whole leader type point across, but without any personality or charisma. A boring empty shell. The only one who brought a little fun to the table was James Remar as the rebellious Ajax. I can hardly recall any others. Of course there is also a girl involved somewhere. She is ugly and annoying, and not worth mentioning. The acting overall was that of a high school play.Gang members (in movies anyway) are supposed to be intimidating, tough and cool at the same time. But these pussies... none of the words mentioned apply to them. The fight scenes are badly choreographed and cheesy, and the movie doesn't have any special photography worth mentioning. I watched the Director's Cut, and did like the whole comic book intermezzo editing throughout. That however doesn't change there is virtually no excitement and no genuine humor, not even in the shape of irony.This thing appears to have a cult following, but even if I wanted to, I couldn't figure out why. It is unbelievable this was ever part of pop culture. Maybe it's a different story if you grew up with this, seeing it in the theater at the time. I could imagine this as one of those shallow date movies that allows young couples to focus on each other during the movie, in stead of having to focus on the screen. Because what you get here, judging as a twenty five year old first time viewer, is 94 minutes of nothing.That's right Boppers, this is a seriously dated product that does not deserve to be recognized the way it is.

Director Walter Hill wisely chose not include this detail, leaving us with a much more interesting, less hackneyed movie. 'The Warriors' is best viewed as an urban set fantasy, a fairy tale about finding the way home through a hostile wilderness full of strange and deadly dangers. This makes it a more striking, immeidiate film, leaving the viewer unconcerned with technical details about real gangs or the real New York and able to concentrate fully on the the plight of the characters and the movies cutting social commentary. The film has 'cult' written all over it, with it's campy (But beautifully designed) costumes, wild seventies hairdos (Just count those afros!) and surprisingly, almost shockingly violent action sequences. Characters are simple but effective, the brooding Swan and hot headed Ajax standing out, and there is perhaps the simplest, but most believable explaination for a street villains motive; ""'Why'd you do it?''Because I just like doin' things like that.'"". There is excellent location work, numerous subway stations providing a literal and metaphorical 'underground' through which the Warriors move, while the bleak, off season depression of a run down Coney Island at the films climax is almost heart breaking in it's effectiveness.

263,freddymeister,The movie that invented coolness to begin the 80's...,9,17 July 2003,"In what has to be THE VERY BEST street gang movie ever made, 1979's ""The Warriors"" is a roller-coaster ride through the streets of New York that you won't soon forget.Directed by Walter Hill, who went on to become ""The Master of Action Movies"", as his credits include among others: ""48 Hrs."", ""Streets of Fire"", ""Red Heat"", ""Trespass"", and ""Last Man Standing"", the movie is a non-stop, no-nonsense character study of a multi-racial street gang from Coney Island called The Warriors.The cast, which only has three actors who went on to become either T.V. or Big Screen staples in Michael Beck, James Remar, and David Patrick Kelly, play their parts in such a convincing way that you may think that Hill grabbed some real gang members to star in the movie. The plot centers around a big meeting taking place with all the gangs, as we are introduced to most of them, and find out exactly who rules the underworld in a city like New York. Cyrus, the ultimate leader is shot to death during his now famous ""CAN YOU DIG IT!"" speech, and The Warriors are mistakenly blamed for the murder. What follows is one of the most exciting pieces of cinema, as our heroes roam through the streets, subways, alleys, & neighborhoods of the city, running away from everyone, as all the gangs have been notified to bring them to justice.The Bombers, a gang dressed up as baseball players (complete with facial make-up and everything) are the first ones to swing and miss, and even though The Warriors do suffer some casualties along the way, we find out that they are indeed New York's toughest gang.Walter Hill's movies have always existed in a world of their own; take 1984's ""Streets of Fire"", where Willem Dafoe and Michael Paré come down to a showdown in the middle of the street while battling with sledge-hammers; not everything is racially motivated, and race seems to have little to do with the conflicts. The same happens in ""The Warriors"", as Remar and Beck's characters are in direct competition for the leader-of-the-gang role, and seemingly disliked each other because of the different approaches to leadership that each one has.If you're looking for a TRUE CULT MOVIE of the 70's, that will both entertain and enlighten you, then ""The Warriors"" is that movie. If you're a fan of good cinema, then this movie is a can't miss.",The Warriors
264,beulah1361,Great Movie,9,26 August 2003,"Having been an 8th grader at the time the movie came out and living in NYC, the movie was very real in its story and locations! All of the kids in school talked about the movie and how scared we were to ride the trains into different niegborhoods alone! At the time in NYC there were many nieghborhood gangs and many acted and dressed that way!  This was right at the time before music videos came out and fashion was a local thing.  At that time in different neighborhoods you had different ways kids dressed at the time.  And the train scenes were really true and gritty the way the trains looked at the time!  Getting from the Bronx all the way to Coney Island on the local train could take up to 3 hours easy.  Its one of the all time classic movies in the reality of NYC in the late 1970's in regards to teenagers and young adults!!!",The Warriors
265,beulah1361,Smoke o you were wrong,9,10 October 2003,"I have to say I think smoke got it all wrong!  You have to have lived in NYC at the time the movie came out!  It was really true to life!  You had so much gang actvity in NYC at the time you wouldn't beleive it!  You had neighborhood gang, subway gangs,ethnic gangs and even school gangs.  Gangs were a big part of the 13-21 year old  culture at the time!  Which corresponds with the age that you could go to a NYC public High school. The radio station plot was not far fetched, in fact you had a lot of underground radio stations including college stations and local neighborhood stations that actually broadcast from peoples homes and or place of buisness and knew all the local action that was happening!  This movie evethough dated today is one of the most accurate gang movies portrayed in and about NY.PS Those subway scenes were really shot in the subway and the dirt, graffiti and sounds were real!  If only if we had SMELL-O-Vision you could really get a taste of what it was to ride the subwasys back then!",The Warriors
266,beulah1361,Tommy is so right,9,14 November 2003,"Tommy had it right!  You had to be living in NYC at the time to really understand how true this movie really was.  Only the baddest dudes had guns at the time. The weapons of choice were still baseball bats and knives.  The style of dress, the language, the music and even the subway scenes were all true to life.  Anybody who thinks this movie is to outrageous to believe either did'nt live in NYC at the time, or lived a very sheltered life in NYC.  Along with the Warriors were movies like Fort Apache, and Wolfen which both gave realistic veiws of the Bronx during that time!  The South Bronx in those days had many streets that looked like Beruit! The Movie the Warriors is an all time classic for anybody who was 13-25 in 1979 living in the hoods of NYC",The Warriors

NYC was full of gang activity in the 1970's! And if you think that the movie is in some future world then Panther never rode a NYC subway train in the 1970's. With the graffita, crime and constant breakdowns it was true to life! I always marvel at people who can't believe NYC wasn't as bad as it looked! Just check NYC history in the 1970's whole neighborhoods were terroized with gangs and corrupt cops! NYC was broke, laying off teachers, cops, firemen and sanitation workers! 42sd Street was really unsafe and filled with porno theaters and whore houses. You could go on the deuce(42ndST)and buy any drug openly on the street! The amazing thing about the Warriors is that back then there was no MTV, BET or VH1 for young people to see how thugs lived or acted, you had to see it for yourself! Trust me growing up in NYC at the time I was and still am, amazed how it has changed for the better. Those days will never be seen again in NYC, and that what makes this movie all the better for guys like me from the 1970's who lived in NYC at the time!",The Warriors
268,frankie-65,Not as good as the original....,7,4 November 2005,"The problem with this new DVD version is Walter Hill's insistence on re-editing the film into a comic book story, complete with comic strip scene changes ala sin city and other such nonsense that totally removes the edge and strength of the original theatrical edit. This is a film with an action packed, adult themed feel that requires a sharp, hard delivery the way it was originally.It almost seems as if he did this edit out of some weird ambition to keep up with the new video game's look, or to capitalize on the whole Spiderman/Batman/sin city style of movie making that is so popular now, which I think is a grave mistake. The warriors as it was first released in the theaters and on video and initially on DVD is the version you really want-it contains all the drama, intensity and new york sleaze this movie shows to perfection. I give it seven stars because the movie is great, but this new version is pretty much a waste of your time-just get the first DVD release-it really is much better.",The Warriors

It doesn't seem to work on any level, after a while I thought was it suppose to be funny.A lot of the characters come across as rather camp, they look like they have just come out of drama school, or from the film Fame. It resembles the Michael Jackson Thriller video, with leather waistcoats prevalent.Thank god I only recorded it from Freeview. The acting is appalling. No wonder why none of the actors were ever heard from again. Mel brooks could have made a much better film. This is really a made for DVD/TV film. The action scenes are rather amusing because they are so awful. Maybe it was meant to be called the ""worriers"".",The Warriors

I watched it expecting the mega-cheese that this movie is.That's right, it's cheese all the way through, and I loved it.Easily the best gang action movie I know of, it also ranks up there as one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. The movie is one big chase, and you really do feel as if you are one of the Warriors with thousands upon thousands upon thousands of vicious street rivals wanting nothing more than to tear you apart (literally).Featuring a very well cast group of no names (only James Remar was a stand out to me) and an awesome character base, this movie thrives upon it's title roles. You are drawn in and become attached to them all, part of the films appeal.Because I didn't see this until just recently (I was born in the late 80's, far after the film's original release), the film is out-dated and together with it's retro-techno-rocker soundtrack it is pure cheese.But that's the cult appeal of this flick. It's a classic, under-appreciated gem that is well worth picking up.It should at least prove to be a little bit of fun.",The Warriors
272,snow-19,The Greatest,10,23 July 1999,"The Warriors, a modern adaptation of Homer's ""The Odyssey"" in which a gang (in this case) that is far from home has to fight their way back to their own turf, is a classic gang film.  Although none of the actors ever went on to become big time stars, and the gangs are imaginary, the movie's tone and action make it a four star film.  A true masterpiece, the Warriors is a film that history will serve to elevate.  Only time can allow people to truly see the Warriors for what it is, a high adventure film with great imagery that describes the struggle of nine young men trying to beat the odds - not only in their struggle to make it home, but in their struggle to survive in life. The Warriors is a fictional account that serves to showcase the tough streets of New York and the life that young urban males are forced to endure.  Besides, even if you don't care about any of that stuff the Warriors has great a** kicking scenes.  Doesn't everybody like a little a** kicking know and then, hey?",The Warriors

277,Tantive7,The best of the Best..,10,14 October 2001,"Walter Hill shows his directing flair again for action, drama and style in this crackling 1979 movie about a Coney Island gang falsely accused of murder and fleeing from everyone....including the other NYC gangs and the New York City Police Department. Set amongst a hostile, nocturnal world of neon lit train stations, baseball bat wielding gang members and lethal women ""The Warriors"" moves along at a frantic pace with a fine selection of young actors taking the lead. Michael Beck plays the cool headed, ""war chief"" Swan, seeking to get the other members back home to Coney Island alive and in one piece. James Remar is unforgettable as the woman chasing, hot headed Ajax...always out to prove his manhood with his fists. And David Patrick Kelly is perfect as the murderous, but ultimately cowardly leader of the Rogues. Attending a combined gangs meeting deep in the South Bronx to hear the Gramercy Riffs plans to control the streets of New York, the Warriors are wrongly accused of the shooting death of their charismatic leader, Cyrus. The finger of blame pointed their way, they flee via any means they can and upon their way back to home base encounter violent opposition from the Orphans, the Turnbull AC's, the Baseball Furies and even rifts within their own ranks lead to trouble. A colorful, exciting and fast paced film...at the time of it's original release it drew criticism for allegedly encouraging gang activity, but now seems almost cartoon like in it's displays of violence.Hands down a great film,stands the test of time. 1 million stars",The Warriors

Right from the start, the movie seems to apprehend and bring around the viewer's focus to the gang, The Warriors, and the possible menacing dangers that lie in wait for them , should things go awry. Strangely, one finds himself / herself rooting for these guys to get home, fast! The Warriors numerous perils en route to their familiar turf (Coney Island), are just building up the suspense for the climax at the end of the movie.

Its such a shame Walter Hill went on to win international fame and success with ""48.hrs"" and not this as it is far the superior movie. The Warriors are a street gang wrongly accused of murdering the big boss at a gathering of gangs across America. Its then on for the journey home as the Warriors try to make it back to Coney Island against Thousands OF rival gang members, each one hungry to take them out. If you've never seen this movie make sure you hunt it down soon.

I was told, so, after much anticipation I found out when it was on on Sky and watched it, having high expectations. Unfortunately, I felt this film was a let down on most fronts, with a weak storyline, boring 2 dimensional characters and cheesy CHEESY fight scenes! I mean c'mon, a film about a gang trying to get back on their home turf after being accused of murder, travelling station to station just to bump into a new gang and fight them off - leaving no room for ""oh whats gonna happen later""! isn't very exciting. The characters were boring and the only female presence in the film felt  rushed and done out of the fact this film had to have some kind of main female character, poor stuff!So in conclusion, watch this if you're maybe a bit bored, and don't feel like sitting through 3 hours worth of meaningful crap - it's just a bit of simple fun, but generally wooden and boring.6 out of 10",The Warriors

One of my favorite lines was when Swan tells Mercy that she's just a part of what's happening and it's all bad. To me it's a well constructed story with a not so bad ending.

The plot sounded interesting so I thought I'd give it a try. I was hooked from beginning to end. I didn't even want to leave during the commercials because I was afraid I'd miss something. My favorite scenes are the fight in the bathroom (edited so well), Swan & Mercy on the subway, & when Swan has the gang following him in the subway station, & Mercy asks him what he's going to do, & the rest of The Warriors show up at that moment. Also, I can never hear the song In The City by Joe Walsh without thinking of this movie. It is truly great. For the record, this review was written by a woman in her thirties.",The Warriors

Acting was amazing, and Cyrus was fantastic.All in all, Walter Hill did an amazing job on one of the greatest film of all time. I heard they were doing a remake, which is set in 2006 in LA.

Mark my words. If they remake this movie and put it in theater around this country there will be trouble. This movie is/was the cause of some of the gangs we have out there today. Some people are not very bright or was not brought up very well and they see a movie like this and thinks it's cool to live it out. Leave well enough alone. Do not open up Pandora's box.

288,jakeaustridge,This is the source of amazing movies!,10,2 July 2008,Many people would say it's wrong for a 13 year old to watch an 18 because of all the bad things going on in Britian. But now with all the new action and drama movies The Warriors is still my definite fave! It has some continuity because its a farely old film but that doesn't cover up the great acting and fight scenes. Its not to graphic or gory but hitting people with baseball bats isn't childs play. I am allowed 15's and not 18's but my dad made an exception for this film. Swan and Ajax are the best but the downfall is Ajax gets busted about 3/4 into the film.Most of my mates watch stuff like Kidulthood(AWESOME MOVIE!) and Green Street because it's more a modern British film as The Warriors is a 70's style American movie. But Green Street didn't have the same thrill or tense scenes as The Warriors did.Definitely recommend to my mates and people who love action/drama movies.,The Warriors

The film is simply about a massive gang meeting in New York organised by over all gang boss Cyrus. He is murdered and the blame is put on The Warriors for killing him. So the Warriors have to get across town to the safety of their turf. Not an easy task when you have 20,000 gang members looking for revenge.From here we see different battles between the Warriors and other gangs as they battle there way to survival. It is simply a really good film with great visuals, costumes and acting, it also has a great vibe to the film and the music really adds to the tension.I would recommend this film if you have not already seen it.

290,krwrawlings32,A film best left to the memory,6,9 May 2016,"Way back in the wilds of my youth I recall going to my local cinema to view 'The Warriors'. At the time this was seen as a highly controversial film - the very idea of putting ""realistic"" youth gang warfare onto the big screen was something daring and really quite shocking. I can still remember the excitement as the tension mounted as The Warriors battled their way across the mean streets of New York (then still a place as foreign to a young man in the West of England as Baghdad or Timbuktu!). I particularly remember the scene with the roller skating thug quietly following Swan through the underground/subway station!But oh how times have changed! This film cropped up on Film 4 the other night and I thought I would check it out to see how well it has held up over the years. The truth it is hasn't held well at all! The gangs all look like refuges from a Vivian Westwood fashion shoot, their language, like daddyo, sounds as out of date to the modern ear as Shakespeare! As for the action sequences... well, what was once gripping and exciting now seems staged and oh-so carefully choreographed (the slow motion sequences do not help!). Please do not get me wrong, there is still much to be enjoyed in this film - I love the painted faced Baseball Furies gang, and the relationship between Swan and the girl (whose name has completely escaped me!) is sweet, but this more a film to be viewed now on the same level as West Side Story, The Wild One or Rebel Without A Cause - ie as a document of past attitudes and styles etc. Mmm... maybe some films are best left as pleasant memories!",The Warriors
291,barreljumpersblog,Coney Island's BEST,9,11 August 2015,"If you're talking cult movies from the 1970s then The Warriors is seminal to that conversation. The mood and atmosphere and visual-style of this movie encapsulates the crime-ridden city that was New York in the 70s. Today when people discuss the movies of the grind-house era, The Warriors is the pinnacle of that. For this little time capsule alone you can enjoy this movie since 99% of the film was shot on location.This movie is a freight-train of momentum that doesn't let dialogue slow it down. The plot is bare bones and characterization is kept to a minimum but very thing works. Before Mad Max: Fury Road, there was The Warriors and both movies share many similarities in their general approach to pace and world-building. I won't slow things down by discussing the storyline or characters, because you need to enter this movie and experience it for yourself.Recently the pod-cast Don and his Amazing Friend did a thorough discussion of the movie where the covered everything from the original scripts to all the minor items to look for throughout the movie.

292,b_fuller24,The way things were back in the day...,8,14 December 2007,"I saw this movie when it came out. I was fifteen, and the movie was great. I still watch it every now and then, and it is still great but for very different reasons. Back then, it was a glam violence thing. A harder edge movie, a lot tougher than the other movies around at the time simply because people were actually fighting in this one, instead of shooting at one another or boxing politely. None of my friends who saw it at the time devolved into a street fighter or a crime lord, so the hype about this movie leading to the collapse of civilization as we know it was obviously off the mark.Even back then I could see that there were some not-so-wonderful moments in this film, but the thrills keep coming so fast and close that they suspend disbelief and it just works. Now, having seen a lot more movies during the years, I love it for different reasons. This movie takes its story seriously, for starters. While it has some mistakes, it avoids mistakes that abound now. First of all, this movie has precious few Big Names. Made more recently it would be crewed by Sizemore, DeNiro, Pacino, Gibson, Berenger, Kilmer, Cruise and the other usual suspects. It would fall on its face under the weight of the stars assembled. Hollywood thinks more is better, including more stars. This is not the case (compare ""Heat"" with ""Made in L.A."" for an excellent example of this). Everyone does not have a gun. Weapons are chains, lead pipes and bats. The guys do not accidentally find full auto weapons everywhere, and because of this there are very few shots fired. In ""Lethal weapon"", the police had no problem at all getting sniper- or full auto weaponry for a completely illegal bit of after hours freelancing. There are few enormous explosions, where cars, buses and trains jump around like bunnies and land on mysteriously deserted streets. Explosions are used as filler nowadays, so when the script falls short something blows up instead to keep viewers occupied. There is no obvious wirework. No satellite tracking of our heroes, or other technology used as spackle over plot holes. No impossible stunts, apart from the fact that people simply cannot fight like that without getting seriously hurt (a one inch bruise after being hit with a bat? come on!). Apart from the too-over-the-top gang colors and some lines of dialogue very few things in this movie makes you cringe and say ""that would NEVER happen!"" because this is basically a believable movie, and that in turn makes Cyrus a lot more frightening. He was probably right; if these people could cooperate they really could take over the city, at least for a while. That struck a chord then and it strikes it now - the scum always outnumbers the good guys. They could easily don brown uniforms and a striking logo and overthrow everything sane and just, if they really put their minds to it. It's happened before. Apart from the fact that it avoids making these latter day mistakes, the movie has a lot of great moments. The whole opening sequence with the trains and Barry DeVorzons pulsing music. Cyrus speech while cop cars sneak through the park like predators to squelch his vision of the future. The scene with the Baseball Furies coming over the hilltop like a pack of wolves, running without effort while our heroes puff and wheeze. The scene on the train with the ""rich kids"" on their way home and facing their bad side counterparts. Just about everything Luther does on screen. In a modern remake he would be costumed, rich and have exotic weapons or know arcane martial arts. Here, he is just a vicious thug who likes to mess with people, and unlike the Green Goblin he is scary because he could be anyone on the street. The incoming reports to Masai, who shows no emotion instead of howling and bouncing off the walls. Masai is five times scarier than this stereotype, just by sitting there waiting for his forces to wear the enemy down. And last but not least the faceless DJ, sending her messages to the ""night shift"" about where the Warriors are heading and what they are doing. These are great movie moments, scenes that do stick in your memory. Not like Travis Bickle talking to himself, perhaps, but several notches above the regular movie fare. This movie is sadly undervalued. Sure, it is a lot more B than A movie and it has hideous dialogue in places, but that goes for the first Star Wars too and few people claim that SW is a bad movie. The Warriors is a blast to watch, and a piece of film-making that younger directors should try to learn from.",The Warriors
293,fowlman78,"Wariors, Come out to play-i-yay!",10,5 February 2006,"My friend kept telling me to see this film because of it's great plot and good action. He also kept repeating the great lines from the film. I went to his birthday party and he said we'd be watching it and I was excited. I saw the trailer for this movie and I was pretty freaked, like it looked good, but it looked weird. I saw it and it went beyond my expectations. I saw the director's cut version and I loved the comic book style he chose. It was cool how it went from the comic book to the movie. I won't bore you with a long explanation with the plot, but it basically is about this gang called the Warriors who are framed for killing this other gang leader and have to return to their home turf of Coney Island. The plot was great and the lines are memorable. Also, a quick thing, the soundtrack was spectacular. ""In the City"" by Joe Walsh, great choice, also ""Nowhere to Run"" was quite good also. The soundtrack was in at perfect times. A good movie has to follow with good music or it doesn't fit. The action sequences were nice and weren't over the top like some movies like this. They were real and they seemed real. This wasn't a movie that wasn't plausible, accounting for the times and the place, this could have happened. All in all I recommend this to anyone. An incredible movie for what it is and what it is worth.",The Warriors
294,the-english-gentleman,Eight men... hundreds of gangs... one bop back to Coney,9,28 November 2005,"THERE ARE SPOILERS IN HERE FROM THE GET-GO. WATCH THE FILM FIRST, THEN COME BACK AND BASK IN MY GENIUS. MIND YOU, THIS FILM IS 26 YEARS OLD. I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH I COULD DO TO SPOIL IT BY NOW.""Warriorrrrs! Come out to PLAY-I-YAY!"" There. You knew I'd have to put that into the review somewhere, so I'll get it out of the way early. Now for the review proper.Man, what a film! A horrible little alcoholic I know had told me for years to watch this film, but I resisted because the only bit he seemed to find entertaining enough to relate was the bit where Fox gets hurled in front of a train by a cop. I found this idea interesting, but pretty pedestrian as rumble movies go.What he didn't tell me about was the gloriously cocksure Ajax threatening to introduce a baseball bat into a man's rectum and turn him into a Popsicle. Or Vermin punching a woman in the face while Cochise smashes a wooden chair over another's head (in the interests of self-defence, of course). Or Cyrus repeatedly shouting ""CAAANN YOUUUU DIIIIG IIITTTT?"" just before being gunned down by the FANTASTIC David Patrick Kelly (who grinds out the 'come out to play' line in a voice I hope nobody EVER uses on me).He didn't tell me about the savage brawl in the public toilet with a gang of what appears to be kids' TV presenters (one of whom chooses to fight in roller-skates). He didn't tell me about the Baseball Furies, who look like the Marylin Manson Little League. Neither did he mention the soundtrack, the cinematography or (some of) the acting, all of which were damned impressive.I don't think you need me to give you the plot. You can find it in a million other places, not least elsewhere on this site. But if you're reading this, then you're reading it for a purpose. You want to know if The Warriors is worth two hours of your time, probably in response to the new game version from Rockstar. The answer? Yes it is. And let me tell you, you haven't lived until you've seen a man dressed as a toddler hurled, upside down, through a wooden toilet door.There are a couple of things I wasn't too keen on. The first was Mercy, the smack-talking gang ho who hooks up with The Warriors after deserting her own gang, The Orphans (whose colours seem to be dirty green T-shirts). She seems unable to make up her mind whether she's a tough, independent woman at the forefront of female empowerment or a convenience to be used by any gang member who comes along until the next alpha-male turns up to give her a slap and tell her what to do. Interestingly, she failed to be in the least attractive until she emerged from a Subway tunnel covered in oily filth. Hmm...Another thing that upset me was Ajax's early departure from the film due to obviously unlawful entrapment by a female police officer (later to be seen as 'Dirty Girl' in Frasier). The best character was out in a deeply unfair way. Still, that's no criticism of the film. I think being disappointed by the loss of a character just shows how strong that character was.So there you go. Nine stars for a great film, one taken away for Mercy, who was an irritating shrew. I'd much rather have seen her disappear under the wheels of a train.The Warriors is a good film with occasional lapses into brilliance, and it's refreshing to go back to a time when gangs weren't comprised of self-aggrandizing retards like 50 Cent and Jah Rule. The Greek connection makes for interesting reading too, if you're one of the dwindling few whose attention can still be held by the written word.Can you dig it?",The Warriors
295,michaelmstudent,War rior,7,11 January 2018,"This movie wasn't bad but it wasn't good, the writer had errors everywhere, I get he was trying to make this realistic but come on. Why did the train skip a stop? How did two people beat up 8 people, I mean they didn't even look that strong so how?",The Warriors
296,Keane-6,A classic,10,31 July 2001,"What can you say about The Warriors? Well, it's one of the best films of the seventies, which considering is the best decade for movies, is a huge compliment. But it deserves to be recognised as a classic. It captures the violence and emptiness of life on the streets of New York perfectly. Walter Hill must be one of the most underrated directors around. From the opening to the conclusion he never lets us breathe, as we are taken, alongside The Warriors, on an unforgettable journey through the dangerous streets of New York. The acting is far from perfect, yet so believable. The characters are memorable and you find yourself really rooting for them, and booing the baddies who try to set them up. The Warriors is a true cult classic, and sums up the decade in which filmmakers weren't afraid to take risks. Overall, the perfect film to enjoy with a few mates and a few beers.",The Warriors
297,kazoo,the best,10,13 June 1999,"If you're looking for an energy filled movie than this is definitely for you. The movie has great performances, great settings and of course great fight scenes. The best performances are given by Michael Beck and James Remar. Remar probably stands out more than Beck just because of his tough guy attitude. Another good thing about the movie is the directing. Walter Hill is probably one of the most under rated directors in the business but here he shows that he is very capable at delivering a remarkable masterpiece. This movie has it all. I recommend buying it immediately",The Warriors
298,Kubit,Can you dig it?,8,22 August 1999,"This film is so obviously from the '70's yet unlike so many of the gang films from this era, it gets the mood spot-on. The reasons kids were in gangs in the first place. New York turns into a battle field for the night and looks more like New York in this film than in any other. There is also a romance in this film, that despite the bleak nature of the film survives in my my mind as the prominent feature of the film. Down sides - well i don't think the dialogue quite fits the situation, the director doesn't really seem to know how street kids talk but still.... can't have everything. A good, entertaining but generic film that works on more than one level 8/10",The Warriors
299,stevencole1,A superb movie..,10,19 November 2000,"The Warriors.  How many people have grown up with this movie?  A REAL movie, with great key elements.  The innate loyalty shown between all the Warriors when they are being hunted all over NYC.  The struggle of good versus bad, tough action scenes (Baseball Furies!) and a funky 70's soundtrack make this one cult classic.  One of my favourite movies for sure.Nothing has come close to The Warriors since it's release, the movie is original, emotive, dark and aggressive.  When you look at some of the cheesy remade movies about, you wonder why this has been left alone.  I'm sure a modern version would be successful, ok we have had Boyz N The Hood and Goodfellas, but The Warriors still come out to play....",The Warriors
300,omega_21,Neo Gang from New-York city,7,26 July 2006,"To my shame i discovered this movie really recently and only with a strange reason. I was marveled with the front picture of a recent video game called ""The Warriors"". Seeing the picture i thought than this soft smell the American horror/action movies from the 70's. I was looking for fan critics of a game and find that it was actually inspired by a movie... no hesitation i must see it ! Frankly it's no so good that it could be, the different gangs are not so original and look more wannabe gangster than real gang from new york even in a near futur. the story is not deep and i think that a lot of another things could have been developed. Anyway it's a very pleasant movie with a non-stop action feeling and very fun situation. A must-see ? i don't know really but no need to wait a boring Saturday night to take it from you video dealer !",The Warriors
301,ricolo,American Cinematography at its 70's best,9,1 July 2001,"For me the Warriors is the greatest American film of the 70's. Restricted by a rookie cast Walter Hill creates a highly imaginative chase film focusing on urban gang rule, which keeps an impressive and tension filled pace throughout. Supported by a clever plot Hill captures the characters thoughts and beliefs whilst hoisting them into a diverse and hostile world within New York City. Persued and harrased by the police and gangs such as the particullay intimidating ""Baseball Fury"" Michael Beck and company make for an excellent film as they make there way home to Coney Island. James Remar is a little annoying as the head strong Ajax but nevertheless is excellent as are the rest of the cast especially David Patrick Kelly who plays the extremly twisted Luther who frames The Warriors. A sadly overlooked great at the peak of American film making",The Warriors

The Warriors is set in new york were the police are out numbered twenty thousand to one hundred thousand against the armies of the night. When Cyrus the leader of the Riffs the biggest gang in New York gets shot it then means the Warriors get wrongly accused which then leaves the Warriors having to get the train back to there old town Coney Island with all the gangs and cops in the city out there to kill them. There are some bad things about the film though, the Warriors run through most of the film and when they get hit badly there isn't many cuts and bruises on the people. the movie is just not a action there is also a few comedy moments mainly said by Ajax the tough one of the gang. For all you fans out there in case you haven't heard, the film is said to be remade in 2008 which i'm looking forward to.",The Warriors

I'm to young to have seen it when it came, but I have always had an eye out for the picture on the front, and I remember asking my mom if I could rent it, but of course, I didn't really have any idea what it was then. The brilliance in this film according to me is the fact that they havn't focused all their energy on making the characters, or for that matter any one in the movie, out to be hardcore dead serious and strickly reality. As of course you see in some of the costumes and make-up. But that's probably what's so good about it. And those kinds of fighting scenes seem to belong to a long forgotten era of movie violence, computer techniques and martial arts just doesn't have that feeling! To the end there is one more point that will allways make this kind of movies good: Practicly no one of the characters has made it big after that, I'm sure that most people my age (20) won't recognize any of the actors.

The sights of Cyrus being shot, and the Warriors being blamed.....Ajax and the guys battling with the Baseball Furies in the park.....The Lizzies, with their sex appeal that leads to switchblades and guns.....The karate bruthas - the Riffs.

309,slate_77,A comic stripped,7,9 February 2005,"The Warriors was an important right-of-passage epic for the aware urban teen in 1979. The clashes and the costumes, but especially the attitude quilt this old school over-the-top and stylized, yet nevertheless relevant survivalist urban experience into a compelling story that remains edgy today.The film, perfectly set in late 1970's New York, at a time when New York was - for those of you who weren't around then - an almost out of control, freaked out and dangerous place where constant chaos was never far from being realized.For me there is no better closing credits sequence in pictures. When first viewed this film filled me with a forlorn melancholy about this country's urban future, while at the same time building within me a sense of strength and determination with which to face and overcome any potential adversity or reality.Do not fail to credit the great Joe Walsh's 'In The City' for so memorably setting the scene and sewing together the storyline. If you are young or not otherwise familiar with that song just know that back in the day it was a powerful stand-alone radio jam outside of the film.Resigned lines delivered with an anguished voice accompanied by tortured guitar licks - In The City - Warrior reality.The following is a review of the Director's Cut edition of The Warriors.This is a review of The Director's Cut edition of The Warriors submitted to supplement my prior, February, 2005 review of the original release. I first saw this film in Drive-In theaters at the time of its release. I found the added 2005 filmed segments with Walter Hill, the producer, editors, actors and other motion picture collaborators very interesting and helpful in understanding the original intent of these filmmakers way back in the late 70s at the time the picture was first made.I admit to being at least one man that never knew that this film was partly based on ancient Greek literature nor partly conceived from a 1950s era gang novel. In fact, while being highly stylized and obviously NOT based gang-for-gang or scene-to-scene on any contemporary 'reality', the original movie was - nevertheless - quite plausible as a near future realization amongst the possibilities for the 'Apple in Decay' of that particular time and place. However, the Director's Cut edition, with it's comic strip panel segues between scenes, obscures the blatant realism that every shot of the subway and streets of New York city reinforced in the original release. How can you shoot in then modern, gritty, contemporary, real, New York City and call it unreal? Hill should have shot Gotham City like in Batman if he intended such fantasy.In fact, IMO, a late imitation of Batman is what this 'Director's Cut' edition of The Warriors wants to be, what with the added comic book illustrations. Indeed, I was there in the mid 1960s when the look of Batman took television by storm. The illustration of The Warriors gang behind Hill in his 'Director's Cut' apologia segment is drawn exactly as the Batman panels were done in the 1960s. Is it now necessary after almost 30 years to force everyone to accept that it was the Director's original intent that The Warriors had NO basis in reality? I readily admit that this Director's Cut works fine for any young person of today viewing this film for the first time. They wouldn't have a clue of what 1979 was like anyway. BTW, kids, the hairstyles, subways and streets of New York City looked just as this film portrays them circa 1979. The Punks gang, with the guy on skates dressed in overalls with the football and rugby shirts underneath were an exact copy of the style of dress that many white high school jocks of the middle 1970s wore every day to school. The hair was just right on them too. While I am not so sure if you could call these guys a 'gang' per se, for many high school wimps of the era those fellows sure were menacing!IMO, since the comic strip 'Director's Cut' sensibility clearly demonstrates Hill's original intent, then why didn't he use them in 1979 to show the movie as wholly NOT REAL? Whether original or 'Director's Cut', scene after scene of the film contradict that fantasy. Swan telling Mercy he doesn't like how she livesthe subway scene with the prom kidsthe (former) finale walk the beach under credit roll, searching for a better place, a better life! These were all very current and powerful issues and emotions confronting young people in 1979. So, while the gangs were stylized and somewhat unreal and the fighting was stylized and somewhat unreal, the picture's setting and the human situation portrayed were and still are very real indeed. I much prefer the old version to the new.",The Warriors
310,margaretrstudent,Great Movie,8,12 May 2015,"The weirdness of every gang's outfits and colors was hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing about the gang with the overalls...that's not intimidating at all, they were all like over-grown Chuckies. Swan was my favorite character since he was level-headed and remained cool the whole movie. I loved how everything in NY was tagged up and wish that the trains were kept tagged up, but they're obviously not like that now. If this film was made in 2015, everything in it would be changed or upgraded except for the gang names. Especially how Cyrus would've been killed since the pistol used (revolver?) was a terrible choice. Realistically, a pistol like that doesn't have the range or accuracy to kill Cyrus. I didn't like the Rogues or the Orphans at all, every Rogue had whiny voices and the Orphans were pathetic. Despite these things, I really liked the movie.",The Warriors

I remember seeing this movie when i was younger (13 or 14 (?)) and when me and my buddy saw it at blockbuster we both were excited to check it out. We both were disappointed with it. The plot is highly imaginative and creative and certainly has the potential to make a great movie-a classic. However, I found many of the scenes to be -for lack of a better word- corny as hell. While there are a few characters (Swan, the Rogues leader, Cyrus, Cleon) who are perfect for their roles there are many others who come across as being complete idiots and just not up to their roles in general. I might have thought differently if I had been around to see it when it first came out, but it is not hip nor cool. The baseball furies? How gay is that. I just felt like the whole movie had the potential to be great but fell way short of the mark.

So this movie is aces above most any movie that gets talked about in relation to it. Unlike other action movies these characters have growth and transisition. unlike other ""gang"" movies this is not about being a thug. This is a fast moving entertaining ride all the way through.

319,videogal78,"Come On, Just Give Me One Vest!",10,8 September 2001,"'The Warriors' is an entertaining piece from the late seventies. It takes you on a fun and adventurous ride where you can easily cheer for the 'good guys'. The Warriors find themselves wrongly accused and on a quest to simply get home while dodging other gangs and police. The cast is lead by Michael Beck as Swan, the new leader of the Warriors. James Remar adds friction within the Warriors as Ajax. Beck and Remar do an excellent job going at one another and creating tension while remaining on the same team. All the members of the Warriors leave their mark, the characters ranging from quiet and tough right on down to light hearted. The only thing I would change about the film is the outcome of Ajax. I definately agree with the other opinions on Rembrandt. All in all, 'The Warriors' is a definate keeper. The set is good, the soundtrack sports the seventies, the script is straight to the point, the fight scenes are some of the most realistic I've seen, and the different gangs are a lot of fun to watch. There is heart in this movie and audiences are given a chance to get to know the characters. 'The Warriors' is a classic with the universal theme of good vs. bad. Many of its quotes will ring in your ears long after you see the film --""Warriors, come out to play!!"", ""You Warriors are good"", and I must say ""Come on, just give me one vest, you can get another one, man!""

Any violence in it is more stylized than anything and reminds me of some of the earlier Japanese samurai films, which use the violence as more of an artistic expression rather than for gratuitous reasons. The heroes, the Warriors, are the good guys and they eventually triumph in the end. That being said, their withdrawal from enemy territory to get back home, dealing with a female gang, a gang of weirdly dressed baseball players, etc. is an exciting and surreal adventure. The acting is solid and the line between the good and evil is never blurred. Without giving anything away, I would recommend it highly.

This is a moderately smart action film with some interesting style points, a strong building of fight scenes (in a way which could have been a format for many modern computer games), a great sense of place and a confidence to create New York as a leading character.

But we couldn't get into ""The Warriors"". A security guard had been hired to keep locale gangs from starting trouble. So when we finally got to see it on VHS in about 1988 we ate it up! It quickly became a cult film for people my age. Plot is simple but fun, it's your basic story of a gauntlet that has to be run. Acting for this film was not a challenge, but for one exception - Deborah Van Valkenburgh plays ""Mercy"" tough role, and risky role, may have hurt her career even, hard to look at her in any other role and not remember this one. What makes this film is the action often very real, street fighters, bats, knives, anything at hand is used as a weapon. Also the sound track specifically Barry De Vorizon's mood setting music.

327,meansween-1,the original version vs director's cut,10,3 January 2006,"I am a massive fan of the original warriors, but hated the directors cut. The comic book wipes from scene to scene seemed to cheapen the whole film. Though the director may have been originally aiming for a more 'fantastic' (for lack of a better word) feel, surely he must realise that the way the movie turned out, with a certain gritty and yet, feel good style, is the way it is meant to be. Slapping a few cartoons here and there instead of a simple wipe doesn't make for a radically different movie, just a spoiled one. And why would the original film, a classic and masterpiece, be discontinued once the new edition is released? there are future and even current generations who may not get a chance to see the original now. If the original DVD edition is going to be discontinued, why can't it be included in the new edition, we all know that it is possible (see alien special edition) am i the only one who has this opinion?",The Warriors
328,skongur-623-160188,Who Wants To Hide?,10,28 May 2015,"I guess if there's a category named ""Movies that probably suck when you first hear their title"" exists, The Warriors definitely fits in there.When I first saw this film's name, I presumed it as a unexceptional and banal action movie but I was terribly wrong.The Warriors carries us to the future, where in the dark streets of dystopian New York City, turf gangs and cops rule the streets.When one gang leader tries to bring all gangs together against the cops, the gang named ""The Warriors"" are framed for his murder and the entire city turns on them..The story of this gang (Which formed of members who use their heads rather than their fists) is a great example of profundity and flows expeditious.Subway stations enlightened by dim lights, numerous odd looking gangs and dangerous women quickly draws watcher's attention.The music of the movie adjusts the atmosphere of the film perfectly.The film was written and directed by Walter Hill, who is widely known for his action movies.Many young and inglorious actors like Michael Beck, James Remar, Dorsey Wright and Brian Tyler appearing in the movie, performing outstanding jobs..The Warriors is one of the movies which has well-deserved it's cult status.Recommended especially for fans of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece ""A Clockwork Orange"" .Also recommended to watch late at night.",The Warriors

""is the truce still on or do we have to bop our way back?"" its a movie about survival loyalty and a brotherhood you are willing to give your life for in the dangerous streets of n.y. i have watched this movie about a 100 times and to this date i am reminded of it everyday by random people still quoting this film which by the way has one of the most quotable lines in movie history. so watch it and find out what all the hype is about",The Warriors
330,selket9,Amazing directorial art,9,15 February 2005,"The acting and the dialog aren't the best, but the cinematography is the real star of this movie. The shots are all framed to feel gritty, dark, garish. The gangs are outrageous but fitting in this dreamlike interpretation of reality. The rain washed streets streaked with light, the music, the magnificent Lynne Thigpen as the DJ, the reports to the Warlord of the Riffs done in silhouette. The movie is more art than film. It is violent and it's initial message is more frightening today than it was in 1979. As a woman I also have to note that the men in this movie are very easy on the eye, to say the least. I also like the message that we are given at the end, that you can make your world a better place. Yes it's trite, but sometimes we do forget that. I recommend this movie highly.",The Warriors
331,ambimas,Low life movie for the low brow crowd!,2,17 March 2014,This movie when it came out last one week in theaters in the Suburbs and did well in poor urban areas. Saw it when it came on Cinemax a few years later. It appeals to the Neanderthal amongst us! The kind of people who would go to time square and watch Karate flicks!! It seems like today more and more that these types of movies along with an endless supply of Slice and dice movies that glorify gratuitous violence are filling the multiplexes of America! Very disturbing trend!! Hollywood liberals who make their anti guns stands should clean up their own community and try not to glorify violence for violence sake. Movies should entertain with out appealing to the lowest common Denominator of Society!!,The Warriors
332,TheIntersect,I Cannot Dig It!,1,3 December 2005,"The Warriors is a despicable movie that has cult status for the wrong reasons, the movie glorifies gang culture/violence to the maximum extent possible. However, are watching the movie, what I found most disturbing were the racial undertones set in this movie, the various gangs are segregated by gender, race, ethnic origin to name a few. This movie may have been acceptable in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, but it has no place in modern day society, where gang culture is all to real, where people are killed for such trivial matters as ""your wearing the wrong colors"", ""your in the wrong neighborhood"". So before you decide to watch this movie or recommend it to a friend or relative, please take a look around the world you live in.",The Warriors
333,allanfstudent,Warriors review,8,12 May 2015,I liked how the leader of the warriors helped and motivated the other members of the warriors with leadership. Another thing I liked was when the warriors kept winning there fights. The thing that annoyed me the most was when the warriors dept with the situations on there own. For example one of the warriors got booked by the cops because he wanted to have sex with this lady that was clearly playing him to get caught by the cops. The one way that this film was real was all the gang fights. One lesson that I learned from this film was to not trust females that you don't know. Also another lesson that I learned was to know what to do in when you are falsely accused of something you didn't do. One more thing that I liked about this film was how the trains and how New York used to look like back in the days.,The Warriors
334,andentewstudent,the concept,7,1 June 2015,"The movies the warriors is a movie about a gang rivalry , that escalates into violence and take place in the famous beach of coney island, this is a good representation of whats the scenario in brooklyn,that happens all the time, when a group of kids would meet up to fight, this a natural in brooklyn. Gang violence still happens in this day and age in brooklyn, and other places of the world.The warriors shows a good representation of how kids behave in modern and old time Brooklyn as a result of opposing gangs being so close to each other, as well as poverty in Brooklyn neighborhoods. This movie also shows the little history in coney island that i think not a lot of people know about, as well as the kids and the role we played in coney .",The Warriors

Not only that,but the action was pretty boring, just basically them dodge and fake punching people. The whole movie is just them basically them running around avoiding everything around them.Not really my type of movie. They only reason why I would probably watch this movie alone if I was forced to, or if there was nothing to watch on TV, but that's just me.According to everyone I know, it's one of the greatest films they've ever seen, and according to the internet, it's a classic movie, but to me honestly, I don't see it.",The Warriors
336,jonathanbstudent,Warriors,9,12 May 2015,The reasons I give this movie 9 stars:This movie captured some problems that was happening in 1979. Also it showed that gangs were a big problem back then. Also it captured how subways had looked. Subways was dirty and empty around that time. Also it rarely had any protection. I noticed that the subways back then only used tokens but now they use cards that you swipe. Also another difference is that police cars had a different type of cars. Now there car is more faster and have more technology built inside. Also now you will rarely see and payphone but back then they was all over the place. This movie portrayed new york in a very good way. The characters in this movie played the parts really well expressed the emotions really well.,The Warriors
337,xfuneralofheartsx,a classic in it's own right,10,10 December 2006,"I'll admit the first time I saw this, I didn't see what the big deal was. I thought parts were dragged out, unneeded, and didn't make any sense. I decided to give it a second chance, and it instantly became one of my favorite movies.The Warriors tells the tale of a ""futuristic"" New York City, in which, it seems, everyone is either associated with a gang, a cop, or just in the way. The Riffs, the largest gang in the city, calls for a meeting, consisting of 9 representatives from each gang, and each member to be unarmed. During this meeting, Cyrus, the leader of the Riffs, tells his plan of a unified gang which would run the city and outnumber the cops. During his speech, Luther, a member of the Rogues, shoots Cyrus after sneaking a gun into the meeting. Questions arise as to who did it, which the finger being pointed at the Warriors. From here on out, the Warriors are on their own as they must travel from the Bronx to Coney Island by any means necessary, traveling by train and by foot, through other gang territory.Now a days, the violence in the movie may not effect some, but seeing as how it was made in 1979, I can see where the controversy comes from. As the movie goes on, you will start cheering for the Warriors and anticipating what will happen next. The use of (then) unknown actors helps you get into the story a little bit more, as you realize these could be everyday people and not big-name, big-budget Hollywood actors.Looking back, I realized how much the meeting was an allegory for the Martin Luther King Jr. ""I have a dream"" speech. From the vision of a unified group to the assassination and even after wards, when the Warriors are saying what a great man and leader Cyrus would have been.If you enjoy the movie, or want to understand it more, I highly recommend the Warriors video game, produced by Rockstar. It runs (almost) alongside the movie, but also provides a steady back story or how the Warriors was started and how each member came to be. An added bonus of the game is some of the major actors return to provide voices for their characters, such as Swan, Ajax and Cleon. It is also interesting to see (if you watch the movie before playing the game), how well the clips from the movie translate into the game. Many of the key scenes look like they are taken straight from the movie, like the meeting and the introduction of all of the Warriors in the beginning.Again, I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes cult movies, as this is a major one. Even if you don't like cult movies, I recommend it for the strong messages it sends.",The Warriors
338,tatiannajstudent,I loved this movie,7,12 May 2015,"This was a very entertaining movie. I loved Swan's attitude and how he took charge. I liked the DJ because I found her hilarious and it was funny how she had a song that went with the scenes. I liked how the warriors weren't afraid of the gangs and fought their way through to get home, originally unarmed and out numbered and unaware that they were a target. They were brave. Though the movie was great, I did find some things rather annoying like the fact that so many people were naive and the women were basically portrayed as sneaky whores. The setting was realistic for the time period because the trains during that time weren't maintained and they had tons of graffiti. Though you wouldn't find that now you would then. Also Coney Island's ""Wonder Wheel"" is highly associated with New York. Over all it's a great movie.",The Warriors
339,keme,Can you dig it?,9,12 November 2005,"Take Westside Story, remove the dancing and the singing, Now put it in a blender and add a bit of edge, some muscle, a fair bit of blood, some oddly menacing 70s tunes and a cast of characters so awe-strikingly magnetic they could pull a nail out of a board. Chances are you'll end up with something that looks a little bit like The Warriors.The movie is set in the late 1970s in a New York overrun with gangs, the unlikely heroes of the story are a real live bunch of boppers (that's a gang for all you suckahs out there) from Coney Island known as the Warriors.They are wrongly accused of bumping off the miracleman known as Cyrus, gangland visionary and leader of the biggest gang in NYC, and now every gang in town are out to wreck them for it. All they just want to do is get back home to their turf with their skulls intact.Some may find The Warriors to be a bit campy, but the flicks caustic attitude and mean charm should more than make up for it.9/10",The Warriors
340,stiloette,**** a cult classic*********,10,6 October 2005,"The Warriors, what can you say?? It's easy to see it and label it as just a film about gratuitous gang violence. But on closer look it is a remarkable piece of film making, in all departments. A cult classic, and in my all time top 10 films. I saw this film as a teenager on it's first release in the UK in 1979 with a group friends, the following week we went back to see it again, and again. This was before the age of mass video ownership. We talked about it for weeks and months afterwards, often repeating and quoting the classic lines from the film amongst ourselves. Years after I used to think that it had only appealed to me because of the impressionable age I was back then. But on viewing it several times since then on both terrestrial TV and DVD I must say it still stands up very well. My son is now very much into films and when he reached 16/17 I mentioned to him about what a good film it was. He'd never heard of it before but was very impressed after viewing it. He's since stated that he'd recommended it to friend at college who'd never heard of it before either. His friend now recons it's the best film he's ever seen!. Now these are 16/17/18 year old students who are used to and have grown up expecting big budget, cgi loaded special effects action/gore fests. In no way is this realistic or even gritty, but a heavily stylised action yarn. As an avid reader of history I was aware of the march of the 10000 Greek mercenaries back from Persia, but had never before thought that it may have been the inspiration for this particular film. I can't really put my finger on why this film is so good, is it the camera work, the dialogue, the relentless pace of the action, the soundtrack or perhaps the acting? because it is good. James Remar, Michael Beck and Debora VanValkenberg all put in good and very believable performances. Also our American friends may not know it but this film is very, and I mean very popular among the football(soccer)culture over here. As it portrays the things that they like to associate with themselves, namely loyalty,bravery,honour as well as a pride in what you are and where you've come from. I'm not saying this is morally right or correct, but it's merely an observation.",The Warriors
341,Fuddiduddy,"""It's still on. ...And we're going.""",8,12 October 2005,"The cinematography, the directing, the casting, the soundtrack and the costume design. --All of are what make this classic such an enjoyable, eerie, surreal ride from the northern Bronx to Coney Island, Brooklyn through NYC's gritty subway. One bizarre and creepy street gang after another are on the heels of our innocent but tough and, presumably, well-meaning Warriors. Along the way, we get a reluctant love interest for the gang leader, which thankfully, avoids any softy, sappy and corny feel so obligatory in most movies today.I vividly remember my sister and her boyfriend (now brother-in-law) reluctantly letting me tag along on their date to see The Warriors when it was released in 1979. I was 9 at the time, but enjoy it no less now than I did then. Sure, some of the gangs' ""colors"" are laughably ridiculous now, but this added to the surrealness of the movie. (And I can attest that during the '70s, big city street gangs & cliques wearing their own creative uniforms was a big phenomenon). The Warriors merely exaggerated that fact with the use of the Furies and the ""High Hat"" mime gang.Not all of the acting was great, and the editing needed A LOT of work, but the nighttime sequences, soundtrack, and the use of the DJ all contributed to color of the film. Finally, I just bought the recently-released ultimate director's cut of the DVD, and must say that I'm appalled at Walter HIll's use of comic book style ""wipes"" and layout infused with the movie. It unnecessarily leads the audience by the hand without subtlety adding anything. However, the commentaries by HIll himself as well as the other actors were informative and I appreciated that.I'm surprised that The Warriors has not yet reached widespread pop culture status in the U.S. It truly deserves it!",The Warriors
342,willi-buecking,worth a watch but not too great.,4,6 August 2017,"The great point about this movie, which made me like it in a way, is that it manages to transport a certain feeling, an atmosphere. The design of the different gangs and their behavior is a big plus point. It kind of reminds one of the droogs from clockwork orange. This point alone is a reason to watch. But, to lower your expectations a bit, the plot line is acted out in a very flat and unsatisfactory manner. While the main-plot is about what i expected when i i first watched it, the (supposed to be) romantic subplot is badly written and carried out even worse. The movie could very well do without it, the romance seems to be crammed in just to have on at all cost, which is sadly the case with a lot of movies, but really kills the mood in this one. All in all, i'd recommend watching it once but not expect too much of it. It's a nice watch but it's not exactly a great movie.",The Warriors

Walter Hill directs this 1979 cult classic about a gang from Coney Island. The gang, along with thousands of other gangs is attending a huge meeting in the Broncs. The meeting, held by the most powerful gang leader in all of NYC, Cyrus, is an initiative to unite all of the gangs of NYC to take over the city. They outnumber the cops 5 to 1 and they number 100 thousand strong. The meeting goes awry, however, when The Warriors are framed for killing Cyrus. They must make it back to their home turf, alive, with every other gang in the city hunting them down. It is one of the most excellent movies I've seen in a while, and it really had me cheering for the characters. It's based on an ancient Greek myth about a group of warriors being stuck inland surrounded by enemies and having to fight their way back out from behind enemy lines to the sea where they could escape.

363,donaldreay,"Mad, but Entertaining in a Mindless Way - Spoilers",7,7 November 2021,"Saw this in the cinema when it was released and remembered it as gritty and suspenseful. Caught it on TV the other night and it's just mad. But there are worse ways of spending your time.As others have commented, it frames itself as classical mythology and makes an interesting stab at that. Interesting too as a snapshot of late seventies fashion, attitudes, and the state of New York City, at least as portrayed in film. There's a lot of casual, and not so casual, sexism/misogyny on display that surely wouldn't get onto the screen today. The violence is comic book, with many participants surviving miraculously unscathed. Although, obviously, there are fatalities, and the killing of the first Warrior is quite gruesome.A lot else seems just too unrealistic.The cops, in their attempts to get hold of the Warriors, are of the Keystone variety (apart, perhaps, from the park bench incident). Just think about it. The cops roll up to a meeting of 1000 gang members in a small enclosed space (they arrive before the shooting, so what are they planning to do?) Whatever they might have been planning, what they do is send fifty or so of their number running straight into the gangs waving their truncheons (nightsticks?) about. Way to go! When the Warriors first break cover to run for the subway train, how long do they manage to outrun the bus full of skinheads for? Of course, to get away from a motor vehicle, you run along the road in front of it! The Warriors are right about one thing - some of the other gangs are full-on wimpy. Special mention to the Orphans, and their henpecked leader, who all freaked out when the car was set alight. That girl gang really need to get some target practice in. So many gunshots in an enclosed space result in one grazed forearm.In the end, though, it entertained for its duration.Think of a mash up of Fame, minus the character development, and After Hours, minus the character development. Come to think of it, After Hours does a very similar thing to Warriors far, far better.",The Warriors

The soundtrack could use a little help, and I was disappointed by the early departure of my favorite Warrior.But overall, the movie was excellent.  Just recently, after the Lakers won the 2002 NBA championship, Shaq said the line ""Can you dig it"" to the LA fans at a rally, which is a classic one-liner from the Warriors.

At the meet Cyrus (the leader of the biggest gang) speaks to all of unity and joining forces. Someone shoots Cyrus then blames it on a warrior. The warriors are fighting to get back home while the gangland underground is fighting to stop ""THE WARRIORS""! Has a great 70's feel with a little futuristic/fantasy type of layout. Nice violence and intense emotions. The movie takes place in the city at night and has something of an erie almost thriller/suspense type of feel to it. The musical score is made up wonderfully from synthesizers with a rock and roll groove. Much better than some of your 50's biker musicals and such.",The Warriors
368,Elsav,*clanking bottles together* warriors come out to play-yay!,10,24 November 2002,"'The Warriors' is a brilliantly captured look at how gang warfare in New York could be like in the future. The opening music and credits are very submersive, reeling you into an almost apocalyptic gang world in the New York subways, as each gang is seen taking there route to a meeting held by the head of the underworld, Cyrus. He is inadvertantly shot and this act is blames on the Warriors who become fugitives from all other gang members and the police, trying to return from The Bronx to their homelands in Coney Island. The way gangs work was shocking yet intruiging and very cool. They have little regard for anything or anyone, not paying for train rides, stealing food from corner stall etc.. Then there was the idea of gang turf, as The Warriors end up having to muscles there way through small time gangs who are protective over there areas. If you are into cult movies or interested in NYC and slightly more unorthadox movies that allow you to discover and experience a different world and way of life then definately give this movie a go.

372,EpsteinsMother,Girls Love Guy-movies Too!,10,28 August 2003,"I love this movie!  I turned five years old in September of 1979 and I can barely remember seeing this movie (family members ran a drive-in at the time).  I had forgotten about it when, probably about eight or nine years ago, I'm sitting around the house late at night, bored, and looking for something to watch.  The T.V. Guide described this movie as ""Walter Hill's surreal vision of street gangs.""  Well, having a bit of an arty side I was attracted to the word ""surreal"" and descided to watch it.  It wasn't until the fight with the overalls-wearing gang in the restroom that I realized that I had seen this movie before--it was that scene that had stood out to me as a very young child.  I just think this movie is very well made, something that could have only been made in the late 1970s (one era of time I wish I could remember better than I actually do).  Many people trash this movie, saying it's not realistic and that the characters and costumes are cheesy--but these folks are disliking this movie for some of the aspects that make it great, aspects which I believe were deliberate on the part of the filmmakers.  I'm sorry that Marcelino Sánchez (Rembrant--I think I may be the only person who likes his character)  and Lynne Thigpen (Radio DJ) are not longer alive.  At least Ms. Thigpen lived long enough to probably see this film become a cult classic; but Sanchez probably never realized this, dying so young in 1986. I have to say that at the time I rediscovered this film, what really drew me in was that very handsome Swan (Michael Beck). He was 30 when he made this movie, and probably one of the best-looking men I've ever seen in film. James Remar (Ajax)is not bad-looking, either. But now... now I have to say that Luther (David Patrick Kelly) steals my heart.  Soooo psycho!!! Just screaming-at-the-top-of-his-lungs-bouncing-off-the-walls psycho!  How I love Willem Dafoe... Michael Wincott... David Patrick Kelly...  Ahhhhh, psycho guys are so hot...",The Warriors

This 1979 classic mixes street gangs, the 70's, po bashing, and violence into a nice overall package.  The concept of one man (or group) fighting their way to safety is not a new concept, but The Warriors is one of the few films that does this without leave the viewer thinking ""That could never happen"" .  The Warriors do a lot of running.  They don't have fifty guns and clips of never ending ammo.   They fight with what ever they can and fight only when they have to.  This doesn't mean they're pussies, this means that they are street smart. The fight scenes are pretty damn entertaining and the gangs are a great tough of comedy and entertainment.   A look into the underworld of New Yorkstreet gangs was unique for its time and can still be viewed without lame special effects or unrealistic characters to hold it down.

I loved all the characters, especially Ajax, played by James Remar. Ajax is just that guy who you love to hate, but really, is your favorite for being so strongheaded. All the members of the Warriors represent some thing different, like Swan is the warlord, or leader, Rembrandt, is the new, shy guy, Fox is the guy whose pretty chill with everyone...and the list goes on.

The amount of problems that appeared on the sets of this movie are ridiculous, and yet they completed the movie, and in my eyes, became not only a fantastic film to watch, but to flare up the passion to make movies.There are some elements to the film that could have been improved, but these are down the editing side of the production, such as the scene with ""The Lizzies"", which is very rushed within the film, but in the video game re-make of the movie, this scene is paced better with building tension, and still short, left a greater impact.",The Warriors

Seeing the movie many times over the years on re-release in the theatres, drive-ins and most recently today on DVD my feelings of it's impact still ring true. Not a cinematic classic, but a cult classic.  Along the lines of Planet of the Apes. The overall feelings of fear, anxiety, anger and just a plain old ""I want to kick some ass"" still ring true today.

And pay attention boppers, there are plenty of subtle messages and hidden meanings at each subway stop.It's also nice to see that just about every gang is inter-racial...I can't say for sure about the High Hats (the mimes) or the Baseball Furies, but I'd say its pretty likely considering even the skinheads (the Turnbull A.C.'s) were multicultural. We should all take a lesson from ""gang life"" in 1979.And of course Luther and his gang of wanna-be-Ramones (the Rogues...oooh, scary) are without a doubt the best part of the movie.

379,spike-fumo,The best of the best gang film,10,13 October 2005,"The best gang film ever Since the film was shot in 1979, it gives the whole movie a sense of authenticity and transports you back to a time when walking around New York in the middle of the night was not such a great idea. Being the late seventies, gangs could get away with wearing brightly colored outfits from shiny purple jackets to dungarees. The subway is also an icon of the movie and is what drives the story's progression through the city with encounters with different gangs at each stop. The soundtrack is great and the scores by Barry DE Vorzon really create an atmosphere fit for the scenes they play over (The Baseball Furies chase being a particular favorite).Each of the nine Warriors have very different personalities which have been acted well by the actors (the first appearance for many actors). For example, the bitter rivalry between Swan and Ajax is portrayed well, whereas the other Warriors look after Rembrandt as if he were a younger brother. Of course, there can't be a gang film without fights and clashes and The Warriors certainly delivers. Being 1979, guns were relatively rare, which meant that Walter Hill could show great fight scenes such as the one with the Baseball Furies (using bats) and the Punks (spray cans and chains). 26 years on and there's going to be a ""remake"", a video game based on the original movie, action figures and a special edition DVD!

I watched it again on IFC last night, and it's even hokier than I remembered. I'm really surprised by how many great reviews it's gotten and the number of people who label it as a ""classic"". Whether or not it's based on a historic Spartan conflict, it comes off as a cheesy ""B"" flick that was largely unscripted and made up on the fly. The over-acting is reminiscent of a pre-1960's film, when over-acting was the order of the day. The fight scenes were equally unrealistic, and once the Warriors made it past the Turnbull AC's and the Orphans, the rest of the movie was extremely predictable. The ""narrator"", if you could call her that...the DJ on the radio station that apparently catered to ""bangers""...raised the level of absurdity to unprecedented heights. All that being said, it does have some sort of indescribable quality to it that makes it worth watching.

It makes more sense in having it in as it's shows us the place that they are escaping to and it compliments the daylight ending in Coney. The 'back where it began' type ending.Also, not sure about the remake they're going to do, surely it can't be set in the present day as gang warfare has changed somewhat since 1979.Like the new figures that Mezco have released to co-incide with the 25th anniversary of the releases.",The Warriors

Definitely needs to be remade in the modern age of film, just because the premise is too easy to work with.

Growing up in that era, I can tell you that my friends and I still talk about the movie at least once a month. I was so happy to see the recently released version on DVD. While searching the internet, I also found a copy of the original script. It made a great read. Although not without its flaws (in terms of continuity and location), The Warriors is a movie for the ages. It gives a glimpse into a bygone era, and shows that not all ""gangs"" were thugs looking to create trouble.

It reminded me of an old school version of the movie Double Dragon, where you have a whole bunch of exotic looking street gangs chasing after a couple of guys, except unlike the movie Double Dragon The Warriors is not completely lame. As a New Yorker this brought me back to a nostalgic time before I was born when there used to be only two people in the entire city with guns. Everyone else fought really well. Even the cops had their moments in this film as they were ready to rumble on several occasions armed with nothing more than a nightstick and a whistle and a pair of cuffs. I don't want to go to into detail and ruin the movie but by the end of the movie you genuinely want those gangbangers to keep on banging cause they're good...they're damn good. Definitely a fun one too watch so long as you don't invite the token ""Annoying Guy"" who's going to make jokes about how bad the movie is simply because its so outdated.

I was a fresh faced 15 year old watching this 18 rated movie. This was quite normal because the old movie house was owned and run by two old ladies with bad eyesight, and couldn't tell anyones age.I actually saw every single screening, such was the 'buzz' created by this ground breaking film. It had everything, cool soundtrack, colourful yet ruthless characters, and a storyline that had you sitting on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Some of the fight sequences in The Warriors put a lot of modern day action sequences to shame.The choreography of these sequences were so realistically composed.As far as performances go, Michael Beck was excellent as the quiet and moody Swan. His character was brilliantly written, as he doesn't have to say very much in terms of dialogue to speak volumes. However, I recall that all us lads wanted to be Ajax. mad as hell and as tough as nails. In fact, the only downside to experiencing The Warriors phenomenon, at that time, was that everyone wanted to have a fight after the end credits. Boys will be boys. As for the remake, well, why even attempt to remake a classic. It can never be surpassed! I forgot to mention that I grew up in the Highlands of Scotland. Quite a long way off from New York. But, last year I visited The Bronx Zoo and walked along the promenade at Coney Island. It was great to see that the big wonderwheel still sits proudly, centre stage of the fairground, and there's a cool wall mural of the Warriors next to a hotdog stand.

400,odersacthemighty,This Movie is Incredible,9,26 October 2005,"This movie is absolutely fantastic, from the gripping intro of Cyrus' speech, to the climactic end at Coney, this movie has it all.When I first heard what this movie was about, I thought it was going to be a mindless Vin Diesel, cheesy action flick, but I was wrong.The movie has so many great aspects to it, such as all of the different gangs. The time that must have been taken to come up with over 100 different gangs is just phenomenal.I did have a few issues with the movie though, such as how the different characters never really showed any history or backstory, it would be great to know how The Warriors were started or how Cleon and Swan met.Another issue I had was that some of the dialogue was a little bit cheesy, but it's not so bad as to ruin the movie. Also a little outlook into what happens after the events would be nice, what happens with the Riffs, and does anyone take over for the crusade of unity.All in all this movie is amazing, more movies today should be like it.I give The Warriors a 9 ""Can You Dig It"".",The Warriors
401,samwell,Only tolerable due to nostalgia...,3,14 November 2005,"I am amazed at the number of people who seem to view this movie as a true ""coming-of-age"" epic. The storyline is the best part of the movie: Cyrus, a gang leader with some vision, calls a huge Central Park summit for all the gangs in the 5 boroughs of NYC. He preaches to them his idea of uniting all these petty gangs into a 100 000 strong army of ruffians. At the climax of his sermon he is killed, and the shooting is subsequently blamed on ""The Warriors"", a gang from Coney Island. Every other gang quickly turns on them, as Cyrus seemed to be the only chance of ending constant violent turf wars. Now the Warriors must fight through every gang in the city in order to get back home.Unfortunately, the film is so unrealistic that even if the acting had been good (which it is certainly not), it would have been painful to watch. Remember, this is 1979. Of every gang featured (including an all-girl, pseudo-lesbian gang - how seventies is that???) not one is based on race. In fact, this movie should be held up as a great example of anti-segregation as every single gang seems to be comprised of a couple of white guys, some Puerto Ricans, a black guy or two, some Italians, and some Asians. I wouldn't be surprised if they even threw a Jewish roughneck in each one, oy vey.If you want to watch a movie to laugh at funny clothes, hairstyles and overly obvious music, then by all means, sit back and enjoy your 98 minutes. If however you're looking for a movie that backs up a great idea with ""crazy"" things like good acting, realism, and well choreographed fights, then maybe pick up ""The Outsiders"" instead.

402,drkstr221,The Warriors=Greatest movie of all time,10,11 December 2005,"OH my god, this is by far my favorite movie, what with all of the odd ball gangs, the greatest being the Baseball Furies to the limp wristed Orphans. ANd who could forget lines like ""Riffs"" ""Yeah Right"" of the most famous line from the movie, ""Warriors, come out to play"" when Luthor was in the car with the bottles on his fingers. Memorable people like my personal favorite, Ajax, acted to perfection by James Remar. Or Swan by Michel Beck, the one and only Warlord, after Cleon. Now, with it coming back in various forms like the great game and it coming out on DVD but probably the least favored one,the remake. But who cares, the movie is fantastic and is near and dear to a few people, including me. NO joke, it is so fantastic. I think that i would marry this movie if it was popular.",The Warriors
403,dragontailonfire,My Alltime Favorite ...,10,28 November 2005,"The Warriors is my all time favorite movie. On the second place comes Bruce Lee's 'Enter the Dragon'. I've seen The Warriors repeatedly, more than any other movie, and I can see it again and again without getting bored.I noticed in several reviews that the Special DVD sucks except of the special features. In the remake, don't know if it will really be released, it seems the Baseball Furies are not in the play. That's a really g-damn shame.The PS2 game is really though, thanks to Rockstar.!!! Who can send me the complete movie script???My favorite lines: ""Hey, no sweat. Swan is war chief!"" and ""The chicks are packed! The chicks are packed!""",The Warriors
404,outlawstar_07,(none),10,3 December 2005,"i saw this movie on Spike, a few months ago, and i liked it so much i stayed up and watched the encore, and i've now seen it 7 times, it's entirely original and is a refreshment from today's movies that all reflect each others personalities and traits. If you'd like to watch an awesome classic than pop a squat on your couch/foo ton and look for it on t.v. it's definitely going to be shown a lot more often. And if it isn't call up your cable company and reguest it, too lazy you say? get netflix and order it three times, just in case one doesn't make it, back ups. If you don't want to watch this movie, what are you reading this comment for?",The Warriors
405,rickyravelo,this is the best movie i like a few parts and will love a 2nd one,10,17 December 2005,"its my favorite movie since i saw it on Ax my dad had told me about it before,no i have the video game and its my favorite one to.i would like a 2part saying that Cleon wasn't wasted and was let there unconscious and they freed Ajax from prison..with the same actors or new one younger saying they are their sons.i love the part Luther goes like""nooo nooo its wasn't us it was them the warriors"" you warriors are good real good, THE Best..i also like the part on which swan tells Ajax on the grave yard,, make your move...and also i like the way swan walks..i also like the fight with the furies and the punks i like Ajax when he says you see they were a bunch of wimps",The Warriors
406,JJCordCutters,Classic Movie,10,28 September 2018,I saw this movie when I was young. I have loved ever since. I have it my trakt list and all so I can watch when ever. IT IS A CLASSIC!!!!!!,The Warriors
407,mfanfani-1,The warriors,10,20 January 2006,"Simply gorgeous.The history of a fighting and pursuing long night under the sound of silence.It is also obvious that John Carpenter's ""1984:escape from New York""took many ideas from it:the night setting, the idea of the men alone against all the oddities, the music, never too loud but scary at the same time. I adored this film because even though its theme is related to violence, I found it extremely relaxing; it is also a perfect mirror of the last 70's.It is definitely the first movie describing the gangs'world, the desire of the youth to gather, to express its fear, its feelings in a world which is quickly becoming cruel, violent.And the gangs violence is definitely softer than the outdoor world's violence. The actors play a masterpiece:even the less important characters are played with the attention to every details. The scene of the bathroom is great: its synchronism, its rhythm, everything is perfect. Beautiful also the scene of the long and passionate kiss in the underground..Seldom we have the chance to see, nowadays, such beautiful kissing scene.But one above all the scenes, the pursuing of the warriors by the baseball furies: the moment in which, in the silence, the first cap of the chief of the baseball furies appears running on the screen....scary.",The Warriors
408,sept51971,Does it contain the original cuts scenes?,10,20 January 2006,"I remember seeing The Warriors the first time and it had about 5 extra scenes- all you you true Warriors fans should know what I am talking about. Does this movie contain them??? I was very disappointed with the first DVD version which did not include them, however this being a directors cut I would imagine that it should be there-please let me know as it has been years since I-and I am sure many fans have not seen these cut scenes since its original release...If so then Walter Hill has satisfied his devoted fans by doing so, if not get back to looking for those missing scenes Mr. Hill as us true Warrior fans want them in a DVD version-widescreen please.",The Warriors
409,jap340,Armies of the Night,10,10 June 2006,"The Warriors: One of thousands of ""Armies of the Night"" fighting over one another's turf every night. The Boppers, The Gramercy Riffs, The Hurricanes, all just a few of the gangs protecting there right to fight. The movie starts of with the Coney Island gang The Warriors going to a gang meeting. Every gang in the city is being called to a truce lead by Cyrus, the leader of the biggest gang in the city. After and empowering speech, all seems to be great. However, amongst these excited gangs are The Rogues. The leader of the Rouges, Luther, pulls out a tiny pistol and shoots Cyrus right in the chest. Instantly, cops flood the park and Luther claims to have seen a Warrior pull the trigger. Now, 60,000 gangs and 20,000 cops are swarming NYC. The Gramercy Riffs sends every gang after them in an attempt to wreck em. Throughout the movie, it shows the endless struggle of The Warriors as they bopp there way back to Coney all in one night. Ajax, Snowball, Vermin, Fox, Remberant, Swan, and Cochise were chosen by the Warchief Cleon out of 120+ soldiers to treck along. Cleon is the man who formed this gang, the ""Warchief"". He formed The Warriors after he and another quit the Coney gang The Destroyers. Swan is second in command. Cleon told him that if anything happened to him, Swan would become Warchief. Swan and Cowboy joined The Warriors after a battle of king of the hill. Ajax is heavy muscle. He joined after brawling with others. Cochise is a soldier. He joined The Warriors because the others were to weak for him. He had to prove himself by finding one of The Boppers size nine hat. Snow joined by fighting. Vermin helped Cleon form The Warriors. Fox joined by going into China town and fighting with The Savage Huns. Remberant is the youngest one. He joined The Warriors because he proved that he not only has heavy skills in tagging but in brawling. While some gangs like The Orphans were easy for The Warriors to fight off, others weren't. Gangs like The Turn Bull ACs had a dump truck and chased down The Warriors. The Warriors get seduced by an all female gang, The Lizzies, and turns out they're packed to. While in Tremont, The Orphans turf, The Warriors meet up with a cheap whore named Mercy. She and Swan have something going on, and walk off together in the end. The second to last gang The Warriors fight are named The Punks, kids with long hair, overalls, and roller skates. The knife that the leader of The Punks uses is later used by Swan to stab Luther. After the fight with The Punks, The Warriors leave to get home to there turf. Its now about 5 in the morning. Coneys empty. When The Warriors finally think its OK to walk about, Luther and his Rouges follow them in a graffiti covered hershe. Luther breaks out with the famous ""Warriors, come out to play!"" line as the end draws near. In The end, its leader against leader as Swan and Luther ar ready to fight. As Luther draws his pistol, Swan takes out his knife and throws it threw Luthers hand as he cries. The Riffs arrive right after and take care of Luther. Then, the remaining Warriors walk of as the sun rises as the DJ who gave them such a bad time plays Joe Walshs In the City.",The Warriors
410,gfctatnell,"Excellent, one of the greats!",10,5 February 2006,"The Warriors - A gang in new york city, however is a low rep gang but high enough to be on the biggest gang network. The film is about The Warriors fight to safety as an amazing, life changing meeting is disrupted by the killing of the leader of the biggest gang in the city. The meeting is hosted by the president of The Riffs, The Riffs have a network of heavy set gangs that all were invited, The Warriors being one of the gangs on the list. The leader of The Riffs, Syrus is a real pioneer. He says every gang invited must only bring 9 soldiers, un-armed, no guns, no knifes, no bits of word just nothing to wield at all. The warriors send there 9 soldiers : Cleo - The leader of the warriors, strong, intelligent and is very strict upon his gang. Swan - A lieutenant of the warriors, of all the 9 soldiers selected Cleo trusted him the most and said he would be war chief if Cleo happens to get wrecked or arrested. Ajax - Another lieutenant of the warriors, hes very lary and careless. He also has a very eager eye for raping women in the park at night. Cowboy - A small time soldier in the gang but still very loyale to both the gang and his hat. Chochise - A small time lieutenant, a good fighter, always wearing a bottle of alcohol around his neck (incase needed to use as a bomb) and is always eager to have as much fun as possible and relax as much as possible. Vermin - A big time lieutenant, not a very good fighter but still ready to fight. Fox - Small time soldier, loyale to his gang even though most of them bully him. Ash - Big time soldier, close to lieutenant but shows signs of weakness occasionally. Rembrandt - New soldier, he may be new and weak but hes the best tagger the warriors have at there disposal.And there you have it for the warriors. The story takes them on an adventure across new york because they are framed with the murder of Cyrus. Every gang in the city as well as police are looking for the warriors, making it one hell of a fight to get back. Some die, some get arrested and some fall in love. All in all, if you like action films, if you like gangs and if you like violence in general this is the film for you!",The Warriors
411,imaking750,my opinion,10,11 February 2006,"I've seen the warriors on both formats and i think its good as hell. I've beaten the warriors game that was also great but its kind of sad,after they made the movie i read in the warriors site that Masai died of sickness and Rembrandt died of cancer and some of the others weren't seen again since they made the movie anyway i think that both the versions were excellent and i hear there making a new version of the warriors this 2006 and will be coming to theaters this year I'm looking forward to seeing it they said it wont have any of the original characters and it will be set in California, but if y'all want more info check out the warriors official site.",The Warriors
412,sgarza17,Hardcore Soldiers !!!!!,10,6 March 2006,The Warriors are a real heavy set! You will see by watching this movie. This film is a classic in old school brawling. A tight crew from Brooklyn wants to go all city and to be known. These Coney Island Warriors are looking to gain some heavy rep by breaking anyone who stands in their way. Can you imagine the city of New York having over 200 gangs. One hundred thousand soldiers strong in the city of New York. The Riffs president had a good plan going. The gang members out numbered the police greatly. It turns out it was to good to be true. The meeting goes really bad and the Warriors are blamed for blasting the president of the Riffs. Watch how the Warriors get back to Coney Island in one piece.,The Warriors
