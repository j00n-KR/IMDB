0,MartinHafer,Very good but not as good as its Oscars would imply.,8,17 January 2015,"Charlie (Tom Cruise) has just learned that his estranged father has died. But the biggest surprise comes soon after when he learns that his father's fortune is NOT coming to him and Charlie is NOT the only child in the family. It turns out that he has a much older brother, Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) and the money has been placed in a trust to care for him because he is mentally disabled and dealing with the effects of autism. In a jerky move, Charlie kidnaps his brother and decides he'll care for him until the trustee will agree to give him some of the $3,000,000 fortune. Much of the film is a road trip where the two go cross-country--making money at Vegas and having a laugh or two. However, the ending where Charlie supposedly grew and changed (just a bit) did seem a bit difficult to believe.""Rain Man"" won four Oscars--including one for Best Picture. This would seem to imply that it is an amazingly good film. However, I would argue that the film is actually a very good one but it also appeared during a year in which the competition just wasn't very good. The list of other nominees would include ""The Accidental Tourist"", ""Dangerous Liasons"", ""Working Girl"" and ""Mississippi Burning""--all films that just don't seem particularly Oscar-worthy. The film is interesting and also is a funny look into the awful fashions of the late 1980s. Just don't expect a film that is anything else.",Rain Man
1,TheLittleSongbird,What a brilliant movie!,10,3 October 2010,"I heard a lot about how good this film was, and when I saw it myself I can completely see why. Rain Man is beautifully crafted; funny, moving and startling, sometimes all at once. The cinematography and scenery is beautiful, and the music is effective. The story never loses steam or feels boring, and the script is excellent while Brian Levinson directs absolutely beautifully. The performances from the two leads are brilliant. As fantastic as Dustin Hoffmann is, and he is, his character is one of cinema's greatest triumphs and Hoffmann adeptly is hilarious, unsentimental and completely and utterly believable, that is not to say Tom Cruise should be dismissed, because Cruise is every bit as good as a character whose emotional journey ranges from confused and impatient to understanding and protective. Overall, brilliant film elevated by the two leads and the direction primarily. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Rain Man
2,bkoganbing,The Yuppie And The Savant,10,27 February 2008,"The name of Babbitt has an old but not terribly honored name in American literature. George Babbitt was the creation of Sinclair Lewis as the the self seeking, hard striving archetypal middle class American whose interest is making money above all. If George Babbitt had a grandson he'd be Charlie Babbitt late of Cincinnati, Ohio.As played by Tom Cruise he's a worthy successor to his grandpa. George Babbitt if he were around today would be proud of Charlie. He's a child of the Eighties, looking for paper profits in fast deals. But he's got a cash flow problem. He's on the hook for a pair of expensive Italian Lamberghini sports cars and his customers want either the cars, their money back, or his head.In the midst of these problems comes word that is father who he'd been estranged from for years has died. Back from Los Angeles to Cincinnati goes Tom in the hopes a timely legacy will save his butt. What a shock to find that his father's millions went in trust to an unnamed benefactor and all he got was a used car and rose bushes. But that's not all.The unnamed beneficiary for whom the money is held in trust is Tom's older brother, older by about 15 years who's been institutionalized. He's an autistic, idiot savant, played by Dustin Hoffman. What to do, but break him out of that institution and gain custody of him and his millions.Rain Man's success hinges on the performance of Dustin Hoffman as Raymond (Rain Man) Babbitt and it's the best piece of work Dustin Hoffman ever did on screen. We're told that for someone in his condition, he's pretty far advanced. He can count 246 matches falling out of a matchbox that contains 250 and 4 were left inside. He's memorized Abbott&Costello's Who's On First without any idea of what it means. He sees and memorizes, but can't reason or articulate.But Dustin Hoffman did more with those monotone answers and his own facial expressions in interpreting the role than I think most actors would be capable of. It's a world so different for Hoffman than it is for Cruise and for any of us reading my review. Raymond Babbitt would memorize the words I write and not be capable of knowing their meaning.The film is about the growing relationship of the two brothers, one of whom the other didn't know existed. Hoffman does know about Cruise and there was a reason he was kept apart from him, not a good one to keep him unaware of his existence, but a reason. It's something I won't tell you'll have to see the film to find out.Tom Cruise also does a wonderful job in exploring all the dimensions of Charlie Babbitt. Normally I find it a weakness in a film that secondary characters aren't developed. But in the case of Rain Man it really is all about these two brothers. Rain Man got four Oscars, four big ones, Best Picture, Best Actor for Dustin Hoffman, Best Director for Barry Levinson, and Best Original Screenplay and Story for Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass. All richly deserved.Best scenes in the film when Cruise decides to make use of Hoffman's talents by stopping off in Las Vegas. That has to be seen.You will be moved mightily with one viewing of Rain Man.",Rain Man
3,SnoopyStyle,great performances from Hoffman and Cruise,8,15 May 2015,Charlie Babbit (Tom Cruise) is a self-obsessed hustler selling high-end automobiles. His girlfriend Susanna (Valeria Golino) tries and fails to connect with him. His father dies and leaves him the 1948 Buick Roadmaster convertible. He drove it once without permission at 16 and got thrown in jail for 2 days. The estate in excess of $3 million is left to Raymond Babbitt (Dustin Hoffman) who is an autistic brother unknown to Charlie. Charlie kidnaps Raymond while trying to get his half share of the money.There are two terrific performances. Hoffman's careful dissection of an autistic character is one of the first such performances that I saw. It's the work of a master. Less acknowledged is the callous despicable Charlie character. Tom Cruise is unrelenting. He's the one who has to react to everything that Hoffman throws at him. His character has the growth and the changes. Their interactions are a fascinating watch.,Rain Man
4,Prismark10,Kmart sucks,10,9 April 2019,"I watched Rain Man several times when it was initially released. I recently re-watched it and found it just as entertaining.The movie arrived in 1988 as an event. It had young hot shot Tom Cruise and a committed performance from Dustin Hoffman as an autistic servant. The drummed up publicity expected big box office and Oscars.Cruise plays Charlie Babbit a fast talking salesman who sells high performance cars and his business is about to tank. He is more busy keeping out creditors from his door.When his wealthy father dies all he is left with is a 1948 Buick Roadmaster convertible. Although Charlie was estranged from his father, he is shocked that the bulk of the estate, over $3 million has been placed in trust to care for his older brother Raymond Babbitt (Hoffman.) Shocked because Charlie does not remember having a brother.Ge goes to see Raymond who has been living in an institution for decades. Charlie takes Raymond from the institution in the hope that he can get a share of the inheritance money.The rest of the film is a road movie. Raymond is afraid to fly and Charlie needs to take the back roads to California. Over time he recognises Raymond's conditions as an autistic, his rituals and lack of emotional connection.Raymond's ability with numbers leads to a diversion in Las Vegas where Charlie wins big in Blackjack.As they travel together and slowly bond, Charlie rekindles memories of the rain man. Now realising that this were early childhood memories of his older brother, Raymond before he was institutionalised.Barry Levinson directed Rain Man in a very modern way. It also has an interesting and eclectic soundtrack from Hans Zimmer.The key of the film is the chemistry between Cruise and Hoffman. This was an era where Cruise would normally be paired with an older more experienced named actor such as Hoffman, Newman, Nicholson. He showed he could keep up with them. Charlie gets to grow as a person by the end of the movie. The key is Hoffman's performance. He really inhibits Raymond Babbitt and his world.",Rain Man
5,mark.waltz,The innocent mind of a child combined with the brain of a genius.,10,12 January 2015,"There's been a misguided belief in movie fans that to win an Oscar, your chances will increase if you're playing somebody with a mental or physical handicap. That certainly is true as evidenced by the number of people who have won for playing disabled characters, but there certainly have been a ton of actors who didn't get a nomination for playing such roles. In the case of Dustin Hoffman as the unknown older brother to Tom Cruise, it is obvious as to why he won, and that is the fact that his second Oscar win came for one of the single best film performances ever put onto film.Tom Cruise's Charlie Babbitt is a total selfish S.O.B. who is surprised by finding out that his late father left his estate to an unknown person and only left him an expensive antique sport scar which had been the cause of their rift years before. Investigating the beneficiary, Cruise ventures to a hospital for the handicapped where he encounters Raymond (Hoffman), an autistic man who recognizes the car which forces the hospital's administrator to reveal that indeed, Raymond is the older brother Cruise never knew he had, only having encountered him in what he felt was a childhood dream as ""rain man"".While Charlie remains a very selfish character, his motivations change as he gets to know his brother, going from wanting to get control of the estate (to save his failing sport scar business) to getting custody of Raymond. But no matter his intentions of wanting to get to know his brother, the question arises as to if a mentally handicapped man like Hoffman's Raymond can make it in society even surrounded by the best that money has to offer. Fortunately, the selfish Charlie has a very wise girlfriend (Valeria Golino) who pushes him to try to get to know his brother in the first place, and this opens up the possibility that there is a chance that Charlie will learn that the world doesn't just focus on him and his needs and that there is certainly something more important in life than just making a name for yourself in business to prove to a dead man (the unseen father whom he resents even after death) that you can make it without him.While Cruise gives an honorable performance, his character is certainly too smarmy to really totally like. It's Hoffman who wins praise here hands down, giving a detailed nuance to everything that Raymond does. When actors do win Oscars for playing characters like this or with other handicapped (such as Cliff Robertson for ""Charly"" and Daniel Day Lewis for ""My Left Foot""), it is because there is more than just an element of reality to their characterizations. They win Oscars for these performances because they show the average movie goer what these characters are really like. It asks the question, ""What really is the definition of being handicapped?"" and explodes open our view of the world past what we simply only see on the surface.",Rain Man
6,classicsoncall,"""I like having you for my big brother.""",8,21 February 2018,"This picture cracks me up every time I watch it. The toothpick scene in the diner is simply classic to me, topped off by that 'four left in the box' admission by the waitress.""I've got Jeopardy at five o'clock"" would have been my summary line under normal circumstances for this film, but this wasn't an ordinary movie. When Charlie Babbit (Tom Cruise) proclaims that he likes having Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) as his big brother, it was the completion of a transformation that gradually occurred over the course of the story. Cruise's character starts out in the story as a scheming, money worshiping egomaniac, and is subtly moved to accept and love an autistic brother he never knew he had. One probably has to suspend some disbelief over that circumstance, but the way it's explained in the story makes the idea at least somewhat plausible. The revelation of Raymond as the 'Rain Man' is one of the movie's great creative touches.I know this, I would love to have been on the set while this picture was filming, just to see what outtakes never made it into the picture because of Hoffman's unique ability to portray the type of character Raymond was. But even better, I would have enjoyed seeing Hoffman stay in character off set to bedevil his co-star with repeated clueless observations that would have driven Tom Cruise crazy for real. Can you just picture it? ""I've got Jeopardy at five o'clock"".",Rain Man
7,gavin6942,Classic Hoffman,8,28 January 2015,"Selfish yuppie Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise)'s father left a fortune to his savant brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) and a pittance to Charlie; they travel cross-country.This is a film that is not only brilliant for its script, not only prescient for its addressing autism before people knew what it was, but just a perfect example of casting. Hoffman is a strong actor and really shows it here. Cruise, not quite as strong, fits in perfectly as the pompous, well-coiffed 1980s capitalist.If you want to talk about modern classics, you want to talk about ""Rain Man"". Few films hold up as well as this one does. But then, there is just something about the 1980s that seems utterly timeless.",Rain Man
8,lee_eisenberg,"Good, but the best movie of 1988?",7,15 May 2006,"Personally, I don't know whether I would have given ""Rain Man"" Best Picture for 1988. It was a good movie, but I don't think the best one from that year (I would give that distinction to ""A World Apart""). The plot of course has yuppie Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) meeting his autistic brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) and taking him on a trip across the country. Over the course of the movie, we see how Raymond's autism affects him and his surroundings, but also makes him able to do really hard math problems (granted, the numbers mean nothing to him).All in all, this is a pretty well done movie. Maybe not a masterpiece or anything, but worth seeing nonetheless as a look into a certain part of society.",Rain Man
9,jboothmillard,Rain Man,10,4 July 2005,"From Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated director Barry Levinson (Good Morning, Vietnam), this is an excellent road movie and drama film. Basically selfish hustler Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) has found out his father, who threw him out as a teenager, has died. He has only left him an antique convertible, and everything else is going to the older brother he never knew he had. His brother, Raymond (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Dustin Hoffman) is an autistic man (with Asperger's Disorder/Sydrome), and he has no knowledge with the concept of money. Charlie is very displeased with no fortune, and a brother his father never told him of, so he decides to ""kidnap"" Raymond. But Raymond is too scared to fly, apart from Qantas, so they start a long road trip. Along the way Charlie does have his rages at Raymond, but at one point he discovers that he is a friend he thought was imaginary in childhood, the Rain Man, and that he can calculate complicated mathematical problems in his head with great speed and accuracy, he starts to have real affection for his brother. The best scenes are the gambling (poker) spree, and those where Raymond and Charlie get on well, the ending of course when Raymond goes back with the carers or whatever is quite emotional. I can have some understanding of the character of Raymond (not in exactly the same way), because I myself have Asperger's Syndrome. Cruise is terrific as the suffering and later loving brother, Hoffman is not only admirable, but he is sympathetic when he is terrified and slapping himself, but also sometimes funny (I admit that) with his talking to himself and genius, it is just a great film. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Music for Hans Zimmer, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Tom Cruise was number 32, and Dustin Hoffman number 24 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Cruise was also number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Hoffman was number 21 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 63 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Outstanding!",Rain Man
10,ccthemovieman-1,Cruise's Abrasive Character Ruins This For Me,6,13 November 2006,"Once again, here's a film I liked a lot on the first viewing, but less and less on subsequent ones and finally calling it quits after the third look. By then, Tom Cruise's character ""Charlie Babbitt"" was too much to take. It wasn't entertainment to listen and see his profane, arrogant, mean-spirited character. Yeah, he comes around to some decency in the end but it's too little-too late for me.Dustin Hoffman, of course, gained a lot of recognition for his idiot-savant role of Cruise's brother ""Raymond Babbitt."" It's tough to root against a mentally- disabled person, even if he's math wizard.As interesting a story as this is, and as is Hoffman's acting and character, Cruise ruins this film for me. For others who wouldn't be offended, I highly recommend the movie as it's an involving story and Hoffman's performance alone is worth the rental.",Rain Man
11,rmax304823,Funny and Sentimental.,7,17 May 2012,"There's nothing much new in the movies about photographic memories. We've seen them in ""It's Always Fair Weather"" and ""Operation Madball,"" among others. It all depends on the use to which they're put, and ""Rain Man"" puts a photographic memory to pretty good use.Tom Cruise is a selfish expensive Los Angeles car dealer who is in a financial hole. He doesn't blink when his estranged millionaire father dies back in Cincinnati. He blinks when he discovers that he's inherited nothing but an old specimen of a Buick convertible and some rose bushes, the remainder of the fortune being put in a trust for the autistic brother, Dustin Hoffman, that Cruise never knew he'd had.Hoffman is sequestered in a local institution where he's safe. Cruise, determined to somehow get his hands on all that moolah, kidnaps Hoffman and drives him across the country in that Buick, accompanied by Cruise's girl friend, Valeria Golino.It becomes a mismatched buddy comedy. Hoffman is a pain in the neck, always talking to himself, demanding his obsessions be met regarding food, clothing, and scheduling. Hoffman can't stand to be touched and is unable to look anyone directly in the eye. If Cruise were capable of feeling shame, he'd be ashamed to take Hoffman out in public, but in fact Cruise is so shallow that all he feels is irritation and anger. Golino is so disgusted by Cruise's self absorption that she leaves him flat somewhere along the secondary roads, leaving us with two very self-aborbed men.Things pick up when Cruise realizes that Hoffman is not a garden variety autistic but a savant. He has an extraordinary memory for details. He memorizes half a phone book in a few hours. He can remember anything, as few people can and few autistics. Eidetic imagery, the fancy name for photographic memory, is real enough. You can show somebody a comb for a few seconds and he can tell you how many teeth there are. But it's most common in children and fades with age. At any rate, Cruise forgets all about memorizing phone books and teaches Hoffman how to count cards at a Las Vegas casino. They make more than eighty large before being thrown out of town -- enough to save Cruise's big car business.A movie like this, with two people who are alien to one another but are thrown together by circumstances, has to be handled delicately because everyone already knows that, by the end, the two of them will have bonded emotionally. In a movie like ""Groundhog Day,"" Bill Murray's conversion to humanity is done very well indeed. Here, the transition is a bit contrived. What apparently landed Hoffman in the institution was that he was handling Cruise as a baby and accidentally dropped him in a tub of hot water. This is supposed to be a Big Reveal and our eyes are supposed to tear up. And at the final conference, which will determine Hoffman's fate, the two brothers are left alone for a few minutes and Hoffman leans his head against Cruise's and -- sob. The scene is meaningful in the worst sense. Fortunately, it doesn't end with Hoffman's being ""cured"" and dancing in the streets. Instead he's packed off back to the farm where Cruise promises to visit him. That's a mature sort of ending.Hoffman evidently put a lot of effort into learning how to act like an autistic and it pays off. Cruise is lightweight, adequate, and handsome. The Italian inflections that inform Golino's speech are exquisite. It's like listening to an Italian movie in which the phonemes almost accidentally form English words.I hope the movie doesn't leave anyone with the impression that autistics are all savants because it's far from the truth. Nobody knows what causes it but it's present at birth. An autistic baby is quiet and doesn't care if you pick him up and hug him or not. They're fascinated by glittering objects. (Hoffman says of a Vegas hooker, ""She sparkles."") They tend to repeat rhythmic movements such as banging their heads lightly against the wall. And autism is at one end of a continuum, while at the other end is childhood schizophrenia. It's a curious disorder. Experienced observers comment that when you look at the eyes of an autistic child, though they don't respond to anything you do, you just KNOW there's intelligence there.",Rain Man
12,paul_haakonsen,Definitely worth watching. Definitely. Yeah...,7,23 July 2017,"""Rain Man"" is definitely one of the classics from the late 1980s. It is one of those movies that just pops out instantly when you talk movies from the 1980s.The storyline in ""Rain Man"", briefly summarized, is about an L.A. hustler named Charlie Babbitt (played by Tom Cruise) whose father dies and leaves him an old car and rose bushes in his last will and testimony. Charlie learns that 3 million dollars go to a trust fund issued out to an unnamed recipient. Charlie delves into the matter as he wants his share of the inheritance and come to learn that he has an autistic brother named Raymond Babbitt (played by Dustin Hoffman) who lives at the Walbrook institution. Charlie ""kidnaps"" his own brother and travel across the country. It turns out that Charlie gets more than he bargained for on this journey.Now, it is a combination of a fantastic story written by Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass, along with director Barry Levinson's vision, and the acting performances in the movie that makes this such an outstanding, memorable and beautiful movie.""Rain Man"" does indeed have a good cast ensemble, and it is of course both Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman that are the main attractions here. But this is without a doubt Dustin Hoffman's movie, because his performance as the autistic Raymond is just phenomenal. He is so convincing and his performance just has so much spirit and research put into it.This is without a doubt a very compelling and beautiful movie, and it is a story that sinks right in and sticks with you. And it is also the type of movie that you can watch over and over, albeit with some time passing in between each viewing, mind you.Personally I can't claim to be much of a fan of the ending, because it seems so very abrupt, and it doesn't really manage to bring a fulfilling closing to an otherwise heartfelt and warm story.",Rain Man
13,edwagreen,"""Rain Man"" Autism Speaks Out ***1/2",9,5 February 2006,"Dustin Hoffman, in a truly brilliant performance, as an autistic person, shut out of family life by his father. We must remember that Hoffman was classified as high functional. It would have been nearly impossible to make this film if that type of function were not there.It is only with the death of his father that the normal son, Tom Cruise, learns of the brother he never knew.Hoffman is totally believable as the victim of autism. We see and feel his very struggle.Cruise seems to be another hot-shot performance who is deeply affected and toned down when he meets his brother. The hot-shot tones down as he learns more about life itself when he begins to interact with his handicapped brother. Cruise also gave a phenomenal performance and should have also been Oscar nominated. Didn't anyone see any resemblance in the fine performance that Hoffman gave with his 1967 break-through performance in ""The Graduate?"" In both films Hoffman displayed a rare vulnerability. In both films he struggled to come out of a life of being withdrawn.We view the autistic as not the hopeless or seemingly retarded, which society has viewed them.A film of the heart, richly brought out by the superior acting of Oscar winner Hoffman. A remarkable journey of a young man who wants to cope in a world that has shut him out.",Rain Man
14,michaelRokeefe,Barry Levinson directs a masterpiece. Greed or family?,8,2 May 2000,"Well acted. Well written. One of my favorites. A greedy young hustler (Tom Cruise) seeks to reunite with his brother played by Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman's character is an idiot savant and has just inherited the bulk of their father's estate. Cruise takes Hoffman out of the asylum and back into the mainstream hoping to talk him out of his share of the inheritance.

15,sunwarrior13,Great Acting Performance By Dustin Hoffman,10,7 October 2011,"Rain Man tells a story of a self-centered Los Angeles-based automobile dealer named Charles Sanford Babbit,simply known as Charlie,who is at conflicted with his own life. As a young teenager,he used his father's Buick convertible without permission and as a result, he went to jail for two days.One day,Charlie learns that his estranged father died and left him from his last will and testament a huge bed of roses and the convertible. While the remainder will of $3 Million goes into a trust fund to be going to someone. He was extremely angry by this and decides to look into this matter further.Apparently,the recipient happens to be Raymond, his brother. He has no knowledge of him since his older brother happens to be an autistic that resides at the Walbrook Institute. Charlie takes Raymond and decides to take him on a lust for life trip to the west coast as a threat to get his share of the inheritance. But during this road trip to Los Angeles,Charlie learns about Raymond's autism, which he initially believes is curable — resulting in his frequent frustration with his brother's antics. He also learns about how his brother came to be separated from his family, as a result of an accident when he was a baby. Raymond also sings ""I Saw Her Standing There"" by The Beatles like he did when Charlie was young, prompting him to realize that his older brother is the protective figure from his childhood, whom he falsely remembered as an imaginary friend named ""Rain Man."" Charlie proves to be sometimes shallow and exploitative, as when he learns that Raymond has an excellent memory and takes him to Las Vegas to win money at blackjack by counting cards. However, towards the end of their trip Charlie finds himself becoming protective of Raymond, and grows to truly love him. Eventually,he has gained a new brother and mellowed his materialistic attitude as he develops a new relationship with his brother.It is a classic movie due to Dustin Hoffman's performance alone as the autistic Raymond Babbit. I have never seen someone who portrayed a character with all honesty and accuracy. Also commendable is the chemistry between Hoffman and Tom Cruise as Charlie Babbit.Watch this movie for this reason alone.Also,it deals with the theme of a relationship between brothers and of people suffering from autism.This seemingly ordinary film as most part of it is a conversation in road trip between Charlie and Raymond presents more than what is actually does for it is truly a heartwarming film.A 10/10 rating is only justifiable. Highly recommended.Definitely,one of the best movies during the 80's.",Rain Man

17,hitchcockthelegend,My main man Charlie Babbitt.,10,4 March 2008,"It is something of a great cinematic achievement that Rain Man became the great film it clearly is because the story surrounding it is interestingly Hollywood in itself.Four directors, six screenwriters, two cinematographers, eight producers, writers strikes, crew change, and a studio fighting for its life.All of the above are common knowledge but it doesn't hurt to remember these facts when viewing the award wining triumph of a movie that stands the test of time today. The film is so simple in structure it really needed something special to pull it out of the prospective banality of being ""just another road movie about finding oneself"", Rain Man achieves something special by tackling its subjects with very sensitive hands and splicing a believable human concept into the story via the incredible shows from its two leading men.Dustin Hoffman gives a magical moving performance as the Autistic Savant Raymond, the ultimate complement I can pay the performance is that it really is believable, both moving and clever rolled into one artistic result. Tom Cruise is equally as great in a role that called for drastic layer changes, a role that demanded much conviction from the actor taking it on, and Cruise gives the role much depth as he goes from shallow bastard to a very emotive and feeling human being, it's a great show that stands up to reevaluation these days. A performance that seems to have sadly been forgotten in light of Hoffman's film stealing show. With a film such as this you pray that the ending can do it justice, and I'm glad to say that there is no pandering here, it's an ending that says so much because it doesn't cop out, I thank god for those rewrites because the endings to the original scripts would of had me booting the TV set out of the window.Essential cinema. 10/10",Rain Man

I knew exactly where this was going and how it was going to end...BUT that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It's well-directed by Barry Levinson with a well-written (if predictable) script. Also Tom Cruise was actually very good--I usually hate the guy but I admit he did good in his role. But Hoffman is the whole movie. From what I heard he played the role exactly as it should be done (he spent months with autistic patients and families of them). He stutters and sprouts facts off non-stop. Hoffman is clearly enjoying himself. Valeria Golino is around as Cruise's girlfriend. She's given little to do unfortunately. Also this movie does not need to go on past two hours.Still this is a GOOD little film.

The transformation of Charlie, the way the two brothers grow closer to each other, the adventures and the humour make this a sweet, engaging story. Throw in the excellent performance of Dustin Hoffman (for which he received an Oscar) and you have a movie well worth watching.While he didn't get an Oscar nomination, Tom Cruise does well as Charlie.

21,evanston_dad,Road Trippin' with Hoffman and Cruise,7,27 July 2008,"Barry Levinson mostly resists the urge to give in to the rampant sentimentality that this story begs for, but the end result is still rather treacly and weepy.Tom Cruise plays a selfish hot head who ends up having to care for his autistic brother (Dustin Hoffman). It's a road trip movie, the kind where you just know Cruise is going to discover all sorts of goodness about himself before it's all over; meanwhile, Hoffman acts up a storm, delivering the kind of performance that wins awards left and right (which is what happened). I don't mind this movie, but something about it just feels soft and gauzy, like all of Levinson's films. It's got no TEETH.Grade: B+",Rain Man
22,AaronCapenBanner,Raymond,8,6 December 2013,"Barry Levinson directed this Academy Award winning(best picture and director) film that stars Tom Cruise as Charlie Babbitt, a selfish car salesman who one day learns that his estranged father has died, though he has left the bulk of his estate to Raymond Babbitt(played by Dustin Hoffman, who won a best actor Academy Award) the brother he didn't know he had, and who is also Autistic. Enraged at only inheriting rose bushes and an old car, Charlie goes to the Walbrook Institute, where Raymond lives, and proceeds to take Raymond with him on a cross-country journey, though he'll have to do it by car, since Raymond has a fit at the airport, but as time passes, Charlie starts to bond with his newly discovered brother, and his selfish attitude changes... Superb performances by the two leads, especially Hoffman, who is entirely believable in a difficult role, and the direction and script are first rate as well, largely avoiding clichés, though it does go on a bit too long.",Rain Man
23,FlashCallahan,This is definitely not my room.....,9,7 June 2015,"Charlie Babbit is a hustler. He's been on his own long enough to know how to work people and situations. He finds that the father who threw him out as a teenager has died, and left him an antique convertible and something more important, a previously unknown brother, Raymond. Raymond is autistic, but is able to calculate complicated mathematical problems in his head with great speed and accuracy. Their father has left his fortune to Raymond who doesn't even understand the concept of money. Charlie is enraged by what has happened and by his father keeping Raymond's existence from him for his entire life. He kidnaps Raymond from his residential home, and the two begin a long road trip that will lead them to an understanding of each other.....After the behemoth that was Top Gun, Cruise could have easily gone to do the huge blockbusters that he is known for today. But instead, he decided to dial it down for a few movies, thus giving us some of his greatest performances.And this has to be up there with his greatest performances of all time, because the moment we meet Charlie, we instantly have a huge dislike to his character, thanks to his abhorrent, selfish behaviour, and yuppy tendencies.It's clear that he has a chip on his shoulder from what his father did to him all those years ago, and in turns has made him a selfish individual. But as the film progresses, and learning from Raymond that material things do not make the man, Charlie begins to appreciate his brother, rather than the legacy that he has bequeathed.Hoffman as expected, is the heart of the narrative, and his depiction of autism is one of the most gentle, respectful, and genuine performances I've ever seen of a condition I've ever seen on screen, and he truly deserved every accolade he received for this film.The film is very funny in places, and heartbreaking in others, and the cinematography, especially during the road scenes, and the beautiful dance sequence, is jaw dropping.A beautiful film about leaving your pseudo life behind you and forgiving your past, and finding your future.",Rain Man
24,Aaron1375,Hoffman is excellent in this movie. Good humor and good drama too.,9,7 April 2010,"This film probably ranks as my favorite movie that Tom Cruise is in, but I give most of the credit to Dustin Hoffman for making this movie so entertaining. The film follows this dude whose business is in bit of a financial mess. He is estranged from his father and now his father has passed away having left all his fortune to someone other than his son. Well the son ends up finding out that he has a brother and takes this brother on a cross country trip, at first to try to get some of the money. His new brother is autistic so there is a lot of outbursts from the younger sibling as he just does not know how to cope with the older brother's mental condition. However, over time he begins to get closer to this new brother and he actually wishes to take care of his older sibling, not for the money, but because he begins to actually care for him. The movie is really good and I love the interplay between Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman is excellent at playing a person with autism, you can understand why Tom Cruise's character gets so annoyed as he is not used to dealing with this condition. I also enjoy road trip movies like this one too. Nothing like hitting the open road with characters that are rather different and such. The humor is great as I loved the underwear part and I loved how Tom Cruise's character fixed the problem of there not being the right amount of fish sticks. Simply a really enjoyable movie.",Rain Man
25,Wuchakk,"Road movie with Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman as brothers, the latter autistic",7,30 August 2016,"Released in 1988 and directed by Barry Levinson, ""Rain Man"" is a drama starring Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman as brothers who meet for the first time, the latter being autistic. As they travel across the country from Cincinnati to Los Angeles they have many misadventures wherein the spoiled rich Charlie (Cruise) gets to know Raymond (Hoffman) and ultimately has an epiphany. Valeria Golino is on hand as Charlie's babe.""Rain Man"" is a road movie and it's solidly entertaining, albeit overrated in some circles. The score by Hans Zimmer is fitting, but decidedly 80s. The tie-in to Charlie's imaginary friend from his childhood is effective. Both Cruise and Hoffman deliver quality performances wherein you forget you're watching a movie and buy into the characters & their story, which is a sign of a good drama, although Raymond can be irritating or frustrating to watch at times.The film runs 133 minutes and was shot in Cincinnati &East Walnut Hills, Ohio; Kentucky; Indiana; Oklahoma; Las Vegas; and Los Angeles, California.GRADE: B",Rain Man

Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as autistic Raymond Babbitt who was kept away from his younger brother, Charlie, played brilliantly by Tom Cruise. The film is about the brothers who travel to Los Angeles from Ohio and how they bond over the journey despite Raymond's complete need for structure including a schedule including People's Court, The Price is Right, and his genius for numbers which gives his younger brother a better idea. I don't know much about autism so I'm not going to criticize Hoffman's portrayal which has been joked around a bit much like the repetition of his speech. The film won Best Picture at the Academy Awards along with director Barry Levinson and Dustin Hoffman for his second Best Actor Oscar. I still think the film's superior but I'm not crazy about it.",Rain Man
27,deloudelouvain,Oscar worthy movie.,8,1 March 2019,"Rain Man is a worthy winner for the Best Picture award of 1989. All of the four Oscars are logic and well deserved. Dustin Hoffman for the Best Actor In A Leading Role did a great job playing Raymond Babbitt, a highly skilled autist. But not only Dustin Hoffman gave us an exceptional performance, as the young Tom Cruise played one of his best characters as thus far. The subject of the movie, autism and how to cope and live with it, isn't the easiest subject as there are alot of forms and degrees of autism. It's not always like this movie portrays, someone with exceptional skills, as most of the times it's quite the opposite. But in the case of Rain Man, it's a beautiful story about more than just autism, certainly one of the better movies of that year.",Rain Man
28,Mr-Fusion,Deserves the praise,8,23 August 2017,"""Rain Man"" isn't hard to figure out. You get a pretty good idea how self-centered Charlie Babbitt (Cruise) is from minute one and you just know a transformation will take place. It's easy to say Dustin Hoffman is a phenomenal actor, and equally easy to see him effortlessly play autistic; but Cruise's performance is also eye-opening. And you've gotta give him credit for going toe-to-toe with a legend (and holding his own). I get what the fuss is about. This is funny, moving, devastating, but it's also very adult. Charlie's interactions with his brother are often tense, and the connection that's eventually made is hard-won. And also natural. I can never really say if a movie should've gotten that Best Picture trophy, but this is a great one nonetheless. 8/10",Rain Man

They both learn how to live with each other and eventually learn to love each other. As for a best picture, I wasn't too sure. But the actors will impress you. I would recommend this movie to anyone.

30,MovieAddict2016,"Why has it become ""cool"" to hate this film?",10,23 November 2005,"Barry Levinson is one of the great screen directors of our time. He's most notable for being able to evoke subtly comedic discussions amongst his leading characters, save the rare occasion when his strained efforts backfire (""Toys"" comes to mind). ""Rain Man"" (1988) is his crowning effort, his best achievement I can think of off-hand. It's considered a drama but it's also a true odd couple comedy, about two opposites who learn they have one common bond: their kinship.The Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt, a wealthy car dealer living the high life in California. He's just gotten in a shipment of Ferraris and he's going to make a killing on an upcoming deal for all of them, when his entire background comes back to haunt him in a single unfortunate moment during his newly acquired and quite happy life.Charlie's father has just died, leaving him an old sports car and rose bushes. But more painful than the fact that his father has died or that he was left simply with a car and some prize-winning rosebushes is the fact that Charlie had tried to put his ill-fated past behind him, and now it has caught up with him again. He has to face the reality of his father once again.This isn't really evident the first time you watch the movie. Charlie is angered at the fact that he got nothing more than some bushes and a vehicle, sure, but he admits he expected nothing more. What really angers him is that he has to face his father, dead or alive, once more; either through faded memories or by the realization that he is now dead and their friendship was never repaired.When Charlie finds out that his father's entire estate has been left to a single trustee, he schemes around and unmasks who the trustee really is -- his older brother he never knew he had, Raymond Babbitt (Hoffman), who lives in a homey mental institute and quotes the Bud Abbott and Lou Costello ""Who's on first?"" charade when he gets nervous.Charlie confronts his brother, who seems as though he doesn't recognize him. And in a moment of weakness, Charlie kidnaps his brother from his home, drives him back to California, and attempts to squeeze the money out of Raymond, who has no holding on the concept of money at all.Despite his lack of understanding regarding monetary value, Raymond is an idiot savant, and Charlie takes advantage of Raymond's mathematical skills by taking him to Las Vegas to count cards. After achieving a fortune they are thrown out of the casinos and left to face charges of kidnapping. The problem is, by the time it's all over, Charlie has formed an odd sort of bond with his brother. Long after the laughs settle the emotional impact of the story sinks in.The ending is the sort of rare conclusion that brings tears to the eyes. Throughout the film, Charlie is an arrogant, ignorant, greedy businessman who cares of no one but himself. By the end, however, he has learned more than he has in his entire lifetime from the brother he never had. And unlike a lot of the buddy films out there, we get to see the bonding between Charlie and his big brother, Raymond, form on a daily basis, until it is brought to a standstill.Dustin Hoffman gives his best performance in ""Rain Man,"" one of such unmatched strength and brilliance that we often feel that we are really watching an autistic man on screen. Raymond Babbitt is one of the most memorable characters you will ever encounter as a viewer, and though Dustin Hoffman isn't necessarily a favorite actor of mine, I place his performance in ""Rain Man"" as one of the most convincing and touching performances of all time.Trying to put the reason that ""Rain Man"" is so great into words is simply impossible. It's got everything. And as humorous as Raymond Babbitt becomes, he never seems unreal or obnoxious. As I watch him every time I watch the movie, I completely forget Dustin Hoffman is playing him until I mentally remark on how well he is doing so. This is movie magic, folks.Hollywood has a fascination with characters like Forrest Gump and Raymond Babbitt, but -- even more so than Gump -- Raymond is never annoying. (That's not saying that Gump is, but...Raymond is even more touching and realistic.) Raymond is a fair bit more impaired than Forrest, and we feel for him even more (though which is the better film I could never say).By all means, see this movie. Drop whatever you're doing and rent it, buy it, watch it over and over. It's amazing. I don't care if I sound like a mainstream critic trying to get my quotes on the new Special Edition box of the DVD (yes, please!), I love this movie and I can't say enough good things about it.",Rain Man

I've always considered Tom Cruise to be a bit over-rated as an actor but as Charlie Babbitt he really was very good. Charlie is an angry man, whose business is in trouble and who discovers, when his father dies, that he's been denied the $3 million inheritance he thought should have been his. Even more surprising to him, he discovers that he has an autistic brother he had never been told about. Thinking that Raymond was the key to the inheritance, he essentially kidnaps him from an institution and then tries to ransom him, for lack of a better word, asking for $1.5 million to send him back. A funny thing happened, though. Charlie and Raymond began to develop a relationship with each other. The key to this movie, as good as Cruise was, was Dustin Hoffman's unbelievably believable portrayal of the autistic Raymond. He nailed everything perfectly, from Raymond's obsessiveness, to his emotional outbursts to his childlike innocence. Everything in Hoffman's performance was perfect.The superb performances were essential to making this work, because I must say that I didn't find the story to be overly compelling. Parts of it were interesting, while parts of it were also rather silly and unnecessary - the dance and kiss scene between Raymond and Susanna in the elevator jumps to mind as one example. It was hard to nail exactly where Charlie's feelings for Raymond began to change, although the final handful of scenes display the growing bond between the two perfectly. If you like really good performances, this has them in abundance, along with a story that, while not riveting, is good enough. 7/10",Rain Man
35,Robert_duder,One of the amazing eighties classics,8,5 July 2005,"Rainman is the quintessential eighties film. First Tom Cruise, second loads of bad language, third hot eighties chick, fourth a renowned and respected actor and fifth...a crazy road trip. It's fun, but never much of a comedy, it's actually more sad and dramatic and pulls the heart strings in such a big way. The biggest way and reason that happens I think is Dustin Hoffman's performance.Rainman is the story of a self centered, quick talking car dealer who's father dies. He hasn't spoken to his father in years and goes to the funeral mostly to find out what is becoming of his father's fortune. Instead Charlie is left his father's car, nothing else. The rest of his father's estate is mysteriously left to some unknown recipient. Charlie is furious, especially considering his business is on the brink of closure and he needs money. Through some investigating he discovers that his father's money has been left in the car of a doctor at an institution. He then discovers that in that institution is an older brother he never knew he had...Raymond. Charlie is determined to get that money and takes Raymond into his custody without asking and wants to take him back to L.A. in hopes that he can get permanent custody and therefore the inheritance. Raymond refuses to fly so Charlie and Raymond are forced to take a road trip across the country. As they go Charlie gets to know his brother and by the end of the trip the only thing that matters is his brother's well being.Tom Cruise does a decent job as Charlie Babbitt. It's not an unfamiliar role to him but he still plays it well. The supporting cast is just equally okay, nothing mind blowing but they aren't given a lot of lines or place in the film. Instead this film is entirely about what the title suggests Rainman (a name Charlie came up with as a child because he couldn't say Raymond.) Dustin Hoffman is brilliant in one of his greatest roles. He creates such an emotional character that we all fall in love with Raymond, we all want him protected. He's brilliant and has this talent with numbers and yet is so emotionally withdrawn he can't show any real emotion which is heart breaking for both the audience and Cruises' character. Despite the film being an intense drama, there are some genuinely funny moments that are classic. Teaching Raymond to dance, and just even the dialog between the two brothers. This is just one of those movies that everyone has to see at least once. It's touching and Dustin Hoffman is truly amazing. The only downfall to the film is the ending which although made sense it just didn't seem to wrap things up as well as I would have liked. Anyone who loves movies has to see Rainman. 8/10",Rain Man
36,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Moving and inspirational, if a little too personal to me",9,18 November 2008,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Arrogant, self centred Los Angeles car salesman Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) learns that his father, with whom he parted on bad terms, has died. Even more shockingly, he learns he has left him not a penny in his will but instead to a much older brother he never knew he had. And even more shockingly, his long lost brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) is an autistic savant who has lived in care all his adult life. Determined to get his greedy mits on his father's cash, Charlie travels to the care home and kidnaps Raymond, unaware of how Raymond's eccentric rituals, from only buying his underwear from K Mart in Cincinnatti, to insisting on watching People's Court at a certain time, to only flying on QUANTAS air flights because 'they're the only one that's never crashed', will drive him to the brink of insanity. But being in charge of something so vulnerable eventually melts even rude Charlie's heart, and as they begin the cross country drive back to LA, including a stop over in Las Vegas where Charlie uses Ray's memory to work wonders at the Roulette table, they form a bond that changes both their lives forever.With the film adaptation of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time now apparently abandoned?!?, it falls on the most memorable film to deal with autism for me to make an announcement. I myself have a mild form of autism, in the shape of Asperger's Syndrome, that I have known about from the age of twelve. In the plot summary section, it states this is what Raymond has in the film, but as others have commented and I concur, he is severely autistic, not an 'aspie.' I cannot professionally diagnose anyone, but I think I've come to know enough to be able to say what is what in this sense. Just clearing that up, then.Aside from a stirring, well developed story, what's got to carry the film is the performances from the two leading men. They are, of course, both brilliant. Hoffman deserves praise for his leading role, but even taking into account the incorrect description of his character on the PS, his role does seem a little corny now. Despite using his method acting technique, hanging around with autistic people and studying their mannerisms and behaviours and as well as the film makers having the consultation of six behavioural psychologists on the condition, as others have stated, with what's now known about autism since the film came out twenty years ago, his behaviour is a little too simplistic and straight forward. Suffering mildly from the condition myself, I'd have to go with this. The real surprise performance is from Cruise, though. In earlier films like this, before his name became synonymous with being a 'big movie star', I guess he showed he could handle serious roles that required more depth and heart. Praise too for Valeria Golino as his girlfriend, who tries to get him to see how he uses people and tries to get the best side out of him.This was an inspired and original film when it first came out and has remained so till today. Barry Levinson has crafted a moving and gentle piece that moves at the right pace and surprises the viewer in different and exciting ways. ****",Rain Man
37,ElMaruecan82,"An important lesson of empathy, humility and generosity ...",8,25 September 2012,"Any movie fan remembers the iconic line from ""Cool Hand Luke"": ""what we've got here is failure to communicate"". I believe a similar diagnosis can be made about the two lead characters of ""Rain Man"", Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) because he's autistic, and his brother Charlie, 25 years younger, because he's a young yuppie blinded by his own ego. Both live in their world, both are their own referential; naturally, they're put in a situation where they have to interact. ""Rain Man"" features one of the most intriguing premises of the 80's, and although the film never strikes as a 'masterpiece', not even in style, it does deliver the emotional pay-off we all expect without recycling old archetypes or falling into sentimental trap.Should I describe Raymond Babbit's condition? Those who know already have in mind his mimics, head-banging, 'uh-oh', his addictions to such TV programs as ""Judge Wapner"" and ""The Wheel of Fortune"" and his perfect recitation of Abbots and Costello's 'Who's on first' routine when he's uncomfortable. And to those who haven't, it's enough saying that Dustin Hoffman surpasses himself, if it ever was possible after performances of the caliber of ""Tootsie"" or ""Midnight Cowboy"". He's unbelievably convincing, capable to transcend the limits of acting. To win an Oscar for a rather one-note character is an exploit even more impressive because Hoffman manages to pull some human complexity in Raymond, making him absolutely endearing and adorable yet frustrating and scary. Raymond is a character we want to love without turning it into pity.On the other hand, his brother Charlie is the total counterpart, young, handsome, he's a self-made man who exploited a passion for cars to sell imported vehicles. Even his girlfriend, played by the beautiful Valeria Golino is Italian, like a foreign beautiful possession, a trophy that elevates him above the others. Charlie Babbit is a character who flirts with the archetype of the young and arrogant go-getter, a role tailor-made for an actor like Tom Cruise, especially in the 80's. The talent of Cruise consists on making his character unlovable enough to laugh at his misfortunes with Raymond, but human enough to feel sad for him when he learns about his father's death, and much more, when he learns that he didn't get one cent from him, while he was full of debts. Charlie is a character we want to hate but end up giving him the benefit of the doubt.And Charlie is so blinded by his financial problems that he's incapable to care for Raymond and take his medical condition into consideration; all he sees in him is the guy who inherited three millions from his father. At this point, I suspect the screenwriter immediately thought 'hey, in fact, Raymond is medically autistic, while Charlie is symbolically autistic; let's see if the viewers will figure that'. I don't think it takes a degree in psychoanalysis to jump to that conclusion. Anyone would see the kidnapping of Raymond coming. Naturally, the girlfriend leave them to let the adventure begin between the two brothers and both would learn how to communicate  not. This is where the odd-couple/road movie formula stops. The strength of ""Rain Man"" is to never make Raymond change, no miracle cure, no sudden change of behavior, if there is one who's up to change, it's Charlie. And he must change, otherwise, the whole premise of the film is pointless.The quality of Barry Levinson's film is to make a predictable turn of events work remaining believable, it also grabs our interest without an abundance of spectacular scenes, or overused emotion. It's always interesting to see a character with leadership quality, handsome and somewhat charismatic, pushed to follow an autistic man and having to deal with out-of-control situations. Charlie wants to take Raymond in L.A, but they can't because Raymond is afraid of planes, and when Raymond starts screaming in panic, Charlie understands that the road trip will follow Raymond's parameters of life. In a way, Raymond Babbit is a leading role because he leads the story. And by following Raymond, Charlie will get to know more about his brother's sensitivity and become more empathic, a word he knew nothing about. The narrative progresses and provides the film's greatest twist, when Charlie realizes he can use Raymond's savant skills.Till now, the film is mostly remembered for the 'Las Vegas' sequence and the iconic moment when the two brothers stand on a descending escalator wearing the same suit, and the last step between Charlie and Raymond's reconciliation, a clever partnership for a rewarding pay-off. It's obvious that Charlie was mostly motivated by greed, but it's impossible not to see genuine attachment growing between Cruise and Hoffman. Both had failure to communicate their feelings, but it's by inviting his brother to communicate his inner thoughts, his fears and desires that Charlie learned the process of listening, of using another referential than his, of being capable of giving and understanding. The film follows the traditional coming-of-realization structure, and on that level, Tom Cruise never makes his changing obvious and spectacular. Indeed, both actors are so good, almost equally, because it was to Cruise to portray anger and frustration without making it forced or over the top.Without Hoffman and Cruise, I can't imagine the film having the same impact. Yes, the screenplay is well-written, and Hans Zimmer's score has a haunting effect, but it's definitely an actors' film. It ended up winning the Best Picture Oscar in 1988, which is quite surprising considering how simple and non-Best Picture material it feels, but it did created a genuine interest for autistic condition, and featured many memorable scenes, and I guess sometimes, that's enough to touch the hearts.",Rain Man
38,MOscarbradley,Hitting the road to Schmaltz-ville,6,27 August 2007,"Hollywood always believed that if a movie dealt with a serious theme in an entertaining manner it was somehow worthy of consideration which is why so many second-rate films like ""Rain Man"" ended up winning the Academy Award for Best Picture. As 'Best Pictures' go ""Rain Man"" wasn't quite the worst of them but you can't help feeling it trivializes its subject which is played almost entirely for comedy or sentimental value. If it's enjoyable, and in its way it is, it is due entirely to the two principal performances of Dustin Hoffman, (an Oscar for best actor), and Tom Cruise, (no nomination, but thoroughly deserving of one).They play estranged brothers reunited after the death of their father. Hoffman is an autistic-savant, (definitely qualifying as a handicap; definitely several rungs up the Oscar ladder), whose facility with numbers proves a definite plus when it comes to playing the tables in Las Vegas. (The journey from first meeting to final parting also qualifies this as a road-movie). Cruise is the initially venal younger brother who wants to use Hoffman's 'talents' for his own ends but, this being a Hollywood movie of the inspirational variety, it isn't too long before bonding takes place and at the time Cruise's persona was such that playing a bad guy wasn't really on the cards.If anyone ever doubted in the early days that Cruise could act all they had to do was to look to this and ""The Colour of Money"" where he gave his Oscar-winning co-stars as good as he got. The film's director was Barry Levenson, formerly as script-writer who graduated to making his own films with the marvelous ""Diner"" and whose best films tended towards autobiographical pieces set in his native Baltimore. ""Rain Man"" represented his attempt at tackling a 'big' subject. It had all the ingredients for popular success and it gave him the Oscar but it's still a bland, formulaic film typical of what the big studios were churning out at the time.",Rain Man
39,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Looks like rain.,6,6 October 2021,"'Rain Man (1988)' follows an impatient, arrogant and closed-off car salesman who finds out he has an autistic older brother when his father dies and leaves most of his estate to a mystery benefactor. In an effort to 'earn' his half of the money, he takes his brother on a cross-country road trip and, along the way, comes to appreciate him as the only member of his family who he actually has a bond with. The movie isn't as emotionally impactful as it perhaps thinks it is, even though it does hit the beats it ought to and has a few rather affecting moments. It also feels a bit long and, even, a little aimless. Having said that, it's generally entertaining all the way through. The lead character is really rather unlikeable which, though done on purpose, does make it a bit difficult to get invested in his story. Luckily, his arc sees him become more sympathetic over time and he is typically an engaging presence. His brother actually comes across as much more endearing; he's an easier character to root for. It's their relationship that forms the bread and butter of the piece and it's usually well rendered. The flick also does a decent job with its representation of non-neuronormativity. It is a little outdated, but it's empathetic and relatively true to life. It's sadly still rare for a film to focus on such things, even if it would be better if the role was played by a non-neurotypical actor.

Unfortunately, the kidnapping that somehow doesn't end up with the police involved, the ridiculous scenes in Las Vegas (why they buy suits, how they win, how politely the head of security asks them to leave, etc), and the idea that Tom Cruise's inexperienced character could care for his brother without drama while driving him across the country has none of the authenticity that Hoffman's acting has. The film wanted to broach a developmental disability but also entertain and appeal to the mass market, and for my taste, erred too much on the side of the latter. The transformation in Cruise's character is too abrupt even though the film is long (probably too long), but it redeems itself somewhat with strong final scenes. Worth watching, but not amazing.",Rain Man

Yes you can laugh at the stupidest words he says from his mouth but for god sakes, he doesn't even know how to cope with someone who has autism.

Dustin Hoffman absolutely amazed me here by playing Autisitc, just the way he walked, talked and acted, it was just uncanny, especially his freak out scenes, and Cruise is just as good, playing the incredibly selfish brother, as he and Hoffman, had fabulous chemistry together, plus the ending was a little surprising for me, but nonetheless I liked it. Hoffman deserved his Oscar, and Cruise deserved one too in my opinion or at least a nomination, plus one of my favorite scenes is most definitely when they go to the Casino, to count cards. It's extremely well made and written, and it also has some wonderful tear jerker moments as well, plus I loved the scene where Cruise teaches Hoffman to dance, as that was a great scene.I will admit to not seeing much of Dustin Hoffman, however his incredible performance here, definitely has made me a fan, and I would rank this in Cruise's top 5 for best performances, plus you will hate him in the 1st half, as he is such a prick, but really love him after a while, once he starts caring for Hoffman. Everything about this film is just perfect, and It was really unpredictable too, plus I loved the score&music as well. This deserves it's place on the top 250, as a matter of fact it should be even higher in my opinion, and it's also hilarious at times too, plus It also seemed that Hoffman and Cruise had so much passion for there roles. All the characters are extremely likable, and what also amazed me is how Hoffman and Cruise made there seemingly incredibly tough parts, look so easy!. This is an absolute masterpiece, that deserves it's best picture win in my opinion, with a brilliant story, Hoffman and Cruise are incredible, and if you haven't seen it, please do so immediately you shouldn't regret it!.The Direction is outstanding!. Barry Levinson does an outstanding job! here with brilliant camera work, great angles and just keeping everything perfect and at an extremely engrossing pace.The Acting is no doubt Oscar worthy!. Dustin Hoffman is simply incredible here, he really convinced me he was autistic, he was funny, lovable, had brilliant chemistry with Cruise, and just the way he walked, talked it really did amaze me, as I really enjoyed watching him work, you will love his character and be amazed by it trust me! (Hoffman Rules!!!!). Tom Cruise is amazing as always, and is incredible here, he plays such an incredible selfish prick at the start, but he turns wonderful in the 2nd half, as he was just as good as Hoffman in my opinion, he had the difficult task of switching character wise, he at least deserved an Nomination, but I loved seeing him and Hoffman work together!

It's a feat that is seldom seen and one that is comparable to a pitcher's throwing a shout-out, a no-hitter or a player's hitting a grand slam home run.SO TOO IT is that today's honoree, RAIN MAN, is as all encompassing and cherished a rarity; albeit in a far different field. This picture does ""touch all the bases"" in providing its audience with great and fairly equal portions of drama, comedy, tears and laughs. In each of these categories, the film invites the audience members to share in the emotions dominant at the time. This is particularly important in the category of comedy; for in such a complex and sensitive story, it would be a true tragedy if the production team had opted for having us laugh at the story rather than with the it.SO AS A RESULT of the gentle meshing of those previously mentioned elements, we have the added drama of a guy under the gun of a desperate business situation. Added to all, there is this his (the Tom Cruse character) sudden discovery o his older brother, Raymond.ALL OF THESE parts are masterfully assembled and carefully blended into a masterpiece of a film for all.

Made in 1988, it has Tom Cruise playing an 80's yuppie, Valeria Golino as his girlfriend, and just the way that it is shot screams ""80's movie"" all the way around. It manages to hold up very well, though, due to the touching story/acting combination between the principle characters.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Charlie Babbitt (Cruise), estranged son of a very wealthy father, finally coming back home upon his father's death to ""see what he gets"". When Charlie discovers that his family fortune has been placed in a mysterious trust, he packs up girlfriend Susanna (Golino) for a road trip to discover just what is going on. What he finds is a mysterious, eccentric autistic savant named Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), who ends up being much more than meets the eye.The chemistry between the Cruise/Hoffman characters is the fuel that fires this Academy Award- winning masterpiece. Cruise is always solid, and Hoffman turns in the kind of special performance that I now almost exclusively associate his name with. Their give-and-take with each other is priceless and provides some iconic cinema moments that will last long into the ages.Also, it can sometimes be difficult to make a movie about any type of mental illness (e.g. they often come off as too patronizing or sympathetic), but director Barry Levinson creates the type of story where he lets the viewers decide ""what is what"" instead of preaching to them. By the end of the film, you won't know what the ""right answer"" is.Overall, ""Rain Main"" is a dramatic gem that will forever hold at the very least a niche in Hollywood lore for its unique performances. My exact rating for the film would be 4.5 stars. It may not quite be in that upper echelon of the ""best of the best"", but it is certainly knocking on the door.",Rain Man
52,johnnyboyz,Not many films can portray the sentimentality and genius on display in this picture.,10,9 January 2008,"Such a brilliant and powerful film for certain reasons does not just have you watch it and leave you after viewing; forever rendered as a film you may recall if certain triggers occur. No, not this film; this one, like so few others, stays with you at least a few days after the viewing for all the right reasons. I would say this is similar in a broad sense that it is large and epic in its power and punch; similar to Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Forrest Gump as well as rather a few others from what I've seen in the sense it his you where you don't expect it and stays with you for a while afterwards.Rain Man, I suppose, is essentially a buddy movie that takes place on the road. Planes, Trains and Automobiles as well as the Lethal Weapon films and Midnight Run were enjoying success round about the time but where this is in no way a cop thriller or an out and out comedy, it is arguably the best of the bunch in its chosen genre; the road movie. What I like most about Rain Man is that it is sad without being too tragic; it is driven emotionally without the need for nasty deaths that may await its characters around the corner, nor does it rely on tragedies such as loosing loved ones or befalling a certain terrible event. Rain Man is pure emotion put across through brilliant acting as well as the certain situations that Charlie (Cruise) must adapt to in order to solve the problem that his brother Raymond (Hoffman) has got himself into.Rain Man is extremely simple in its set up yet deadly clinical in its execution. The upbeat 80s song playing over a really cool looking car seemingly gliding through the air as it's unloaded off a boat sets the scene perfectly for its character introduction of Charlie. We see the space he inhabits: it is a large and open warehouse which has some things inside of it but rather empty on the whole. Two colleagues; one of which is Susana (Golino) who is the girlfriend, rapidly try to keep in check with people on the phone as brand new sports cars idly wait by the side. This sums Cruise's character up perfectly: a big and active but perhaps empty in places life that is chaotic; yet he still has friends to back him up when he needs it  the cars signify the 'coolness' Charlie possesses where as the empty space that is the rest of the warehouse perhaps signifies his lack of a real family. Raymond on the other hand inhabits a smaller and more concentrated space at the hospital; an almost childlike room that screams of innocence.But to call Raymond a child is incorrect. There is a seemingly pointless scene in the middle of the film where Raymond gets distressed over the fact he may miss a TV programme so they have to stop at a random house to find a TV. The kids in the house want to watch cartoons but Raymond isn't excited by the prospect at all; he watches his programme and the rest of the children seem bored by it suggesting Raymond has at some level, an area that isn't of an infantile nature. This in itself creates a new argument. It is apparent Raymond is autistic but through deeper knowledge, he suffers from a severe form of Asperger's Syndrome which means any break from formation or routine results in high anxiety. This is where the film challenges you to laugh. Do we find Raymond and his misadventures funny? The scene where they have to stop to watch a television doesn't advance the plot at all; it merely highlights the problem he has but is it played for laughs? Another example is the scene in which Raymond quotes the waitresses address and phone number because he can remember what he reads (last night he read the phone book: A-G). Rather than laugh out loud at this, we may chuckle if we're familiar with Asperger's Syndrome but would others laugh at the absurdity of being able to recall her exact information? Similar scenes are when Raymond counts the toothpicks; repeats the radio jingle and is interested in the sexual noises coming from Charlie's hotel room. Again, is it funny that this happens or is it just a scene highlighting the symptoms of the illness. Director and Screenwriter alike are putting across humour and information that we may laugh at, cry at or learn from: genius.But rather than be a documentary of any sort, the films would have its characters go through a journey. What's tragic is that we don't know whether or not Raymond realises he has done so. Charlie, I feel, changes from his old yuppie self and develops a nicer side. He learns what it means to have a family. He says so himself that his mother died when he was two; a father he hated and ran away from at 16 and a brother he only discovered the other day. As well as this, he realises that love interests aren't something to be toyed with since Susana leaves him when she sniffs evidence of Charlie using Raymond to get his inheritance. Charlie learns what it means to behave correctly when it comes to love and family ties and both characters share epiphanies at various points. To have the two heroes start the 'road movie' as one type of individual and have them finish it someone completely internally different is a difficult yet powerful thing to achieve but Rain Man absolutely nails it dead centre. With few real bad things to say about the film, it is no wonder I loved it so much.",Rain Man
53,filipemanuelneto,"It's a good movie, but not as good as the Oscars make it look.",7,23 August 2020,"There are excellent films, bad films, average films... but there are also films that, although they're good, are clearly stilted, as if they were great without, in fact, being that excellent. This film, for me, fits that description. It is a good film, and that is indisputable, but it is not as good and as remarkable as many have said. The film won four Oscars, namely Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor, and with all fairness, but against weak competitors.The story is simple: Charles Babbit is a skilled car dealer who is in a delicate business situation when he is informed of the death of his father, with whom he had not spoken for years. Counting on inheriting his fortune, he is angry to know that he inherited only a classic car and all the money will be managed by a fund in favor of a brother he did not know, who is in a clinic because he is autistic. Determined to contest the will, he kidnaps his brother and takes him to Los Angeles on a long road trip, where they will have the opportunity to get closer.The story that the film brings us is good but I didn't find it particularly credible. Its hard to believe that a hardened selfish person like Charlie could change in a few days. Although the idea is pleasant, it seems naive. There are also some points where the film seemed illogical to me, such as the ease with which Charlie removed his brother from the clinic. In any case, if we are willing to accept the story, the film will compensate us because its good, has a lot of quality, no dead moments and manages to keep us interested.If the plot is good, dialogues and cast performances are even better. The dialogues are excellent, particularly the lines given to Dustin Hoffman, where we have a lot of references to North American cultural landmarks and some tributes, such as the quotations by Abbott & Costello. In fact, Hoffman is the most striking actor, with a superb interpretation of an autistic character. It is difficult to play handicapped characters without it looking like a caricature or a bad taste joke, but Hoffman has managed to put soul and elegance into his work and to look authentic. Less interesting to me was Tom Cruise, but he's a good actor and did an excellent job by giving us an acid and disagreeable character, but who the audience would have to give a chance for redemption, so he couldn't be just hateful. Much less positive was the performance of Valeria Golino. She was left the most of the film and is quickly set aside.Technically, it is a fairly regular film. It has a pleasant cinematography, with good color and light and great beautiful cars (they are an important element of the film). The trip allows the use of good landscapes from several places of the United States, with emphasis on vibrant Las Vegas. The costumes are awful, but they were the fashion in the Eighties, a decade with no sense of taste at all. The soundtrack, by Hans Zimmer, is decent but does not stand out, if we exclude the opening song, known enough to be in the ear.",Rain Man

55,TheMovieDiorama,Rain Man downpours an acute awareness for autism through a earnest cross-country comedy-drama.,8,30 March 2020,"Savant syndrome, often associated with the autism spectrum disorder, is a mental condition that enables the individual to excel at a skill related to memory. From dropping a box of toothpicks and instantly calculating the exact number that lie on the dilapidated flooring to immediately answering advanced arithmetics to a precise degree of accuracy. The extraordinary memory capabilities this disorder grants, likening the brain to acquiring eidetic abilities, consequently decreases other neurodevelopmental traits. Socialising is minimised, as savants relish in living strict routines, exerting emotional complexities and organised abodes. Most, unfortunately, are unable to cope with the limitless boundaries of the real world, often residing in the reclusiveness of mental institutions.So when selfish, abrasive and greedy Charlie, estranged from his recently deceased father whom bequeathed his fortune, discovers he has a savant brother Raymond sitting on three-million dollars, he instantly initiated manipulation. Unaware of his existence til now, Charlie coerces Raymond into leaving the institution and demanding half of his father's estate. The road-trip ahead becomes an eye-opening journey into brotherly admiration and awareness for a mental disorder fairly unknown to many.Levinson's Academy Award winning drama, regardless of the fact that a non-savant portrayed Raymond, is often cited for improving public awareness for autism, allowing appropriate agencies to start accommodating them. It's a tale of familial virtuosity. Rain Man is not necessarily propelling Raymond's disorder into the limelight, the feature is focussed on Charlie. The dehumanising greed, the naive treatment towards his older brother, the neglectful impact to the people surrounding him. Representing a modern society not willing to acknowledge the mental instabilities of others. Levinson's meticulous opening shot, which sees Charlie importing four Lamborghinis, to the departing closing shot of Charlie solemnly staying at the passing train, accentuates the story revolving around Charlie.As with any road-trip, it's a journey of self-discovery. Two very different yet isolated souls unearthing a deep attachment for each other to which their limited exterior emotional output prevents the outside world from acknowledging. The bond of brothers. Charlie haphazardly showing Raymond the luxuries of life, whilst Raymond simultaneously assimilates humility. Whilst the latter may not change as a character, Charlie relishes in characterised alterations throughout the near-seamless car drive. All culminating into a subdued yet powerful scene where the two silently rest their heads together, knowing they have reconciled and found each other after all these years. Morrow and Bass' screenplay intelligently inserts a comedic undertone without melodramatically creating sympathy for Raymond. His repetitious nature, mostly consisting of ""K-Mart, we should go go K-Mart"", serves as endearment rather than frustration when it's referenced again twenty minutes later as a progressional step. ""K-Mart sucks!"", Raymond blurts out. It shows humanistic evolution through subtle indications. As with most road-trip films, the journey itself can often be narratively bumpy, with characters repeating the same actions to fill time. This unfortunately occurs here when Charlie constantly enters a phone booth whilst leaving Raymond to his own devices. It presents a lack of variance.Regardless, when two actors are constantly offering masterclass performances and attempting to best each other with every scene, it's incredibly difficult to identify the flaws. Hoffman enhances his already legendary status with an effortless performance that physically, mentally and emotionally captures savantism. The repeated lines of dialogue, the gentle swaying of the body and the inability to look people directly. Pitch perfect. Yet it's Cruise who astonished as arguably the central character of this whole ordeal. The natural changes he intricately presents to his character, from abruptly shouting at Raymond whenever he was frustrated to teaching Raymond how to dance in the presidential suite of Caesar's Palace, were sublime. A steady attachment begins to manifest, and it is solely down to his succinct role.Golino, portraying Charlie's girlfriend, was overshadowed and unable to make an impression. Her character has arguably the most impactful scene of the entire feature, that being the elevator dance. Yet unfortunately her underdevelopment and simplicity resulted in Hoffman stealing the scene once again. A shame, as a memorable female presence would've balanced the boisterous drama. Zimmer's score also deserves noteworthy attention for providing atmosphere during the long driving sequences, bringing life to the expansive horizon of rocky canyons and grassy fields.As someone who knows various individuals whom have acquired autistic dependencies, including Asperger's Syndrome, Rain Man brings credible attention to these deficiencies without humiliating them. By simply showing awareness, Levinson balances the acute memory senses with the emotional complexities, and manages to direct a solidly enthralling road-trip feature along the way. Much like winning blackjack in Las Vegas, it encompasses emotional highs and lows without resorting to melodrama, placing a price tag for brotherly love as priceless.",Rain Man
56,SAMTHEBESTEST,An Emotional rollercoaster of abnormal bromance powered by Dustin Hoffman's Best Act ever..,8,12 May 2020,"RainMan (1988) :
Brief Review -An Emotional rollercoaster of abnormal bromance powered by Dustin Hoffman's Best Act ever. Some people waste too much time on writing thrilling, suspenseful, twisty and tricky films to make a good film but they should have realised that once you bring realistic emotions in the film you don't need all that tricky stuff. Well explored Emotions will always work, no matter which era it is or which kind of film you're making. Rain Man gives a new face to Bromance with one abnormal character in central role and one greedy character to take him along. Dustin Hoffman plays the abnormal character brilliantly and how brilliant? I can't say anything much than calling it his best act ever. Tom Cruise as his younger brother does excellent job despite being a hateful character, he force you to love his acting. Veleria Golina and the rest of the supporting cast have been good at thier small roles. The writing and screenplay of Rain Man is one fine collaboration of mixing emotions in right cinematic proportions. Also, there's life lesson for all of us on relationship and bond between family members. Barry Levinson deleivers an emotional classic that will surely tug a ring in your heart irrespective of what kind of person you are. Rain Man includes several scenes which will stay with you. If you hate this film, then you're the problem. Just watch it and be ready for a tear jerking and heart touching show.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",Rain Man
57,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Honest sense of humor makes ""Rain Man"" a surprise classic",8,20 August 2009,"""Rain Man"" might be most remembered for Dustin Hoffman's brave and remarkable performance as autistic savant Raymond Babbitt, but the film's greatest strength lies elsewhere: its sense of humor. At first, you're inclined not to laugh at Raymond's oddities and especially not at the way his brother Charlie (Tom Cruise) treats him, but as the film progresses, you become less worried about being respectful and suddenly ""Rain Man"" is really just a film about two brothers on the road together, sometimes sharing funny moments, sometimes sharing tough ones -- but who discover something about themselves through their newfound relationship.""Diner "" director Barry Levinson, who has always carried his sense of humor about him in all his projects, is responsible for much of this tone to what is a challenging story. Ronald Bass and Barry Morrow do write in some humor, but when summarized, this film does not have a pleasant story line. It's about a young man who's angry that his father left him nothing upon his death, finds out it all went to an autistic brother he never knew he had and in his rage, as sort of a ransom, kidnaps his brother and heads for L.A. Cruise plays an unlikable yuppie with no patience or sympathy for his brother's condition. He's entirely selfish and blinded by deep-seated father issues having grown up without a mother and leaving his father after a dispute at age 16. It's a good role for Cruise, having played rebellious younger characters in ""Top Gun"" and ""Risky Business"" at this point in his career, it was a good fit that smoothly transitioned him into a more dramatic role, establishing him as more than just the latest fashion. Charlie's change is the most significant in the film, and though it's hard to believe he's not being selfish about Ray from beginning to end, it's the transformation in his sense of humor that really sells us. At first he's funny because of how he overreacts to his frustrations in taking care of Ray, but once he understands him, it becomes sweet and genial.Raymond is Hoffman at his finest, maybe the height of his career after ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" and ""Tootsie."" Playing the mentally challenged is done so little because it's such a difficult thing and a touchy subject that Hoffman had to have handled with incredible sensitivity as he was developing the character. The real genius in his acting is in his eyes. You can always tell he's counting or paying attention to details and he's mesmerized by the world around him. That sort of guides how he interacts with the characters. Levinson picks up on this and subsequently gets a lot of scenic footage, namely Las Vegas where Raymond is fascinated by everything that sparkles.The troublesome part of the story is that it glamorizes Ray's savant abilities and at one point takes advantage of them with little remorse. At the same time, it's clear that despite the opportunities for ""Rain Man"" to just lay on the sap, Levinson wants it to feel real. Even Hans Zimmer (in his first score) was forced to keep the score electronic '80s style, which while awful is a distinct choice in tone. In real life, Charlie probably wouldn't treat his brother all that much better, he would just appreciate him differently.

A more dramatic ending would have been nicer as well, but the director choose to end it on a calm, tranquil, slightly sad note, which had its charms as well.Of course the acting performances are great. Dustin Hoffman (deservedly) got lauded, but I like Tom Cruise's role as well, playing the arrogant, moneyminded brother of an autistic person.Any bad? Not really, the only thing that is typical of all Barry Levinson pictures is that they are very laid back and slow burning in nature. One has to like that. On the good side: I feel like I really got to know these characters. Thanks to a warmhearted direction and great acting performances this story I wont forget easily. Really nice...",Rain Man

Cruise really comes across well as a selfish yuppie who runs a car business, who's father's just passed away leaving poor old Charlie, nil. The two really never got on, and left on pretty nasty terms, which is the impression we get, if Cruise's almost blank reaction, is anything to go by. Surprise, surprise, Charlie discovers a brother he never knew, who's autistic, played with flawless precision by Oscar win, Hoffman, which still looking back on it, today, just recently, is still an amazing piece of acting work. With the money going to Raymond, Charlie must find a way to retrieve his deserved share, taking older brother for a ride, going cross country. It becomes fun seeing Hoffman's temper tantrums irk Cruise, who's not equipped to handle this situation, yet over the course of a week, they really get to be good mates, so when parting time comes, it's actually sad, not that they're really parting. This is the greatness of the film, it's journey where Cruise must finally accept his brother for what he is, an autistic genius, especially with numbers, and childlike. And Hoffman has likes too, like Apple juice and K mart clothes. They're even have to crash a family's house, as Raymond starts up again, as he never misses an episode of Final Jeopardy. Valerie Golino adds sexy appeal as Cruise's girlfriend, where Raymond stumbles into the bedroom during an intimate moment. Hoffmasn's so creative with his character, mannerisms speech. Like autistic people, they are still alive inside, the bath scene, with Raymond screaming madly, was an unsettling moment.

62,paul-allaer,"Standing the test of time 30+ years later, and then some... with love from Cincinnati",9,29 January 2019,"""Rain Man"" (1988 release; 133 min.) brings the story of Charlie and Raymond. As the movie opens, Charlie, an exotic car dealer in LA, and his girlfriend Susanna are on their way to a Palm Springs weekend getaway when Charlie gets a call that his estranged dad has passed away, and to get to Cincinnati for the funeral. After the funeral, Charlie learns that the bulk of the $3 million estate has been given to a mysterious beneficiary. Enraged, Charlie is determined to learn who that is. It turns out that Charlie has an older brother Raymond who is an autistic savant. Charlie takes off with Raymond, determined to bring Raymond back to LA... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie brings back particular memories for me. I moved to Cincinnati just around the time that Barry Levinson Tom Cruise, Dustin Hofmann, and the rest of the crew were here to film a good part of the movie (more or less the first hour). The city was buzzing, and the Enquirer would dutifully note, almost daily, where the stars had been spotted (including at several Reds games, of course). The Cincinnati landmarks in the film are plentiful, including the airport mosaics, Dixie Terminal and the Suspension Bridge. (There is also a scene where Raymond keeps repeating ""97X Bam! The Future of Rock & Roll"", which is the best (indie rock) radio station I have ever listened to. Sadly, they went out of business in 2010 or so.) The scene where they drive the 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible over the Suspension Bridge, and Raymond starts humming along to the noise made by car driving over the bridge, is probably still the most Cincinnati-iconic movie moment ever. Of course, the movie is much more than Cincinnati, I mean it is no coincidence that it ended up the highest grossing movie released in 1988, and then winning 4 Oscars including Best Picture, Director, Screenplay and Actor, wow, just wow. I hadn't seen ""Rain Man' in probably over 20 years, and I was surprised how well this still works. I mean, Cruise portrays a jerk in much of the movie, and you can see the talent dripping off of the guy. Hoffman wins the Oscar. 'Nuff said. Likewise for Levinson. The only times that the movie feels outdated are of course the multiple telephone booth scenes. Yes, I guess that's how it was 30 years ago! (As an side, I still live in Cincinnati, now 30+ years later.)Bottom line: ""Rain Man"" is a delightful movie, with outstanding performances from the two lead actors. Extra brownie points for those of us from Greater Cincinnati, as we are glued to the screen to see what points and scenes we recognize (ooh look, they filmed this on 275 West!). ""Rain Man"" is a WINNER all the way.",Rain Man
63,bsmith5552,Absolutely Riveting Performances,10,16 July 2001,"""Rain Man"" is a magnificent film with absolutely riveting performances from its two stars Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Hoffman plays Raymond an autistic adult who has been institutionalized since his youth. Cruise plays Charley a small time hustler who upon his father's death, finds out that unknown to him, he has a brother (Hoffman) that he knew nothing about. Hoffman reportedly researched his character by spending time with autistic patients, prior to the filming. The results are amazing. He has all of the mannerisms and habits of an autistic person down pat. You actually believe he is autistic he is so convincing. He richly deserved the Academy Award that he won for his performance. Cruise, because of his pretty boy image, is not given the credit that he is due as an actor. In ""Rain Man"", his character goes from a self-centered hustler, to one of compassion, love and understanding over the course of the movie. He complements Hoffman's performance perfectly. There is a touching scene in an elevator between Valerie Galino as Cruise' girlfriend and Hoffman where she gives him a kiss and he responds by saying innocently, that it was sloppy. Watch for Director Barry Levenson as a psychiatrist near the end of the film. ""Rain Man"" deservedly won the 1988 Academy Award for best picture is is a true classic.",Rain Man
64,freemantle_uk,A story of self-interest and brotherly love,8,5 February 2011,"Ever since Tom Cruise became a big name star he has always wanted to prove to the public that he is a serious actor and wanted to win an Oscar. His starring role in Rain Man was his first attempt at getting the Academy's attention but ended up getting upstaged by Dustin Hoffman.Charlie Babbit (Cruise) is a young, ambitious and selfish car dealer, importing Lamborghinis but is in the middle of a business problem when trying to sell them. He has an Italian girlfriend, Susanna (Valeria Golino) and his only real concerns are himself and money. When Charlie's estranged father dies and leaves him only a 1948 Buick Roadmaster and his prize rose bushes. His $3 Million goes to a unnamed beneficiary. When Charlie finds the route of the money he discovers that he has autistic older brother, Ray (Hoffman). Charlie takes Ray away from his home in Cincinnati and takes him on an cross-country journey as a bargaining tool to gain the money. On the way Charlie gets frustrated with Ray's needs and routine, not understanding his condition: but also slowly builds a relationship with this relative he did not know he had.For this role Mr. Cruise was in full scumbag mode and he has proved he can do repulsive roles really well. His character Charlie is truly a dislikeable character who only cares about himself; but the story of Charlie follows basic screen writing rules of what he wants and needs. What Charlie wants is money but what he really needs is a family and get to know his brother. Cruise was obviously trying to flex his acting muscles for this role. Hoffman made sure that he gave Ray a lot of traits like talking to himself and lives on a routine of certain food and television problems. He does seem like a man who lives in own world and can not interact with people. He does give a good performance and it was obvious Oscar bait. The two men work best during more tender moments where Charlie gets to find out more about Ray and their past and Charlie does develop a more caring bond with his brother.To me Barry Levinson is a hit and miss director: he has made some really good films like Sleepers and Wag the Dog, but he has made turkeys like Sphere to balance things out. With Rain Man he does a standard but he does have a few moments of flair: a moment I particularly liked was when the camera follows Charlie and Susanna when they are having an argument. But for most of the time all Levinson needs to do point the camera in the right place and let the actors just interact with each other and make sure there are some nice wide shots and make sure there is a decent editing job. But I did feel awkward at times involving how Ray interacted with people, particularly when Charlie and Ray are outside a farm house and Ray was about to have a fit. It was at times uncomfortable when the film was not tender.7.5 out of 10.",Rain Man
65,PWNYCNY,What's Rain Man's problem? - His brother. Revisted movie - Great Movie,10,8 January 2006,"This movie is about a man who has some kind of mysterious mental disorder which enables him to perform the most complicated mathematical calculations but cannot tell you the answer to one-plus-one. The movie suggests that he is autistic, but is he? He communicates quite satisfactorily when he wants to, and when he's upset he starts rocking back and forth and throws tamper tantrums. Well, so what? When he's left alone, he's all right. It's only when other people, such as his conniving and pushy brother, insist that he talks that he gets nervous. But the movie also shows that when someone speaks to him nicely, he responds accordingly. One strong scene is the scene where a young pretty woman, Iris, who is a prostitute but clearly not a sinister or threatening person, starts talking to Raymond, and Raymond, who is supposed to be autistic, responds. He likes Iris and more importantly has a conversation with her in which he reveals a droll sense of humor. The scene gets ruined when the brother shows up and drives away Iris, which destroys the ambiance developing between Raymond and Iris, who found Raymond intriguing, and wipes out what potentially could have been an upbeat and amusing part of the story. What if Iris had picked up Raymond? What if Iris, like the prostitutes in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" or ""Pretty Woman,"" had bonded with Raymond and started taking care of him? Maybe Raymond would have gained some confidence in himself, felt a lot better about life, really learned how to dance, shaken off the effects of autism, and got it together to tell his pushy brother to get lost. Then the movie would have really become interesting.I rate this movie an ""seven"" exclusively because of Dustin Hoffman's dominating performance as the indomitable Raymond. Otherwise, this movie is a ""four.""On 5/12/07 I watched Rain Man again and wish to make a few more comments. This movie is about two brothers who attempt to bond with each other after suddenly discovering each other's existence. Both brothers struggle with emotions that overwhelm them but ultimately they succeed in establishing a bond. This time I was much more impressed with Tom Cruise's performance. At first angry and selfish, his character gos through a complicated change and emerges a much better and more responsible person. As for Dustin Hoffman, his performance is a classic and is the hub around which the movie revolves. Mr. Hoffman's character is trapped in a psychological prison that distorts his behavior and makes him emotionally unreachable. But with enough attention, encouragement and support provided by his brother, he begins to improve and by the end of movie there is hope for him. I now rate this movie a 10.",Rain Man

67,ackstasis,"""I'm an excellent driver""",8,17 September 2007,"'Rain Man' is a truly enjoyable film, both heartwarming and inspirational. Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise combine flawlessly to give two of the finest performances of the 1980s, and director Barry Levinson  following the success of 'Good Morning, Vietnam'  took home his only Oscar to date. 'Rain Man' was monumentally successful at the 1989 Academy Awards, nominated in eight categories and taking home statues for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Hoffman), Best Director, Best Picture and Best Writing, Original Screenplay. Unbelievably, Tom Cruise  despite giving one of his career-best efforts  did not receive an acting nomination.Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt, a selfish young Los Angeles car dealer who is in a spot of financial trouble. After learning of the death of his estranged father, Charlie attends his funeral in Cincinnati, and is shocked to discover that his father's $3 million inheritance has been left to somebody else. Thus, Charlie comes to learn of Raymond Babbitt (Hoffman), his autistic savant older brother, of whom he had known nothing. Whilst Charlie has a photographic memory and is a prodigy with numbers, his autism means that he cannot look after himself, and, furthermore, he has no understanding of the concept of money. Eager to rob Raymond of his inheritance for his own selfish reasons, Charlie basically kidnaps him, despite the objections of his girlfriend, Susanna (Valeria Golino).'Rain Man' is one of cinema's most touching ""road trip"" movies. As Charlie and Raymond make their way to Los Angeles' in Charlie's newly-acquired 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible (Raymond had refused to fly with any airline other than QANTAS, having committed to memory every plane crash in history), they have their own share of frustrations, with Charlie soon developing a great level of respect for Raymond's abilities. There is also a very memorable stop-off in Las Vegas, where  in the movie's most exhilarating scene  Raymond wins his brother more than $80,000 by counting cards in a six-deck shoe. There are also some sentimental moments, particularly when Charlie, wanting to prepare Raymond for a ""date"" he thinks he is having, teaches him how to dance.Screenwriters Ronald Bass and Barry Morrow drew their inspiration for the character of Raymond from real-life savant Kim Peek, who suffered from agenesis of the corpus callosum and was not actually autistic. Hoffman plays his character to perfection, complete with the hurried speech and the quirky tilt of the head. Other Raymond Babbitt oddities, which we all come to love, include taking photographs of random objects, watching ""The People's Court"" at four o'clock every day and reciting Abbott and Costello's ""Who's on First?"" routine whenever he is nervous. Cruise, who is often over-looked, also gives a stellar performance, with Charlie tracing a full character arc, his selfish disregard for Raymond's wellbeing gradually giving way to love and understanding.",Rain Man

Together they make an unlikely but fascinating pair of social misfits: one is mentally and emotionally disabled (despite his mathematical memory); the other is mentally and emotionally immature, and both are difficult to warm up to at first, making their gradual connection over a long, cross-country road trip all the more rewarding. Dustin Hoffman tackles the more difficult (and more showy) role, but because the character is limited by his disability the film is slanted toward the more photogenic Tom Cruise. Director Barry Levinson laminates the already calculated scenario under a thick commercial glaze, to the point where even the snapshots shown over the closing credits (supposedly taken by the autistic Hoffman from a fast-moving car) look perfectly composed and artfully arranged.",Rain Man
70,FilmCriticLalitRao,Rain Man missed a good chance to be a major universal phenomenon in cinema !!,6,20 September 2014,"Although the theme of two unknown people knowing each other during the course of a journey is not at all new, neither for world cinema nor for sagacious viewers, American director Barry Levenson's 'Rain Man' remains very much ""an American film"" in essence. The Americanization of a universal story is its biggest drawback. The film is replete with plethora of easily recognizable symbols of American culture namely casinos in Las Vegas, American style desperation to watch successful TV shows and consume food items which are considered an essential part of American cuisine. Despite these shortcomings, Rain Man manages to retain its label of 'an entertainer' for viewers of all ages and tastes as it makes effective use of two big Hollywood actors Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise to portray how strange circumstances drive an ambitious man to have a change of heart. As a feel good film, Rain Man is a successful film about the emotional bonding of two people who do not have much in common. Actor Dustin Hoffman is so convincing in his role that he has no trouble in making us all believe that intelligent are the ones who appear sheer nerds to others.",Rain Man
71,GiraffeDoor,It coasts way too much on its concept,4,13 February 2020,"For all the heart it has, I though this was a flaccid and slow attempt to touch the feels.I think I can sort of see what they're going for: it's that formula of the ambitious and shallow workaholic trying to use another person for their own gain, but in a shocking twist, re-evaluate their values and discover something deeper in loving another human and taking care of them.The concept is safe enough, it's just that the handling is so bland. Hoffman is always funny to watch (though one does feel a bit guilty for laughing) but Cruise's character just simply isn't characteurish enough for the movie's themes to really be interesting. Plot point of taking vegas could have been interesting but they don't really do anything interesting with it and it just fizzles out. I found the character development baffling and unearned.There isn't really any meaningful conflict, it's just an anecdote that shouldn't have lasted more than 20 minutes. This movie just doesn't give me any reason to care. It thinks its some kind of trip into realism but it's just way to sentimental and contrived to pull that off.",Rain Man
72,CubsandCulture,Screenplay let's down the rest of the film...,8,28 January 2019,"While ultimately this is a very good film the script's inability to fully contextualizes Charlie's actions greatly hampers the film. Charlie's character arch is weak and not fully believable. He starts out too amoral and greedy to fully end up caring about the little things and family. It is a matter of degrees; the diner scene at the end needed to be less familiar and the scene setting up the car deal needing to be more caring. Apart from that, the script's treatment of Raymond leaves a little bit to be desired. At times his abilities are mere plot devices and comes across as exploitation. Re-watching this a few days ago I am surprised that it was as careless in its writing as it is.Nonetheless, the chemistry between Cruise and Hoffman greatly patch over the weaknesses in the script. The moral qualms about Charlie occur in hide sight because Cruise sells the arch extremely well. Hoffman is amazingly believable as Raymond and he never collapses into mockery. The film works as well as it does because of its leads.Through Levinson's deft touch helps. Road trip moves with two characters are often visually static but here Levinson keeps the film alive and each sequence has a distinctive flavor within a cohesive whole. This is a great looking film in spite of the challenges. The film feels very much a product of the 80's and it is a credit to Levinson to be that in tune with the Zeitgeist.",Rain Man

Thus begins a touching cross country journey of discovery as the two brothers learn about each other.Director Barry Levinson ( who was awarded the Best Director Oscar) involves us deeply in the tale, and thanks to him we really become a part of the Babbitt's adventure, always helped by Hoffman's warm portrayal of Ray's peculiar, ritualistic and fascinating world, and Tom Cruise equally effective display as the greedy and selfish Charlie.""Rainman"" really saw Mr. Cruise come of age in a strong performance as the self-serving business man who goes through a personal metamorphosis when he spends a week with his newly found, mentally 'high-functioning' older brother. Dustin Hoffman displays his consummate professionalism and easily steals the show in a beautifully weighted performance as autistic savant Raymond Babbitt. This wonderful turn from one of Hollywood's greatest talents earned him a second Best Actor Oscar in what was a most convincing outing. Most admirable in support are Valeria Golino as Charlie's long suffering girlfriend Suzannah who is desperately trying to become a part of his world and not just an accessory, and Jerry Molen, as the trustee of Ray's new estate and the doctor who has only his patient's welfare in mind.John Seale's camera presents us with some memorable images of America's mid west, editor Stu Linder keeps proceedings always moving toward a passionate climax and Hans Zimmer provides a truly moving and striking score.Levinson pulls everything together superbly in a movie about personal values and priorities, human sacrifice and the discovery of feelings. In the beginning Ray, with his inability to understand or display emotion, is as much capable of showing them as the shallow Charlie. Yet ironically it is the ""Rainman"" who helps his little brother get in touch with his inner self, and ultimately unearth the ability to care and love.Our director lends the drama, from the pen of Barry Morrow, superb surety and genuine, heartfelt poignancy, never letting it become over burdened with emotional baggage.

But later as the movie progresses, it shows how Charlie slowly grows affection to his distanced brother.

79,Movie-ManDan,"Not Just One of The Best Movies of the 80s, One of the Best Movies In Any Decade.",10,2 November 2014,"This feel-good comedic drama was one of the first to deal with a mental disability. Autism is more common today than it was in the 80s, so Rain Man is perhaps more relevant now than then. It follows selfish yuppie, Charlie Babbitt (Cruise) who is angry that he did not get over $1 million of inheritance from his father whom he never had a good relationship with. When he finds out all the money went to his older brother, Raymond, (Hoffman) with high-functioning autism he never knew he had, Charlie kidnaps him to get his cut. Raymond's social ignorance, lack of communication and odd rituals bug the living hell out of Charlie, until Charlie sees the good in Raymond and gets out of his self-centred world. Dustin Hoffman gives his most recognizable and best performance as the Rain Man. The movie may be a drama, but Hoffman provides all the comic-relief this movie needs with his rituals, ignorance and intelligence. The movie is a triumph based on Hoffman's performance alone. His Oscar win for this was one of the easiest wins in the Academy's history. Tom Cruise also gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the one that drives the movie. He is the protagonist and the one that changes the most throughout the film, starting as a mean car salesman to a humble, loving one. I mentioned that it was funny seeing Hoffman bug Cruise, but it is just as funny seeing Cruise throw his hissy fits because his is so annoyed by his brother. The brother-to-brother relationship is strong and original. The information that is delivered about autism is done in a strong and simple way.

The director, well i never watch any other film of him. That's why i never wanted to see or to buy the DVD for my collection of this film. Finally one day i was on a DVD store and i saw a double pack DVD: yes two films for the prize of one. The films was Blue Velvet and Rain Man. I think that Blue Velvet is the best of David Lynch and i love it....but i don't have the DVD so i buy it. Finally i saw Rain Man just because i have it now but well i just LOVE IT.Dustin Hoffman do his best performance ever in a very charismatic role. He plays the Rain Man or Raymond, who is very intelligent person but has this problem of the autism. And Tom Crusie prove that he can be a good actor too (not as good as Hoffman) and plays Chalie Babbit, the younger brother of Raymond.The story is simple: Charlie never know about his brother until his father die and all the inheritance goes to Raymond, so he thinks that he can took away the money from his brother.Well i have to say that i was very wrong about thinking that Rain Man wasn't a good movie and the only negative aspect of the film is the MUSIC.

I hope you people don't get mad at me for such ignorance. I don't know much of what was going on in 1988-- in fact, I wasn't even born--, so that's why I didn't know this movie's recognition. Tom Cruise's character (Charlie) is an arrogant, ambitious and selfish boy who finds out he has a savant brother who inherit all their father's money. From that point on, Charlie tries everything to get the custody of his brother, in order to be able to manage his fortune. Not only that, but Charlie is extremely rude with his poor brother, and I felt like punching Charlie in almost every scene. There is nothing wrong with acting from anyone from the cast; Hoffman, Cruise and Golino are decent in what they're doing. The big problem is the weak directing. Barry Levinson builds only normal scenes that never engage the movie as a whole, so I never got to see a dramatic moment in the whole picture. Also, the kissing scene between Raymond and Susana didn't feel right by any standards for me. Maybe the only really interesting scene happened when Charlie and Raymond had a conversation with the doctors, in the last 10 minutes, but it feels too hard to track the slow-paced story that filmmakers have given.

It was a game changer at the box office, with the movie dealing with autism, loneliness, and a getaway. Dustin Hoffman is great as the retarded character while Tom Cruise is his best friend. The cinematography is great, the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer (his first) amazing, and the acting is legendary. My dad grew up watching this movie on VHS and i finally watched it on bluray since i'm old enough to see this movie. It's not for kids since it's rated R.",Rain Man
83,PredragReviews,Surprising delivery by Dustin Hoffman!,9,21 March 2016,"Rain Man' is the kind of film where we know we are watching a formula movie, but we are so enraptured by the story and the premise and captivated by the brilliant performances by Cruise and Hoffman that we can't help but let ourselves go and fully enjoy what this unique film has to offer. It wouldn't of been so successful if Hoffman and Cruise hadn't delivered such brilliant performances, their scenes together are masterful and we really believe that they could be brothers, this also helps at boosting the emotional impact near the end of the film.Hoffman deserved that Oscar 100%. One of the best acting performances I have ever been privileged to have seen. His performance really shines when it shows the constantly evolving chemistry with him and Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise makes use of his time in this film masterfully and shows why he is one the best Actors of all time. I felt Valeria Golino performance to be lacking when she's upset or disappointed she does not seem as good or effective as possible, she is kind of lacking in energy some of the time here. But anyway...This movie was very emotional at some times, and had it's funny moments as well. I believe that ""Rain Man"" is truly a work of art, and a film that everyone can watch, understand, and enjoy.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Rain Man
84,eric262003,The Performances Were Amazing,9,29 November 2011,"I used to be skeptical into thinking it can't be possible that two immensely talented performers are at their very best and every scene that they're in just makes you green with envy. ""Rain Man"" has that kind of manipulative tactic and it succeeds in doing that. I saw this movie numerous times and more than that in near future (because this movie is addictive) and through every viewing I learn a new thing and more fondness is only an eyelash away. The chemistry between the two leading stars (Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman) is phenomenal it'll make your heart melt like butter. Like the Rob Reiner movie ""Stand by Me"", this is another road movie that leads to the path of self-discovery. In this case it comes from a arrogant Los Angeles car dealer Charlie Babbitt (Cruise) hears the news that his distant father has sadly passed on. Charlie thought that he was going to inherit a huge lump sum of cash only to be surprised that his late father left him absolutely nothing. instead he gave all his inheritance to a brother Charlie never thought he new named Raymond (Hoffman). The only problem is, Raymond is severely autistic and can't really look after himself let alone manage money. Angered by the whole situation, Charlie removes Raymond from the ward he's living and takes his savant brother and drive all the way west to Las Vegas because Charlie has a clever plan. You see, Raymond may be autistic, but that doesn't mean he was brain-dead either. He had a knack of solving the most complex mathematical problems and can easily count cards quite well in casino card games like poker and blackjack. And Charlie took this to his advantage. The transformation of Charlie's character is so stunning, you might be able to sympathize the character with ease. The relationship he has with Raymond was well beyond believable from irritated and frustrated by Raymond's desperate needs like only flying to Qantas airplanes to his fixation watching Judge Wapner on ""People's Court"" to trying to getting a better understanding of what it's like to be autistic and to further find weaknesses within himself discovering that we as a society has at least one weakness. And Charlie eventually has an epiphany that he himself is even more fragile than his brother Raymond and that he is willing to become a better human. One of the things I found admirable was how humble Hoffman was in his role. From a documentary on the making of ""Rain Man"", Hoffman actually had a lot of doubts that he wanted to be taken from the cast be replaced by Richard Dreyfuss. He really thought his role was horrid and unbearable. His perfectionist ways shows he wanted to play it both sensitive and carefully. But director Barry Levinson dismissed his request and from there it was all gravy to me. Hoffman and Cruise were creatively masterful in their respected roles as this movie deserves it's respects and recognition and it offers a kind of message we can all learn that in the end we're all small and our smallness is what helps bring the world around.",Rain Man
85,pc95,Heatfelt Bonding of Brothers,8,21 March 2009,"I've seen this movie a few times over the years and thought it about time to comment on it. It's over 20 years old now and you can see some of the late 80s stamped on it. Doesn't detract from it though. Dustin Hoffman really nails this part and well-deserves the Oscar. Additionally it excelled in it's human story of a left out bitter brother who begins to learn a thing or two besides the importance of money. The road trip culminating with the Vegas scenes showed an interesting growth and acceptance. Probably one of the best scenes in the movie was the Pink Cadillac pancake scene where Raymond identifies the maple syrup joke, and Chailie Babbitt (Cruise's character) picking up the impact of it later in his defense. He's grown by the end of the movie and we can easily identify it as he starts to un-latch from money and pick s up nuances of his past that is associated with his older impaired brother. It's the simple and endearing quality in the movie that makes it a strong picture and recommended deservedly winning best picture and director director.",Rain Man
86,philip_vanderveken,A good drama that gives an idea of what living with an autistic person must be like,8,13 July 2005,"It's not very difficult to see why this movie won four Oscars and was nominated for four more. The academy loves movies about people with difficult lives or with a handicap. Sometimes it almost feels like they are desperate to show that they too have a heart and so a director who hasn't won anything so far just has to make a movie with such a subject and he can be sure that he will hit the jackpot. Does that also mean that those movies are always excellent? No, although I wish they were. But it has to be said, not all of those movies are bad either, take for instance this ""Rain Man"". That's certainly a movie that deserves a closer watch.When the selfish yuppie Charlie Babbitt hears that his father has left behind a fortune after his death, but that he won't get it, he is furious. He has never had a good relationship with his father, who threw him out as a teenager, but he sure hoped for more than a now antique convertible. And to make things worse for Charlie, he hears that all the money goes to Raymond, an autistic man who he has never seen before in his life, but who appears to be his brother. And if that shock isn't yet big enough, the man also appears to be able to calculate complicated mathematical problems in his head with great speed and accuracy, but doesn't even understand what money can be used for. Enraged by all this 'injustice', Charlie kidnaps Raymond from his residential home, but then finds out how difficult it is to live with a man who only can live with his fixed routines...This wouldn't have been a typical eighties movie if there hadn't been a selfish yuppie in it of course, but I must say that it didn't bother me this time. The main reason for that is because it accentuates the contrast between the two men even more. Charlie has nothing else but money on his mind, while Raymond doesn't even know what money is. That's without any doubt a very smart idea which makes this movie work. And that's not the only good thing about this movie. The acting for instance is also very good. Especially Dustin Hoffman is excellent, but that has of course much to do with the role that he is playing. Still, his performance is very believable and remarkable. And even though I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, I must say that he was really very good in this movie. The role he was playing seemed to be written for him.All in all this is a very good movie that sure deserves to be seen. The acting and the story are far above average and give a good idea of what it must be like to live with an autistic person. I'm convinced that this movie certainly doesn't deserve a rating lower than 7.5/10.",Rain Man

89,wisewebwoman,Hoffman's Performance steals the movie,8,3 November 2002,"I bought this on DVD having seen it in the theatre in 1988 when it was released.  It was not as riveting to me on a second viewing, however.  Tom Cruise's performance, particularly, seems to fall far short of what I remember. I found his mannerisms sometimes quite irritating and his transformation into a rounded human being a little too sudden.  There is much to this movie - the brothers reflect two sides of the same coin.  Both autistic in their own way.  Raymond, the part played by Hoffman, genuinely so and Charlie, the part played by Tom, an emotionally crippled luxury car salesman, unable to feel or see anything outside the next deal. Some of the scenes are memorable, Charlie teaching his brother to dance, Charlie accommodating his brother's rituals in their everyday life together on the road, Charlie's girlfriend kissing Raymond.  Hoffman deserved his Oscar, not once does his performance fall below excellent. 8 out of 10.  A must see.",Rain Man
90,Howlin Wolf,Brilliant film. (Inconsequential Spoiler),10,12 December 2001,"This is more than just a twee, sappy, coping-with-illness melodrama.  The scripting and acting make it a pleasure to watch time and time again.  The characters are all recognisably human, and act realistically and with plausible motivation.  The film refuses to sentimentalise - or make a martyr out of - any of its characters.  It just concentrates on telling a story well, rightly assuming that this alone will be enough to provoke audience thought.  As a result, it's not an 'issue' movie, it's a movie that anyone can enjoy, which just happens to have autism as one of its topics.  Make no mistake, Charlie Babbitt is an emotionless [illegitimate child] at the film's opening, but Cruise's magnetic performance keeps the audience from becoming totally alienated.  It may be true that Hoffman's performance can be put purely down to imitation, but boy is he convincing as Raymond Babbitt, Charlie's long-lost autistic older brother.   I know, it sounds like the perfect recipe for standard Hollywood mushiness; but Barry Levinson's opus manages to sidestep that possible pitfall by virtue of being an amalgamation of several different film genres over the course of its running time.  The film is always interesting to watch because the characters are so well drawn, and if you watch it for the first time, you never know where the narrative is going to take them.  There are countless scenes that will probably be really pleasant surprises to new audience members, and that give Hoffman and Cruise a chance to flex their acting muscles.  You could watch these guys reading out the phone book and still be entertained; and to prove a point, Hoffman does just that... 
   You can either watch it from an objective standpoint, or get sucked in to the centre of the lives of the two main leads.  If you DO find yourself involved, you will be put through the emotional wringer.  There are scenes to make you laugh, cry, angry and reflective; yet this happens organically, and is in no way the result of manipulation.  The film is flawlessly cohesive from first scene to last.   Near-perfect cinema, and a deserving winner of the Best Picture Oscar of 1988; ""Rain Man"" is a triumph for all concerned.",Rain Man
91,michaeltrivedi,Good,6,2 October 2019,"Rain Man is a good film, perhaps a classic.

He needs his brother to receive an inheritance from his father.It's a really fun film actually. The film takes us to Hollywood, and shows us how two different people could actually get along really nicely. It's also love between family members.I would definitely recommend a watch.6 Stars",Rain Man
92,KUAlum26,"A Movie only ""The New Yorker"" could dislike",9,17 October 2007,"I recall shortly after I first saw this movie(late December,1988),coming across the review of this show in a copy of THe New Yorker MAgazine,where the reviewer dismissed this film as being ""a fawning piece of kitsch"". I was,naturally,rather displeased with this dismissal of the movie because,even though I understood that the New Yorker has(or had)a well-traveled rep of being a ""Snob"" magazine,it still seemed to give such a dismissive and short-sighted summary of a well-nuanced,humored and well-acted story.Charlie Babbit(Tom Cruise,modified from being the usual Tom) is a short-tempered car dealer whose life is built around ""making the sale"",and is less than thrilled to find out that,upon the death of his distant father,he's inherited a long-lost older brother. It doesn't improve things that said brother Raymond(Dustin Hoffman,in a performance as iconic as it is memorable)is an Autistic Savant,at least not at first. But as the two make a journey across country which is at least partly inspired by Charlie's discovery that Raymond's talent at counting impossibly high numbers and inscrutable attention to details and facts could be used to make him a fortune in LAs Vegas,they bond in an all to human,awkward,gentle and funny way.Director Barry Levinson was on his A-game through much of the 80s/early 90s(""Tin Men"",""Good Morning,Vietnam"",""Avalon""),and his almost mater-of-fact following of this relationship is a thing of cinematic beauty. While I cannot quite call this movie perfect,I dare anyone who isn't the most cross-eyed or jaundiced about movies to see this movie as anything less than a unique story of human bonding through pathos and frailties. A keeper of a film!",Rain Man
93,pyrocitor,"Touching, thought-provoking and refreshingly positive - a film to be cherished",9,17 February 2009,"It has become exceedingly difficult of late to mentally recreate in the public consciousness the essence of what made Rain Man such a rare success of a film. Having been reduced to a series of truncated sound bites and references in recent popular culture, with throwaway gags in The Simpsons and Tropic Thunder downgrading it as ""that film about the mentally challenged man"", public recognition of Rain Man has tragically often been reduced to associating it as being just another film exploiting the handicapped for the sake of Hollywood entertainment or melodrama. The fact that this is a misperception is a crucial link to what made Rain Man such an uncommon success in the first place - the fact that it never took upon such a reductionist approach, but instead was content to remain an honest, unpretentious film about people, is what makes the final product such a resonant accomplishment. Director Barry Levinson (whose career had never generated anything so noteworthy before nor has it since) delivers one of the defining films of the decade, a picture which manages to be touching, intelligent and just funny enough to counterbalance the emotional poignancy and maintain a human spin on the story. The film's screenplay by Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass is wise enough to avoid the temptation to milk the character of autistic savant Raymond Babbitt for excessive pathos or dour moralizing, or, even more unsettling, pass judgement on him through either alienating him as an outsider to society or playing him up as a tragic hero. Instead, Raymond is simply presented as a human being, with the script allowing the character and his actions to speak for themselves, making the film more accessible and truthful to audiences by drawing attention to the condition of autism with a noticeable absence of contrived Hollywood sentiment allowing the viewer to fill in the blanks and warm to the film independent of artistic manipulation. While the prospect of a road movie may have initially led to uneasy associations with Hollywood cliché, for once the context accomplishes its purpose with magnificent aplomb, allowing the viewer to bond with Raymond and his uneasy brother Charlie while sharing their journey to a surprisingly genuine extent. Rain Man is made all the more appealing through Levinson's confident refusal to bank on convention or strive for operatic Hollywood ambitions - instead, its intimate, simplistic scope make the important message all the more poignant, and the ensuing film all the more of a success.Nonetheless, the film can hardly disputed to be a flawless triumph, coming across as slightly too long, with 15-20 minutes which could have been easily trimmed. Similarly, for however honest and heartfelt the film's sentimental undertones may be, the emotional trappings do escalate to the point of excess at times. However, such concerns of Levinson's film crescendoing into a Hollywood sap-fest are quickly dispelled by a surprisingly tasteful and quietly poignant ending, and Hans Zimmer (making his Hollywood debut)'s bouncy, Caribbean style musical score puts a delightful spin on the film miles beyond anything a melancholy orchestral effort could have generated, adding a simultaneously light-hearted yet thoughtful tinge to the film. However, for all of the external plaudits, the film's main strength lies in its two primary performances, and on this front Rain Man proves an exceptional triumph. Dustin Hoffman is nothing less than flat out mesmerizing as the aforementioned autistic savant Raymond Babbitt. His extensive research into autism clearly showing through his impeccably crafted characterization, Hoffman fearlessly shoulders the emotional center of the story with a character unable to fathom emotions - the fact that Raymond remains endearing, lovable and incessantly credible throughout is a testament to Hoffman easily deserving every last bit of recognition for such a superb feat. Nonetheless, despite Hoffman's performance attracting the bulk of the attention, Tom Cruise equally proves his merit, displaying a previously unseen acting prowess and dedication which launched a transformation from flavour of the month teen star to a genuinely talented leading man. Cruise manages to morph his arrogant, self-serving yuppie Charlie Babbitt from a despicably manipulative character who effectively kidnaps his autistic brother in an attempt to weasel inheritance money from him to a surprisingly sympathetic man exercising his inner turmoil in a refreshingly fluid and convincing fashion, and Cruise channels his edgy energy into the character in an unexpectedly effective fashion. Valeria Golino is also a charming presence as Cruise's more kind-hearted girlfriend, adding much needed warmth and compassion to a story which in many ways is about two emotionally closed brothers learning to feel. All parties concerned deserve every ounce of credit for transforming a potentially cumbersome Hollywood sob story into a miraculously balanced, informative and entertaining film, (mostly) resisting contrived melodrama in favour of a more thought-provoking, positive narrative approach and making Rain Man a film to be cherished. -9/10",Rain Man
94,frankde-jong,"It takes two to tango, Hoffman and Cruise equally brilliant as lead actors",9,15 June 2021,"When the father of Charlie - (Tom Cruise) and Raymond Babbitt (Dustin Hoffman) dies, most of his money goes into a trust with the autistic Raymond as beneficiary. Charlie, who wasn't aware of the existence of Raymond, kidnaps him from the institution he is living in to enforce his ""fair share"" (according to himself) of the inheritance. This kidnap is the beginning of a strange kind of roadtrip.""Rain man"" is a film about autism. Seeing the film again after many years I realised how subject to inflation the term ""autism"" has been. Today it is almost synonimous with a person who is socially awkward. Today a character as Charlie Babbitt, who is very egocentric and not very well tuned to the feelings of other people at the beginning of the film, runs a serious risk to be labeled as ""autistic"". Raymond Babbitt on the other hand is a real disabled person, not able to function independently in society.At the time of release not all medical professionals were happy with the way Dustin Hoffman plays Raymond Babbitt. Raymond is not only autistic, he is also great with numbers. This may give the impression that an autistic person combines a low emotional intelligence with a high intellectual intelligence on one specific subject. This is not the case. Raymond Babbitt was modelled after Kim Peek an autistic savant. A person with the savant syndrome excells in one specific ability, while lagging behind in other abilities. The savant syndrome often coincides with autism, but is is not the other way around.I am not a medical professional, and I like the performance of Dustin Hoffman very much. As may be expected of a method actor he was thoroughly repared for his role. His Raymond Babbitt is not a freak and he is also not only pittiful. Holding on to his habits to the extreme (tapioca pudding on wednesday is tapioca pudding on wednesday, whatever is on the menu of the restaurant ad hand) we can imagine that he is driving his brother crazy. The character of Raymond Babbitt has no development and that is right. A happy ending in which Raymond would be cured would be rediculous.It takes two to tango, and also Tom Cruise plays a brilliant Charlie Babbitt. I guess accepting this part was not without risk for the glamour boy from ""Top gun"" (1986, Tony Scott). In the first place his counterpart being the renowned Dustin Hoffman, in the second place playing the not to sympathetic Charlie Babbitt.However, just as James Dean proved himself as a serious actor next to Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson in ""Giant"" (1956, George Stevens), so Tom Cruise matches Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain man"". The character of Charlie Babbitt may not be very likeable at te beginning, he is the only character with character development. Step for step he becomes closer with his brother and learns to think not only about himself. At the end he even thinks of putting sunburn on Raymond's face in time!",Rain Man
95,bobsgrock,"Wonderful, sweet, charming, and funny.",8,25 July 2008,"Since its release almost twenty years ago, Rain Man has become a perennial favorite of many movie lovers. And who can blame them? The story is very simple, yet one we all can relate to. It tells the journey of two brothers who never knew each other until their father died and are now taking a cross-country trip that turns out to change them. The older brother, Raymond, is autistic, and due to his unusual and repetitive behaviors, he seriously annoys his younger brother, Charlie. These two could not have lived more different lives. Raymond has been kept in a mental institution with a rigorous schedule to help his autism, while Charlie has been living the good life selling high-priced cars in Los Angeles. Charlie is selfish and only in anything for his own benefit. But, once he meets Raymond, the circumstances change how he reacts and he is forced to really listen and pay attention to somebody he never knew existed.This is a film that grows on you as you think more about it. This movie is so well done, you don't really have to think about anything except the story and what will happen to these two next. The acting is terrific with Dustin Hoffman nailing the part as an autistic, yet somewhat brilliant man who has been sheltered his whole life. Tom Cruise is spectacular, better than Hoffman in some scenes. He is so good at balancing the selfish, yuppie self in the first part, then becoming a caring human being in the last act. All along the way, there are many scenes to make you laugh at Raymond's behavior, as well as cringe at the dangers of autism, a disease not well known at the time of this movie. Overall, this is a wonderful, sweet, charming, and funny movie that drives home the point that sometimes its better to know someone for a few days than your whole life, because it might change you for the rest of your life.",Rain Man

97,film-critic,"After 21 years, ""Rain Man"" floats into mediocrity...",5,23 July 2009,"This discussion needs to begin with the idea that whatever critique comes of this film; it is not in direct correlation to those that suffer from autism. The words written herein are only used to discuss the film ""Rain Man"", not to have a lengthy discussion on my thoughts with this serious condition. With that said, I recently had the opportunity to sit down and watch ""Rain Man"" commercial-free, and unedited by TV – viewing it the way audiences may have seen it in theaters – and I wondered – is ""Rain Man"" that wonderful of a film, or we just all taken-aback by the intense performance by Dustin Hoffman? This is a tough question as I was somewhat bored with the story that Morrow and Base put together, yet each scene that Hoffman was in I was glued to the screen watching his idiosyncrasies, his apt ability to make this character out of merely studied influences. Hoffman deserved the Oscar for this film, but again, looking back – was it deserving of everything else that it won? ""Rain Man"" recycles this age old story that Hollywood is familiar with, a dying family member leaves a will to another, unknown, family member that eventually becomes the savior of the film. The groundlings to this story are not anything new to direct-to-video markets, but with Hoffman and Cruise headlining, there is more of a mass appeal. What pulls this film up is, as already stated, Hoffman – continuing to prove his worth – but yet slips downward yet again with Cruise. He seems to be a bit of a loose cannon in this role. For the first moment that we see him, he is this fast-talking, smooth sailing entrepreneur that seems to be going through this financial crisis. Randomly he is able to leave, drive from California to Florida and finally making a pit stop in Ohio for his father's funeral. Upon arriving he becomes bitter and more sinister as he learns that he is not inheriting his father's wealth, but instead has a brother that will have it all. As we discover whom this is – our film changes from this family plight to this road movie – going all over our great nation to demonstrate brotherly love. Yet – from the moment this voyage begins, we see less and less of the Cruise's initial character and we are welcomed into the third stage of Cruise, caring man who is just trying to survive.Where ""Rain Man"" gets itself into trouble is that Hoffman is so good, we are unable to fully develop Cruise's character. We are glued to Hoffman on the screen, and thus Cruise can get away with anything (slipping in and out of character within scenes) because are eyes are focused on one man, and one man only. Cruise does give a performance in this film, but it seems stale and disjointed. His emotion never seems to come out, especially with the very dark ending – leaving us with no hope for the future? The bleakest of endings, I was left wondering how much this would have worked if we were to focus on Cruise's character throughout, only giving us glimpses of Hoffman throughout the film. I would have liked to see his inner turmoil, his struggle without the glossiness that was handed to us. As a man with no money, he was easily able to maneuver anything that his brother wanted? The suits for Vegas were not free. Yet, we seem to let this slide off our backs when we talk about this film because we are all in awe of Hoffman, which we have every right to be. Personally, Hoffman deserves all the kudos for his role, but watch Cruise carefully; I believe he gives one of the worst performances of his career.Then there is Barry Levinson. There is so much that I like about him as a director and there are moments in this film that he pulls your heartstrings hard – and with the greatest of ease. He never gave us a false impression of autism – there are these moments where we believe Hoffman will say something that doesn't fit, there are plenty of music-leading moments, but instead he pulls the rug and gives us honesty and truth. I appreciated that and adored Levinson's choice of cinematography, but the ending needed work. Once we were out of the car, we were rushed to a conclusion. The less-tender moments at the end didn't congeal well, leaving us with false hope and darkness. This isn't a happy film, and I just don't think Levinson had a way to wrap it up. The train scene was disappointing and disastrous to say the least.Overall, I think I am going to answer my own question. ""Rain Man"" doesn't seem to last the test of time. Hoffman's performance kept the over two hours worth the viewing, but I don't think I could watch this again. ""Rain Man"" is a mediocre film fueled by one great performance. There isn't any meat to the overall story, and at times it just seem to flop around on the floor waiting for something to put it back into the vastness of cinema. ""Rain Man"" did sweep the Oscars that year, giving everyone that feeling of joy – but nearly 21 years later, it just doesn't remain a memorable film.Grade: *** out of *****",Rain Man
98,mentalcritic,Hurting the very same people it proclaims to be about,2,7 May 2007,"When I first saw Rain Man in 1989, I thought I was witnessing something very tragic and terrible. Overwhelmed with pity for Hoffman's character, I never gave the film's contents a second thought. Then, in 2004, I finally learned why I had been subjected to so much abuse during my childhood and adolescence by teachers and healthcare professionals that I can not sleep a wink at night. Yes, like hundreds of thousands of angry adults, I was diagnosed with a higher-functioning form of autism. And then my pity for Hoffman's character, or any semblance of respect for the man who wrote him, was replaced by something much, much worse. There is fear, there is anger, and then there is outright hatred. Among autistic individuals who grew up in the 1980s, Ronald Bass is easily one of the most hated men who has ever lived, and his attempt to backpedal to take into account the fact that autism is a spectrum rather than some crippling disease that simply must be cured has only made it worse for him.Aside from being very badly written (real people with high-functioning autism do not scream, cry, and hit themselves just because a variation occurs in their plans), it is also plain ignorant. This is not only apparent in the words of the performers, it is also apparent in the words of its supporters. Dustin Hoffman once said that playing this role was very easy because his character was essentially in a cocoon, while one commenter here tells us that character is ""totally unable to comprehend the real world around him"". Both show such a ridiculous ignorance of autism that it would be funny if this matter were not so damned serious. Even today, as people try to tell us to our faces that we are not autistic because we do not scream and cry when someone breaks wind in our direction, we struggle to get our voices heard among so-called charities that are ostensibly set up for our benefit, yet do not allow our input. Supporters might call Rain Man the way forward for ""issue films"". I call it dehumanisation.It also strikes me as flatly ironic that Tom Cruise, a man so ignorant that he makes creationists seem reasonable, does not like to emphasise his involvement in this film when autism has exploded into a burning issue on the world stage. That should honestly tell everyone who has not yet learned what real people with autism think of the matter all they need to know. The reason why Cruise does not point to Rain Man and claim this is evidence that he knows something about the suffering of the neurodivergent that he also helps contribute to is because a smart agent researched the issue properly and informed him that real organisations representing the autistic such as Aspies For Freedom would have his guts for garters. It also says a lot about a film, and none of it good, when he happens to be the most convincing performer involved. None of the other actors save Hoffman seem remotely convinced about the dialogue they are delivering, and in fact some of them look very concerned that they are coming across as ignorant. Rightly so.It is not often when a singular problem so utterly destroys a film, but the bad writing in Rain Man just utterly takes the cake. In Philadelphia, a real blueprint for so-called issue films, one key piece of dialogue from Tom Hanks describes the stigma and isolation of being infected with an illness that is almost universally fatal. Philadelphia gets it right because it goes to great pains to emphasise that the illness itself is bad enough, but it is the attitude of the beholder that makes it as unbearable to live with as it is. And while Rain Man attempts to do the same, it fumbles the ball by not just displaying ignorance on the part of everyone around Hoffman, but by practically announcing that its makers were just as ignorant, if not more so. Now, with reliable testimonies to the effect that such directors as Tim Burton or Steven Spielberg are on the autistic spectrum, the silence about the erroneous nature of films like Rain Man is literally killing us.You see, in the hysteria that films like Rain Man help to whip up, quacks are convincing parents to use unsound and unsafe medical therapies on their autistic children, with total disregard for the fact that such therapies can and already have resulted in fatalities. Autism cure charities attempt to block the autistic out of discussions of their own affairs, and attempt to negate our objections through exclusion. So when I tell you that Rain Man is not the Schindler's List or Philadelphia equivalent its defenders proclaim, but more akin to Triumph Des Willens, I want you to understand my full meaning here. Over a decade ago, I went to a museum in which products from eras gone by were exhibited. One exhibit, essentially a hall of shame, showed us ugly artifacts such as Darkie toothpaste or other such racially stereotypical adverts that would only be acceptable in a society where a social minority is legally subjected to second-class citizenry. And if we lived in a society that cared as much about the autistic as Ronald Bass would like us to believe he does, Rain Man would be part of a similar exhibit.Rain Man is a two out of ten film. I wish it were possible to give negative scores, but c'est la vie. That people mistake it for a good film about autism is a mark of shame upon the entire human race.",Rain Man
99,hnt_dnl,Cruise EQUAL to Hoffman!,10,8 April 2010,"I recall back in 1989 right after BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY came out and it was obvious that Tom Cruise was going to get his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor for that film, Gene Siskel after reviewing it said that it wasn't BORN that proved that Tom Cruise could act, but RAIN MAN, which came out the previous year 1988. It was at this point in my (early) film-viewing life that I learned that some of the true best performances are not when actors play showy roles designed to win Oscars, but when they play ""regular Joes"".In RAIN MAN, Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt, a rather mean-spirited, selfish yuppie whose car business is failing and he needs a lot of money to save it. Charlie's father has just died and Charlie thinks he's about to inherit a fortune, but instead all he leaves him his classic Buick convertible and the rest of the money is put in a trust to go to Charlie's heretofore unknown autistic savant half-brother Raymond, played by Best Actor Dustin Hoffman.As far as I'm concerned, Hoffman is one of the top 5 film actors of all time, and as impressed as I was with how convincing he was in this role, I was EQUALLY impressed with how perfect Cruise's performance was! This film does not work if Charlie's reactions to Raymond come across as somewhat false, sentimental, predictable, or schmaltzy and Cruise avoids all these traits and delivers a real performance. One particular scene that I found to be incredibly real ironically had nothing to do with Raymond and was before his character was introduced. When Charlie finds out his father left him essentially nothing, he spoke in a fast-talking, ranting manner summing up his disgust and disdain for what his father had done to him; it underscores the essence Charlie. Cruise had obviously played jerky, rather unlikable characters before, but in RAIN MAN, he is working with a much better script and this just feels like the first REAL performance of his career. Now, that said, one really has to be blown away by how great Hoffman is playing Raymond. There is not one false note in his performance and so his Best Actor Oscar is thoroughly deserved. Can't really argue with it. But retrospect is a son of a gun and I'll be darned if Cruise did not at the very least deserve a Best Actor NOMINATION! That would have been fitting as well. I know who the other 4 nominees are and have seen those films and performances and NONE of them are as good as Cruise was in this! RAIN MAN, the Best Picture of 1988, was directed by Best Director Barry Levinson. What's amazing about the film is that it is essentially a two-character play but always remains watchable due to these 2 enduring performances. We get to see a genuine relationship (as good as it can) develop between these 2 characters and it never really gets boring or devolves into schmaltz or sentimentality. Just genuine character interaction and development. Great film.",Rain Man
100,aciessi,"Love, Rain, and Wapner",9,12 June 2015,"Rain Man has become somewhat of a trivial joke these days, but it's a film you must watch. Unexpectedly, it's one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. The pairing of the sleazy car- salesmen and his incredibly profound autistic brother provides an interesting, almost hilarious companionship. Charlie's waining patience with Raymond is very funny, considering how little people actually understand the eccentricities of autism. But the more we find out about Raymond, the more we feel for him, and the more we want Charlie to fall for him. Without a doubt, this is Dustin Hoffman's best performance. This is is a feat of brilliant method acting, that only comes once in a lifetime for an actor of such electrifying theatrics. It looks like it was a risk to his mental stability, but who wouldn't accept the role of Raymond, and completely disappear in this character? I think Raymond is one of film's most groundbreaking characters, and he brought to the forefront, a syndrome that even to this day, few people understand, or even care to understand. This is a fantastic movie.",Rain Man

The film won a People's Choice Award as the ""Favorite Dramatic Motion Picture.""Rain Man is a road film with a difference, featuring one of the most showy, and admittedly memorable leading performances in recent years. Hoffman is remarkably meticulous in his portrayal of the immutable, repetitive idiot savant. Yet the film stands and falls on Cruise: it later became a cliché that he chose characters who progressed from arrogant egotism to selflessness, yet that is precisely what is required here. Working from a script that pushes all the right buttons, Barry Levinson directs with snap, energy and a good deal of wit.",Rain Man
102,bankofmarquis,Hoffman and Cruise pair well,8,11 June 2020,"Some films grow over time, some diminish and others are unfairly maligned. I feel that such is the case with 1988's RAINMAN, the film that won 4 Oscars including Best Director, Actor and Picture. I, too, thought that this film might be ""cringe-worthy"" in the harsh light of 2020, so it was with some trepidation that we fired it up as my wife's choice for ""Secret Cinema"" in our house.I need not have worried for this film, it's themes and performances hold up very, very well more than 30 years later.Starring Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise, RAINMAN tells the story of selfish, self-absorbed, high flying Charlie Babbitt who is shocked to discover that he did not inherit the estate of his estranged father - it went to his brother, Raymond (who Charlie knew nothing about). Finding out that Raymond is autistic, Charlie kidnaps Raymond, figuring he could con his way to his Father's fortune.The first, most surprising, part of this film is the wonderful chemistry between Cruise and Hoffman. They play off each other very well and seem to have a natural rapport. Hoffman, of course, won the Oscar for Best Actor that year - and it is well deserved, even though some claim that his characterization of Raymond is a ""gimmick"". I think that is not giving the character - and the performance - it's due, for I found (on this rewatch) that Hoffman's portrayal of Raymond is layered, sensitive and sincere. He builds a character that you want to root for.The surprise of this film is Cruise's performance as Charlie Babbitt. At the beginning he is playing the ""yuppie"" jerk quite well - focused only on himself - and his possessions and the money he can make, Charlie is not very likable and is, if I must confess, a bit one-dimensional to start. But something happens along the cross-country road trip that Charlie takes Raymond on - his character (and Cruise's performance) grows and shapes into a fully three-dimensional person that has good traits and bad traits. It is one of Cruise's finest performances - and it is a shame that it was not rewarded with an Oscar nomination.Director Barry Levinson (Director of the under-rated gem DINER) does a nice job keeping the pace - and the mood - of the film moving forward. This could easily have devolved into an over-sentimental and ""schmaltzy"" feel good flick, Levinson finds the right balance to make this a ""feel good"" film.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Rain Man
103,SmileysWorld,Best acting performance I have ever seen,9,28 December 2001,"Dustin Hoffman's performance as Raymond Babbitt is,bar none,the best acting performance I have ever seen.I have never seen an actor get so deeply immersed in a character than Hoffman does in this film.He is excellent here,and he deserved nothing less than the Oscar he won for it.As for Tom Cruise,his performance as Raymond's childish and hotheaded brother is also worthy of note.To watch his character slowly shed his ignorance throughout the course of the film was indeed a delight.If you have not seen it,don't deprive yourself any longer.Buy it.It's a keeper.",Rain Man
104,sjanders-86430,Today this would be a different story.,10,4 April 2021,"Today this film is outdated. First of all a high functioning autistic child would be kept in the home. There are early childhood evaluations and teachers who know what autism is and how to develop a child who is on the spectrum. Today there is an industry of people who come to your home and show you how best to raise a child with autism. Also the repetitive speech can be treated with drugs. Dustin Hoffman tried to drown his brother, and that is why he was institutionalized. Tom Cruise finds his brother. He takes him to Las Vegas and has him count cards. They make big bucks. Ultimately the two brothers bond. Barry Levinson has to be given the top prize for pulling off such a tough topic and making it very interesting. Dustin Hoffman was perfect. I loved the way he walked closely behind Cruise. I wonder why he wasn't taught about money. Today that would never happen. If a child was institutionalized, he would be taught everything necessary to survive, especially money.",Rain Man

He received next to nothing from his father's fortune and he has a brother who's existence was kept secret all his life. He begins a desperate attempt to convince the lawyers that he deserves half of the fortune by using his autistic brother as exchange but ends up bonding with him, while all the money are put on a distant plan.It's an interesting approach in terms of character and point of view changes which occur suddenly for an introverted person who thought only about himself. Due to the high quality of the two main actors and their execution, we're presented a very interesting and emotional story of an unexpected bond between two very different characters, despite the natural difficulties of one of them. Their adventures are described in great detail but unfortunately the action is pretty static and tends to become repetitive. Although trying hard to induce something different towards the end, the movie's finale is abrupt and predictable.It's a very good movie, especially when talking about acting and characters, but it left me with the impression that they could have done a bit more about the plot, especially when it comes to the final part.

107,Atreyu_II,"Dramatic, but simultaneously hilarious",7,10 August 2007,"""Rain Man"" is a reasonable movie. It might be classified as a drama, but let's face it: it is both drama and comedy because it has lots of hilarious moments.This movie serves as a lesson of life as well. I consider it a lesson of life as much as ""Pay It Forward"", ""Regarding Henry"", ""Dead Poets Society"" and ""Scent of a Woman"" - each one at its own way, of course.It shows us what it's like to be an autistic but it also shows us that people can change for better and stop worrying only about themselves to worry about the others.That's what happens with Charlie Babbitt: a selfish, greedy, spoiled and explosive yuppie. When he finds out that he has a brother (named Raymond) he only cares about the money and his relationship with Raymond is very temperamental. Raymond starts by taking the quick-tempered Charlie to the limits of his patience, but later ends up taking Charlie out of his selfish world.But is Charlie a hateable character? Absolutely not! His short temper actually makes him very funny. Whenever he explodes because of Raymond is hilarious. Charlie uses often insulting vocabulary, but in a funny way.""Rain Man"" seems a simple movie at times, but it has beautiful moments too, especially with the always glorious help of naturally gorgeous sceneries.Dustin Hoffman is great in this role, but in my opinion this is not his finest performance: here he is very limited and repetitive both in speeches and emotions. However, Tom Cruise has his greatest performance ever in this movie - he's amazing in this role!The soundtrack is typical from the 80's, which means that it is very good. Most of the themes are instrumental and great, but the opening song is awesome: ""Iko Iko"", sung by The Belle Stars.By the way, ""Rain Man"" has also some beautiful and fabulous machines: various unities of the Lamborghini Countach, a Ferrari 400i and a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.Until the first hour and a few more minutes, this movie is excellent or very close to that. However, the second half isn't as good. Far from being terrible, it becomes a little boring. Part of the reason is because I like better the explosive Charlie than the ""good Charlie"". I have other reasons, but sometimes I'm not very good at explaining things, so I will leave that behind.",Rain Man

Certainly the casting of Hoffman (a performance as a disabled person that is believable and not insulting) and Cruise (yuppie with a - hidden - heart of gold) helps. As does the shinning glitter of middle America and well chosen soundtrack.The movie is just a pleasant drift-down-the-river with a few small laughs and twists along the route.

110,rebeljenn,"Good performances, but could have been edited",6,18 March 2006,"'Rain Man' is a story of characters on a quest to find identity and to come together in brotherly love. Cruise's character is afraid of commitment and bitter with his life and his father; he meets his autistic brother in a mental hospital in Ohio after being told that his father left nearly everything to him in his will. Cruise's character has every intention of taking all of this from his autistic brother, played by Hoffman. Hoffman's character ends up being kidnapped by Cruise, and the two embark on a journey from Ohio to California. Along the way, Cruise's character learns patience and other virtues while using Hoffman, then realises his potential. Both characters do learn something about themselves.The magic of this film takes place in the first hour to an hour and a half, and then it gets pretty dull and some of the sub-story seems as though it could have been edited out. This would have probably made a better and more coherent film. (For example, although the romance did portray a sense of what Cruise's character was like, the continued romantic sub-plot did little for the film.) This is not an excellent film, but it does have some good elements, including performance and story - although some of this could have been edited out to make a better film.",Rain Man

Institutionalised since the 1960s but now the beneficiary of his late fathers inheritance of $3m or so USD.Of course Raymond does not understand the magnitude of the inheritance but his brother Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) does. Charlie has also just found out he has a brother at the reading of the will.Charlie is a yuppie, struggling businessman with debts to service in his home city of Los Angeles. Raymond is living alone except for the company of fellow patients and staff in a Cincinnati institution.Charlie befriends Raymond (I dont think he has or realises he has any choice in the matter!) and 'kidnaps' him from the institution to visit L.A. A simple three hour or so internal flight becomes a multiple day road trip when Raymond refuses point blank to fly, never mind drive on the fastest highways!In a series of locations and situations a bond develops between the two very different brothers. Charlie softening his stance significantly in the process. Hoffman in particular gives a great performance showing the affects of his character's mental health condition on both brother's.Oh QANTAS have never crashed is my most memorable line, especially when preparing to fly to Australia!",Rain Man
112,AhmedSpielberg99,W-O-N-D-E-R-F-U-L-L.,8,5 August 2018,"I finally got to watch this movie. It really was on my radar for a very very long time. The movie's story is not unconventional by any means, but thanks to Levinson's smart direction, Ronald Bass' powerful script that adds a lot of fresh details, and the terrific performances from the leads, Rain Man feels very original. In fact, I can even see how the ending would be from the beginning, but that didn't make the slightest issue for me. Barry Levinson presented the movie in a way that manages to generate emotion in their audience without ever feeling melodramatic. That's because Levinson avoided many clichés, the most important one of them is the typical way of storytelling. Instead of making a movie that relies on drama, he made road-trip movie that produces a catharsis of emotions more than you would ever imagine. As a matter of fact, the movie feels as if it has a character-driven story, except it's actually not. And the result is a movie that has a very restricted and bound plot, but it never feels that way. While watching the movie, I felt that I can't expect anything. I felt as if I was watching a movie with a picaresque tale, but it's actually far from being that. 
 
Unlike Wag the Dog, Rain Man has a lot of memorable moments that will stay with you forever. In other words, Barry Levinson made Rain Man feels more cinematic than Wag the Dog. But I'll say it again, the movie never feels overly sentimental. Dustin Hoffman gave one of the Best Performances in his career, but I really can't say if he had deserved the Oscar more than Tom Hanks in Big or not. Tom Cruise's performance is really what stands out in my opinion. I think he gave one of, if not his best performance ever. I don't want to spoil anything for who haven't watched this wonderful film yet, but there are a lot of scenes that show Cruise's acting abilities, and prove that he is underappreciated as an actor who really can deliver some exceptional dramatic performances, not just doing incredible stunts and running. I think he deserved to be nominated for an Oscar at the least. That being said, I have some issues with Rain Man. The first one is that the beginning was a bit rushed and very fast-paced for its own good. Specially because the drama kicks off very early, and the movie should have taken its time to represent it. The entire message of the movie has been literally revealed near the end by Tom Cruise, so that's an obvious, and a bit annoying problem.Also, the ending could have been a little bit shorter. However, the last 15-20 minutes has some of the smartest, and most powerful dialogue ever written. And it also has the most intense and moving moments in the movie. The moments that show Raymond math prowess were very hilarious and funny at the beginning, then they became kinda overused, but after that they were taken advantage of very cleverly.Overall, I loved Rain Man so much, and I really don't know why there are many people who think it didn't deserve the Oscar for Best Picture. It's meticulously written, impressively directed, beautifully shot, superbly acted, engaging, moving, touching, and above all that, it's very enjoyable. Also, Zimmer's score is electrifying!(8.5/10)",Rain Man

Charlie wants to be given his inheritance money and it's refused as his Father effectively wrote him out of his will, instead the money's given to Raymond and Charlie takes Raymond away (basically kidnapping him but he justifies it to himself as they're brothers) and refuses to allow him back into the home unless he gets his money.

His role as ""Raymond"" is true for many others who have this type of condition inside. A couple of huge gaps sort of made me wonder about how this one really stood out with faith and redemption knocking on the door. They try desperately hard to show off a chunk of that human feeling, but it hardly exists. The real downside is Tom Cruise for his portrayal of a ""hothead"", even if everything falls down on him and his life. He doesn't seem to be treating his long lost brother very well, but he is funny at one incident where he shouts over buying undies at a Cleveland K-Mart. That does provide an example of living with simple adjustments for Hoffman, though. I also don't understand how Hoffman would become a human calculator of himself in solving some terribly complex math problems. That, of course, is another example for the film, as people have the ability to be smarter than others, but this sounds like another idea thrown into a Hollywood movie that sounds too impossible in reality, or even to achieve.

122,caa821,Outstanding still,10,9 December 2006,"It's hard to believe this film is approaching 20 years since its release. I always enjoy seeing it again - for the story, characters and performances, of course; but also, having been born and grown up in Cincinnati, I recognize all of the areas and locations where the initial portions of the story are filmed - from Cruise's arrival following his father's death, until the finally get on the road towards California, in the vintage Buick.Virtually all movies require some creative license in their stories, but there are two here which alway give me a bit of pause. The major one is that - even though his father is clearly characterized as a distant individual, and one who had to institutionalize Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) following his wife's death - it is illogical that Charlie (Tom Cruise) would never previously been aware he had a brother.Charlie, a toddler at this time, might very well have forgotten Raymond, and the father may have wished to spare his younger son from anguish. But the time line of the story would have required that during Charlie's 14 years or so remaining at home, from 2 until he was 16 or 17, he gained no awareness of his brother at all. 14+ years of the father's visits to the institution, telephone calls, notes and letters, etc., and Charlie never had a clue? Seems unlikely - but, at the same time, wouldn't have this story if he'd known.The other (minor) point which I find illogical is their shopping for clothes and shoes (and barbering) when they get to Vegas. Charlie has maxed-out his cards, and hocks his valuable watch for a stake to take advantage of Raymond's prodigious skills at the blackjack table.I've been to Caesar's, and these shops in their arcade. There is no way Charlie could have gotten out of their shops with those suits, clothing accessories and shoes, plus the hair cuts, for less than nearly half of the proceeds from his watch. Even somebody with the tastes Charlie had obviously acquired in the film, he's have taken a more economical route to clothing and grooming them.Of course, these are minor in view of the overall presentation, and its heartfelt story of the characters coming together, and especially Charlie's finally growing-up and acquiring a fresh, valuable perspective in his life - and adding to that of his brother, in spite of the barriers and hidden recesses in Raymonds personality.A real classic, which should remain so for many years to come.",Rain Man

Dustin makes the character even more likable and by the end of the film you begin to love him as much as Tom. He's brilliantly observed and quite remarkable.The script is full of wit and fantastic characterisation. Tar-tum would be proud of the great character observations in the glorious screenplay. I also liked how the film didn't have a typical Hollywood slushy ending, but actually ended humanly and realistically with a hint of tear being placed in the audiences eye. It's fantastic.""Rain Man"" is quite simply an ray of sunshine, a truly heart-warming and moving experience that everyone should experience. It's funny, touching and most importantly carries a message that has a heart. It really is a wonderful film and if you haven't seen it, you must!",Rain Man

Indeed, absolutely nothing happened during this one-week road trip where no twist spice up a terribly predictable and flaccid plot.The script is too redundant and extremely flat, unemotional and not that interesting scenes keep following each other: it's long, it's slow, anyway it's boring to death.Tom Cruise, at the beginning of his career, is correct, as for Dustin Hoffman he is almost annoying in this role that reeked an Oscar, but most importantly the chemistry between the two actors is imperceptible which is really prejudicial since their relationship is at the heart of the movie.Rain Man, barely passable, therefore appears to be a big letdown considering the masterpiece rank a lot of people give it.",Rain Man

Yet this same realism holds the film back by keeping it too grounded despite making the viewers beg for at least one tear-jerking scene that never comes.Hoffman certainly gives an inspired performance that is both very convincing in his disability and able to demand endearment from the audience. However, much of that endearment is due to Cruise who had the extremely difficult role of shaping the audience's emotions around Hoffman's cold and offputting character.

Autistic Savant was rarely heard of at that time, but Dustin Hoffman's gestures, tones, and look complete Raymond in a very respectable way. Tom Cruise...

In an effort to get the 3 million dollars left to his brother, Charlie kidnaps him and they embark on a roadtrip across the USA.This is a good movie pushed to greatness by Hoffman's spectacular performance. He provides one of the greatest performances in movie history and rightfully deserves his Oscar. Accompanying this powerhouse performance is a beautiful story. The humour was well handled and the story is very thought provoking. It's a very entertaining movie, held on its pedestal by Hoffman.Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass wrote this movie and did fantastic jobs at it. It's a funny, harrowing and thought provoking tale that really drives emotion in the audience and makes you care deeply about the characters. With no spoilers, the ending for this movie is perfect and it couldn't have been done any better. Well done Morrow and Bass.What can I honestly say about Hoffman that hasn't already been said before. His delivery, his mannerisms, his facial expressions - all of it is so contrived and focused and pure; it is truly one of the best performances ever given by an actor... ever. Cruise was our leading man and does a very good job as that. I really bought Charlie's arc and character development throughout the film and this is the perfect example of character redemption in a movie. He started off as a jerk but then you see his arc unfold and begin to really understand him. Props to Cruise for this but, once more, the writers, and even Hoffman's performance, deserve the credit. My main issue is Valeria Golino as Susana. Her performance wasn't anything too good and her entire character was completely pointless.It is a technically proficient movie and I have no real gripes as to the way it was shot, edited or lit.This movie is funny yet also sad. It is dramatic yet also melodramatic. The characters are lovable yet also loathsome. It's truly an example of what genius writing, a layered performance and fantastic direction can do.

134,roghache,Remarkable portrait of an autistic brother,8,14 March 2006,"This is a wonderful touching film and one that gives the average viewer with little first hand experience a touch of insight into autism.The plot revolves around the two Babbitt brothers, Raymond and Charlie. After the death of their father, the handsome, materialistic, self absorbed Charlie (Tom Cruise) learns that he has a long lost older brother named Raymond, who's autistic and also the sole beneficiary of his father's fortune. Charlie kidnaps his brother from the mental institution where he is resident, and the pair set out on a cross country journey. Charlie starts out trying to manipulate some of the inheritance out of his brother. Raymond is an idiot savant with an incredible ability to do mathematical problems in his head. So Charlie decides to take advantage of his brother's remarkable talent by taking him to Los Vegas so he can count cards. Gradually, he starts getting rather attached to his endearing (but sometimes quite difficult to deal with) savant brother. As time passes, an unusual relationship and close bond develops between the successful and mentally handicapped brothers, as Charlie realizes that he is indeed ""his brother's keeper"". One brother (Charlie) changes during the film, while the other (Raymond) remains pretty constant. Tom Cruise is memorable as the brother learning to love and care for his brother, coping with the challenges of autism. Dustin Hoffman is of course absolutely brilliant as Raymond, the role for which he won a much deserved Oscar. He is an extremely endearing character, with a particular fondness for Judge Wapner of The People's Court, which he watches every afternoon religiously, without fail. Wait until you see Raymond taking dancing lessons. By the movie's end, every viewer has learned to love Raymond; he's everyone's brother.Very touching ending which I won't give away. An incredible film, an education in autism, and a legendary savant (who seems real, not fictional) living on in our hearts.",Rain Man

Along the way, they grow close, and the yuppie finally begins to see his brother as family rather than another way to get rich. However, when he learns that his autistic brother is a mathematical genius with the best memory he's ever seen, he decides to make a stop in Vegas. Rain Man is a classic feel good movie that people of all ages should enjoy.The best part about Rain Man is that it manages to be absolutely hilarious in some scenes while being tear jerking dramatic in the next. Movies that can mix genres like that and still flow together as one are automatically good in my eyes. Some movies try to do both but just end up looking sloppy. Not Rain Man. The story is a very cool inspirational story. It's one of those movies that brings a smile to your face because of how cool it is. The dialogue is genius. For a movie that consists primarily of two guys, one of which is autistic, the dialogue is still smart, funny, and witty.The acting is terrific. Dustin Hoffman pulls off one of his best performances, and he rightfully won an Oscar for it.

While educated through entertainment, we ween't being insulted but engaged only because Dustin Hoffman's portrayal was so believable and comedic at the same time. I left it here as recommended against my better judgment as the exposure outweighs any plausible insult. Raymond blurts out, ""Three minutes to Wapner"", and we all laugh, but how different is that habit from folks out there who behave in the same way and are not mentally handicapped? (Don't make me late for my hockey game!) The foul language used throughout by the older brother almost simplifies the frustration that caretakers of autistic family members must experience. I'd have preferred more of a selfish less epiphany by the movies' end. Another knock is the music soundtrack hardly matches the movie experience, yet it remains a must see as Dustin Hoffman deserves all of the accolades for making Autism an attainable story.",Rain Man
137,steiner-sam,"Has held up well in the past 33 years, although some of the scenes stretch credulity",7,19 October 2021,"The film is a road movie set in the 1980s following two brothers very different in age, one of whom is an autistic savant.Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) is a fast-talking, self-centered, shady dealer in luxury sports cars who is in financial trouble. He's based in Los Angeles and has been estranged from his wealthy widower father since he was a teenager and his father let him sit in jail for ""stealing"" his father's antique car when Charlie was 16. Charlie also has a troubled relationship with his girlfriend, Susanna (Valeria Golino).When his father dies suddenly, Charlie goes to Cincinnati, assuming he'll inherit a fortune. He learns the bulk of the estate has been put in trust for a brother he does not remember. Raymond Babbitt (Dustin Hoffman) is in an institutional facility run by Dr. Gerald Bruner (Jerry Molen), who is also the manager of Raymond's trust. Charlie meets Raymond and tries to bargain with Dr. Bruner for part of the estate, but is rejected.Charlie then kidnaps Raymond and begins to take him back to Los Angeles, hoping to get control of the money. Along the six-day road trip (Raymond refuses to fly), Charlie begins to learn more about his brother, who is an autistic savant with a remarkable memory and a facility with numbers. Along the way, Charlie learns why Raymond was put in the institution, and that when Charlie as a child began to talk, he called Raymond Rain Man""."" Charlie develops genuine affection for Raymond and tries to gain custody of him.I don't know how current science would assess the portrayal of autism and the savant syndrome portrayal in ""Rain Man."" Raymond's character is a combination of characteristics that have been found in autistic savants.I think the film has held up quite well in the past 33 years, although some of the scenes stretch credulity beyond bounds. Tom Cruise is overly clueless at the beginning of the film but plays his role well. Dustin Hoffman is very good in his portrayal of a certain kind of emotional flatness that gets interspaced with strong coping mechanisms when Raymond was placed in uncomfortable situations.",Rain Man

140,dr_clarke_2,"Rain Man is a great film because of Dustin Hoffman, but he's by no means the only good thing in it",8,7 July 2020,"Barry Levinson's 1988 Academy Award for Best Picture winner Rain Man is of course most famous for Dustin Hoffman's astonishing performance as an autistic savant. But to simply remember it for that alone is to do it a disservice; it isn't Hoffman alone that makes it a good film.
Rain Man tells the story of a selfish and cocky car salesman - Charlie Babbitt - discovering that he has a hitherto-unknown autistic older brother, and try to exploit him to get his hands on their late father's fortune. As he gets to know his brother Raymond however, he gradually starts to bond with him over the course of the road trip they are forced into when Raymond refuses to fly, and ultimately - and rather predictably - realises that his newly discovered sibling is more important to him than money. Whilst it is Raymond who every casual viewer remembers, it is Charlie who undergoes an actual emotional journey here (with Raymond as the catalyst) and through whom the plot is focalised. There's a critical scene when Charlie realises that Raymond was his childhood imaginary friend Rain Man, which is arguably the turning point at which he finally realises that his relationship with his brother is worth more than their father's fortune.
Hoffman, who unsurprisingly won a Best Actor Oscar, is just as impressive as everybody says he is as Raymond. Having spent some time with real-life savant Kim Peek (on whom Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass's screenplay is partly based), Hoffman gives perhaps the single most remarkable performance of his distinguished career, completely immersing himself in the role of an autistic savant in a way that never fails to convince. It's a sympathetic performance, but Raymond's failure to understand many of life's complexities and of his unbending need for certain rituals and routines is also used as a source of gentle comedy, for example when Raymond wanders into Charlie and Susanna's room whilst they are having sex and when Charlie and Raymond get invited in to watch television by a kindly mother after Raymond becomes increasingly agitated that he is missing his program.
With Hoffman stealing the show, Tom Cruise nevertheless gives one of his very best performances as Charlie. Cruise is sometimes dismissed (with some justification) as a movie star rather than an actor, but he plays Charlie perfectly, from the early scenes in which his selfish character is established, to the ending in which he passionately fights for the right to see his brother, but is wise enough to realise that he can't take care of all of Raymond's complex needs. The characterisation works well, the screenplay gradually providing an insight into his dysfunctional relationship between them, going some way to explain the selfish Charlie's bitterness.
Levinson isn't one of those directors with a distinctive style that makes a film immediately recognisable as his work, but his direction is polished and assured and puts all of the emphasis on the performances of his actors, with frequent use of close-ups to help show what the characters are thinking. There are plenty of nice touches too, such as when we see Raymond wandering away from the car in the reflection in the window of the phone booth that Charlie is using. And of course, there is Byron P. Cavnar, a local who talks about the Pony Express in a waiting room scene and who Levinson decided to simply film and keep in the movie. The car scenes are particularly well shot by cinematographer John Seale, as are the casino scenes which successfully convey the noise and excitement of the setting.
If there's a flaw here, it is that although Hans Zimmer composed the score there is a lot of music both diagetic and non-diagetic that - shall we say - firmly roots the film in the 1980s and not in a good way, which is also true of Valeria Golino's hairstyle and everybody's costumes. But whilst fashions don't always age well, the same cannot be true of acting: Rain Man is a great film because of Dustin Hoffman, but he's by no means the only good thing in it.",Rain Man
141,jayjaycee,Hoffman at his best,9,8 August 2020,"""Rain Man"" is a 1988 drama directed by Barry Levinson starring Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise.
⚪
All in all, this fraternal road trip is an unconventional drama that carefully deals with its delicate subject matter and yet makes it extremely powerful. As if it isn't already phenomenal that is stars my second and third favourite actor in the leading roles, the New Hollywood legend and the ""Top Gun"" icon deliver superb character play as well and their chemistry develops according to the development of their characters. While Cruise is as charismatic and terrific as always, Hoffman delivers a powerhouse performance as the toothpick counting, TV shows loving, super intelligent autistic Raymond who breathes life into the whole production in the first place. Back in the day, mental illness and disability were both sensitive themes that scared most of the people simply because society wasn't enough educated about those two aspects, and in this regard the film is outright ground-breaking, because it depicts an autistic person as what he is - a human being. As a result of this, many people reduced their prejudices towards people like Raymond and were a lot more educated, just as the main character Charlie Babbitt was in the end: Thanks to magnificent character development, the narcissistic jerk who only bears in mind to receive the money his brother inherited and hence kidnapped him, becomes a sympathetic and loving man who loves his brother more than money, and I think that is nothing but wonderfully balanced development. In the beginning, it is exhausting, both to watch and for Charlie to bear, but in the end, I felt like I have learnt a lot more about autism in general, as it depicts it so utterly realistic. It is as heart-warming as it is touching, and thanks to a magnificently written screenplay that features some subtle, sociocritical remarks and amazing performances, we get an interesting and enlightening insight into the life and struggles of an autistic as a human being. Nothing short of eye opening, outstanding cinema and a milestone in the genre of drama.",Rain Man
142,freakfire-1,Its Wapner time.,8,24 March 2008,"Dustin Hoffman was brilliant in this film. And that is not a over-hyped statement to say. Who else could pull off the autistic character better than Hoffman? Not Tom Cruise nor could Abe Vigoda. Perhaps Jim Carrey could, but he was too young for this film and wasn't even well known at the time.Hoffman plays the unknown autistic brother of Cruise, both of whom have discover one another after their father dies. Seeing that the 'Autistic One' gets the money, Cruise takes him in hopes of getting some of it. And that is where the fun begins.It was hilarious and realistic at the same time when Hoffman played the part. ""Uh-oh 12 minutes to Wapner"", ""Qantas never crashed"", ""The syrup has to be on the table before the pancakes"". It seems dry when typed, but it funny in sequence.Overall, Hoffman makes this movie. The other actors and actresses are sub-par. I mean, Hoffman even reads the phone book! Because of Hoffman, this gets a high mark. ""A-""",Rain Man
143,disinterested_spectator,Ridiculous!,4,10 November 2015,"This movie is based on a premise so absurd that it undermines all the sentimental good feeling we are supposed to experience while watching it. Charlie Babbitt, who is on the verge of bankruptcy, finds out that his father, from whom he has been estranged for many years, has died. He goes back home in the expectation of inheriting his father's estate, inasmuch as he is the only living relative, at least so he thinks. But he finds out that aside from an old car and some roses, the entire estate, worth $3,000,000, has been put in trust for someone else. That someone else turns out to be an autistic older brother he never knew he had (he never finds out why no one told him about this older brother, Raymond, and neither do we).Charlie decides he is entitled to half the estate. So far, so good. Up to this point, the movie is more or less within the realm of what might actually happen in the real world. In said real world, Charlie would have hired a lawyer to contest the will, and then he could have gone about his business while waiting for results. I once had a cousin who left all her money to her lover. I figured that was the end of it, cut and dried. But a lawyer thought otherwise. I signed an agreement with him, and two years later he sent me a check for $22,000. Now, if a mere cousin can break a will, I figure one of the sons of the deceased has a really good chance of doing so.Instead of just hiring a lawyer, however, Charlie kidnaps Raymond from the institution where he has spent most of his life. Then, he calls the head of the institution and demands $1,500,000 in ransom to get Raymond back. That would be all right if we were supposed to think Charlie is a criminal, but we are not. We are supposed to ignore the fact that in the real world, Charlie would end up in prison. Instead, we are supposed to believe that he is going to show up in court with Raymond by his side, saying, ""I have him now, so give me the money!"" as if that is going to strengthen his case.In true Hollywood fashion, we get the best of both possible worlds. Charlie comes to care for Raymond, forgoes his claim on the estate, sends Raymond back to the institution where he belongs, and promises to visit him regularly. But, thanks to some card counting on the part of Raymond earlier in the movie, he and Charlie won $85,000 playing blackjack, just enough money to keep Charlie from being forced into bankruptcy. But it is a little hard to enjoy this happy ending after spending half the movie suffering through that ridiculous kidnapping plot.",Rain Man

At the end of the day, the acting is all you really have with Rain Man.  The story is very straight forward, which is fine for this type of film.  Rain Man hasn't aged particularly well, which makes one wonder if the film truly deserved its Best Picture Oscar.   Tom Cruise's stereotypical character has been seen in a thousand different films.  The hard-nailed guy who only cares about money finally finds a person that opens his heart, and eventually makes him a better person.

As Barry Levinson said in his Oscar acceptance speech, this film really was about two actors. Tom Cruise shows how easy he can head up a film, and conveys Charlie's spoilt brat side and loving brother side with equal grace. His frustration is our frustration. But this show is all about Dustin Hoffman, and what a performance he gives. The voice, the body language, the mannerisms, the flawless delivery - Hoffman's performance is one of the finest ever to win Best Actor. The film's screenplay is wonderful, the dialogue it gives to Hoffman is itself worth an Oscar. Levinson's efforts in bringing all of these wonderful elements together is evident and praiseworthy. The score is a critical part of the film and does a great job keeping a film about autism light.The meaning of the title ""Rain Man"" is probably my favourite besides ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and is definitely the strongest scene in the film.

149,cinephile-27690,An Autistic Person Reviewing A Movie About One(Spoilers possible).,10,19 February 2020,"I just watched Rain Man for the 2nd time in my life, the first being 5 years ago. Upon re-watching it, I regret waiting half a decade to see it again because it is such a wonderful movie. The movie made my top 5 the first time, and it's still pretty high on my list.The movie follows Charlie Babbit(played by Tom Cruise), a self-centered and greedy car salesman who finds out that he is not getting a $3 million inheritance from his father's death because he has an older brother he never knew about named Raymond, convincingly played by Dustin Hoffman.Not only that, but he has high functioning autism, and his tendencies can be used to Charlie's advantages. He takes Raymond to Las Vegas, and makes Charlie rich. He also hopes that he can split the inheritance if he spends some time with his brother.But as he gets closer to his brother, he learns to love him and to care for him more and money less.The movie was a huge success when it came out, and it won Best Picture for 1988. This hype is well earned. When it comes to camera work, plot, character development, and it's sweet blend of comedy and drama, there is no aspect of this movie that falls short. Perfection is a subjective thing, but let me tell you, this comes as close as a movie can!As I already mentioned, the movie stars Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman. This is the best work they both have done. Tom does a great job playing Charlie as a greedy man with a changed heart, and his frustration scenes of dealing with Raymond's tendencies are great as well.(""Why does it matter *where* you buy your underwear?""/""I should be in L.A. right now, but NO! *We don't go outside when it rains*!"")However, Raymond excels at complicated math problems- such as the square roots of multi-digit numbers, multiplying large numbers, counting the number of toothpicks on the floor, and knowing what cards one holds in their hand if the rest are on the ground. He also can perfectly recite Who's On First from The Naughty Nineties when he is nervous, but he doesn't understand why that joke is so funny.Despite this, he thinks spending 50 cents of dollar gives you 70 cents left, and he has no comprehension of his autism or other things that would be easy for us to understand.Dustin also does a fantastic job playing an autistic man. If you never ever saw him in anything else, like The Graduate, you might actually think that he is autistic in real life. Fun fact, he actually hung around autistic men to understand how they act so he could apply that to his portrayal of Raymond! He really put that study to great use.As for Tom Cruise, his evolution from self-centered to selfless is touching and we can sympathize with him as the plot progresses.As aforementioned, the movie does have some great comedy moments, like when Raymond comes into Charlie's room after hearing ""noises"", and other scenes I mentioned earlier, to avoid many spoilers. This comedy drama has a perfect blend of both genres being mixed together.While Rain Man is not my favorite movie from 1988(That would go to The Last Temptation of Christ-my favorite movie of all time), this most definitely takes the next spot, and objectively speaking, this absolutely earned Best Picture, with no exceptions! (The Oscars got it right, in short.)Rain Man is a masterpiece with sentiment and wonderful performances, and a great outlook on disabilities. (Another plus as an autistic person myself, though my level has many difference-but similarities are there.) Whether you want over 2 hours of fine entertainment, a perspective on autism, or a performance-driven movie worthy of it's awards, Rain Man most certainly won't disappoint.Note: A teacher I had in high school loves this movie as well. This is a movie we would discuss often and he would reference from time to time. Please consider that to be a 2nd recommendation!",Rain Man

Charlie Babbit is enraged when his father dies and only leaves him the 'rose bushes' and a vintage car, while his autistic brother Raymond inherits 3 million dollars. The astonishing story of Raymond (Hoffman) and Charlie (Cruise), is hilarious, powerful, angry and emotional as they cruise the USA.

Dustin Hoffman was too good. This was his first movie that i had seen and he is definitely mind blowing. Tom cruise was also good. The story is too good and takes you through a journey from being a selfish fool to being loving and caring brother. The transformation in tom cruise behavior in no way looked like it was forced and it was nice to see how with time and situations things change so much. The film got boring when they tried to make the journey too long.

155,willrams,Totally Involved,9,6 April 2003,"This movie I saw today on AMC TV and I sat through it twice; that's how involved I got in it even though I'd seen it in 1988.  Dustin Hoffman plays an autistic brother to Tom Cruise, and complications arise not only because of Tom's selfish desire to cash in on a trust fund their father left to his brother; but the trying times of listening to the trite words of Hoffman. On their trip around the country and playing in Vegas at cards (Hoffman has an uncanny brain for winning at cards), they become closer friends whereas they had not really known eachother.  The story is supposedly a true one of how Tom comes to grips with the problems and let's Hoffman (Rain Man) go back to where he had lived before.

But it's still worth viewing. The beginning was kinda dull and I thought that I ain't gonna like this movie, so I was kinda surprised when after 15 or so minutes, I couldn't take my eyes of screen. Dustin Hoffman was brilliant, though his character was autistic, he still was likable and even funny (and it's ain't easy to make likable character who's always kinda self-contained). Tom Cruise's character was kinda negative but still, was pretty likable when he didn't shout on Raymond, I think he did a great job.",Rain Man
157,kingofdanerds,Rain Man: Winner of Best Picture and rightly so,10,20 May 2021,"It is funny to think that when the Oscars happened in 1989 (to celebrate the films of 1988), that Tom Cruise not only starred in the best picture with Rain Man, but also star in the Worst Picture with Cocktail (honestly Cocktail does not even deserve to have worst picture). With that being said, Rain Man has been on my watchlist for quite some time now. Found the film at a local computer store that happened to be selling movies and decided to pick this film up. Rain Man was released in 1988 and was directed by Barry Levinson (director of Good Morning Vietnam, Sphere, and Toys) and stars Dustin Hoffman (Sphere, Tootsie, and The Graduate) and Tom Cruise (Cocktail, Top Gun, and The Last Samurai). The film was a critical hit and financial hit as well and went on to win a total of four Oscars.Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) deals with cars and all that fun stuff and learns that his father has passed away. After attending the funeral, he learns that all that his father left him was a 1949 Buick and some rosebushes. He learns that there is a large sum of money but not left to him and money is something that Charlie needs. He learns that he has an autistic brother named Raymond and that the money was left to him. So, Charlie takes Raymond on a road trip hoping to be rich but may come out rich, but not with money.Rain Man is rightfully deserving of Best Picture despite me not being really familiar with the other nominees. Rain Man is Tom Cruise at his best. This is where I can fully respect Tom Cruise as an actor. People are always praising Tom Cruise and I am always asking why but now I fully realize what people mean now. Dustin Hoffman (who won best actor) does a fabulous job here as well. I honestly do not know where else to continue on to here. I should begin on the topic of how autism is portrayed in this film. I am not 100 percent qualified to really talk about this subject in it's entirety but I will say this much about it, I have known and currently do know people with autism. But what I do not know is anyone on the high functioning side of the spectrum (like Raymond). Rain Man is a great teacher when it comes to being informed about autism. I did not even know what a savant was (at least by it's name). So let it be known that if you are willing to learn a little bit about autism, this film can teach you a few things. I am not saying that it is supposed to and it would be better to read a book about the topic, but the film nonetheless does so. Does the film portray autism accurately? Yes it does but I have seen that there is criticism surrounding that it has created these untrue sterotypes while also dispelling these sterotypes. I see more of the latter. The story is very touching and has a great pace. It is a road trip movie and a road trip in real life is supposed to be slow (not at a snail's pace though) for everyone to take everything in. That is done in this film. The cinematography is just great with beautiful shots. Just plain gorgeous. I was surpised to see that the musical score was done by Hans Zimmer who has certainly made a name for himself today as doing the Pirates of the Caribbean score. The score here is fairly solid though nothing too much that stands out much like Zimmer's later work.Rain Man is a ten out of ten film. It tells a very touching and at times very emotional story and it is one that I think everyone should watch.",Rain Man
158,kyle-cruse,"Good, but not a personal favorite",8,12 August 2008,"""Rain Man"" proved to be a fairly enjoyable and touching film. It shows how a selfish man (Tom Cruise) changes after meeting and spending several days with his autistic brother (Dustin Hoffman, in an Oscar-winning role) whom he never knew existed. The film could be described as a comedy-drama, though it is far more on the drama side. There are plenty of little funny moments (particularly from Tom Cruise's somewhat funny lines and ""hurry up"" type of attitude) that keep the film entertaining. The plot is a little too predictable and some parts of the film (Dustin Hoffman freaking out uncontrollably) are somewhat difficult to watch. The Best Picture of 1988? Not for me (""Die Hard"" is my favorite). While the film is not a personal favorite of mine, it does have its moments. It also has one of the best original film scores I have ever heard, with a sort of haunting feel to it. Worthwhile, but far from perfect.*** out of ****",Rain Man
159,datorsiers2,Raymond? ...Yea.,10,9 January 2015,"An excellent movie, this movie just shows that super complex plot or many intense action scenes are not needed for a movie to be great. ''Rain Man'' is a very mellow, calm and moving movie about Charlie Babbitt and his new found brother Raymond, who is autistic, but has a gift - he can memorize anything.Dustin Hoffman, playing Raymond, displayed insane acting skill in this movie. That is easily one of the best acting performances i have ever seen in any movie, it felt like he went so deep into the character, there was not a single flaw in his acting throughout the whole movie. Definitely playing a very interesting and complex character, to say at least, he is one of the few actors who is capable of pulling acts like this off, just an incredible performance. Tom Cruise was really good too, have never been a fan of Cruise, but his performance was just outstanding, he had a role, which was not as complex as that of Hoffman's, but still an awesome performance.The story had the reality aspect to it, nothing too crazy, since we know this movie is based on true events. It was just great to see how a completely normal guy tries to understand a mentally unstable person, who just doesn't go by the rules of society.Definitely, a great watch, a movie that can easily be watched many times, not only once, easily one of the best characters and performances ever!

It tells a great story and features memorable scenes and memorable dialogue. Rain Man is a Very Good movie and it has always been one of my favorites.
The Acting is a major strength in the film. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances as Charlie Babbit. Dutin Hoffman is absolutely phenomenal as Raymond Babbit, he brings the character to life in one of the best ways. Supporting Performances are all strong too. The movie is perfectly directed by Barry Levinson. It also has a beautifully written screenplay. The movie features many scenes that I have always remembered.

It was nice to see a non-action Tom Cruise movie.Tom Cruise is great as Charlie, a selfish young wheeler-dealer. However, the main attraction of this movie is Dustin Hoffman's Oscar-winning performance as Raymond, an autistic savant. My mom has dealt with a lot of autistic children, and she says that this was a very accurate portrayal. It gave me a taste of just what it could be like to have an autistic in your family.The relationship between the two brothers is very well played-out. Charlie at first can't stand Ray, but he later learns how to deal with his extreme autism and even later forms something of a bond with him.There are many powerful scenes, such as the ""hot water burn baby"" scene. There are also plenty of funny moments to come around, with my favorite being Ray bugging Charlie about underwear (""UNDERWEAR IS UNDERWEAR!"" yells Cruise).A great movie and for sure one of the best films and performances of both men's careers. This is especially recommended for people who are familiar with autistic people.RATING: B+",Rain Man

It turns out that Charlie has a long lost brother name Raymond (Dustin Hoffman). But Raymond doesn't know how to use the money because he is autistic. So Charlie ""kidnaps"" Raymond from his institution, but then Charlier learns a whole new meaning about family. This movie was just absolutly great. Dustin Hoffman was great as was Tom Cruise. The movie doesn't get off track at all. It just sticks to the plot. If I could I would make every family own this movie. I recommend highly to all people.10/10",Rain Man

But to him amusement is father just left him an old car along with some other stuff, while the majority of the property and money is left to Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) who is Charlie's brother that he never knew that existed until now. Furious and disappointed, Charlie wanting to grab what's inherited to him learns that Raymond is autistic and spent almost his entire life in a mental institute.

Dealing with Raymond's challenging behavior; Charlie gets anxious day by day on how he can reach his goals. But unknowingly while spending time with Raymond, he finds a long lost connection of brotherhood and actually starts to feel for Raymond. 'Rain Man' is a classic, not just in 80s but in all time movies. In an age where movies were not totally based on how pretty they looked or how well animated with special effects, you will feel what a movie really needs to be while watching it.Charlie and Raymond both are challenging characters to pull off. Specially Raymond who is mentally challenged and unpredictable, Hoffman portray really well proving that he is one of those actors who knows what character representation is all about. Equally wonderful performance by Tom, who is selfish and greedy you might hate him right from the inception. (My regret is that Tom is not getting any more worthy characters such as this nowadays which he can place his real talents than jumping from one building on to another like a stuntman) Wonderfully written script with warmness of hearts embedded, 'Rain Man' brings in anger, disappointment, love, hope and ambition in to one whole 133 minutes. With wonderful performances of Tom and Hoffman throughout and cleverly build set of characters this is one heartwarming piece of drama that you can lay hands on. read my reviews at flickshout.blogspot.com",Rain Man

168,sam_smithreview,Brilliant casting with Tom and Hoffman,9,8 June 2016,"I have seen this movie probably 7 or 8 times in the past three years, wrote a paper about it for my college film class last semester, and basically regard it as my favorite movie of all time. Where to begin with the praise for this movie? Let's start with the acting. Dustin Hoffman is my favorite actor, and has been for a while. I'd watch him in any role. I was amazed at the way he was able to pull off this role. I've never seen a more deserved Oscar win. The vacant stare, the monotone voice, the screaming, it was unbelievable. Each time I watch it I am floored by his talent. Tom Cruise is also good, the villain of the story who undergoes such a subtle change that it's almost not visible until nearly the end. He is, however, perfectly suited for the flashy, egotistical character of Charlie, and I think he did a great job. The directing was unobtrusive and beautiful, for the most part just letting the action unfold, which is exactly the way it should have been done. It's a feel-good movie that does that and more, and I think nothing I've seen in the movies is as touching as the scene in the motel where Charlie discovers who ""Rain Man"" really is. I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10. Absolutely wonderful.",Rain Man
169,Kubris,My main man,8,1 January 2013,"Seeing Rain Man reminds me of The Graduate, another of Dustin Hoffman's most popular films. Some films tell big stories about the nature of humanity, or our social dynamics, where other films tell a nice contained story. Both of these films are in the latter, and thus the degree of how much one will like the film comes down to a viewers' taste. I really liked both of these films, but consider the Graduate to be far superior- but that's just me. I'm sure there are many people who are the exact opposite. Anyway, Rain Man is an exceptionally charming film with broad appeal due to its positive messages about family and lifestyle.The topic of autism is handled incredibly well. The process of Charlie meeting his brother and being impossibly fed up with his shortcomings is sadly believable for his character, as is his gradual acceptance and caring, though not without his outbursts. A week such as this wouldn't completely reinvigorate a person, but it certainly changes his perspective from his enclosed world of money.The two leads are brilliant: Raymond's mannerisms are so believable, and his presence is soft but powerful. His foil is his brother Charlie, greedy and inconsiderate. He's a p****. But time brings these unknown brothers together believably, with no one single moment of 'the big change', hallmark of bad 'transformation' films. Raymond is the catalyst for Charlie's change in the scientific definition: he himself does not change. The film may make it seem like Raymond too has evolved, but he hasn't. His routine has. A year after the film finishes he would be right back at the start, albeit with a caring brother.Rain Man is a great story from an efficient script with enjoyable dialogue and a smooth pace. The technical side of the film is conventional: costumes, music and set design is very 80's. Some films have greater potential than others, and Rain Man achieves all it can. 8.5/10",Rain Man

172,rabbitmoon,Really enjoyed rewatching Rain Man,8,1 May 2018,"After all these years, Rain Man is compellingly watchable, and refreshingly well acted and written. The character of Charlie Babbitt is complex and deeply fascinating - a generally decent, loving guy buried with anger, a need to prove himself, and a reservoir of resentment from feeling unloved. He's an archetype for the Fight Club generation, and played to absolute perfection by Tom Cruise in what is surely his best role. I can't think of a modern young actor who could play this role as well as he does - Cumberbatch, Matthew Goode, Gosling, Reynolds - they just don't have that same fiery intensity and nuance. You can see Cruise thinking while someone else is talking. I actually didn't care too much for Hoffman's performance, its a tough one but more of a caricature once he's in that zone (a bit like Franco impersonating Tommy Wiseau). Anyway, back to the film. Generally brilliant, some excellent scenes, and a really classy opening. I feel it becomes a bit incongruent towards the end though. First Charlie exploits Raymond's skill at the casino, making back the money he needs (this is supposed to be a happy solution for Charlie, despite being against the film's supposed moral backbone). Valerie Golino then basically goes completely against her strong morals by somehow making her way to Vegas and finding Charlie again, just because she's out of a job. What was she hoping for? The one guy who's selfishness and neglect just lost her a job.. and she goes right back to him. Then, she sexually assaults ol' Raymond in an elevator. Then they let him DRIVE A CAR out in public, lolling as he crashes over curbs. This is all just before Charlie has his little discussion with the care home manager, where he doesn't listen AT ALL to what the guy is saying and is being more flippant and obtuse than he has been throughout the whole film. Its a strange unravelling of what the set up had promised, and I felt it could have been written so much better. It just felt rushed (and directed without any finesse).",Rain Man
173,mattrochman,Somewhat overrated,5,30 March 2007,"Dustin Hoffman certainly gave a good performance. But I recall one Oscar host who said something like ""your chances of winning an Oscar are high if you portray someone with a mental or physical illness"" - reference to Rain Man, Philidelphia, Silence of the lambs, Shine..and the list goes on.The interesting thing is that playing these sorts of characters may not be as difficult as many people think. That's why I have respect for actors such as Jodie Foster and Hillary Swank - they play relatively normal people, but with conviction and realism; and that makes it difficult to take your eyes of them. But I would have thought that playing a Raymond or a Forest Gump type character would be relatively elementary for these actors.Take away Hoffman, and the often underrated Cruise, and you have a fairly mediocre, long winded and somewhat boring story. To some degree, this is because the film is a bit too pre-occupied with showcasing some of the inadvertent talents of a autistic savvant. But then again, somehow I feel that would have been fine, had the screen-writers ditched the backdrop of a film (Cruise in financial trouble and needs the inheritance money). Worse still, the backdrop made the final 30 minutes extremely predictable (money isn't everything... blood is thicker than water... blah blah blah).Certainly watchable, but tends to drag on a bit and as mentioned previously too much a predictable background plot that required unnecessary servicing throughout the film.",Rain Man

Raymond is autistic but seems to be a bit of a genius when it comes to numbers. Entirely acting off emotion Charlie kidnaps his brother from the mental institution in the hopes he can convince the institution director to give him half of the fortune left to Raymond. The two then embark on a cross-country trip, Raymond proves to grow on his brother much faster than Charlie thought imaginable. Soon this grows into a powerful connection and unbreakable bond, one with the strength to change both brothers lives forever.This film succeeds very well at creating a beautiful moving story while at the same time startling. The cinematography and scenery of the film was stunning at times and Hans Zimmer almost literally always creates a very effective score. The script of this piece was also excellent I may add. The two leads, Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise were perfect but especially Hoffman whose portrayal was breathtaking and he clearly immersed himself in that role to the point where he's almost unrecognizable. This film is truly deserving of That Best Picture Oscar without any doubt or incertitude.",Rain Man
181,nagsaptarshi,"A movie that makes you smile and cry, simultaneously",9,24 May 2009,"Well, it took me 21 years to watch this movie.Literally, the first time when I saw this movie was when it was released and I was back then a kid of 9 years who barely could understand the delicacy of human characters portrayed in the movie.And finally when I watched the movie again, I was 30 and boy oh boy,I was blown over.What a performance by Dustin Hoffman!!!Is it his best so far?Well, may not be, coz he is such a fine actor and he has so many good movies in his kitty.But truly it was one of his most memorable ones.And Tom Cruise, oh man, this bloke can act.I have always been so much skeptic about his acting skills.But I am happy that I have been proved wrong.He can act, thats for sure and this movie is a documentary proof of it.The best thing about this movie is of course the chemistry between them, a spoilt brat and an autistic person.The director handles such an issue with such panache that you are compelled to emote with the protagonists.Valeria Golino did an excellent job in her small role.She really sparkled in the elevator scene.The rest of the cast did a fine job, too.Overall, it is a memorable movie backed by power house performances.Don't ever take the risk of missing it.",Rain Man
182,eamon-hennedy,"A wonderful, moving and surprisingly unsentimental little film.",10,10 May 2006,"One of my all time favourites this movie, Rain Man is moving, funny, sad, uplifting and ultimately a little dowh beat, but contains two terrific central performances from two Hollywood legends and terrific direction from one of mainstream Hollywood's finest filmmakers, who makes all the right choices, which of course means not making the obvious ones. What surprises one straight away about Rain Man is how funny the film can be, without any of the bad taste theatrics of, say, a Farrelly brothers movie, who have frequently used various forms of mental illness or autism as the butt of many of their jokes in their movies. Here we have a film about autism that is very funny, but knows that it is dealing with a serious condition, thus making the jokes not so much about the condition, but about one man having to deal with it, in this case Charlie Babbit, played superbly by Tom Cruise in what is arguably one of his best performances, up there with Jerry Maguire and Magnolia. This isn't a film that pokes fun at Raymond's condition and thus makes him into a superb character, one that we care about, even though in many ways he is incapable of showing emotion back to the person who comes to care for him the most, even though we desperately want him to.Enough cannot be said of Dustin Hoffman. One of Hollywood's finest, here he is at his utmost best, sparring off Cruise superbly in some of the finest scenes in a mainstream film from 80's Hollywood (the K-Mart sequence is a particular highlight), he is engaging, even though he is always reserved and never makes eye contact with anyone, he is also funny, yet sad, but never over-eggs one or the other aspect in his performance.What surprises one about Rain Man is how restrained it is for a Hollywood film. The biggest aspect of the film to symbolize this is its music score from Hans Zimmer, composing his first American film. Instead of relying on strings and pianos like many other composers would do, Zimmer relies more on percussion and an almost African-Carribbean style main theme that sums up the film perfectly. The music never overshadows the film, it is more restrained and cleverer than that and almost sums up what you can say about the film. Nothing ever goes over the top or into theatrics, everything is kept as realistic as possible, from the performances, to the way it is filmed by Levinson, right through to the writing and the film's ending which doesn't go for the conventional manner of trying to have the audience reaching for the tissues, but neither does it go for some emotional catharsis that you would expect either. Of course there is one little moment (""You're my main man""), but it works anyway and strangely keeps in line with what the film is doing.Clever, brave and superbly done, Rain Man is one film that I demand that everyone should see.",Rain Man
183,movieman89-2,Hoffman at his best,10,26 November 2008,"I love watching this film. It really is an excellent drama.Hoffman really does deserve his award, his acting was amazing. He really did fit the part of the autistic man, Raymand. He has learnt brilliantly about autism.Great touching story, brilliant script and filming.The story shows about what it's like being and living with someone who's autistic.

Cruise and Hoffman shine as long lost brothers, developing a wonderful chemistry that envelops the entire experience. The acting is all-around convincing, with an admirable supporting cast. The emotional depth present is then perfectly executed, with meaningful scenes full of well written dialogue. The storyline has some incomplete resolution in its asides to the main plot point, but is still quite thoughtful with its downfalls not taking too much from the experience. Overall, a great drama.",Rain Man
185,teejayniles2345,"All I wanted was a hug, Raymond ! ! !",10,14 April 2002,"Last evening on the NBC Saturday night movie, a bowdlerized version of this ""me-GENERATION"" feel-good classic was televized over a three hour time slot. Granted that they wanted to make some ad revenue, the televising of this Barry Levinson ""Best Picture"" was over-padded with interruptions and gutted as far as its emotional outbursts and episodes of total panic/frustration. I find the line of dialogue used in my title to reflect the love-hate dichotomy at this film's beating heart:  the Tom Cruise character pathetically utters it when his autistic/savant brother played by Dustin Hoffman screeches and protests the effort to hug him when the younger feels that they've reached some level of adequate ""intimacy"" and trust.  This film lays a lot of guilt trips on people who just ""don't get it:"" the fact that incurable mental illness and disability just don't go away and receive ""magic cure"" love that wipes all the pain away.  The Tom Cruise character kidnaps his brother and ""pimps"" him as a robotic cohort in illegal Vegas activities.  In modern 1980's ""me-generation"" sensibilities that's OK because everybody deserves their ""half"" of the bargain.  If the angry brother just gets a car and rosebushes then he can hold for ransom whoever he needs to in order to get $1.5 million.   This entire ""me-generation"" logic recently brought us BANDITS who were really ""nice"" guys and CITIZEN Q where the disgruntled Dad (a Denzel Washington character) holds everyone hostage while his son gets a deserved heart transplant.  I wonder why gun violence predominates in our politically correct-obsessed culture like 2002 America and people hold each other and the police at bay with means of violence so excessively. NBC, for shame on your utilization of such a powerful movie for the selfish end of commercial ""milking.""  Go back to what you tried last summer with some sort of context-sharing for the major movie televising that you did with FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH and CADDY SHACK!  Movies are powerful and not just for audience commercial ""flypaper.""",Rain Man
186,ScottDWhalen,Well done Dustin Hoffman WELL DONE!! O & u to Tom lol,10,8 January 2019,"MUST WATCH!
I have been wanting to see this, but ended up forgetting about it till thanx to Kristen who watched it & reminded me..
Rain main was inspired by a well known savant named Kim Peek who is watched over by Darold Treffert. Now this is not based off a true story just an inspiration the director found in Kim. The things Kim can do is well beyond amazing to me & breaks my heart he can't live up to the amazing abilities his mind can reach.
Now as for the movie itself we all know Tom Cruise is a damn good actor who plays Charlie Babbitt, but in this movie Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt does WAY MORE than an outstanding job of fitting right into Kim Peeks personality, the way he moves, thinks, & expresses himself. I honestly don't think there would have been anyone else besides Dustin to act as Kim. Now not sure if anyone noticed that Rain Man is ""Raymond"" which was Charlie's ""imaginary friend"" that he explained to Susanna. The movie played out pretty well showing how one can realize family can truly be important to one who really has a heart. Yet some people need that extra push to see that family is important at all times even if u never ment them. Kim/Raymond has no clue what is going on in the world, but he knows what makes him happy family, money, or not. Yet he found connection with is ""main man"" & found a brother he never knew existed outside of living with his father. He may not have ever forgotten him, but he has no clue if he still existed which is y Raymond may not have recognized him showing no compassion or emotion towards him. Bet he will be this time in 1,209,600 seconds & betting more he will be excited to see him.",Rain Man

Ray is autistic and lives in his own world and has no comprehension of the adult world. However, he has crazy math and memory abilities.Dustin Hoffman won all sorts of awards for his performance as Ray but it was Cruise's performance that stood out to me. I'd actually find it easier to play an autistic person versus a character whose not really supposed to be all that likable and had daddy issues.Another interesting note is Cruise's character of Charlie has some Asperger/autism characteristics himself. He has trouble expressing his emotions as well. Also repeated those are definitely rosebushes!But yeah it was a good movie though. Definitely a good movie.",Rain Man

Starting with the song 'IKO IKO' the movie travels its path on an amazing and fresh story for its era/time. Dustin Hoffman played one great role and gave performance of his life. Tom Cruz was good too. Then why do i rate this movie 6/10 ?Although it is an amazing story as i mentioned it has one feature lacking. It starts with hatred and lust mixed with cruelty but suddenly turns into affection. Now this is still good but the changeover is not out of some appropriate reasons but, as i saw it, the most pitch-y point of the changeover (of this emotion and attitude) is the brilliance of one brother that helped other to win a huge amount at the casino. Now one brother is autistic but rich and other is lusty and in debt. It also tried to show the change in his attitude towards money and his autistic rich brother by checking out the memories of parents and the past events between brothers that connected them to rain man and main man but still casino winning by the brother actually made highest impact in movie and same was just visible. Now this is the situation where the movie fails to satisfy the logic that was this love for poor autistic but brother or was it the satisfaction that I won because of him and I have someone who can in time of need help me make a lot of money? honestly speaking the situation or doubt is not that much, its still the development of real love but the execution was too weak in this respect.",Rain Man

194,Jackblyth8,Prepare to be Moved,9,25 January 2021,"The 1988 film featuring Tom Cruise as a Charlie Babbitt, a selfish automobile dealer and Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt, his autistic brother. Following the death of his father, Charlie finds out that the 3 million dollars left over is being held in trust for an unidentified party. At first, Tom Cruise's character is furious, as currently he finds himself $80,000 in debt, leaving the dealership garage and heading, with his glamorous partner, to his home town Cincinnati, driving into Wallbrook, a care home for those with mental difficulties. He then meets with the home owner who explains to Charlie that he has an older brother who is autistic and named Raymond, a man who lives his life differently to Charlie, he is extremely sensitive and needs things in their certain order. When he is uncomfortable in a social situation, Raymond tends to recite Baseball players on first base. We as viewers sympathise with Raymond, clearly unsettled in the company of others, his melancholy lifestyle compensates for his autism, he doesn't know right from wrong, but struggles with a change in scenery. As Tom Cruises character tries to connect with his brother, subtly aiming to gain some of the inherited money, Raymond's knowledge on cars, specifically Charlie's, is immaculate, Charlie realises that Raymond is no doubt intelligent, but, alarmed by the attention he is receiving. Charlie's girlfriend Susanna, played by Italian actor Valeria Golino, takes a shine to Raymond, sympathising with him just like the viewers, she wishes Charlie would rethink his plan to take a share of the money. We are introduced to Raymond's night routine when the three stay the night at a hotel, like a broken record the protagonist informs Charlie that he has lights out at 11 and until then, watches TV whilst sitting at a desk making notes. He also points out that his bed needs to be by the window, emulating the formation of his room in Wallbrook, inferring that he doesn't like change. Following a midnight row with Charlie, Susanna leaves the voyage, disliking Charlie's idea to use his brother in order to take his father's money. Charlie continues the trip with his brother, and in a diner, a frustrated Charlie grabs Raymond by the neck tenderly, causing Dustin Hoffman's character to yell in pain, and write in his book about his injury. After the incident, he requests a tooth pick from the counter, and the waitress, rather clumsy, drops all tooth picks on the floor, within seconds Raymond correctly counted the number of tooth picks that fell out of the box, 248 exactly. His brothers hidden talent intrigued Charlie and as the pairing headed to LA by car, because of Raymond's refusal to fly - knowing all the history of air accidents, the two brothers encounter a road accident, slowing dow the traffic, leading to a very scared Raymond, who was worried about the 'dangerous' road and stepped out of the car and started walking, this being at night, he eventually got into the passenger seat of his brother's car. The next stop at a motel, saw rain pouring profusely through the day, Raymond refused to leave the room and go out in the rain, instead stalling his brothers aim to get to LA. We see a gradual friendship begin to form, more on Charlie's side who warms towards Raymond, after previously being agitated by his autistic ways. Accepting the fact that Raymond is his brother, he is always looking out for him and in a difficult scene, Charlie rescued Raymond from the road, as the main character didn't move from the crossing due to a sign saying 'do not move', he is frightened by impatient drivers whom beep their horns in anger towards the autistic being. When Charlie takes Raymond from the road, he introduces his brother to a doctor; Charlie isn't sure what is the matter with Raymond, knowing he has social difficulties but is extremely smart, the doctor tests Raymond's quick maths skills, giving him multiplication sums impossible to answer without resources, Raymond replies with the exact answer. The journey from Cincinnati to Los Angeles continue and when Raymond realises he is about to miss his routine game show, he makes Charlie pull over into a country house, where he persuades the woman who lives there, to play the show, explaining his brothers conditions to her. In the house full of young children, the camera gradually moves over to Raymond, who's eyes are glued to the television, murmuring not only correct answers, but the entire host introduction. The two brothers depart and stop off for the night at yet another motel. Charlie appears to show affection towards his brother, liking him for how he is, Cruise's character supports his brother and speaks more softly and calmly to him, hoping that he is able to engage in a conversation. The emotional scene, sees Raymond recall past events involving his brother, and confronting him with a photograph of wen the two were younger. Unsure why he was separated from his brother, Charlie continued to ask questions, Raymond struggling to speak, remembers Charlie calling him Rain Man because he couldn't pronounce Raymond, hence the title. As the feature progresses, the calm Raymond subverts into fear as hot water runs from the tap quickly, suggesting that Raymond's autism was part of an incident involving Charlie and hot water, inferring why the brothers were separated. Charlie puts Raymond to bed and the next morning, head into Las Vegas, arriving at a casino. In the hope for Raymond to flourish in the maths entailed to gambling. During a game of blackjack, Raymond's knowledge of the deck of cards issued allowed him to win big, proving a big attraction to many, his masterclass caused the table to be surrounded by others coming to watch, grabbing a large amount of winnings, the casino head's are suspicious and take Charlie in for questioning, suggesting that the pair spend no more time at the gambling den. The $86,000 won was enough to cover for Charlie's debts, and he reconciles with Susanna who returned after hearing about Raymond and meets in their posh hotel. Raymond attempts to make conversation with a woman who approaches him at the bar, but Charlie sniffs out her game, and tells her to leave him be. Susanna and Raymond head into a lift, where Raymond murmurs about his potential date with the woman at the bar, Susanna questions whether he had ever kissed a girl before, Raymond replies with ""no"" and Susanna kisses him on the lips, allowing him to experience the feeling. Charlie and his brother spend the night in a colossal suite looking out to Vegas' nightlife. Raymond - fixated on his date - admits to never dancing before, Charlie slowly takes him through a soothing routine, in which Raymond engages. Bringing along his portable television with the baseball on, the friendly figure understands that his date isn't showing up and prepares for bed. The following morning the two brothers head back on the road before finally reaching Los Angeles. Upon arriving at his home, Charlie shows Raymond to his room. In a concerning scene, Raymond appears to be preparing food in the kitchen, but, causes a fire without knowing, steam travelling upward and setting the fire alarm off, Raymond afraid of the load alarm and smoke, requires help from his brother who comforts him explaining that all is fine. Back in LA, Dr Bruner meets with Charlie and Raymond, offering Tom Cruise's character $250,000 to walk away, but after spending time and forming a bond with his brother, he is determined to keep him. Charlie, no longer upset with what his father left him just wants to have a relationship with his brother. A psychiatrist is brought in and questions Raymond, realising he is unable to decide himself what he wants, Charlie halts the questioning and tells Raymond that he's happy to have him as a brother. Charlie takes Raymond to the train station where he boards an Amtrak train with Dr Bruner to return to the mental institution. Charlie promises Raymond that he will visit in two weeks, and watches the train depart into the distance. The well-directed film reinforces what we should value in life, beginning the film as a selfish, greedy dealer, Charlie became comforting and kind towards his autistic brother. Raymond on the other hand, was reluctant to leaving with his brother, but engaged in the relationship and the journey allowed him to remember his past experiences with his younger brother. Raymond needs special care and support, care that Charlie can't provide, for Charlie to do what's best for his brother is key, making it a fitting ending.",Rain Man

Him alongside Tom Cruise made for a pleasantly suprising powerhouse duo. This is an important film experience to endure. I just watched Rain Man for the first time in 2020 and though I can see why it has a complicated legacy being seemingly insensitive at times, it illuminated a profoundly groundbreaking awareness to autism and mental illness on screen.

199,severindringel,Too superficial and clichéd - but an enjoyable film with an important theme,8,16 February 2021,"Barry Levinson's 1988 classic has not necessarily aged well, but remains a staple of Hollywood film history. Rain Main namely tackles the savant syndrome, a special phenomenon of autism. A topic that almost no one had on their mind at the time. The plot around it is quickly told: After the death of his estranged father, the egotistical car dealer Charlie is drawn to his hometown in Connecticut, where he looks at the will. In the process, Charlie discovers that his father's entire fortune has been left to his previously unknown big brother Raymond, who has been in an autism institute for many years. Charlie then hatches a nasty plan that leads to an unexpectedly emotional journey.Rain Man has earned its cult status specifically thanks to the stirring chemistry between the two brothers Charlie (Tom Cruise) and Raymond Babbitt (Dustin Hoffman). In his breakthrough role, Tom Cruise is excellent alongside the established and highly regarded Dustin Hoffman, although his character is not a sympathetic one, especially at the beginning. His greed for money and obsession with himself lead to a lack of understanding of his socially challenged brother's condition. Of course, he didn't know of his brother's existence all these years and therefore had to deal with this bomb, but his complete lack of empathy makes Charlie something of an antagonist until the middle of the film. Through Cruise's authentic acting we learn more and more about Charlie and why he acts the way he does. The fact that he is able to relate to Raymond better and better as the film progresses and increasingly puts aside his almost evil behaviour towards him helps to make us almost like him towards the end. But the show is clearly stolen by Dustin Hoffman as the autistic Raymond. Regardless of how realistically he portrays a person with this syndrome, Hoffman captivates you from second one and you are always invested in his character. Of course, you also feel sorry for Raymond because of his lack of expressiveness, but it's mainly the human element that Hoffman brings across so brilliantly. You almost think you can put yourself in his place, even though he lives in a world of which you, as a non-affected viewer, have no idea.As mentioned at the beginning, Rain Man has not necessarily aged well over the years. This is mainly due to the clichés typical of Hollywood at the time, which apply especially to Cruise's character. The bad boy with the pretty Italian girlfriend (also the cliché of women falling for men of this ilk) who starts out with seedy intentions and gets better as he goes along. Surely this is the cornerstone of why it ends up being a feel-good movie that warms hearts despite its harsh quintessence. Still, this theme could have been suggested in a much more serious and professional manner. The simple plot therefore makes Rain Man almost a pure feel-good film, but one that definitely educates and should therefore rightly be seen by people.",Rain Man
200,bulleetz37235,A timeless classic,10,2 September 2005,"This is an excellent film. Rain Man incorporates moving drama, timeless scenery and unbelievable performances from Dustin Hoffman and even Tom Cruise who up to this point in film history was known for typical chick flicks or films in which his potential was not shown, even the color of money couldn't make him look like any kind of decent actor. Yet in Rain Man he isn't bad, but I suppose it is very clear and easy to say that Dustin acts him off the screen. The screen is a simple tale of brotherly love. Dustin plays Raymond ""The Rain Man"" Babbitt, the long lost, supposedly autistic brother of Charlie Babbitt (Cruise). As Charlie finds out he has a brother never revealed to him by his father he feels let down and betrayed, and even more so that now his father is dead and leaving his estate, to the value of $3.000.000 to his brother, and not to himself. So Charlie in his situation decides to take Raymond away from the medical institution he was left in, and goes on a huge road trip, not willing to give his brother up, unless the institutes settles his share of his father's assets. But as this slow but intriguing film goes on, the bonds get stronger, and you can see the devotion settling in around them as they establish some common ground. And so when the end of the film comes and the brothers are ripped apart, even though really you know they should be allowed to unite it is extremely saddening. The end scene is particularly good, and very emotional, and the fact Barry Levinson has made characters the audience can genuinely care for, it means that the overall effect on the viewers is elevated to a whole new and amazing degree. It is brilliant. Don't deny this film it's worth because of technicalities and the fact it doesn't relay the correct message, and praise the quality of its creation. Which is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best and most touching film productions to ever grace the screen.",Rain Man
201,superboy478,A Memorable Masterpiece,10,5 June 2002,"Rain Man was absolutley a tear jerker. And I mean that in a very good way because the film delt with certain issues and there were scenes where a person would just want to drop to the ground crying their eyes out. It was truly a wonderful film to watch.Car financer Charlie Babbit (Tom Cruise) has just found out that his father Sanford has just died and has left some things behind. First, he has left Charlie a classic car, but what Charlie is unaware of is that Sanford has just inhereted $1 million to Charlie's autistic brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) who has been held in a mental institution in Cincinatti, Ohio. Charlie travels to Ohio to meet his long lost brother and plans to get the money he feels he deserves. What happens is, Charlie kidnapps Raymond from the institution and they hit the road to Los Angeles. Charlie's plan is to keep Raymond until Charlie gets the $1 million. But along the way, Charlie turns from a greedy, selfish loser, into a caring person because he becomes close to Raymond and really develops a close bond with him. Their trip becomes the time of anyone's life.I must say that Dustin Hoffman delivered a real nice performance as Raymond and for sure deserved the Oscar that he won for the film. Tom Cruise did very well also.Rain Man is a movie for ages 14 and up and will teach you the beauty of having someone to look up to and love.",Rain Man

Cruise is on fire as the young egotistical car salesman whose $3 million inheritance falls to the autistic brother (Hoffmann) he never he had.  The rest of the film develops into a first-rate road movie as Cruise attempts to claim what should be is but ends up becoming a better man in the process.  Everything for a genuine masterpiece is there and is used to the full, the acting being the icing on top of the cake.  Whilst there certainly is moving, subtle drama, there's plenty of laughs in seeing the highly-strung Cruise's greedy ambitions falling through before finally finding his heart.

So it should not be too much of a surprise to learn Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his performance and Morrow won an Oscar for basically the same story.

The story of their meeting and discovery of each other is fantastic and fascinating.  The farm children who watch ""People's Court"" with Hoffman are well-cast and bring youthful interest and meaning to the plot.  This movie is truly beautiful, but also sad and has a powerful message behind it.  The mentally handicapped are not to be hidden or stuck in a room, they're to be treated as human beings and can learn for themselves.  It is a film that I highly recommend for all people who aren't yet acquainted with retarded or handicapped people, and also for those who have been.  ""Rain Man"" is truly fantastic and beautiful.",Rain Man
205,Ashcropolis,Kmart sucks,9,12 July 2019,"Rain Man is such a fantastic film. Heartfelt, pure. Just a dude and his long lost autistic brother on the road. Its been a while since I first saw this. I forgot about Some great, genuinely funny comedic scenes, but it does lack in the emotional/sentimental department. There's several moments where this movie where it could give you 'Good will hunting"" type of feels, but it just never quite gets there. Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman both are so fantastic. Natural performances that are just a treat to watch on screen.",Rain Man
206,quin1974,A road movie extraordinair,9,4 January 2001,"I had of course seen this years ago when it was released and later on video, but I never could really put my finger on what made this movie so good all those years ago. Yesterday I had the chance to view this excellent depiction again on TV after about 10 years, and now that I have grown into appreciating movies and being able to properly judge a movie I was astonished.First up there is the acting. Dustin Hoffman delivers his most touching and brilliant role as the savant brother Raymond, who was committed to an institution because he is autistic and needs guidance. Then there is Tom Cruise, who plays his first really character driven part after doing some light-weight movies, and I must say this is one of his best performances to date (among 4th of July and Magnolia). This role launched him into the big leagues, but regrettably he is cursed with his good looks (as is Brad Pitt). His role of Charlie Babbitt, the selfish entrepreneur in trouble, is a textbook example of a character that changed through the course of a movie, excellent. The other cast members are equally convincing and deliver great jobs.Second: directing. Barry Levinson has made a brilliant picture out of the Ronald Bass script, and should consider this his best directing move. The timing is top-notch in this flick and you really start to feel for Charlie in the end when he realizes that he loves his brother but isn't capable of taking care of him by himself.But for some people it might lack something. The action is packed in the characters and not in their actions. If you don't have an eye for detail this might come off as dull. But not for me, this picture has made it after all into my personal top 100 of favorite movies.I recommend this picture from now on to anyone who has a heart and who has the capability to listen to this heart.9/10",Rain Man
207,xiaoli7377,Hoffman Steals the Show in This Timeless Classic,10,29 August 2020,"Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) is a cranky and high-strung exotic car salesman who is left with a pittance of an inheritance from his distant father. Outraged, Charlie tracks down where the majority of his father's money went, which leads him to an institution for the mentally disabled in Cincinnati. While there, he meets an autistic savant named Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), who turns out to be an older brother that his father never told him about. Initially, Charlie kidnaps Raymond as leverage in order to receive the half of the inheritance that he sees as rightfully his, but through a cross-country road-trip with his older brother, his eyes and his heart are opened and he begins to form a bond with family that he never knew he had.The performances and script in this movie are what really make it so commendable and heartwarming. Particularly Dustin Hoffman as Raymond. It's a very rare thing for an actor to play a disabled role so convincingly and believably. Cruise is very good here as well, and you can just feel some of his anger and frustration seeping off of the screen. A lot of the movie revolves around the interactions between these two characters and the situations that they are placed in due to Raymond's strict adherence to a regimented world. It is through a gradual and slow process that Charlie begins to understand and accept Raymond's disability, and he also begins to learn more about himself and he learns to cope with his own issues that he had with his father.It's truly heartwarming and worthy of both the accolades that it received and the box office success that it achieved when it came out in 1988. And it still holds up today as a timeless tale of human relationships and self-discovery through unlikely circumstances. ""Rain Man"" is one of my all-time favorite movies, and I personally feel like it deserves even more recognition than it gets as an outstanding piece of cinematic art.",Rain Man
208,CarmaChan,In my Top 5 - Outstanding!!!,10,20 December 2007,"I can't count how many times I've watched this movie. I love it. I love every minute of it. I forget that I'm watching famous actors. I am seeing two brothers. I am seeing a transformation - small in the end, for Raymond, but huge for his little brother.I have no criticism at all about the movie Rain Man. It is perfectly entertaining. I puts me through all kinds of thoughts and emotions; it takes me on a journey; it makes me laugh and cry and want to kiss and dance, and try one more time to connect with extended family members who are so different from me, it feels impossible. This movie affirms that someday we'll understand each other a little better.",Rain Man
209,ShaeSpencer,Empathy,10,16 August 2020,"We all know Dustin Hoffman is riveting in this. But on my second viewing, I was deeply taken with Tom Cruise's performance.It's kind of a thankless role, having to act against such a transformative, justifiably showy performance. But the way Cruise makes you really believe in his character's arc, culminating in that wondrous moment of quiet kindness and understanding as they finally connect, that silent, soul-affirming catharsis of two polar opposites finally coming together in some mysterious, fleeting, hard-won center... And not only that, but we come to EMPATHIZE with this guy who was so loathsome at the film's start. It's one of the high points of Tom Cruise's career, and one of those rare moments of transcendent cinematic beauty I can only call 'magic.' Few actors could have pulled it off. Few directors have the guts to carve out this kind of space for their actors, leaving room for a miracle. Barry Levinson did. Thank God for that.On that note, I'm not satisfied that Levinson has gotten his due either. I say that knowing full well he got a well-deserved Best Director Oscar. This movie is a masterwork of tone, character development, and raw, honest emotion. It's a powerful picture of the struggle for familial intimacy. The last few minutes just fill me to bursting with a swell in the back of my throat, of bittersweet melancholy and heartache and gratitude that this experience was imparted to me. That something so simple and tender could cut through my cynicism. People who know me will tell you -- I'm not often so painfully earnest!If I haven't made myself clear, I love this movie. I want you to love it too.",Rain Man
210,Rifat_Rock_Don,One of the best films of the Dustin Hoffman & Tom Cruise are a perfect duo 😍,10,13 May 2020,"Rain Man is a moving story about two brothers, one a selfish yuppie named Charlie Babbitt who cares only about the importance of money and the other named Ray mond who is a autistic and doesn't know anything about the importance of money. Charlie realizes that his father left three million dollars to Ray mond and little to him, as he also realizes Ray momd is his brother! Charlie kidnaps Ray mond from his residential home and begins a long journey and discovery that will forever change both their lives. Rain Man is a completely moving, emotional, funny, and unforgettable movie. Dustin Hoffman is one of my favorite actors and plays his most memorable role as well as Tom Cruise, who gives a great performance that helped a lot in launching most of his career. The direction by Barry Levinson is stunning and of course, his best yet. Overall, the film is a timeless classic that moves me in every way. This is definitely one of the best films of the 80's and one of my all time favorites. Yea, definitely, definitely, recommend it!",Rain Man
211,The_Triad,"""They're gonna give daddy the Rain Man suite.""",9,6 July 2006,"Rain Man is a great film that works on so many levels. As a detailed character study, a comedy, a drama, it manages to blend so many fields of cinema, and it manages to pull all of them off. A short opening plot summary goes that Charlie Babbit is a guy who has a small car sales business that is going down fast. At the end of a stressful day of work, he gets a phone call telling him his father has died. Once he gets down to the matter of the will, most of his father's fortune has been left to a beneficiary - a man called Raymond. What follows is easily one of the best cinematic experiences anyone could wish for, a real gem of a character driven road movie, with perhaps the best dialogue ever in a film. The acting in particular is very good. Dustin Hoffman, obviously is amazing, but Tom Cruise also puts in a great turn that should not go unmentioned. My only initial qualm with the film was it's score. A weird pan pipe based piece of work. But as the film progressed, I supposed it made it more original than set it apart from any similar movies that would surely opt for some kind of Thomas Newman rip-off. To sum up, maybe a 9 out of 10 is perhaps too high, but I got myself into a pattern with my reviews where I rated certain films too high and... anyway... It is a great film and will surely be liked by anyone who has respect for great cinema, a good story and I'm sure most people in general.",Rain Man
212,suvopyne49,Rain Man touches the heart,10,14 February 2011,"A brilliant story ( Written by Barry Morrow), and well directed by Barry Levinson.

The story then moves to Charlie taking his brother away and wanting to do a deal to have half of the 3 million dollars which his brother inherited. In due course he developed a connection with his brother and the movie revolves around their relation.A stand-out performance by Dustin Hoffman, for which he won the academy award.

213,Ryan_9,Wonderful story!,10,17 August 2020,"Rain Man was a brilliant movie! Dustin Hoffman (Raymond Babbit) was incredible as he got so deep into character. I was very impressed that he could play an autistic man that well with his tone of voice, movements, and emotions. His performance will always be remembered. I'd say Tom Cruise's (Charlie Babbit) performance is underrated compared to Hoffman's. He shifted from an arrogant and greedy person to being grateful and caring for his brother. I feel like he deserves more credit because he was fantastic. The two of them had great chemistry with one another. This film also portrayed how people with disabilities should be treated instead of always being stereotyped.I loved the plot with Charlie and Raymond going on a cross-country trip to California as they told a wonderful story through love, acceptance, and family values. I also loved Ray's repetitive dialogue, such as ""Who's on first?"", I'm an excellent driver"" and ""K-Mart, 400 Oak Street."" Some of his lines made me laugh with how funny and memorable they were. The ""maple syrup is supposed to be on the table before the pancakes"" was another enjoyable line. Any scene when they would stay in a motel was great. I really liked it when they went to Las Vegas because of the reasoning and how Ray helped Charlie win. I was nervous they would get caught ""counting cards."" The ending was a little sad, but they left you feeling hopeful knowing that Charlie's visiting Raymond in two weeks and that they will continue to see each other.The cinematography was outstanding. I loved the long shots of them driving. I especially admired the shots of them cruising around Las Vegas as they were beautiful and captured the city well. Also, the shot of Charlie and Raymond leaving Wallbrook was excellent.Overall, I'll give Rain Man a 10/10. Brilliant movie with a wonderful story!",Rain Man
214,tobydale,A lovely movie for so many reasons,9,17 August 2015,"Have just watched this again after many years. A really good movie.By now Rain Man is a time capsule for the acquisitive thrusting 1980's - and it is great to watch simply to see how films were made back then, what they looked like and how they told their stories. This film reminded me of the movie Wall Street - with Gordon Gekko as the greedy badie. Cruise is on that spectrum, greedy, mean and selfish. Gekko has no redemption, but Rain Man is, slowly but surely Cruise's redemption. It's fine to see it unfolding.In a believable way, Cruise (Charlie Babbitt) slowly comes to terms with the facts that a) he has an older brother, Hoffman (Raymond Babbitt) that he never knew he had (thus compounding his contempt for his now deceased father), and b) his Autistic brother has really profound needs, but exceptional gifts. Cruise is the dynamic part of the pairing and gives an excellent performance going through shock, denial but eventually acceptance of the new realities. In return, Raymond slowly undergoes subtle changes in response to his brother Charlie and the experience of the road trip - in small ways he does learn to relate to Charlie and he acquires skills that he would not have acquired had he stayed forever in the Home. It's delightful to see the brothers slowly come to accept each other in their own ways.By today's standards Rain Man is a slow movie lacking in polish glitz and refinement. It's dated in the way it looks and the way it tells it's story - but I like it for that. Rain Man is also a forgotten movie, for some reason. This is a great shame as it is a really good film, with Cruise showing strongly. It is also a complete tour de force by Hoffman - who gives arguably his finest ever performance rightfully collecting the Best Actor Oscar.So - watch Rain Man - a lovely movie for so many reasons.",Rain Man

Charlie takes custody of brother Ray. When it's discovered Ray has amazing mathematical ability, including the ability to count cards, they take a road trip to Las Vegas.Scene after scene the brothers are compared. In a manner reminiscent of the movie 'The Effect of Gama Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds' which compared the lives of two sisters in a dysfunctional home, Rain Man seems to simply be a comparison of the lives of the two brothers. Charlie is harried constantly; struggling on cell phones, car phones and home phones in efforts to make his next pay check and meet their daily needs. Ray takes pleasure simply watching 'Wheel of Fortune'. Ray seems happier than brother Charlie.Tom Cruise could have won an academy award for his performance here also.

225,wolverinesforever,Here's a rarity: a film that gets a mental disability RIGHT,10,9 September 2010,"I am one of the few people who can personally relate to Raymond Babbit's condition. I was diagnosed with autism a long time ago. Because of this, I have tougher standards when it comes to movies that deal with mental or physical disabilities. Too often, I see films patronize these people as saints, even when they do almost nothing for themselves throughout the film. In my view, when it comes to dealing with ""disadvantaged"" people, I feel these figures should honestly overcome the odds despite or even because of their disabilities, or be recognized for whom they are (in a supporting light) for both their good and not so good traits (""Rain Man"" takes the latter approach). I have no qualms when I say that I was not inspired by the ""based on true events"" stories of ""The Elephant Man,"" ""Radio,"" and ""The Blind Side,"" because I felt these movies patronized disadvantaged people whom I felt had little agency for themselves.But, ""Rain Man,"" on the other hand, gets it right. Almost EXACTLY right. And it gets a rare 10/10 from me too.Let's start with the treatment of the Raymond Babbit character. He has mid-functioning autism, and he will be like that for the rest of his life. Though he's quick with math and card counting, he will never understand the concept of money or be able to function on his own. And the film wisely does not set him up as a figure to be hailed. Admired? Perhaps. All the same though, while Raymond does grow a little in that he allows a little more flexibility into his daily schedule and begins to share a bond with brother Charlie, he's still a mostly static character has some very positive (math and memorization) and very frustrating (takes things too literally, obsessive fears of the unknown world) characteristics.The real hero of the film, is his brother Charlie. And Charlie undergoes a REAL transformation. You actually watch him grow and change as he forces himself to take care of his brother. By the time he was trying to make a case to become his brother's guardian, I honestly believed his words and felt he had undergone a dramatic, yet subtle, change. The film handles his arc very delicately here; lots of small moments lead to the progression of his character.As almost everyone has stated before, the acting is superb in this picture. Dustin Hoffman is perfect as Raymond, absolutely perfect. His facial ticks, his refusal to look into eyes, his meltdown when he hears the smoke detector, it's all there. He truly sets a golden standard when it comes to playing autistic characters, or any character with a mental disability, for that matter. And Tom Cruise is perfectly cast as the yuppie brother Charlie. Admittedly, this does play right into his 1980's persona. But the way he transforms from being so immature and ignorant to becoming a caring person is so honest, so well done. I know it's easy to bash Tom Cruise these days, but when I watch this movie, I can't help but hold very high admiration for him.""Rain Man"" has held up well since it's 1988 release (my year of birth, in fact). Even today, though we know far more about autism, ""Rain Man"" still remains a smart insight into the condition. ""Rain Man"" gets both its story, and the issue of autism, RIGHT. And that is why it will continue to be appreciated by generations of film viewers for years to come.(Oh, and did I mention that Hans Zimmer's film score, his first to be nominated for an Oscar, is awesome as well?)",Rain Man
226,Patel_KH,Rain Man and the Main Man...Brotherhood as the way it should be!,9,15 August 2009,"Couple of things I want to mention before I reason out why this is a great film. First, the soundtrack of this film is amazing and very well suited to the film, its rare to hear the background music and feel the emotions that the director is trying hard to convey but this film perfectly executes that part.{It didn't win Oscar for the best original score, that to me indicates the winner must have a hell of a score to beat this} Second, I liked the poster of the film. It clearly shows the distinguishable personalities both the character have. Nice Work!I consider this a great film because of the following reasons: 1. Dustin Hoffman played an autistic savant and I've seen comments from people saying the performance isn't Oscar worthy because he played a one-dimensional character BUT thats the point my friends, he played the character with such prolonged intensity and dedication that it was truly an Oscar worthy performance. 2. Please don't bash Tom Cruise for no reason. He did a good job and complimented Dustin's character well. Couldn't ask more from him {I'm not a Tom Cruise fan but he did his job here}. I liked Charlie's compatibility with Raymond. 3. The movie was nicely done, Kudos to the director and all the staff involved. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was also quite witty and funny.The only fault if I can say so was that I wanted to see the brothers' relationship get more evolved than the end showed, a little more!This movie deserves to be in the Top 250...There are many unworthy candidates there who aren't as good as this movie in my opinion.I give this a 8.8/10",Rain Man

229,tupungato,Touching and very funny,9,28 August 2008,"The third or fourth time I watched Rain Main, I began to have doubts about the events that transpired in Las Vegas. When the casino management sequestered Charlie Babbit in a private room, informed him that they had videotaped him as he played Black Jack, accused him of counting cards, and ordered him to get out of the hotel and not return, they made no mention of the man with the deadpan demeanor sitting next to him at the table.""Just keep your mouth shut, take your winnings, leave the casino, and don't come back,"" they could have told Charlie Babbit, ""and take your strange little partner with you."" Seems that someone would have questioned Charlie about the man with whom he often spoke -- the dealer must have noticed that Charlie sometimes openly consulted Raymond before placing his bet--rather than treat Charlie as if he were traveling alone.If, as Raymond's Doctor Bruner said early in the film, an autistic person doesn't tolerate changes in his daily routine because he desperately needs order and predictability in his life to feel safe, wouldn't the constant flashing of lights, movement of people, and noise from slot machines and roulette wheels cause him to panic? The casino scene begs that question.In any case, my favorite part of the story takes place before the cross country road trip begins, when Charlie drives to Wallbrook, first discovers he has an older brother, and learns about his uniqueness. The dialog between Wallbrook employee, Vern, and Charlie, as well as Raymond's reaction to having unexpected visitors in his room sound very natural. The quality of the story does not really suffer,though, once Charlie and Raymond embark on the journey that takes them from Ohio to California. Dustin Hoffman does such a convincing job as an emotionally and socially limited yet intellectually gifted man, obsessed with numbers, patterns, and lists, and compelled to memorize them, that less plausible moments become believable.",Rain Man

231,emdragon,Walking in the Rain Man,7,18 February 2008,"This is an interesting movie. Self centered, high energy Charlie (Tom Cruise) takes his autistic brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), whom he has'nt been around for over 2 decades, and who has been locked up in a mental hospital. . . from the east coast to LA in his car. They must go by automobile because Raymond's autism affects him so that he cannot fly without overwhelming extreme terror. Raymond must be molly coddled and indulged to keep his disorder from destroying him along the way. A road adventure ensues. Charlie's motivation for the trip is money. He wants to get a piece of an inheritance from his father that is earmarked for Raymond whom he has'nt even seen since they were kids.OK. I liked the concept of it. Brotherly bonding and an interesting adventure. It is warm hearted, and therefor easy to like. But the implausibility of some of the scenes just blows me away. Are movie-goers actually willing to buy that a person can just automatically get rich gambling in a casino because a certain math skill (by Raymond, who is a savant) can give you, at best, a 1-2% edge? And there were other implausibilities as well. The age difference for one. Hoffman is clearly much much older than Cruise. And the manic need by Raymond (Dustin Hoffman's character) to watch certain television shows causes Charlie, in one scene, to pull up to a farm house so that Raymond can watch television. I never could convince myself that anybody would go for that, despite Charlie's affability. Otherwise, Barry Levinson does a good job directing this picture. The cinematography is quite excellent, and the sound and camera work is superb throughout the picture. Tom Cruise is OUTSTANDING in this picture. In my book it is his best performance in any movie I have seen him in. He plays snot-nose to perfection; slowly dissolved into brotherly and loving. His performance is the highlight of the film. Dustin Hoffman is less convincing to me as the autistic savant, though, to his credit he was fairly consistent throughout the picture, except when they got to Vegas he seemed to stretch out a bit and lost some credibility (for me).

234,jwiley-86292,I'm an excellent driver.,7,17 June 2017,"This review will be a comparison between this film and Snow Cake, which is about a high- functioning autistic woman. Speaking as one of these who can also form complete sentences, I need to explain why Rain Man is the better film in every way. Really, the two demand comparison.1. It has a sense of humor. Snow Cake treats autism like a much more sensitive subject, causing the tone to be more serious. It was also made after films about people with documented mental disorders had become a go-to award bait tactic. Consequently, Snow Cake is cloyingly sentimental to the point of being patronizing. Rain Man didn't have any pressure on it to be respectful, as the existence of autism was not common knowledge beforehand. There are many moments I legitimately found funny. 2. It is visually satisfying. I believe in the phrase ""every frame a painting,"" and the un-artistic setting of Snow Cake pales in comparison to the monumental cinematography of this film. Although Rain Man is set in the present day (for when it came out,) there is a clear effort to give the locations style by way of the 50s and 40s. In fact, parts of the film's aesthetic remind me of Adrian Lyne's Lolita. That is a compliment. 3. It's two and a half hours long, but feels shorter. And there you have it. I chalk up the possibly unflattering portrayal of autism in this film to where study of it was at the time. Snow Cake did not have that excuse. I feared condescending sentimentality, and was instead legitimately entertained.",Rain Man
235,MildInconvenienceMan,Good but the key is in the detail!!!,7,10 October 2012,"This was a good film that really helped the audience to understand autism and how much of an impact it can have in peoples lives, what I liked about it is it didn't dwell on this and instead had a great storyline that involved autism, rather than completely revolving around it like some kind of unique selling point.Hoffman's acting was superb and it was really hard to imagine him as anything else but autistic, he really got into the character and there were no obvious moments when he clearly was not in his autistic character, which really helped the flow of the film. On the other hand Cruise is an actor who I have always disliked, and this film was no different, he played his same old cool guy character, always wearing ruddy sunglasses, so frustrating. However even for him his realisation at the end of the film was sufficient enough to carry the end of the film even though in my own eyes the film ended fairly poorly.The ending just showed that life would carry on just as it had done before they had even met, and the most frustrating thing is that Cruise's money problems were never properly figured out, which was the whole reason he did this in the first place, yes he gambled but this never really explained the main storyline ending. As well as Cruise's reaction to his girlfriend having kissed his brother which was also unexpanded. Other moments such as Hoffman just leaning on his brother lightly obviously showed that Cruise had made a connection, but still why could he not have done that earlier, for someone with autism that situation would have been no different to any other, as well as Hoffman telling jokes, so the story became more fantasy based than based on any kind of real fact.It was this kind of flawed storyline which showed a lack of research while writing the film, which really showed especially towards the end of the film which prevented it from being a truly great movie. In spite of this it is still a very good movie that shows the expansion of Cruise's character although against his character type, it is still good to watch and enjoy, but lacks the realism of a film great.Good but the key is in the detail and this film just didn't deliver in terms of realism, especially on such a sensitive and misunderstood subject.",Rain Man
236,john-3109,Peek District,10,27 February 2006,"Barry Levinson's (1998) film of Barry Morrow's story loosely based on the life of Kim Peek explores the uneasy, deepening relationship between fictitious savant Raymond Babbit (Dustin Hoffman) and his long lost brother Charlie (Tom Cruise).No surprise that Ron Bass, who shares the screen writing credit, has in preparation a film of 'The Butterfly and the Diving Bell'.The death of the Babbit boys' father triggers a chain of events and a journey on which we accompany the vulnerable orphan Raymond, and his rather shallow and pretentious brother.It's rather interesting to compare the story of Raymond in the film and the real life-story of Kim Peek.In life, rather than in art, Kim Peek is as becoming as Dustin Hoffman manages to make Raymond Babbit. But he is cared for, not in an institution - as Raymond is - but by his own father... who, in everyday life, is far from wealthy.Pardoxically, in the documentary, we see Kim being put through his paces by neurologists and psychologists who are heavy on tests and measurements but light on understanding. Quite the opposite of the institutional carers shown in the film, who are not slow to miss the facets of Raymond's experience which are non-standard. They are very much the worthy and responsible custodians of Raymond's fragile existence.The film helps us to begin to confront the uncomfortable and inevitable situation of the Raymond Babbits of this world. The father of the real Raymond Babbit (Kim Peek) will very probably die before he does. Like Raymond, Kim Peek can easily memorise air safety statistics. But, aged 40 something, he is still having trouble getting food into his mouth without leaving a lot of it smeared all over his face.The uncomfortable exasperation which Charlie Babbit shows us in the early stages of the film is the likely inheritance of any actual Raymond when their parents become infirm and die. There are hardly any fathers wealthy enough to fund meaningful care for individuals in Raymond's situation.They rely on an unexpected miracle, which happens in the film. They rely on something happening to somebody else that will engender in them a lasting commitment quite inappropriate to anybody who is not their natural parent.There is no neurology or psychology text book yet published that could make this process as obvious and straightforwardly accessible as this film does.",Rain Man

240,mauricebarringer,Hoffman is an extraordinary actor.,8,2 March 2007,"This outstanding film was highlighted by Dustin Hoffman's superb performance. I taught high school for 22 years with 10 of them teaching mentally retarded students, many of whom were autistic.Having worked with these disabled people I can say that categorically without exception Hoffman's performance is the best I have ever seen regarding a portrayal of a mentally retarded person. His lack of emotion and repetitiveness in his mannerisms, speech and emotions were highly accurate. (A few reviewers criticized him for lacking emotion, but this is exactly how mentally retarded autistic individuals behave.) Incidentally, 75% of people with autism are also mentally retarded.Hoffman's Raymond was not high functioning as the film doctor said. (Another astute reviewer mentioned this also.) He was mentally retarded with a small portion of his brain having savant ability for mathematics.Hoffman's character had substandard intellectual and cognitive skills (couldn't perform simple math questions) and poor adaptive behavior (his interaction with the prostitute and his inability to discuss subjects intelligently or even simplistically). These are the 2 criteria for mental retardation along with the disability occurring before the age of 3.My only complaint with this otherwise outstanding film was the scene where Hoffman and Cruise stopped at the rural house so that Hoffman's character could watch a TV show. The scene should have been cut as it was not realistic.",Rain Man
241,ericventura,My Main Man,10,12 August 2017,"I have to trust Michael Caine on his opinion of Tom Cruise in Rain Man, describing the subtlety and intricacy that Cruise depicted accurately in his role of a brother kindling a relationship with his estranged brother. Cruise deserved the Oscar, but I love Hoffman's performance all the same.In the end, Rain Man is simple perfection. The realism and beauty in the screenplay is amazing. To portray a subtly developing relationship between brothers who have not known each other with such incredible emotion, is a feat that will rarely or never be achieved again. Silence of the Lambs (1991) depicted a perverted relationship between a psychopath and a scared detective, The Godfather (1972) depicted the violent relationships of a mafia family, and Chinatown (1974) depicted the twisted relationships of a screwed-up family, but Rain Man achieved described the brotherly relationship with universal truth and raw emotion. Rarely seen perfection makes an instant classic, but two of the greatest performances of the late century by Cruise and Hoffman only accentuate the relationship. Valeria Galino delivers a fine-tuned performance as the oddly erotic girlfriend who drives the brothers forward in an intensely interesting fashion.There's not much else to say except that the ""my main man"" scene is done with chilling perfection. The raw emotion gave me the chills and put me on the verge of tears. To evoke such emotion in the characters and the viewers is a monumental task. If any film did it right, this one did.",Rain Man

It had been 14 years since I had seen it, and I had some birthday money, so I bought the DVD.  I loved it as much as I did the first time.  It was definitely worthy of its Best Picture Oscar.Tom Cruise plays Charlie Babbock, a very self-centered man.  He learns that his long estranged father has died, and is upset when the will is read.  The money winds up going to Raymond Babbock (Dustin Hoffman), his much older brother who he never knew existed up to this point.  Raymond is in an institution because he is a man with savant syndrome, a disorder on the autism spectrum.  Charlie is upset because all the money went to Raymond, who does not know anything about money, or understand money's purpose or value.Charlie takes Raymond with him to try to bargain in order to get what he thinks is his rightful share of his dead father's money.  He tries to take him on an airplane to L.A. but Raymond is terrified of airplanes, leaving them to get there by car - a three day journey.It is on this road trip that Charlie gets to know his brother very well.  In this movie you see Charlie gradually transform from an impatient, selfish man, who treats Raymond like an object, rather than a person, to someone who grows to understand, and love Raymond.  Anyone who thinks Tom Cruise can't act, needs to buy or rent this DVD and watch it over and over again.  Watch for the gradual change in Charlie's heart.I gave this movie a ten.",Rain Man

Cruise is his usual Yes I'm so beautiful I don't really have to act, self indulgent jerk. And, Golino, what the hell is she doing in this flick. She was overmatched in Hot Shots Part Deux, and is way out of her dramatic league here. I know, you're going to say but what about Hoffman? Hoffman did disappear into the role(as he usually does) but I found his character to be very shallow and one dimensional,even by austistic standards.I thought the kid in Mercury rising, to be a much more believable autistic(and I have worked with both autistic kids and adults).Also, most institutions that have autistic people, have much better security than the one in this movie.Plus, the Las Vegas scenes were totally unbelievable.If real people had just taken 70 thousand of some casinos money, they wouldn't have just been asked to leave the hotel.They would have been escorted to the bottom of lake Meade, complete with cement sneakers.There are a few somewhat touching scenes between Tom and Dustin, but far too few to waste time on this film.My opinion of this movie was summed up by Hoffman...Kmart sucks...Dustin, so does this movie.",Rain Man
246,EzioMonty117,A crowning achievement in Dustin Hoffman's career,10,1 October 2015,"Rain Man rounds up how much a Drama film could be so special. The film's acting, Message, wit, drama and it's story is all Perfect, here's why this film is great.The story follows Charlie Babbitt, a selfish yuppie who after finding out his father misfortune of Death, he must take care of his autistic savant Brother Raymond Babbitt since he has fear of planes, they go on a road trip to Las Vegas where Raymond learns about gambling, learn to Dance and kiss, but also that Charlie finds out that Raymond is a number genius and somehow have a Close Connection to each other as the film goes on.The film's screenplay is top-notch having both a comedic and sad appeal to the film's premise. The performances particularly Dustin Hoffman is one of the most intriguing performances in a Movie yet. Everything from timing to script is all done perfectly, Tom Cruise is good as well but somehow less promising With annoying tone and poor decision Choice for script for the character.The Music by Hans Zimmer is alright, sometimes it sounds great, and sometimes it sounds god awful. I don't think Hans Zimmer should do the Music for this Movie, but im the only one. The direction is stunning, the film having a autistic Brother is a genius idea, this Movie does this idea perfectly.The card-playing scene in Caesar's Palace is fascinating and the one of the most entertaining scenes in the Movie along With the scene where Raymond is out on the road stopping at a red light on the road.The film's most emotional scene is when Raymond talks about the Rain Man that Charlie kept thinking about as a kid. It's all done in a dramatic matter, which makes the film much better.The film has it's problems like the Music and it's somehow disappointing ending, but other than that, this film rocks.Rain Man is a must watch for all People looking for a comedic drama Movie that is pretty darn great. Performances, script, humour, drama, screenplay and Message is outstanding despite Music being OK and having a abrupt ending. Don't miss out this Movie.10/10",Rain Man

He captures autism in such a way that you could actually believe in his performance.Tom Cruise's role was equally as brilliant.  His gradual understanding of his brother's disability (and extra abilities) lead to the grasping of a strong relationship with his brother.I feel that the trip across the country was the start in the relationship (because of the scene at the airport) and also the real start of the film.This is a film that everyone can watch because everyone can understand and enjoy it.",Rain Man

I think it is quite special among movies about family. And I suppose this is because I could feel that the brothers actually accept each other as their part of life by sensing very small things. There was no rapid change, but it was true that some connections were between them. Of course it is very hard for them to totally open their minds due to the 20 years and illness, but the road trip could narrow the gap a little bit between Raymond and Charlie.I like the ending. There is no huge change in there lives, but the brothers actually go through some tiny changes. Way more realistic. Also it was very sad to see that Charlie could not help but let Raymond go back. I could see something unspeakable in his eyes when Charlie said good bye to his brother. Tom Cruise is a excellent actor. And of course, no doubt, Dustin Hoffman is amazingly talented. His performance was astonishing in this movie. And I got to respect him more after knowing that he is the one who changed the ending of the film.

252,ralphgillis,Accepting The Way Of Life,7,18 September 2021,"18 September 2000Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman form an unlikely duo that works really well. Hoffman plays the role of a severely autistic man. This performance deserves a lot of concentration and substance to pull off well, you definitely don't want it to seem in-genuine or feel forced. He needs to stay in character at all times, there's a certain barrier he can't cross and if he does, he fails. Cruise's character is a selfish young man who only cares about himself. He plays the role perfectly and gets to act in heartfelt scenes that prove he is a diverse actor that doesn't deserve all the hate he receives. But that is gonna change when he meets his long lost autistic older brother, they will live together and soon enough learn to love each other.The handicapped are portrayed in a sad and melancholic way in films but in this film it feels real and honest because instead of being stuck in a mental institution throughout the entire movie, he gets to be free and do things he didn't think he was able to do. Cruise plays a part of that because most of the time he is trying to cope with living with an autistic person, he yells at him and sometimes insults him. The handicapped are treated with more realism than you would normally see in a movie, it's also interesting to see how they would react if they were out of their institution and had to live in civilisation with all the deficits they have to face.As we see these two characters come together, there is a string of hope. The audience hopes that they will be able to look past the complications and negativity that surround both of their lives from that moment on, and finally learn to love each-other by the end of the film, and that certainly happens. The audience feels sympathetic towards the characters because they have both been treated badly in the past.The ending is bittersweet and it doesn't work out the way you would want it to. It's not a happy ending, which to me is acceptable. It's very realistic, not everything works out. It's heartwarming and touching because these two characters evolved drastically and it feels as it it was the final goodbye, even though it's not.I recommend Rain Man even though I feel as if the pacing could be a bit better mid-way during the movie. It's a tad bit too slow. Nevertheless it's worth watching.",Rain Man

Dustin Hoffman does a great performance as an autistic guy, with his way of talking and his facial expressions. Tom Cruise did a very brilliant job as well, and I think his part was also very important, because he is the guy who changes from rude and self-centered jerk to a guy who cares about the safety of his brother.

The music mixes with the movie as does a screwdriver drink. Rain Man is actually a two actor film. Of course, a small but important part of Tom Cruise's girlfriend is played by the ever pretty Valerio Golino. Let us not talk about Dustin Hoffman or Tom Cruise. Hoffman got an academy for this. Both the actors can achieve the depth that was required of them 10 out of 10 times, we all know that. Instead, let us talk about Barry Levinson. My point is ""If you have a good story to tell, people will listen"". The movie starts with a great scene, follows that great scene with another one and does so until the last scene. Nothing is out of place here. I have seen this movie like 10 times and still find it entirely watchable again. The cross country drive made the whole movie an excellent watch. Rain Man is a great cinematic experience.What it does best is that it touches the core of human sensitivity while on the road. It is Barry Levinson who made this simple story an Academy winning effort instead of just another road movie. Barry Levinson pulled out a miracle out of mere nothing and used the two actors with such class, it will stand the test of time for generations to come.The outbursts by the autistic character played by Hoffman were so nicely done, kudos to him.

256,pensive_englishman,A must see 80s classic,10,31 December 2020,"""My grand-ma and your grand-ma were sit-tin' by the fire.
My grand-ma told your grand-ma: ""I'm gon-na set your flag on fire.""Iko Iko what a familiar song dedicated to the 1988 classic film Rain Man. Can you believe that 32 years after its debut I have finally got the chance to watch the full version of this heart warming and tear bringing classic film, after initially watching a few segments in the 90s as part of my English study?The plot is quite an interesting one being that a young and at times manipulative brother ""kidnapped"" his older and autistic brother in an bid for his half of the $3m inheritance. Obviously when you deal with an autistic person 24/7 it is only normal for you to be pushed over the edge. Dramas rely on conflicts which are stripped quite bare in this show. The one-sided ""arguments"" are exemplified via a few hilarious but dumbfounding scenes such as Raymond's irrational refusal to board the plane due to airlines' crashing history and his autistic insistence on getting K-mart underwear. Yet it is exactly conflict that pushes the plot forward. My observation of most films is that it is when conflict reaches its crescendo that it gets softened. This show proves to be no exception. All the salvos Charlie hurled at his brother Raymond took a drastic downturn when he found out the Rain Man in his childhood is actually Raymond his brother. Then things start to improve. There are many touching scenes in the story such as Charlie teaching Raymond dancing, Susanna kissing Raymond in the elevator and the two brothers having pancakes together. And perhaps such moving scenes reach their climaxes when Charlie puts his forehead against his brother's and kisses him as a show of love having decided to give up the legal battle for his custody. Isn't this sufficient to bring a tear or more?I always say cast and crew matter. After all no film would be accomplished without accomplished actors. Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman, what a commensurate and complementary pair. Both have got tremendous acting skills. The fact Hoffman was awarded best actor in a leading in the 1989 Academy Award is quite telling. Biased or not, I can't hide my fondness for our brother Tom, who not only possesses strikingly good look but also excels in versatility of roles from ancient warrior to futuristic sci-fi astronaut, from IMF agent to sophisticated drama characters like Charlie. Both actors are such a formidable duo.Filming locations are not critical review for some but I always like to mention them as they form a significant part of the backdrop. It is by research and probably thanks to IMDb information that I find out the film was shot on a wide span of US states. The mountains on the backdrop, the country roads, the glamor of Las Vegas are all too familiar to be left out. That really draws me close to my past two US trips.And perhaps one more thing before you get fed up with me - the anecdote of Qantas that never crashes. That certainly endorses the safety record of our national carrier. Thank you for flying with Qantas - the spirit of Australia. And welcome to Down Under.All in all Rain Man is a classic must see for the 80s. Make sure you watch it. Goodbye Rain Man. I'll see you soon. Remember in the closing scene, ""one for bad and two for good."" ""Bet two for good.""",Rain Man
257,TigerlilyBramble_of_WillowBottom,"C-H-A-R-L-I-E, my main man",9,15 June 2002,"No offense, but anyone who can possibly find anything bad to say about ""Rain Man"" either doesn't understand the movie, doesn't appreciate excellent acting or directing or screenplay writing, or simply needs to get a life. By the way, I am under 14, and I loved the story of Raymond and Charlie Babbitt.Like practically everyone else said, Dustin Hoffman soars. So does Tom Cruise--this was actually the first Cruise film I ever saw and didn't even like him at first because his character was so selfish and dependent. Now back to Hoffman. There wasn't a single moment where I didn't believe that he was autistic. I was on Raymond's side most of the time, but sometimes he got REALLY frustrating.One of the funniest things in this movie was that Raymond and Charlie were one of the most mismatched duos in screenwriting history. If everything wasn't exactly the way Charlie wanted it, he'd throw a fit. (Actually, that's one thing he and Raymond had in common!) He was the exact opposite of understanding. When Raymond started to gripe that something wasn't working out, IT DROVE CHARLIE NUTS! One of the ways they show this is when Charlie yells ""SON OF A B***H!"" out in the middle of nowhere.I also like the part when Susanna tells Raymond that just because the hooker didn't want to meet him didn't mean that there weren't any other women who would like him, and then she kisses him. Most men would go wild if that happened--Susanna was so attractive and smart--but Raymond hardly understood what was going on (""So how was that?"" ""Wet."").Another thing I appreciated about this film was that it didn't have a Hollywood ending; it was believable. But when it did end, I was sad because I wanted more! I suppose if you're the sensitive type, unlike me (or maybe I'm just too young), you should have a box of Kleenex handy, but at other times, the only crying you'll do is from laughing too much. Overall, ""Rain Man"" was a very touching and funny film, and I'd recommend it to anyone who appreciates a very good movie.",Rain Man

259,umashankarpati1997,Charlie Babbit made Joke. My main man !,10,24 February 2017,"Watched it for the 2nd time and wrote this review. This was not a movie that needed forced emotion; it played better because it was understated, because the ending is oblique and because it rang true. This film changed how many people perceived the autistic; suddenly they weren't 'retards' to be shut away, but intriguing individuals. Few movies really do this. But 'Rain Man' did something even rarer: it not only made the audience think, it made them happy.The ending is the sort of rare conclusion that brings tears to the eyes. Throughout the film, Charlie is an arrogant, ignorant, greedy businessman who cares of no one but himself. By the end, however, he has learned more than he has in his entire lifetime from the brother he never had. And unlike a lot of the buddy films out there, we get to see the bonding between Charlie and his big brother, Raymond, form on a daily basis, until it is brought to a standstill.Dustin Hoffman gives his best performance in ""Rain Man,"" one of such unmatched strength and brilliance that we often feel that we are really watching an autistic man on screen. Raymond Babbitt is one of the most memorable characters you will ever encounter as a viewer, and though Dustin Hoffman isn't necessarily a favorite actor of mine, I place his performance in ""Rain Man"" as one of the most convincing and touching performances of all time.Trying to put the reason that ""Rain Man"" is so great into words is simply impossible. It's got everything. And as humorous as Raymond Babbitt becomes, he never seems unreal or obnoxious. As I watch him every time I watch the movie, I completely forget Dustin Hoffman is playing him until I mentally remark on how well he is doing so. This is movie magic, folks.Hollywood has a fascination with characters like Forrest Gump and Raymond Babbitt, but -- even more so than Gump -- Raymond is never annoying.

Raymond is a fair bit more impaired than Forrest, and we feel for him even more (though which is the better film I could never say).By all means, see this movie.

As for Rain Man, it's not a bad film, but I can only see myself thinking it a great film if I were back in 1988 and the pickings for great movies were slim. Dustin's performance is actually quite good and well deserving of the Oscar he won for it. By comparison, Tom Cruise is decent in the film and his dialogue and character growth are unconvincing at worse and routine at best.",Rain Man

It's also because the DVD was on sale at S$9.95 so I just bought it out of curiosity after seeing other people buying it.Dustin does not disappoint; his acting is amazing. He plays the autistic older brother very well, funny and charming. But the story is only average.You can only put so much humor between 2 people as they start a journey of self-discovery. I watched it only once and that is enough. I'd have to put this film aside for a while before I can watch it again and find it interesting.The conversation between the brothers get boring after a while. The film is too long- over 2 hours. I'm tired of Tom Cruise's grumbling after a while and Dustin, playing autistic, can only say those few lines and interesting as they are, it's once too many times.I can't believe it's rated so high at 8.0/10. I'd rate it only 3/5. Good rental, but not worth keeping.",Rain Man

But this movie came out the perfect time, has the perfect cast, and perfect storytelling for it's time. I just watched this movie and appreciated it so much. This movie has really great performances by Tom Cruise and of course Dustin Hoffman who acted perfectly. I have not seen Dustin Hoffman's other movies and seen him in other stuff so I believed he was autistic.The dialog is also great seeing this guy who is not really healthy and happy and seeing his reactions to having a brother you don't know about and reacting to it. And Dustin Hoffman's characters reactions are equally as great too learning things from his little brother. It is also fun to see Tom Cruise getting mad because that happens in almost every movie he is in and also, to be honest, Tom Cruise is really great at playing these aggressive jerks and that is great to see to seeing his character being a better person at the end and having family. And at the end, you just see how happy the two characters are and that is what it is all about. This is an upgrade to cinema and it totally deserves the Oscars it has won. A 10/10 in it's genre and a 10/10 overall.",Rain Man

Of course savant behavior cannot be determined before birth, but certainly to think of a lifetime of caring for someone like Ray could be very overwhelming.Currently there is a popular early teen book is about a girl who acquires mathematical savant behavior after being shocked into cardiac arrest by a bolt of lightning, so if you want to know more check with your library or online.An incredibly interesting topic but just wish I could see the film all the way through (sans his selfish brother's nasty language).",Rain Man

I have Asperger's, and though I'm not a lot like Raymond, it's a step towards understanding.

This movie has beautiful layers, focusing mainly on emotional bonds, slowly unfold one by one as the movie progresses. Dustin Hoffman(Raymond Babbit)portrays his character excellently.

Course it's obvious which actor played the autistic one, Dustin Hoffman of course, Tom Cruise couldn't pull off something like that, and even if he could, it wouldn't be any near as good as Hoffman's portrayal. ""Rain Man"" is a touching tale of brotherly bond and self discovery that had a very deep impact on me personally, because like Charlie Baggitt (Tom Cruise) I also have a brother who is autistic, so I understand the sheer frustration and anger that he experiences in this movie. What was really moving about this movie was the amazing transformation that Cruise's character took on while on this road trip. What started out as an act of kidnapping, provoked by desperation and anger for his father, became a life changing emotional journey. Past memories are redefined and new feelings of compassion and love are introduced and it's an incredibly heart provoking experience. Some of the most powerful moments you have ever seen take place between two people are featured in this movie (The last scene: where the two brothers are finally separated after a very long week of spending time together, when Raymond gets on the train to go back to Wolbrook and Charlie watches him leave, it's a very saddening time and I almost broke out in tears, almost.) Barry Levinson has succeeded in creating characters that you can really care about, as well as creating his best movie ever. It's an unforgettably heart-warming story of brotherly bond, powered by an Oscar winning performance by Dustin Hoffman, and the part that set Tom Cruise up for life. Miss it, and miss out.",Rain Man
269,Janita Dusbee,"Funny, but sad or even disturbing",10,22 October 2000,"I have never seen a movie being so direct and straight to the point. Since autism is a very serious illness, it was often called 'too bad', or 'I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do about it'. Thanks to Dustin Hoffman's excellent, almost perfect role, the seriousness of the disease was brought out in the open and since a lot of research is performed under pressure of media and society, the movie has a goal...And hit it! Next to the social importance, it's allso a great movie, funny but very sad, so no one exept the ones who are very familiar with the syndrome knows what to think.",Rain Man

Hoffman gives an excellent portrayal of a man with autism, totally unable to comprehend the real world around him. Cruise is no less impressive. While he is essentially playing to type, his character's attitude changes so gradually throughout the film that you barely notice, and without Cruise's subtle performance this transformation would be much less credible.This is a highly commendable film, which, despite tackling a tricky subject, refuses to succumb to sentimentality. In giving autism such publicity, the film has hopefully helped to lessen the stigma brought on by ignorance of this condition.Rain Man's great success is that it shows the way forward for issue driven movies in Hollywood. Its success at the box office demonstrates that taking a risk can pay off in spades, provided that the film is good enough.",Rain Man

His performance is wonderful and makes us think that he has really autism, for example, his screaming, the way he talks, his laughing and so on. Although Raymond that Dustin Hoffman plays talks monotonically, his performance tells us feeling of Raymond. As a result, I was absorbed in this story. In this story, Carlie and Raymond are described in contact. In generally, I think that they don't understand each other. However, Carlie changes slowly through contacting with Raymond. I think that this change is also attractive in this story. I think that this movie contains many meanings, so when we watched this movie again and again, I think that our feelings and thought will change. Because of this, I want to watch this movie carefully again and understand point of uncertainly and hidden meanings. I think that this movie is able to enjoy and be impressed!",Rain Man

I remember thinking of him as arrogant also cocky seems like he acts like he is Johnny Depp when he is not however Dustin Hoffman just watch his other movies like The Graduate , Tootsie , Kramer vs Kramer and more he is truthfully one of the best actors of all time like Depp. You can tell by how he played Raymond so intelligent yet so Autistic. His voice, The way he stares into the world, sporadically accurate, yet stuck in repetition , his movements through out the movie. He worked hard on it probably one of the hardest roles in a movie to play. This is my Fourth review on IMDb and its so tough how to describe this movie. Its really emotional I did not cry however there were a lot of moments were you felt what they were going through. Charlie changes through the movie he is first selfish and slowly transforms into an understanding and loving of Raymond. The moment that was my favorite and got to me the most was when Charlie figured out Raymond was the protective figure from his childhood who helped him when he was scared who he thought was an imaginary friend named ""Rain Man"", which was a mispronunciation of Raymond. Raymond was not just autistic he helped his brother Charlie out along time ago to me Raymond or his alter ego ""Rain Man"" was the Hero and Charlie as his brother could only do what his heart said to do - Look after your brother and protect him like he did for me along time ago - That being said a wonderful movie it has a few funny bits on there journey.

Where to begin with the praise for this movie?  Let's start with the acting.  Dustin Hoffman is my favorite actor, and has been for a while.  I'd watch him in any role.  I was amazed at the way he was able to pull off this role.  I've never seen a more deserved Oscar win.  The vacant stare, the monotone voice, the screaming, it was unbelievable.  Each time I watch it I am floored by his talent.  Tom Cruise is also good, the villain of the story who undergoes such a subtle change that it's almost not visible until nearly the end.  He is, however, perfectly suited for the flashy, egotistical character of Charlie, and I think he did a great job.  The directing was unobtrusive and beautiful, for the most part just letting the action unfold, which is exactly the way it should have been done.  It's a feel-good movie that does that and more, and I think nothing I've seen in the movies is as touching as the scene in the motel where Charlie discovers who ""Rain Man"" really is.  I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10.  Absolutely wonderful.",Rain Man
277,harrymccormack1981,Classic Character Study,10,21 October 2012,"I've watched this film many times and it gets better by each viewing.The film centres around Charlie Babbit, a selfish and arrogant thirty-something car dealer who is suffering from massive debt due to over-due loans. His rich estranged father has died and Babbit jr finds out that $3m of his estate has been passed over him into a ""trust"". Charlie's inheritance includes the car which ended his relationship with his father and rose bushes.Charlie, along with his harassed girlfriend Susanna go to investigate and find the ""trustee"" is a doctor in charge of a care home called the Walbrook Institute and the man who has inherited the $3m is the big brother that Charlie never knew he had. Raymond is an autistic savant with care needs but also a splendid memory for facts and figures.Charlie, angered by this revelation, ""kidnaps"" Raymond from his home (although he is a voluntary patient) and demands negotiations around the will with Dr Bruner, the man in charge of Raymond's care.What follows is a road movie of sorts which delves into the depths of character study of the two brothers in both humorous and serious tone which by the conclusion gives the viewer food for thought.Rain Man has been criticised by his stereotyping of people with autism but having autism myself I can't see anything in the film to provoke this except maybe for its minor generalisation (Raymond's memory, strict life routines, difficulty in human interaction). That alone is no more offensive than films showing a pair of twins talking at the same time which appears regularly in a lot of films.Rain Man is a classic.",Rain Man

279,redshoesfall,Watch this for One Reason:,6,25 July 2017,"This is a solid film, though there's really only one reason why you should see this film, and that's due to Dustin's performance. If you're a Tom Cruise fan, then props to you, but much like how Chris O'Donnel's performance is pushed into the background by Pacino's in Scent of a Woman, Tom Cruise is a bore in comparison to Dustin. All you want to see is Dustin Hoffman disappear and become a completely different and believable man. It's quite an experience.The movie (or plot) itself is not without substance: all you want to watch is Hoffman's character Raymond and his chemistry with Cruise's Charlie. The plot surrounding Raymond is incredible, and really takes its time for you to get to know and understand him, probably one of the greatest portrayals of autism on screen, though everything else that happens within the film fades away when he's not the focus.As far as the gray areas or the weaker points in the film goes, it's namely having to do with Tom Cruise's character/performance, and let me press this in that I don't believe his character takes away from the film, though doesn't add much of anything either. This is my personal opinion - his central plot and personal objectives are more vehicular rather than entertaining, and in that sort, ineffective. In general, the film is a joy to watch and certainly something to keep on the shelf, but namely in the way Scent of A Woman is watchable (although I do also believe this film is better).A wonderful and somewhat nostalgic watch.

The gentle emotional bond of Charlie to Raymond is a fusion of tension and comedy. I've never been a Tom Cruise fan, and past this film, I'm still not one. Nevertheless, his talent is truly on show here. His role as Charlie is a difficult one; he has to lead a film along side an actor who is playing a very complex and captivating character. On top of that, he has to flesh out a man who could on the surface, be played very two dimensionally. Cruise succeeds in making Charlie's growth through the film as fascinating as watching Raymond.I think what motivated this comment was how evocative this film is. I started to watch this film again (borrowed from the family) as background noise as I finished some artwork. Within thirty minutes, I was away from the drawing board and spellbound. I don't usually laugh out loud, and I certainly rarely feel like crying because of a film, but the chemistry is so poignant and yet so fluid, you can't help swing back and forth through the emotional spectrum.I doubt I've added anything new to all the other comments here.

This movie makes me think every time I see it, it's one of those movies that you can watch more than once, rent it and experience the world you may not know exists. Get the Special Edition DVD, if you're wanting to buy this film. The DVD only has three commentaries, one deleted scene and a featurette. Also a few trailers and photo gallery, but MGM could have done much better. For a special edition re-release it still kind of sucks. Nevertheless, you're supposed to enjoy the film.

His portrayal of Raymond is ingenious, emotional, humourous,touching and above all believeable. He is mesmerising on screen as Raymond.I also believe this is Tom Cruise's finest performance. I am a big fan of Tom Cruise because he makes films I wish I was in ( Top Gun, Mission Impossible etc), but many people see him more as a ""movie star"" rather than an actor. However in this film the transformation his character goes through during the course of the film is very well handled and executed.

295,abettertomorrow,Flawless,10,6 June 2000,"One of the rare films in cinema history which can boast having absolutely no flaws. Even films like The Godfather, Gone With the Wind and Citizen Kane had flaws if you look closely. Rain Man's simple narrative structure and story may create doubt and manipulate you but after multiple viewings it will become part of you. Part of your personality.Dustin Hoffman delivers an extraordinary Academy Award-winning performance as Raymond Babbit, an idiot savant who has just inherited his father's money, to the dismay of brother Charlie Babbit (Tom Cruise in a very underrated performance). Charlie, frustrated at this, decides to take advantage of his brother's handicap and take him on a road trip to manipulate him into getting some of money. On that long journey, Charlie becomes increasingly fond of his new-found brother, especially after learning that Raymond used to take care of him when they were kids.The story sounds very derivative, I know, but what makes it so unique is the realistic turns the movie takes. First of all Charlie's major character change takes place over a long period of time deliberately so you won't take notice until at the very end. The idiot savant character of Raymond is portrayed in the movie very well and honestly. Idiot savants are incapable of emotional thoughts and the film stays true to that theory by having very little character change for Raymond throughout the movie.Director Barry Levinson (who has a crucial cameo in the movie) did such a fantastic job in this film. There were so many directing changes in the production of this film it is very surprising Levinson pulled it off. His direction is a very subtle, subliminal direction which from a distance looks very ordinary and traditional but when thought over becomes an intellectually stimulating style (similar to Sidney Lumet and Francis Ford Coppola in their prime). The way he slowly changes Charlie's character while making us more sympathetic with Raymond is simply masterful. He puts us in the journey into Charlie's point of view. We first see Raymond as a pathetic, poor individual but at the end of the film we look at him as our brother. Most people would say this film has no theme or message, but they just haven't looked deeply enough. The theme is that the more we learn about someone we begin to gain respect for him and eventually love him. The unchanging character of Raymond embodies this message.",Rain Man
296,booyatom,Road Trip!,9,22 October 2006,"This is an actor's movie, first and foremost. There's very little in the sense of eye-candy and on screen acrobatics, but there sure is quite a lot of emotion and humanity. This is thanks to a great screenplay that allows for an astonishing character evolution for Tom Cruise as well as a clearly defined and stable yet at times erratic character for an accomplished Dustin Hoffman. The plot is intelligently conceived in that it begins with a huge moral roadblock for Cruise's character Charlie Babbitt. We are introduced to a rich and kind of arrogant profit-seeking guy who wants in on his father's inheritance. This inheritance, however, happens to be in the hands of his long-lost autistic-savant brother, Ray, who doesn't ""understand the concept of money"" (a comical contrast with Charlie's nature). All this because Charlie didn't get along with his father; he's been arrogant and selfish all of his life, we learn. So this is Mr. Babbitt's final punishment: Charlie merely gets an old car and some rosebushes and must live with the fact that there's a 3 million dollar cheque out there with his name on it that he'll never see. And so ensues a life altering, yet all the while entertaining road trip.At first, Charlie believes that Ray is an idiot, actually telling him on a few occasions. Then he thinks he's faking it (""I know you're somewhere in there, Ray). In other words, he doesn't know how to deal with his brother's condition. Actually though, he doesn't really care to. He has no time for a ""retard"". Later, however, Charlie finds out his brother's ""good with numbers"". In fact, with just one glance at, for example, toothpicks scattered on the ground, he can tell you exactly how many there are. This gives Charlie an idea: It's time to hit Vegas.This stint at exploiting Ray ends soon however. Ray starts to grow on Charlie. As the movie progresses, there are less outbursts of anger and more understanding on Charlie's side. As soon as he begins to really listen to his brother, he learns things about his past that he never knew. That is, as soon as he ceases to see Raymond as a bank number, he learns a great deal. Hoffman gives one of the best performances in American cinema. Performances like Sean Penn in ""I am Sam"", which consists of mental retardation, are given a little too much credit. Playing an autistic-savant, with all the right nuances and contradictions like Hoffman is something I will continue to marvel at. He's in the dark when it comes to his emotions. He simply cannot express them. As Charlie falls more and more in love with his brother, we are led to believe that the feeling is reciprocal, but it really isn't. Raymond Babbbitt is a person riddled with impossible self inflicted rituals that he must abide by. At the end of the film, Raymond is asked if he would like to stay with his brother, and he says yes. Then he is asked if he would like to go back to his ward, and he says yes. Ultimately, he is not at all in contact with his emotions and has no idea that his brother loves him. It's a sad fact, but a good idea to let him go.In the end, we have what is called a comedy-drama. ""Rainman"" is funny indeed: card counting in Vegas and ""K-mart sucks!"", etc. It is also a drama as we witness the positive evolution of a greedy man and the sad unchanging nature of his autistic brother. The actors make this movie possible.",Rain Man

298,pongigmon,"""Very sparkly, very twinkly"" performance by Hoffman",7,15 August 2014,"Charlie Babbitt played by Tom Cruise was a selfish young professional who was informed that his father was dead and left a fortune worth 3 million dollars to a trust fund which would be given to someone. This turned out to be astonished for Charlie to learn that he has an estranged brother who he encountered at the Walbrook psychiatric Institute. Seeking for the share of the money, Charlie kept the custody of his brother and went for a car trip due to Raymond's phobia of flying. Dustin Hoffman delivered an outstanding performance, as an autistic savant, Raymond Babbitt, who has issues communicating in the conventional way due to his mental neurological condition. We learnt that Raymond doesn't have anyone intimate to him other than Vern, who was just the guard of the mental institution. Like other patients in the psychiatric institution, Raymond was safeguarded and constrained to the daily routine, even the weekly diet was implanted into his brain.Raymond is an astounding character written and played at the film, it captures the quintessence of a mental patient who has emotional feelings and other things care about in spite of the obscurity of communicating these emotions. He is capable of being affectionate and bond with people once he is opened up to others. The portrayal of the character was impeccable, the way Raymond avoided eye contact during conversations and had to keep a television within his perimeter was eloquently executed.The character has his own peccadilloes yet the society has labeled him as an outsider. Yet, Raymond has shown his idiosyncrasy during the course of the movie and his aptitude of memorizing things among others, it's shown that he is more capable than the society told him. As the two brothers travel across the country, they learnt and accepted each other as they had developed an unusual relationship at the end of the movie. As the two acquainted, they made a connection between them and even joked as one of my favorite line of the film 'Kmart sucks,' when Doctor Bruner asked if Raymond would like to put some of his Kmart clothes on. Overall, the movie was moved and provides series of powerful performances from both of the protagonist which was more than satisfying to watch.",Rain Man

302,Tucker_Keon,Rain Man Raymond,6,23 September 2008,"Raymond Babbitt(Dustin Hoffman) is what is called an ""autistic savant"". His brain does not function in the typical fashion. I must admit he is a superb mathemetician. He has difficulty communicating and learning. He is set in his own ways of acting,thinking,eating,sleeping,walking,talking,using the bathroom,you name it. Any sudden unprepared break from his daily routine and weekly rituals terrify Raymond. Raymond has a younger brother Charlie(Tom Cruise) who is a typical healthy human being. The Babbitt brothers' father passed away and when Charlie learns about the death,that's when he learned that he had an older brother. The Babbitts' mother died when Charlie was a toddler and Raymond was in his 20's. Charlie is bequeathed a vintage 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible. That's what brought his relationship with his father to an end. Charlie tells his girlfriend Susanna(Valeria Golino) that when he was in high school,he took a car for a victory spin against his dad's authority. He brought home a report card with almost all A's. The father reported the car stolen,spitefully to teach his son a lesson. Charlie felt he deserved it although the car was his dad's pride and joy. Charlie and a few friends of his were arrested and all but Charlie were shortly bailed out of jail. So Charlie ended up leaving home and he never saw his dad again. Charlie also got prize-winning rosebushes. Raymond,who doesn't understand the concept of money,was left $3 million. Charlie does all he can to gain custody of his brother and get his rightful share of the monetary bequest($1.5 million). According to Dr. Bruner who's in charge of Wallbrook,Raymond's institution,says Raymond gets the best care there. Charlie felt Raymond would live his life civilly outside Wallbrook. When Charlie was a child,he was trying to pronounce his brother's name and it came out ""rain man"". During Raymond's temporary departure from Wallbrook,Charlie takes him to Las Vegas. They play blackjack and win a lot of money. They even receive a penthouse suite,complimentarily as a result of their winnings. At a diner one morning,after eating a pancake breakfast,Raymond immediately knew that 246 of 250 toothpicks fell out of a box onto the floor. ""There's four left in the box."",the waitress says. Raymond even briefly drove the '49 Buick in one or two scenes. In one of the final scenes,a private hearing takes place regarding Raymond. Raymond can't decide whether to stay with Charlie or go back to Wallbrook. Director Barry Levinson plays Dr. Mardsen,who's in charge of Raymond's psychic evaluation program. Raymond kept saying,""Go back to Wallbrook with Charlie Babbitt"". So Dr. Bruner took Raymond back to Wallbrook. This film was theatrically released on December 16,1988. It won three Oscars. Levinson took home a Best Director Oscar,Hoffman took home a Best Actor Oscar,and best screenplay.",Rain Man

304,andy stew,"Superb acting, touching film",8,3 April 2001,"This film was lent to me by a friend, who wanted me to see it as he thought it was very funny. I knew that it would be good as I had read reviews about it which praised the film, and I also knew that Dustin Hoffman is a terrific actor and had won an Academy Award for his performance. However, prior to watching the film I had a minor grudge towards it due to my awareness of films which had been compared with it in the past, namely Forrest Gump and Being There. Peter Sellers is one of my favourite actors and I was annoyed that his extraordinary performance in Being There had not been awarded an Academy Award, while Tom Hanks' and Dustin Hoffman's portrayals of so-called idiot savants had. But when I watched the film, this small complaint gradually became less of an issue, as Hoffman was absolutely terrific, and Tom Cruise proved that he could act well, although there were needlessly high amounts of bad language, which did detract from my enjoyment somewhat.The best part in the film is one that caused that rarest of emotions for me when watching a film - I actually cried at the incredibly moving penultimate scene. That moment at the end of the scene when the brothers are left alone was so powerful that I found myself fighting to hold back tears, and failing. It is one of the most touching cinematic moments I have witnessed, and the build-up to it is superbly done: I was not expecting it to carry such potence.

305,preston_peace,"Yup,Defiantly,Defiantly,Rain",10,3 March 2015,"When you try to write about a movie like Rain Man, the review becomes more of an essay than an actual ""review"". Mostly because Rain Man is about the human mind and what it needs and what it wants; subject that's usually tackled through books rather than film. However, the movie answers these questions perfectly. And it's hard to write about anything that's truly perfect. But, here's what Rain Man as a movie is about. The film follows a workaholic brother by the name of Charlie Bay and his interactions with his savant brother Raymond. Telling you why Charlie has to interact with his brother is said in the synopsis above. But telling you in detail nears spoiler territory and that brings me to the first reason why this film is brilliant.The film highlights the details of everybody in the film. The film thrives of the small parts or scenes that would otherwise be secondary in other films. In other words, the film is built around how much you do and don't know about a character. That includes personality, how they talk, where they live, everything. It's both a blind viewer's utopia and dystopia rolled into one because if one thing is spoiled, there's always something right behind it to make up for it.Second, the film knows how much needs to be said in a shot or scene. It's like the Citizen Kane of weird, realistic, drama. It knows how much you need to know about a character. It knows how much landscape it should show you. It knows how much weird is enough. It knows what kind of lives these people live and how much you want to know about their lives. The pacing alone can fill three essays.Third, it's about characters. Not how the actors portray the characters, but about characters. Every actor and I mean EVERY actor, from Hoffman to the waitress in that one scene, they all become these characters. And that's what an actor should do in a movie. The actor should improve an already fantastic script. The actors play the characters so well that you can no longer see where the direction, acting, or writing ends or begins; it all just becomes one.Rain Man is beautifully simplistic and yet one of the most thought provoking movies I've ever seen. It deserves a spot on the greatest movies ever made no matter how small.",Rain Man

307,sundancekid26,The best film of 1988!,10,21 December 2006,"Rain man is director Barry Levinson's crowning masterpiece. Featuring an all-star ensemble of Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise, Bonnie Hunt and Valerie Golino, it won Oscars for best director, actor and screenwriter in 1988. I must have watched this film at least a dozen times and I never tire upon viewing it in succession. It is the story of an egotistical salesman Charlie Babbitt (Cruise) who, upon learning of his father's death, is perplexed to discover that he has an institutionalized autistic savant as the brother he never knew he had. Charlie ends up going on a road trip of sorts with his brother Raymond (Hoffman) where after being annoyed with Ray's disability, discovers a love for Ray that he never knew he had. We watch as the movie takes us through plenty of luscious scenery and locale while we feel lost in the budding relationship that eventually unfolds between Charlie and Raymond Babbitt. Only a director like Levinson could pull something like this off. Everything is so carefully executed, to the masterful location planning and creative camera angles to some strikingly innovative juxtaposition. At one point near the middle of the film, we watch a shot showing us nighttime and then, without ever cutting away, show us daylight unfold in one composite shot. Furthermore, we have more Levinson trickery in the placement of promotion. At one point we see Charlie sitting in the hotel as a multitude of jump cuts show us the passage of time and we hear numerous commercials playing in the background. Whether this was intentional or not, it works well in the context of the scene. In a way, it's almost as if Levinson has broken the auteur barrier. His directorial work on Rain man is nothing short of stunning. Levinson is truly in his prime here. He even seems to bring out the best in Hoffman as we watch his character Ray constantly notice things that the average non-autistic person would take for granted (ie. the structure of a bridge for instance). I really don't have to say much about the acting. Hoffman's performance as a mentally handicapped Ray is legendary. Truly one of the most realistic performances ever brought to the screen. But it's Cruise as Charlie Babbitt that really shines. It was this film that finally showed naysayers that Cruise could actually act. I actually prefer his performance to Hoffmans! I would go as far as saying that this beats out 'Jerry Maguire' as Cruise's finest acting to date. Watch out Edward Norton! The musical compositions layered throughout Rain man remain some of my favourite of all time. Hans Zimmer has never been better; the Rain man theme song stays in your head long after you hit the stop button. He would even go on to use the same musical structure in his next movie, 'Days of Thunder', also with Mr. Cruise. Basically the entire score is an ethereal, uplifting experience in itself. Stu Linder provides excellent editing to compliment John Seale's dazzling camera work. It's a shame that Linder died only a few months ago while completing Levinson's,'Man of the Year'. I really can't say enough about this film. It's one of those movies where the viewer notices something new upon each viewing. I only just recently noticed that the photo montage on the closing credits screen are actual the pictures that Ray took while on his journey. Also look for a cameo by Levinson as the psychiatrist near the end of the picture. Truly a work of art, Rain man will shine well into the 21rst century as a fine example of classic cinema.

They fit their characters very well and both put forth a superb effort.  I also thought it was neat seeing their relationship grow throughout the movie. 
The Bad:  I found this movie to be quite boring many times throughout the movie.  It got repetitive, and it really did not send a very strong message, in my opinion.  The movie began as a story of jealousy, and ended without much emotion.  After a very long and exaggerated middle, I was hoping and expecting the movie to end very dramatically.  Instead, it ended abruptly and I did not feel much sympathy for any of the characters in the movie.

Other family members and friends of people with disabilities love this movie too, because we knew it the first movie about disabled people that was so true!It was NOT about a Helen Keller type (once unlocked, brilliant and OK)or about cute, sweet kids with Down's Syndrome (they are cute, but most disabled people are adults, and aren't always cute, sweet or easy). Charlie came to love Raymond, learned to communicate with him through humor, and seemed to become a better person because of Raymond; but Charlie was also stressed and baffled by Raymond much of the time. At times he reached out to Raymond with affection, but was rejected. This is the dynamic we live with daily.Someone who simply feels pity, who cannot accept the disabled person for who he/she is, who has no sense of humor, or thinks he is a Miracle Worker who will 'cure' disabled people, will get nowhere, and will not add to the disabled person's life. Charlie and Raymond were the only family that each other had. They had not only a moral but a legal right to continue their relationship and to live close to each other, if not together. Even in the 1980's, as Raymond's closest relative, all Charlie had to do was petition the court to become Raymond's ""conservator"", which likely would have been granted. He was wrong to take Raymond, but the institution in Ohio had no legal hold on Raymond, regardless of the father's will. Charlie's kidnapping would have been outweighed by the fact that a)he was family (like parental rights), it is always better to keep families intact unless serious abuse exists and b) Raymond had the right to live in the ""least restrictive setting"" which in no way is a large institution such as the one where he had been living, across the country from his only family.If Charlie could not handle alone having Ramond live with him, then Charlie had the right to choose, with Raymond, and the advice of social service agencies, an appropriate small group home for Raymond close by where the two could maintain the brotherly relationship they had resumed. Perhaps in the 30's or 50's, the state, assuming that it and psychiatric experts knew what was best, had the right to tear family members apart and institutionalize people, but this has not been so for a very long time, and the ending was the only thing about the film that rang untrue.

I am talking about the acting by Dustin Hoffman.I have seen hundreds of movies, some classics and some flops but through all of these movies with their countless actors and actresses, nothing or no one has ever compared to Hoffman in Rain Man.

Tom Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt, a rich daddy's boy whose nose is out of joint because he only inherited a weird-looking late 1940s Buick and a rosebush. The lion's share of Babbitt's father's estate was bequeathed to his brother, Raymond, whom Cruise nicknamed ""Rain Man"" as a young child. At the film's opening, Cruise has virtually no memory of this long-lost older brother. After the will is read and the legal formalities are completed, Cruise drives the weird-looking car up to the residence where Rain Man,played by Dustin Hoffman has lived for many years. The brothers meet by chance when Rain Man comes out of the residence, sees the car and makes long, detailed comments about it. The brothers meet and Cruise and Rain Man, with the residence's hard-wrought blessing embark on a road trip. They converse, in a fashion. Rain Man was an autistic savant. He picked up a box of toothpicks and was able to tell how many were in the box; he had a ""feel"" for numbers and proved to be an asset at the gaming tables in Las Vegas; he memorized the telephone book; he recited facts by rote; he was a slave to routine and had ""melt downs"" when he missed a favorite show or shopped in a store other than the K-Mart he had become familiar with. Stories like ""Rain Man"" that portray people with autism as autistic savants are a tiresome dime a dozen. That description and accompanying behaviors doesn't even apply to most autisics! Get an umbrella to ward off the tired clichés about autism that come raining down from this movie. This movie has reinforced a stereotype of autism.

317,nanonta,What makes a great film?,9,30 July 2019,"Acting? Costumes? Directing? Music? Although those factors can contribute to or diminish greatness, I would argue that the real answer is great ideas. What ideas does Rain Man present?
1) Charlie's Redemption
This is a common theme in literature and films , and I think it was well done here. I certainly thought Charlie was an unpleasant, misguided character at the beginning. That impression gradually changed. Charlie started to learn things about Raymond. By the end of the film he learned to love his brother and also began to show more humanity toward his girlfriend and Raymond's doctor, and perhaps began to understand his father. In making this transformation, he also became happier and wiser.
2) Raymond's Rituals
We all have certain habits. Some of them are necessary, like doing work or study on some kind of schedule. Raymond's rituals include shopping only at a specific K-Mart store, eating the same dessert, watching the same shows on TV at certain times, and sleeping at a certain time. He also keeps repeating the classic Abbott and Costello routine ""Who's on First?"" See next idea. Raymond uses these rituals as a way to avoid new experiences, which he finds frightening.
3) Raymond learns about comedy
Charlie explains that the Abbott and Costello routine is not a puzzle. It's comedy. Raymond finally begins to learn at the end, when he makes a joke:
Dr. Bruner: Well, Raymond? Aren't you more comfortable in your favorite K-Mart clothes?Charlie: Tell him, Ray.
Raymond: K-Mart sucks.
Dr. Bruner: Oh, I see.
Charlie: Hey, Ray: you just made a joke.
Raymond: Yeah, a joke. Ha ha ha... ha.
20 years after Rain Man was released, the corporate media's late night ""comedy"" shows seem to have forgotten what comedy is. They consist mainly of endless political rants, and their live audiences seem to have forgotten too.
4) Chaos Can Lead to Beneficial Change
Charlie had the trip planned. They would fly to California, he would win custody of Raymond, and would somehow get some of the inheritance money. However, plans very quickly unraveled, and each brother felt that the other was stubbornly inconsiderate.
Charlie's point of view: At the airport, Raymond threw a fit . The trip became longer and longer because of Raymond's demands to make so many things conform to what he was used to at the institution. At the same time, Charlie saw the journey as ruining his own life, destroying his business and ending his control of what he had. Raymond's fear of air travel and interstate highways was an unnecessary, infuriating problem.
Raymond's point of view: He had lived at the institution for decades. Charlie was pushing him to accept uncomfortable or even frightening changes. All the airlines had had accidents and he thought all of them were too dangerous. In a way, these feelings were another way of showing that things were changing too quickly.
But the time the brothers had together allowed them to understand and love each other, and to learn things they otherwise would never have known.",Rain Man

Another key thing to this film is Tom cruise. although his performance isn't as eye popping as Hoffman's, this role gave Tom cruise a chance to extend his dramatic side, and he does it very well. he is very convincing in his role, using humanistic qualities to really show his character's snobby demeanor. His performance was not the stereotypical snob. Barry Levinson also uses comfortable directing styles that sometimes puts you in the mind of Raymond, and it has a dreamlike quality to it. To give a solid summary, rain man is an excellent movie with a simple plot. Sometimes less is more. And if anyone is in the mood for a good movie, look no further. The acting, direction , and screenplay is superior. The screenplay is flawless. I will say no more on that. So now I must leave off with my favorite quote from Rain man: ""Shorts on the highway.""",Rain Man
320,dilaraarslan1998,rain man,6,9 January 2013,"I watched this film for Tom Cruise and I like it. Charlie Babbitt is Raymond's brother but he don't know that. He hadn't known it before his father is that. Raymond who is an autistic man is Rain Man. Rain man is Charlie's friend in his own imagination when he was a child. Charlie and Charlie's girlfriend(Sussanna) like Raymond. Raymond is very regular man and he says every time ""I am a very good driver!"". He is very interesting for me. Because if he doesn't do his plan, he will be shock. I am very upset when the film was finished. Because Raymond went to Walbrook with Dr. Bruner. I think, Raymond should stayed with Charlie. Raymond learned something from his brother for me. If Raymond stayed with Charlie, this film would be better for me.",Rain Man

It belongs to his brother played by Hoffman. As a result the two go on a cross country journey from Cinncinnati to Los Angeles and the results are funny, touching, and sad all at once.Hoffman and Cruise do a tremendous job in this movie that won four oscars!

322,pat_22,Hoffman's Raymond Babbit is one of the best acting performance ever!,8,9 July 2013,"Rain Man directed by Barry Levinson, is propelled by fine dialogue and magnificent acting, thus sustaining an emotionally enriching experience. Being focused around two very much different characters, the film progresses to finding brothers discovering an unwavering connection. Rather than this film exploiting disabilities, and grasping for sympathy, whilst containing the evident challenges of autism, it more significantly shows the audience two very much idiosyncratic individuals mutually finding trust within each other. It begins with 'selfish yuppie' in Charlie attempting to get more financially from his father's will through his unknown brother for his own purposes. However just spending a single week together, the two find brotherly love. This film leaves the audience to ponder how despite appearances, we are all very similar. Remarkable acting by Cruise and Hoffman, but arguably the best performance i've ever seen by Hoffman.",Rain Man
323,gobbles_the_penguin,Dustin Hoffman's finest,10,24 February 2006,"Dustin Hoffman, you are a genius. I am in a position to give the ultimate compliment to him, as my brother is autistic, and the amount of autistic men or women, boys or girls i see is substantial enough to say that when i can't tell the difference between him and them, it means something. Every time i watch him in a different film i always think of him as 'Raymond', even in political drama's such as 'all the presidents men'. I hear that he studied an autistic person for about a year before and during the filming of rain man, and i feel it really paid off. Hoffman's performance alone is worth buying the DVD of this movie. other than that, the on screen chemistry and (plutonic) love he shares with Tom Cruise (his brother) is magnificent, and it's a tremendous story of a love between two brothers that is formed against all odds. Probably the most satisfying thing about this film is that it doesn't lose it's integrity at the end, like other feel good movies, where endings are just thrown in to make everybody happy. This is a real ending, with a real solution to the conflict, and it is congruent with the flow of the entire movie.Must see flick, 10/10!",Rain Man

Dustin Hoffman plays an autistic savant, from beginning to end he portrays the character with such passion it's like he actually is retarded. I've seen Rain Man fourteen times. The first time too young to appreciate, the second old enough to love it. Like Goodfellas round of every scene is violence, Rain Man's ground is the emotion. The score plays a big part of the guide running the emotions through the film. A film about a mentally retarded savant being kidnapped by his cold brother(a perfectly game Tom Cruise) may not seem interesting but Rain Man's director, Barry Levinson adds a warm touch to Rain Man's atmosphere. I recommend it to people over the age of eight.It hit me like a bombshell",Rain Man
330,Chris997,"Brilliant, very moving character study!",10,9 January 2000,"I saw this film when I was very young, to this day I still really admire this film. Rain Man is about two brothers (Raymond & Charlie), who finally meet eachother in adulthood, the death of their father is what brings the two brothers together. Their father Sanford Babbitt, left three million dollars in a trust fund for Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) before he died, and has excluded out his other son, Charlie (Tom Cruise) from inheriting the money. This really irks Charlie and compels him to find his long lost brother. He does find his brother, but what he finds is not a normal brother, more like a brother who suffers from Autism. From that point he kidnaps his brother from a mental institution, hoping to find a way to get the three million dollars. The two brothers eventually learn alot about eachother, and what really matters more then money, family. Tom Cruise's character begins to understand Raymonds condition, and he begins to realize how special his brother really is. Dustin Hoffman's role is more than just amazing, it's true to life. We begin to feel like we know how Raymond is, we begin to enter his world and see the world as only Raymond can. This film won the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Actor & Director, and it really deserved all of the awards. Especially Dustin Hoffman, who's role I think is among one of the finest in film history. This film is really as good as it can get on the big screen!",Rain Man

Dustin Hoffman plays a autistic savant who lives in his own world and is unaware that he is any different from anyone else. This was superbly acted by Hoffman who has just recently become one of my all-time favorite actors. Tom Cruise does a great job playing Hoffman's brother who is cold hearted and doesn't know about his brother until their dad died. This movie could not of been any better and I encourage and want everybody to see it. It's all in the acting and this is clearly Dustin Hoffman's movie all the way.love,me Carolyn",Rain Man

Yet it is Cruise's character whose emotional growth we witness. His acting shows deep understanding of his own and Hoffman's characters.The intimacy the brothers achieve - insofar an autistic is capable of emotions and intimacy - is what makes Cruise's character human, and that is what marks a happy ending. The beautiful music score illuminates the brothers' journey with a leitmotif so distinct it feels like its own character.",Rain Man
338,codykingo,"Gripping, Moving, and Truly good movie",8,20 December 2008,"Rain Man took me a while to get into, but once I did, I was totally absorbed in the film.The story is about somewhat of a snob of a man, Charlie Babbit. He finds out that his father, who he hadn't written, called, or talked to since he was a teenager, had passed away. Without even shedding a tear he goes to his fathers funeral. He later finds out that his father, a millionaire, only left him the car that ruined their relationship in the first place. The 3 million dollars that he did leave was left to Raymond Babbit... his brother. Charlie never knew he had a brother. Raymond is autistic, but very highly functioning. He can do math problems and count at unimaginable rates.Dustin Hoffman as Raymond, is unbelievable. I didn't realize just how good his performance was, until I began arguing with myself whether Raymond was a real person, or just a character in a film. You won't believe Hoffman is just acting.The story is very moving, and yes, I did shed a tear or two. And I'm sure you will too.Rain Man is an incredible piece of film.7.8/10",Rain Man

Yes, Dustin Hoffman displays an excellent performance and thoroughly deserved his oscar for the role but I always feel that Tom Cruise(when is this amazing and versatile actor going to win an oscar???) does not receive enough recognition for his performance as Charlie Babbitt. Tom and Dustin make a great partnership, Dustin would not be as good without Tom and vice versa. I'd love for them to make another movie together some day as they have great chemistry (not sexual of course!!) All in all a touching story of a man who finds the brother he never knew he had (or did he- he knew 'Rain Man when he was young, but I won't spoil it for everyone???) and how he realises there's more to life than money.Excellent performances all round and some classic scenes and lines (The 'Raymond, did you fart?' bit,  'gotta buy underwear from Kaymart;what difference does it make where you buy underwear?

The clichéd road trip to finding inner understanding and over time understanding one another is explored with new dynamics and a more meaningful perspective. It lets us experience the trials and tribulations of the mentally ill, and it's incredibly light heartedness in dealing with autistic issues at times highlights the dark and twisted cruelty of society. It does, also, provide for pleasurable and comedic viewing.The film is a combination of heart-warming comedy and stellar emotionally-provoking drama. The team up of Cruise and Hoffman is a gem. Hoffman as Raymond Babbit is sensational and undoubtedly is the star of this film. His excellent acting convinces us, and then convicts us for our own mistreatings in society. Overall, a classic that should never be overlooked. Good acting, good direction, and most importantly, good humour.",Rain Man

But a lot of events change his heart. Through the journey, his motivation for treating Raymond changes family love from money.
Main character notices and learns something through the story. In this film, Charlie, the main character, notices how important Raymond is. Charlie faces difficulties and delightful events. In other words, the story of this film is not flat. I consider that the wave of the story fascinates the audience.",Rain Man
343,anmircheva,One of the best comedy dramas out there,9,2 August 2020,"A story about two contrasting characters learning and adopting the best qualities from each other. Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) is a car businessman whose only concern is money. He doesn't let anyone in his head, even his closest person- his girlfriend Suzanne. In the beginning, we see them having a conversation in a car..well ~trying~ to have a conversation. Charlie doesn't say a word throughout the entire journey, too soaked up in his thoughts. Suzanne shares that she'd like it if he let her into his head more. Charlie replies sharply in a defensive manner, that if she wants them to talk so much they should have a conversation. He repeats some of his phrases multiple times one after another which is an obvious indication of irritation and unwillingness. in the middle of their fight his phone rings. He gets the news that his father has passed away and receives information about the upcoming funeral. He doesn't express sadness in any way, this news was just another task to do. ''okay, so this day I have to do this, the day after is my dad's funeral, after that I have to do that''. A little bit before that, during the first few minutes of the film, we see Charlie talking on the phone, very enthusiastically with a lot of hand gestures and emphasizing in every sentence. In my opinion, these two situations show a great deal of his personality at the time. Work is his first priority, so he puts all his energy into it, while things like family are not of importance to him. Why would he be so neglecting towards such a great value like family? The only answer that comes to mind here is childhood trauma. His mother dies when he was two years old and he left with only his father with whom he didn't get along very well. When he goes to the trustee to set the situation with the heritage he finds out that the only thing that he left him is a rose garden and a car..while someone ''who shall remain nameless'' got three million dollars. Of course, he wants to know who the secret inheritor is. It turns out this person is Raymond Babbitt (Dustin Hoffman), Charlie's brother who is also an autist residing in a mental hospital. Wanting his share of the money, he takes Raymond out of the hospital and he is not willing to send him back unless his wish is fulfilled. They go on a road trip together and we can see how they don't get along very well at first. The differences in their personalities are very apparent, especially with Ray's condition. The hard part for Charlie is to get used to it and to tolerate it. At first, he doesn't even believe that it's real, However, as the movie goes we can see how he learns to change and put Raymond's needs before his or at least compromise. A huge factor here is the fact that Raymond turns out to be Charlie's childhood imaginary friend Rainman. He's been real all along. This news struck him like a lightning and make him see Ray in a whole different light. ''Rainman'' also goes under admirable development. With his brother, he sees the world beyond four walls. He's exposed to much more humor, laughter, adventure, ~pretty girls~ and most of all-brotherhood.
Rainman is an amazing tale of two brothers learning to get along after decades of not seeing each other. It is Cruise's best performance and one of the best comedy dramas out there, in my opinion.",Rain Man

Dustin Hoffman demonstrates that the movie producers did some serious research before producing this movie. Rain Man exposes you to the world of sales, business, broken families, romantic relationships, and it was highly successful in giving people a brief, albeit rudimentary introduction to the world of the autism spectrum.

Looking for revenge, Charlie kidnaps Raymond and takes him on a cross-country road trip to Los Angeles.The only good thing about this movie is Dustin Hoffman's acting. Hoffman, as he does in most of his movies, makes the character believable. If I had not known that Hoffman was acting, I would have thought that he really was autistic. He was very much deserving of the Best Actor Oscar. With this performance, Hoffman cemented himself as one of the greatest actors of our time. Cruise's performance, on the other hand, made me want to turn off the TV. Cruise seems to play the same spoiled-brat, punk character in all his earlier movies. Throughout the movie, his character continuously berates Raymond for his behavior. Raymond does not understand when Charlie scolds him. Charlie is loud, foul-mouthed, and downright annoying. I know that Charlie is supposed to be the antagonist, but this portrayal took it too far.The move making quality of the film was good, but not above average.

But many people especially in the autistic community believe that the movie promotes stereotypes about the autistic spectrum. And for people who do not do any research and assume too many things, yes this is indeed the case. ""Rain Man"" is very accurate in depicting the specific autistic savants Raymond Babbitt is based after, but this does not mean that he encompasses the traits and behaviors of all autistic people. Savant syndrome is a very rare condition (especially prodigious savants, which is what Raymond Babbitt would be classified as if he were real), so that is something to keep in mind. I thought Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of an autistic savant was simply brilliant. But make sure before watching it that you understand that it is JUST A MOVIE and not a documentary on all autistic people!

Charlie and his father haven't spoken in years and he is emotionless about the funeral. Expecting to inherit his fathers wealthy estate, he is shocked to learn he is only getting the Buick convertible that was the reason for them falling out, and 3 million dollars is going in to a trust fund for an unknown trustee.
Charlie angered at this decides to find out who it is and he does. He makes a visit to Wall brook where he discovers Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) an autistic man a lot older than charlie, who turns out to be his brother. 
Shocked and confused charlie at first wonders why was he kept a secret, but that quickly turns to greed as he decides to kidnap Raymond and hold him ransom for his share of the 3 million because as charlie puts it Raymond has no concept of money. 
Along the way charlie realises something he has missed and that money can't replace family.Tom cruise brilliantly portrays Charlie Babbitt a character who is filled with anger, greed, selfishness and yet he also turns the character slowly around as all those emotions slowly fade away as he discovers he's a brother and though the youngest he feels protective of Raymond, charlie is at first is annoyed that Raymond needs to do things at a certain time, then defends him when others don't understand. Dustin Hoffman is exceptional as Raymond compelling and sweet who doesn't understand he's been kidnapped. The realtionship of Raymond and Charlie is what makes the film work.Valeria Golino plays charlies girlfriend susanna, she brings a real sense of grounded truth to charlie even leaving him at one point out of disgust for his attititude early on towards his brother.

The interactions between the brothers on the road was humorous and revealing. Charlie starts out as a protagonist that is not very liked. He comes off as very selfish and arrogant at the beginning, but as the film progresses his heart seems to soften as he finds out more about his brother, his father,and himself. Dustin Hoffman was fantastic as Raymond. He was very believable in his portrayal of an autistic savant. One aspect that made the movie enjoyable was the demonstrations of Raymond's genius throughout the movie.However the end of the movie bothers me quite a bit.

The film is so simple in structure it really needed something special to pull it out of the prospective banality of being ""just another road movie about finding oneself"", Rain Man achieves something special by tackling its subjects with very sensitive hands and splicing a believable human concept into the story via the incredible shows from its two leading men.Dustin Hoffman gives a magical moving performance as the Autistic Savant Raymond, the ultimate complement I can pay the performance is that it really is believable, both moving and clever rolled into one artistic result. Tom Cruise is equally as great in a role that called for drastic layer changes, a role that demanded much conviction from the actor taking it on, and Cruise gives the role much depth as he goes from shallow bastard to a very emotive and feeling human being, it's a great show that stands up to reevaluation these days. A performance that seems to have sadly been forgotten in light of Hoffman's film stealing show. With a film such as this you pray that the ending can do it justice, and I'm glad to say that there is no pandering here, it's an ending that says so much because it doesn't cop out, I thank god for those rewrites because the endings to the original scripts would of had me booting the TV set out of the window.Essential cinema. 10/10",Rain Man

357,Rivenspeak,Moving and Entertaining,8,27 March 2000,"Rain Man is one of my favorite films, although at times the plot became slightly tedious.  Academy Award Winner Dustin Hoffman gives a stellar performance as Raymond, Charlie Babbitt's (Tom Cruise) autistic brother. Hoffman does a wonderful job showing the emotional detachment that lies at the heart of the movie.  Cruise portrays an emotional detachment of another kind as the egocentric Charlie.  Together they unknowingly undergo a journey on a path of discovery about their past together and their future as individuals.  I gave Rain Man an 8 out of 10.",Rain Man
358,anishwadhwa,Hoffman at his very best..........,8,6 August 2006,"I was completely awe-struck when i saw this movie.. Dustin Hoffman did an unbelievable job in this movie.I was amazed by the way he carried his role throughout the film with utmost ease.Brilliant story about a young car salesman,who gets to know about his autistic brother very late,and in whose name is his father's fortune......who later decides to cleverly trick him to get some of the money,but later develops a strong bond with him(Hoffman),who actually turns out to be quite a help for him (by helping him win lot of money at a casino)Tom Cruise does a commendable job as a supporting actor....... and he looks great in this movie.This movie actually reminded me of My Left Foot(starring Daniel Day Lewis).............which was another classic (according to me).Arguably one of the best movies of the eighties....a must watch for all",Rain Man
359,gstrum,thoroughly uncomfortably underwhelmed,1,21 January 2018,"Somehow this was on the list of a ""must see"" movie I never saw. 
I finally got around to it. 
i'm guessing it just didn't age well. Of course Dustin Hoffman's performance is great, but the rest? Either as part of some story or just as supporting actor, Tom Cruise's heavy-handed asshole character strains credulity. Every scene is uncomfortable and not because Raymond is autistic, but because Charlie is yelling at Raymond and giving him commands like a bad dog owner.",Rain Man
360,jsullivan2219,Rainman-All time favorite movie,10,29 November 2013,Why is this my favorite movie of all-time? I can tell you why in this brief review.... One of the best acting jobs goes to Dustin Hoffman for pulling off the classic character as Raymond Babbitt. He does an incredible job playing an autistic person. He does not overact and sometimes when you watch it think he's really an autistic person in real-life. There are so many lines that he says that are priceless and still are quoted to this day. The relationship between Raymond and Charlie are so perfect because their complete opposites and you see it throughout the movie but still Charlie still fights for his brother to try to live with him instead of going back to the institution where he stole him from in the first place to try to get the money from him. I think this will go down as my all-time favorite classics and I don't think will ever change.,Rain Man
361,jsullivan2219,Definitely my favorite movie definitely,10,17 August 2018,"This is my favorite movie of all-time. It combines two great genres together: (Drama and Comedy) quite nicely. Dustin Hoffman plays Raymond Babbitt a autistic man with some unique talents, like knowing how many toothpicks fell on the ground or the statistics over the years of each airline crashing (except for Qantas).This is probably Dustin Hoffman's best role of all time. At times you really think he is an autistic man. Tom Cruise should've deserved an award or been nominated at least because he was a great supporting cast. He plays a car salesman who is short tempered at times and doesn't quite understand his brother Raymond. I love this story because you see how one long car ride changes Raymond and Charlie's relationship for the best. Such a great story and message.",Rain Man
362,tmess,Where was Cruise's nomination?,10,5 November 2002,"I'm not taking anything away from Dustin Hoffman, who delivered a remarkable performance in a remarkable film. However, at the risk of sounding discriminatory, I wholeheartedly believe that it is generally easier to play the role of a mentally challenged individual than it is to sell the performance of a ""normal"" person, with ""typical"", but more importantly, believable actions and emotions. (Try it yourself if you don't believe me.) However, Tom Cruise makes a difficult role look easy. His unnaturally natural performance, coupled with the fact that he starred opposite a living legend whose delivery was equally captivating, was probably the reason he was overlooked as a nominee for best supporting actor. (Here's where I'll go out on a limb and dare say Alec Baldwin is often a victim of this very phenomenon.) In a nutshell, Cruise's genuine behavior compliments Hoffman's character like a hand in glove.The film itself is magnificent in all regards, and is a must see for those of us who see Cruise for what he truly is: underrated, yet one of the finest film talents of this era.",Rain Man

Tom Cruise, either though I think he's himself in each movie, this one is different. He plays this role very well. Hoffman is just amazing as usual. The guy is like Jack Nicholson, Tom Hanks, etc. He's up there with great actors. Actors who rely on talent instead of looks. Rent this movie and watch it many times, it will never get old. I've seen it many times, and I still love it. Rent this one now! Just remember that Fernando Valenzuela isn't scheduled to pitch till Wednesday! If you have seen this movie, you'll get that joke.

The guy I met had memorized pages from various books and made wonderful portrait. Now, Hoffman was good no doubt but his character's condition was much better off. There are autistics who cant even recognize relations, can't wear their shirts right and yet can memorize the capitals of all the countries. About Cruise, movies like this one and 'Magnolia' reveal his depth beyond his looks. And the actress Valeria was really cute and I was forced to search for her wallpapers.

It's a movie that makes you feel immmense emotion without being to hard going. It tackles the misconception of autism and altogether makes you feel sympathatec and towards the end very uplifted with a sense of joy and happiness the kind that makes you shed a tear throughout I felt for Raymond and fell in love with his character . Charlie on the other hand I started of as the villain of the movie but as the end grew closer she slowly transformed into the brother you always wanted . The movie was simply directed in a way that makes it simultaneously brings the story line together in a beautiful way . The scene where Charlie found out that Raymond was rain man was a one that also brought me to tears and for me the scene where Charlie made his transformation into admiring and loving toward Raymond . Altogether this film is beautifully directed with amazing character builds and tearjerker making it very deserving of the title of a classic,Rain Man

Charlie takes his brother, who is called Raymond until he gets his share of the will but something happens that he wasn't expecting. Good film,of course its a definitely good film as Raymond Babbit would say.This film has a dramatic but sweet tone to it and landed Dustin Hoffman an Oscar for his role of the autistic Raymond Babbit.

369,mingsy_sar,Fantastically realised and superbly acted,10,19 October 2002,"Dustin Hoffman certainly deserved his oscar for his sympathetic portrayal of an autistic genius, it's such a different part to anything he has ever done before. Tom Cruise isn't so bad either! My only criticism is the girlfriend, I don't see what she adds to the overall impression to be honest, though I know that most films have a love interest. The director knew exactly what he wanted out of the script and the actors, and he obviously had not only the final impression on his mind, but also the audience. Alot of directors lose sight of that. But the praise has to go to Dustin. He is superb. His character makes the film, and his relationship with his brother. (Cruise) He pulls at the heartstrings, as well as drawing you in with his intriguing but highly believable personality. He is almost like an adult kid. I can see no flaw in Hoffman's performance. See this film for Dustin Hoffman's awe-inspiring acting if you can't see any other reason to do so. But what else can you ask for in a film, unless you're shallow-minded enough to want special-effects and heart-stopping action. The special effects are the way 'Rainman' has your constant attention, and the action is subtle and just as captivating. A film for anyone, even those with a heart of stone!",Rain Man

I haven't seen someone acting so brilliantly that guessing his real identity would be so tough. Tom Cruise wasn't far behind either. He acted flawlessly and according to me, he should have won too. Nevertheless, it was a perfect blend of emotions, drama and resplendent acting. Barry Lavinson directed it brightly. I rate it 10/10 in all aspects.It starts from a handsome man who dissents to the will of his father according to which he doesn't get more than a penny. Then, enters his brother(Dustin Hoffman) who is the sole owner of his father's proprietary. So, Charlie Babbit abducts him and tries to gain his favor. His journey with Charlie ends with a nice bond between two brothers that once a rude brother refuses to give away his brother's custody to anybody but himself.

Although critic after critic has bellyached on how great Hoffman's performance was, personally, I preferred Cruise's performance as the jealous brother just as much as Hoffman's. Cruise was able to make it flow naturally, just like Hoffman. However, since many people consider mentally retarded people harder to portray, I can understand people's preference to Hoffman's. He was able to make it seem as though although he was there in the places physically, he wasn't actually THERE mentally.Hans Zimmer's score really hits the beats of the film perfectly and underscores the emotion in the plot and the acting, rather then trying to create it where it doesn't exist.A very great movie overall.",Rain Man

Both Hoffman and Cruise played their respective roles terrifically and added depth to an already moving storyline. Not many movies have ever engaged me this much with a relationship between two characters. Although the movie doesn't have special effects like almost all movies now a days, it still grabbed my attention and made me feel deeply attached to Ray. The development of the story and the life of both Ray and Charlie was moving and touching. I honestly think this movie is underrated and deserves to be closer to that number one ranked spot in the top 250 movies. Movies I've previously seen are garbage compared to Rain Man!

377,alexanderkalaitzis,In the end it's all about Hoffman.,5,20 April 2013,"I can't believe that this movie has earned such a stature over the years. I believe that the main-if not only- reason behind this is Hoffman's amazing work in playing the autistic brother of Tom Cruise, who was just over the top and not believable in the majority of the scenes. My biggest objection is the script. All in all we are said that Raymond is a non functioning autistic and that his brother doesn't even care about except the money that he inherited. And to follow that opening it shows us that his brother saw him differently when Raymond earned him all that money in Vegas. That's where the movie goes bad. When I saw the scene where Raymond drives the car out of the casino and the way that the shots were edited I could not help but wonder what would happen between the two brothers if Raymond was not good with numbers. In fact that is his only way of reaching his younger brother. Not that he cares about it, because I believe that Hoffman really meant to do a performance based on self seclusion. But nevertheless it tries to sell us capitalism and the theory that is all about the money in a very vulgar way.Not to mention all the American pop culture that is shown to us through out the film in a way that is very similar to propaganda. Because if you see the things that Raymond wants to see on TV, or eat in the film is like seeing any typical American guy, and again I get the feeling that this passes off as a good way of life. That is concerning the script because Hoffman goes in there and takes his role away from all that. He just makes all this way of life a routine that he is not capable to break. And that turns all the other exibitions of the American dream around. We know that he also made a lot of changes in some ideas of the script, he even changed the condition that Raymond had including his way of dealing with the world which was meant to be cheerful. He took what was gonna be a huge pile of junk and made a movie that is worth watching but definitely not a masterpiece, or even close to one.",Rain Man

But the content is still up to date and the fact that this movie is from another period of time only reflects in terms of music and style. The general topic, the main characters (Tom Cruise is still someone) and even aspects of communication and media as well as mobility are still up to dare and interesting. This road movie brings two brothers together despite the odds and makes a cool and calculating man turn into a sensible human being ready to fight for his family. The acting is done in a convincing way, especially by Oscar winning Dustin Hoffman. With Tom Cruise you never know if he only acts being the superficial hot tempered guy always looking for his own advantage or this is just himself.

Where to begin?
I've heard this movie hailed as a classic. And maybe it was good back in 1988, when people didn't know much about autism. But now...let's just say it hardly holds up.
Raymond was nothing but a stereotype. The language used to describe him--""in his own world"", ""unable to relate to others""--is what people assume to be true about me, and about all autistic people. But I'm here to tell you that it's not at all true.
And Charlie....well, he was gross. Not physically; Tom Cruise was actually pretty good-looking. But the character's actions left me feeling dirty just from watching. And frankly, his turnaround at the end felt forced.
If there's one good thing to say, it's that the actors did a nice job with what they had to work with. Even the worst dialogue was delivered with enough expression to earn a pass from me, at least.
Just save yourself some brain cells and don't bother with this movie.",Rain Man
385,hotair,"To paraphrase Raymond, Rain Man is mediocre. Definitely mediocre.",4,12 October 1998,"This might be just a lot of hot air, but I think the movie and Hoffman's award-winning performance are over-rated. I'll admit that, typically, I'm too cynical to buy a feel-good movie, and ultimately that's what Rain Man wants to be. I'm especially suspicious of movies that use mentally slow characters and their supposed child-like innocence to convey difficult themes like what's right and wrong in the world (see Forrest Gump and Sling Blade). To me, these characters are too often the result of lazy screenwriters. The characters have moments of genius that never ring true, moments that appear far beyond their mental capabilities. These moments are always used to covey some deep truth about us or society. Then, during the rest of the movie, they can barely get dressed or tie their own shoes. I don't buy it.It doesn't help that screenwriter Ron Bass draws his characters so poorly. While Tom Cruise does an adequate job of revealing Charlie as a crying-on-the-inside jerk, Bass never really develops the character. Charlie is shown to be a selfish jerk at the beginning of the film and stays that way throughout. Sure, he lightens up a little at the end, and why not? He just paid off a debt incurred through shady business dealings and won $100,000 at blackjack. Not a bad day. I'd feel a lot better, too.As for Hoffman, well, to paraphrase Pauline Kael, a collection of ticks and weird behavior do not make a great performance. As excellent screenwriter William Goldman says in Premiere magazine, there is nothing special about Hoffman's acting, which he describes as being in the ""drunks and retards"" category. ""Actors kill for those parts,"" he says. ""They love to slur and stagger and drool."" These Scent of a Rain Man roles, as another writer in Premiere coins them, pass for great acting. In fact, eight of the last 10 Best Actor awards belong in this category. (Including two for Tom Hanks, who, ironically, actually deserved the Oscar for his work in Big the year Hoffman won for Rain Man.)Rain Man boils down to a fish-out-of-water buddy road movie. Cliches are abundant and the formula is familiar. Of course, this shouldn't be surprising given Bass' lukewarm track record. His filmography proves he has all his cliches covered: drunks (When a Man Loves a Woman), retards (Gardens of Stone), psychos (Sleeping With the Enemy) and the always crowd pleasing triumph over adversity (Dangerous Ground, which was originally titled the laughably putrid My Posse Don't Do Homework). Don't even get me started on My Best Friend's Wedding or the super sappy How Stella Got Her Groove Back and What Dreams May Come. That none of these films, on the whole, have received even better than average reviews is telling. Perhaps if Rain Man hadn't been helped by high-priced actors and director Barry Levinson, it, too, would have been seen for what it is: Mediocre.",Rain Man
386,kmvander,"Excellent movie, with a couple of inaccuracies regarding autism",8,7 July 1999,"I like ""Rain Man"" and think that it portrays many aspects of autism quite well.However, while savant abilities occur almost exclusively in people with autism, savant abilities are still quite rare, even among autistics.  The movie is an introduction to autism for most people seeing it, who may then incorrectly assume that savant skills are seen in all autistic individuals. Of course, I realize that most movies are not intended to educate, although it is helpful when they do educate people about little-known conditions.Also, as a ""high-functioning"" autistic adult, I take exception to the statement in the movie that Raymond is ""very high functioning"" [said by the doctor to whom Charlie took Raymond during their cross-country drive]. The portrayal of Raymond was barely in the ""high-functioning"" range.  Again, my concern is based on what the general public may assume after seeing the movie (that is, that since Raymond is supposed to be ""very high-functioning,"" anybody who is able to function in society at a higher level could not be autistic, which, of course, is not true).  I have personally run into that attitude from others.One other thing:  I believe that it would have been a much better movie without the sexual scenes; they were really unnecessary.",Rain Man
387,garcia-4,Excellent,10,13 August 1999,"Rain Man is my all-time favorite movie. Even though it is Rated ""R"" I believe it should only be rated PG 13.

388,SED-7,"Hoffman brilliant, but film VERY overrated",6,23 July 2000,"Dustin Hoffman is especially good, but overall the movie is just a muddle. Tom Cruise is particularly obnoxious and dense as the younger brother. Long after the audience has caught on to the special talents of Raymond (Hoffman), Charlie (Cruise) is only starting to get the picture.  But just in case anyone in the audience still doesn't get it, Charlie declares the obvious about 3/4 of the through the movie, (paraphrasing) ""Hey, he's really good at remembering stuff and doing math in his head.""Throw in imported sports cars (Charlie's business), a French girlfriend, a cross-country road trip in a vintage Buick Roadmaster, a stop in Las Vegas, and a brief low-key custody battle, and overall you end up with a confused montage of ""high concept"" ideas.Hoffman is the only reason to see this otherwise lame film.",Rain Man

After watching the movie Rain Man with Tom cruise as Charlie Babbitt and Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt, and Charlie is a more well dressed good looking individual high end car salesman and his brother Raymond who he does not find out he exist until later in the film has a disability called Autism but he does not just have a normal form of autism, Raymond has a high functioning form and is a savant with numbers but has a hard time with social skills and interpreting normal emotions that most individuals take for granite. Raymond has been placed into an institution for individuals with special needs or disabilities and when Charlie visits, he realizes that Raymond has spent most of his life on the property doing Mundane routines to help work around his social skills. Charlie decided to take Raymond from the place and care he has known most of this life and decided to take him to California to live with him and try to reconnect and have that brother he never knew he had, and part of the connecting was because Charlie wanted some of that money he felt entitled to, but was left for Raymond. Charlie is in trouble with some high-end car, Ferrari and Lamborghini to be exact and has issues with getting them passed because of the emissions issues those type of exotic cars have.
Charlie realizes that his father has left his nothing but an important memento an old beautiful classic Buick that his dad never let him drive, and left Raymond with three million dollars in assets that Raymond doesn't even understand the concept of money but does number due to his condition. The soundtrack plays a huge role because of the ambient retro electronic music they used like synthesizers to help promote and enhance and support the viewing experience. The lighting of the movie was very vibrant for the time period the movie was shot in, and the director uses the outfits as well as cars and architecture to help support and enhance Charlie and Raymond's background of wealth., "" To be interesting, character must seem real, understandable, and worth caring about""( Petrie, D. W., & Boggs, J. M. (2018) .pg. 51)The use of the cars was a huge symbolic point and that Buick was in most of the scenes and stuck out because of its curves and paint job that is unlike was most cars look like today to bring the presence of how important that car is to the storyline.
The director uses Raymond very well and his emotions to display how the scene will transpire and how Charlie reacts to Raymond's outburst. The movie is somewhat grainy in future sense because of how movies are all shot on incredible high definition cameras compared to 1988.The angle's that the director uses to help personify having Charlie be bigger and Raymond how is older be smaller and weaker by using fixed frame angles to help personify the character that Charlie plays as being the alpha in the situation. Charlie is in real life played by Tom Cruise who is not very tall and so the Director used the low image point up angle to help personify the character that Charlie is developed into, "" In fact, consistency of viewpoint would be boring in a film and would impede effective communication""( Petrie, D. W., & Boggs, J. M. (2018) .pg. 109) Charlie and Raymond travel from state to state and the use of transition from motel to restaurants from their journey is very capturing and makes me enjoy the storyline much more by not having any dead scenes.
The movies theme as to show that Charlie was driven my greed and anger from his father's way of showing him love, but Charlie did not care that his father pasted only who got what money and his father even then knew Charlies intentions. Charlie did not know about his brother and when he did find out his care and love for him was strictly business for the money that his father left behind in Raymond's trust. After spending time with Raymond and realizing that Charlie was only looking at his as a business play rather than his human brother, after they had spent a long time forced together did, he realize that money comes and goes but family is what matters most. This movie also follows the same theme of Tommy Boy with Chris Fairly and that Raymond would be Tommy's father"" and how Tommy took his dad's business for granted and his dad in general. Charlie fought with doctor who had oversaw Raymond over the years and disagree that Charlie would be able to take care of his brother alone and he was correct. Charlie realized that his brother was more precious and valuable than the money that was tied to Raymond's name.",Rain Man
392,klwally,"Good Movie, not representative of autism however.",10,25 February 2002,"This is a very good film. It is entertaining, and moving. There are things about the character Raymond that are very 'right on'. The drawback of the movie, is that society now seems to think every autistic person they meet is ""like Rain Man"". The anxiety, the need for repetitive behavior, yea that is a pretty good portrayal. Just remember though, in the end, it is just a movie and not every autistic person you meet is going to have phenomenal savant skills, or will 'learn' any social skills in a short period of time.",Rain Man

396,ojrprobert,Rain Man Review,9,13 September 2006,"Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of an awkward autistic brother in Barry Levinson's Rain Man gives a great example of the difficulties experienced by people who are autistic and those surrounding them, and the fascinating abilities of this minority of people. The film explores the difficult things experienced by people involved with autism, and how autistic people interact with others. It also explores autism itself, and how different autistic savants have different abilities and disabilities. At the centre of the story, however, is not Hoffman's character, Raymond, but Tom Cruise's character, his brother Charlie.Charlie Babbit is a young man at the top of his game. He works for Ferrari, has a beautiful girlfriend and is extremely successful, that is, until Raymond comes into his life. When Charlie's father dies he leaves Charlie his car and his award winning rose bushes. The three million dollar house, however, goes to a brother who Charlie knows nothing of, apart from the fact that he is in a mental institution. When Charlie visits the institution he argues with the warden about Raymond's fortune, and questions Raymond's ability to take on this great asset. When the warden refuses to recommend any change, Charlie kidnaps his brother, and takes him under his care.This damages Charlie's relationship with his girlfriend, Susanna, and his job. He soon begins to blame his misfortunes on Raymond, which is not always incorrect. When Raymond refuses to go out in the rain, Charlie is left stranded, unable to reach a destination, required for his job. ""I hope you appreciate this because my business is going down the f***ing toilet."" Raymond has a rare form of autism, which makes him able to perform massive and complicated mathematical problems in his head. He also has a fantastic memory. However, this condition also has its negative affects. He has trouble relating with people. When kissed by a prostitute in Las Vegas, he says that the kiss felt ""wet"". He has difficulty making decisions and does everything he is told. When crossing a road, the light flashes 'Don't Walk'. Raymond immediately stops walking in the middle of the road. He is asked whether he wants to go back to Walbrook (his mental institution) or go with Charlie, and responds ""Go back to Walbrook, stay with Charlie Babbitt."" As well as these, Raymond has countless fears, becomes highly distressed in basic conflict situations and when he cannot watch his television programs at the right time.Perhaps the basic negative aspect of Raymond's disorder is his 'twisted vista' on life. He can do great mathematical equations, but struggles when asked basic life problems, involving things such as money. Everything he seems to do is vague and he does not respond to body language, only words. It is later revealed that Raymond cared for Charlie when he was very young, but once accidentally burnt Charlie in the bath and was sent away. It was during this time Charlie called him 'Rain Man' and this is where the film gets its name. This care is inverted when the pair meets up later in life, and Charlie finds it difficult to take this care on.However, what separated the pair is also what brings them back together. Charlie takes Raymond to Las Vegas and uses his extraordinary mathematics skills to 'count cards' in a game of Blackjack. They win masses of money, and, although Charlie is 'using' Raymond, this trip brings them closer together. Charlie becomes a great carer, and begins to show great affection to his older brother. ""What you have to understand is, four days ago he was only my brother in name. And this morning we had pancakes."" Charlie begins to see that it is better for Raymond to send him to the institution. So, Charlie gives Raymond perhaps the first major choice he has had in decades. He sends Raymond back to Walbrook for two weeks, and tells him he can come back if he wants to. We have seen though, that this may be the end of Raymond's trip, as he is so indecisive that this may be the last time he is outside the institution.",Rain Man
397,bladen-85467,A great film to capture the heart,9,3 May 2020,"'Contains Spoilers' Rain Man is a great story about the transformation of a man names Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise). Charlie Babbitt transformation comes from learning about his brother, Raymond Babbitt (Dustin Hoffman). Charlie's introduction to Raymond comes through the death of his father, who leaves him with only a car and a bed of flowers. The story begins when Charlie learns of who has been granted the other three million dollars in assets, which ends up being his brother Raymond, who he finds out to be autistic. He attempts to become his legal guardian just for the money to save his failing business. In the end, the story turns with Charlie having a change of heart for his brother. His motives go from only wanting the money to being as good a brother as he can for Raymond and doing what's best for his brother.As seen in the plot, the theme and focus of the movie seemed to be Charlie's transformation from within. He began as being obsessed with getting what he deserved, but later caring more for his brother's wellbeing than anything else. The more I observed the way the film handled two distinct techniques, the more I leaned to the theme of the film focusing more on Raymond's ""disability"". I think his disability is touched on a lot not only because Raymond is autistic, but also because of the way it captured Raymond's emotions and thought processes.The film accomplishes the ability of looking through Raymond's eyes and seeing his perspective in a couple scenes through a subjective shot. When Charlie, Raymond, and Susanna (Valeria Golino) are stopped by a train, Raymond gazes at the lights going back and forth at the train stop. The view then looks directly at the lights and shows how he focuses on lights and noise. This brings me to the next point in the movie which is sound. While looking at the sign flashing, the noise begins to drown out the rest of the environment as it fills his senses. It gives a look into what Raymond is going through by helping the audience understand how he feels.There are many other examples of how the film encapsulates the theme through these two techniques, but those two examples in particular show the film's ability to help the audience understand and sympathize with Raymond. This film doesn't lack in drama and also gives a great message of understanding for those with autism.",Rain Man

Everything was fine in the movie, but the only concern is, would Tom Cruise show the same affection, to his brother, if he was not good at numbers,instead behaved more like a regular autistic patient?Tom started liking Dustin, only after he came to know that Dustin had some extraordinary number skills, which helped him in clearing his debts. This clearly sheds the light on Tom's selfishness.

What was really cool about the movie was the fact that while watching it, you find yourself laughing half the time and then feeling sad the other half! I think Tom Cruise did a much better job with movies back in his early days because he was new and so tried harder to do more dramatic roles, i.e. Born on the 4th of July.

Dustin Hoffman was amazing as Raymond Babbitt, an autistic man, whose younger brother, Charlie, played quite well by Tom Cruise, abducts him from the institution he is in order to get his share of inheritance money. The character of Charlie is very selfish and greedy, but as the film goes on, he changes for the better. He takes Raymond clear across the country by car because Raymond won't fly. Watching this film again made me realize that it is really one of the greatest films I've seen. It's a bittersweet story of brotherly love, dramatic at times, but has a great deal of comedy blended in. This is a film to be cherished for generations. I highly recommend Rain Man. The performances by both Dustin Hoffman, who won the Oscar for best actor (very well deserved!), and Tom Cruise are outstanding. I believe this to be one of the first films that Cruise had a real substantial character with depth to him. It's no surprise that Rain Man won Academy Awards for it is a very touching story.

There are also several aspects of this plot that are so utterly ridiculous, and I cannot understand how a movie that is not in the realm of science fiction or fantasy could get away with them. There is the fact that we never fully learn why Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise's character) was never told he had a brother. The lack of a proper explanation for this is laughable. There is the fact that the kidnapping for ransom of a person from a mental institution is an incredibly serious act - one that was not given nearly enough weight in this film in the beginning or middle, and the consequences for such an action later in the film were not given enough weight either. That this film swept the Oscars with such glaring problems - well, let's just hope that the same would not happen in 2019. Charlie Babbitt spends too much of the film as an abusive brother for the switch to caring brother to work as well as it could have, although Tom Cruise is a good enough actor to make it mildly plausible. After hearing so much about this film for so long, I had much higher hopes when I sat down to watch it.",Rain Man
409,buttercup24616,"Rain Man is a great film, I love this movie!",10,15 May 2010,"""When I was a young kid and I got scared the Rain Man would come and sing to me,"" Charlie Babbit (Cruise) said of a nostalgic memory from his childhood. This, is a quote that should stick with you throughout the movie because the whole plot is somewhat centered on it. During the reading of his father's will only two things really stuck with him, the Buick convertible that tore through the strands of their relationship and the three million dollars in a trust fund he has no access to. On the hunt to try and get the three million dollars he soon discovers that it went to his new found younger autistic brother (Hoffman) and even though he's a highly functioning mathematical genius who can count just about if not anything instantaneously, doesn't understand the concept of money. Raymond recites Albert and Costello's ""Who's on First"" (to keep him calm when things are out of place and he feels unsafe) and is a skit that he believes is a trivia question but Charlie later reveals to him is a joke. Now because he is mad at his deceased father, Charlie decides to kidnap his brother upon the day of meeting him because, he wanted his half of the three million. The people on the voting committee of the Oscars seemed to have agreed with me when I say that Hoffman did an exceptional job of portraying Raymond (the autistic younger brother). Yes, the cast was a major strength along with Barry Marrow and Ronald Bass' job on the story and screen play. My only problem and their only weakness was in the scene when Charlie was trying to force Raymond on the plane Raymond's fit seemed to be cued from somebody offset. Throughout the movie some of the things Charlie does and goes through to make sure that Raymond is still living by his daily routine is one of the moments that make you want to laugh and feel bad or cry at the same time. One of these moments is when Raymond recites ""Who's on First"" while walking along the highway with Charlie trailing slowly behind him in the old Buick because after driving past an accident Raymond feels that the highway is unsafe.

410,montygums94,Its about how brothers can reunite after a difficult time,7,17 May 2010,"Austin Montgomery""Rain Man"" ReviewPeople with Autism are amazingly intelligent. They all can carry on conversations, memorize phone books, follow schedules, recite statistics, calculate square roots, and count the number of toothpicks spilled on the floor in just a few seconds. But they can't clean that abstractly. They can't tell you the price of a lawnmower to the price of a pack of gum. Also, they get rather furious when someone interrupts them in a conversation.My favorite part of the movie is when Raymond yells out, ""Kmart SUCKS!"" I thought that was the funniest thing I have ever seen.Dustin Hoffman (Raymond Babbitt) is a man with Autism. He was living in a mental hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. His father died and Raymond inherited three million dollars and his brother's were in awe wondering why it went to him. His brother, Tom Cruise (Charlie), never found out about Raymond until that day. He was very furious that his father left him with everything besides an old Buick. Then Charlie travels to Ohio to find out where his fathers estate went. Then when he finds Raymond he abducts him to bring him back to L.A. until he gets his part in the money.My point of view I think this is a very good movie. It has all the good parts to a movie that I would like. Its funny and it talks about a topic that nobody really sees a interest and has no idea of people with Autism Rain Man works so well because of its simplicity. It doesn't try to perform miracles or discover cures; instead, it merely observes a man's acceptance and self-discovery.",Rain Man
411,michelle-stalnaker,Rain Man is heartfelt movie about a selfish man named Charlie Babbitt played by Tom Cruise and the journey that he finds himself on when his wealthy father passes away.,8,11 December 2010,"Rain Man is heartfelt movie about a selfish man named Charlie Babbitt played by Tom Cruise and the journey that he finds himself on when his wealthy father passes away and Charlie discovers that he has an autistic brother name Raymond who is played by Dustin Hoffman. The movie focuses on the emotional journey that Charlie and Raymond experience together over a one week period. The adventure begins when Charlie and his girlfriend Susanna played by Valeria Golino are on their way to a weekend getaway and Charlie receives a phone call that his father has passed away. Charlie returns to Ohio only to discover that his father has placed his 3 million dollar inheritance in a trust and left Charlie with only a car. The journey continues when Charlie takes Raymond from the facility where he has been living since he was a small child and they drive cross country from Ohio to Los Angeles. Charlie learns many things about himself on this adventure that takes many twists and turns. Charlie discovers what it is like to have family and how important his brother is to him. At the end of the film, Charlie turns down a large sum of money to try to get custody of his brother. The film ends with the two brothers parting ways as Raymond returns to the facility with his doctor.The theme of this film is that family is very important. Charlie spent most of his adult live alone and only focused on himself and his needs and when his father passed away he was focused on how it was going to benefit him. He learned through the course of this film that family is much more important than money and that Raymond needed his brother and he needed Raymond as they are the only family that each other has. Charlie learned that he was a selfish man and that he had to take other people's needs into consideration instead of focusing so much on his own needs.This film has a very serious aspect to it while certain aspects of the film make you smile or even laugh. The theme in this film is very similar to the theme in the movie Big Daddy starring Adam Sandler as guy who does not need his family because they tell him that he is wasting his life. In this movie Sandler realizes how important family is when he takes care of his friend's child. This theme in this film is also about the importance of family and taking care of your family. Rain Man is a much more serious film but the themes of the two films are very similar.The film uses many different ways to demonstrate the seriousness of this film and how it has impacted Charlie. There was a common motif used throughout the film that focused on money. Charlie was always happy when he had money or thought that he had money. This was represented numerous times throughout the movie. For example, Charlie was very anxious to go meet with the lawyer about his father's will until he realized that his father did not leave his estate to him. The film demonstrated several times that Charlie was very focused and driven by money.The lighting used in this film was also very important because it demonstrated the different moods and atmospheres throughout the film. The lighting was used to show happy times and depressing times throughout the film. The lighting was dull and somewhat dark when Charlie and Susanna first visited the facility where Raymond was living. This provided a sense of sorrow for the people living in this facility because it seemed sort of dark and dreary. The lighting for the outside scenes were really bright and cheerful as if the film was trying to make a subtle point about live at the facility. The theme really makes this film great because it allows the viewer to reflect on his or her own relationships. Films that cause people to think about their own situations and reflect are very important because they cause the viewer to think about the film in a very serious manner which may impact their future relationships. The theme of this film will make a lasting impression on most people who watch this film.",Rain Man
412,samson_jones,Superb Performance from Cruise and Hoffman,10,11 May 2012,"The power of this movie remains decades after it was released. One of the best movies I have ever seen.Tom Cruise plays Charlie Babbock, a very self-centered man. He learns that his long estranged father has died, and is upset when the will is read. The money winds up going to Raymond Babbock (Dustin Hoffman), his much older brother who he never knew existed up to this point. Raymond is in an institution because he is a man with savant syndrome, a disorder on the autism spectrum. Charlie is upset because all the money went to Raymond, who does not know anything about money, or understand money's purpose or value.Charlie takes Raymond with him to try to bargain in order to get what he thinks is his rightful share of his dead father's money. He tries to take him on an airplane to L.A. but Raymond is terrified of airplanes, leaving them to get there by car - a three day journey.It is on this road trip that Charlie gets to know his brother very well. In this movie you see Charlie gradually transform from an impatient, selfish man, who treats Raymond like an object, rather than a person, to someone who grows to understand, and love Raymond. Anyone who thinks Tom Cruise can't act, needs to buy or rent this DVD and watch it over and over again. Watch for the gradual change in Charlie's heart.I give this movie a ten.",Rain Man

This film has really only two characters, all others play only minor roles (Cruise's girlfriend has some importance though). Two characters basically, and one dialogue - that's all you need when you've got a script as good as this, and two such great actors. Only that is brilliant. But this film also has such fine, very true episodes, small stories in the larger film. One example is when Ray watches court TV with the working class woman and her many children out in the countryside...it's such a fine picture, just outstanding. ALL IN ALL A GREAT FILM!",Rain Man

Barry Levinson Masterpiece!,10,6 February 2005,"If you haven't watched it yet, i suggest you watch it because this film is the most touching and Hilariously funny film ever to come in theatres.The story starts with Charlie Babbit a slick car salesman who will do anything to make that extra bit of $$$$. Then once Charlie finds out his Dad has just died -who he has fallen out with and as a result he left home in his late teens- he obviously wants to know what he gets in inheritance. Then when he finds out that somebody other than him has inherited his Father's $3million Estate, he goes on search for that person... only to find that it is his brother Raymond -who he has never met before, but only knew him as the infamous RAINMAN!-. an Autistic Savant patient, who's about to turn his world upside down.I won't reveal anymore but take my advice, WATCH IT! and always remember that he's a very excellent driver!",Rain Man
415,takrou01,excellent show,10,5 May 2013,"Upon his father death, Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) inherited the very car that tore up his relationship with his father and a bunch of rose bushes. He also discovered his father left a very large sum of money in a trust for a beneficiary he does not know. Upon further discovery, he learns the beneficiary is actually his older brother Raymond. Raymond diagnosed as an autistic savant, has a hard time learning and communicating. Charlie cannot believe that his father would leave so much money to a person who has no concept of money. Charlie kidnaps Raymond from the institution in an effort to get half of the inheritance. After Charlie learns that Raymond will not get on a plan to LA, he drives across country. During their journey, together Raymond's eccentrics drive Charlie crazy. Raymond will not go out in the rain; he will not travel on busy highways, forcing Charlie to take an alternate route on less traveled roads delaying the return back to LA even more. On their way to LA Charlie stops in this little town, this is where he finds out that Raymond is very intelligent when it comes to numbers. It is at the next stop at a hotel when Charlie starts to remember that what he thought was a childhood imaginary friend actually turns out to be Raymond. He also discovers that Raymond was put in the institution because Raymond accidentally hurt Charlie when he was young. Over all Charlie, starts to see Raymond in a different way, at first Charlie is harsh and comes across very mean. As he gets to know Raymond he starts to accommodate Raymond's needs, he even tries to get close. This is the point where the overall theme fits in, that just because a person is autistic or has a handy cap, does not mean they cannot have feelings. This is very clear in the scene where Raymond, being asked if he wants to stay with Charlie or return to the institution, he say yes to both. In this scene, you can see Raymond has feelings for Charlie because he is allowing Charlie to touch him. Raymond actually leans his head on Charlie's, showing a connection. Over all this, remind me of the movie called I am Sam. I am Sam is a story about a mentally challenged man fights to keep his daughter.",Rain Man

The protagonist is a weird man have special ability. But for him, love(family) is the most important thing. If you want to have a memorable memory, I think it will be a a good choice to watching this movie. After watching this movie, I thought more about what are the important things in my life.

417,bowon111193,The rain man is a story that emphasizes the brotherhood between the two man.,10,9 June 2014,"The rain man is a story that emphasizes the brotherhood between the two man. The older brother has autism which irritates the younger brother, but they are becoming more and more friendly as they travel along the road. (The younger brother could earn a lot of money owing to his older brother, who is really good at memorizing numbers. The younger brother could earn money from the casino, and it helped him to pay off the debt of his company.) I thought it was so moving that I wanted to watch it over and over again. Also, it was realistic because it can happen in the real world. I think almost all sisters and brothers have something in common. They don't know the importance of their brother or sister, but they learn it as the times passes or as they communicate each other more and more. So, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to feel touched and the greatness of the brotherhood.",Rain Man
418,zeynop24,Great movie,8,23 March 2015,"The performances were quite extraordinary. Not only Hoffman but Tom Cruise was truly in the character too and they were the perfect combination for this movie. However, the scenario and the reflection of autism to the visual media was a little superficial and that's expected because it's based on a true character which is an exception, yet for a person who doesn't know that an individual with autism is presented in a much different way than in reality, it creates a different image for those who don't know. Apart from that, considering the movie as a whole it is a true Oscar material. It has every element that Oscars pay attention to, a moral, a brotherhood which is found, understanding the true meaning of values such as money... It is well accomplished movie.",Rain Man
419,guardian_resolutions,Empathy for those without a voice and growth for those who are empty.,9,18 March 2021,"Rain Man is an emotional film that embraces the depth of relationships. The plot is based on the individual interactions surrounding two brothers Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) and Charlie (Tom Cruise.) After the death of his father Charlie discovers that he has an autistic older brother who has been in a care facility since their youth and is the benefactor of their father's three-million-dollar fortune.
On the surface Rain Man's theme can be understood as greed, family, or money. When taking a deeper look at the film the theme can be grasped as manipulation. This manipulation is intense when we see the dealings in Charlie's relationships as he interacts with most everyone in the film. This manipulation is also profound and understood to the viewer after Charlie shares a hurtful story from his past about his estranged father.
Desperate to save his failing business, Charlie being a high-end car salesman, he uses his cunning and charm to try to put himself in position to half or all of Raymond's inheritance. After illegally removing Raymond from his care facility, Charlie then schemes and exploits the trust of his girlfriend Susanna (Valeria Golino,) Raymond and Raymond's care workers. He does this in attempt to posture himself to become Raymond's custodial trustee on the merit of his blood relation, despite not understanding the depth of Raymond's needs.
Tom Cruise shines emotionally in this film and we see this similar theme in the movie Jerry McGuire. Where Cruise plays a sports agent, who loses his client base after denouncing greed and money to embracing family and relationships through manipulation.
Dustin Hoffman's as Raymond has an Academy Award winning achievement for playing the high performing autistic and is one of the most memorable character performances in my lifetime. It is noteworthy that director (Barry Levinson) uses juxtapositions to give the viewer insight and understanding to how Autism work. We see this in the hotel scene where Raymond listens and answers questions for Jeopardy on the tv, while drawing an exact replica of the carpet pattern, even though not visibly paying attention to either the tv or the carpet.
This carpet pattern is significant to the understanding to how Raymond's mind connects the dots. We see this again at the casino where Levinson focuses in on Ray noticeably thinking. The background noises fade, isolating the sound of the spinning wheel that emulates the sound of the wheels of a machinery turning, as Ray counts the cards like a machine at the Blackjack table.
We see another hotel scene where the prevalent evolution of Charlie when he gains understanding of what Rain Man means to him. This scene leads to a tender moment between the two brothers. The low-level shots, dim lighting, and soft music that the cinematographer (John Seale) accomplishes gives Rain Man compassion and maturity.
In the end, a bond is developed between brothers and an empathetic moment compels Charlie to concede his manipulations. He is beginning to comprehend what Ray really needs and that his selfishness has been aimless and the relationships he has longed for are now realized.",Rain Man
420,gloriadean,"I agree - it's good, but not great",7,11 March 2021,"I agree - it's good, but not greatI think the film gets very mean-spirited at times with Cruise constantly losing his temper. And vicious. I don't know how this won so many awards, but I like the director and give 'The Natural' a perfect 10Although it is an amazing story as i mentioned it has one feature lacking. It starts with hatred and lust mixed with cruelty but suddenly turns into affection. Now this is still good but the changeover is not out of some appropriate reasons but, as i saw it, the most pitch-y point of the changeover (of this emotion and attitude) is the brilliance of one brother that helped other to win a huge amount at the casino. Now one brother is autistic but rich and other is lusty and in debt.It also tried to show the change in his attitude towards money and his autistic rich brother by checking out the memories of parents and the past events between brothers that connected them to rain man and main man but still casino winning by the brother actually made highest impact in movie and same was just visible. Now this is the situation where the movie fails to satisfy the logic that was this love for poor autistic but brother or was it the satisfaction that I won because of him and I have someone who can in time of need help me make a lot of money? honestly speaking the situation or doubt is not that muc",Rain Man

424,Jokomotaive,From two schmucks in a car to the Oscars,7,4 October 2018,"Autism is a topic rarely discussed in movies. Which is strange considering how relevant autism is now in today's modern society. Writer Barry Morrow got inspired to write Rain Man after meeting Kim Peek (November 11, 1951 - December 19, 2009). Kim is a real life savant with an outstanding memory and is known as a ""megasavant."" So the film was made and became a huge success amongst critics and audiences alike, even winning four academy awards at the 1989 academy awards. Barry Morrow, after winning the Oscar for best original screenplay, actually gave his Oscar statue to Kim Peek to carry with him. As the statue was held by more people than any other, it has since been known as the ""Most Loved Oscar Statue"". Unfortunately in 2009, the 58 year old Kim Peek died of a heart attack on December 19, 2009, leaving many heartbroken. Kim Peek inspired people all over the world, with quotes like: ""You don't have to be handicapped to be different cause everybody's different."" One could say that his legacy lives on in Rain Man, which was one of the first movies to deal with autism in a serious way. Tom Cruise plays the young wheeler dealer Charlie Babbitt who after his father's death, travels from his home in Hollywood to Cincinnati, Ohio to settle the estate. He learns that he is receiving his fathers old Buick Roadmaster while the $3 million estate he wants is going to an unknown trustee. He manages to get the information that the money is being directed to a mental institution. Once at the mental institution, he meets the trustee who by surprise happens to be his older brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) whom he previously never knew existed. Raymond is an autistic savant who struggles in today's modern society and can't understand the concept of money. Unable to get the money from Raymond or Dr. Gerald R. Bruner (Jerry Molen), Raymond's doctor, he manages to convince Raymond to follow him back to Los Angeles, with the intention of gaining custody of his brother and get the $3 million dollar estate. The most remarkable thing about Rain Man is the performances of Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Dustin Hoffman especially shines as the autistic savant Raymond Babbitt. He approaches the character with an utmost respect and heart. It's a very detailed performance with a lot of nuance put in to it. Tom Cruise, though not as entirely noteworthy, still manages to pull of a good performance as the arrogant young man. They also work together really well. During the rehearsal, they swapped lines with one another and even auditioned for each other's character during the casting period so Cruise auditioned for Raymond and vice versa. So they were pretty aware of their roles as soon as shooting began. They truly have a wonderful screen presence and the chemistry between them is something that brings a smile to your face. Rain man can be described as a road movie. The physical journey, the one the characters experience driving through America, can serve as a metaphor for the overall development the characters go through. The further they drive, not only does Charlie gain more insight about Raymond and his condition but also about himself and his own problems. How he treats his brother, how he sees his girlfriend Susanna, played rather well by actress Valeria Golino, and how the constant hunt for money has plagued his existence. Maybe even Raymond learns a few things from his brother as they go along. The film tries to give insight into the responsibility and what it's like dealing with autism for everyone involved at the same time it tries to serve as a critique of capitalism. Which is something it does rather well. Responsibility is a big theme in this movie and many of the conflicts that arise are because of Charlie's lack of it.Another important thing to note is the sharp rendering of American culture. Though it struggles with some stereotypes, the filmmakers have proven to have a great sense of story world. Letting the characters live and breathe in the film's environment, without pulling the focus away from them, gives the sense of a world that stretches itself far beyond what we're seeing on the screen. In a great scene featuring Charlie and Raymond driving through the quiet, empty streets of Las Vegas, they enter one of the casinos and we're introduced to the bombastic chaos of people, flashing lights and the loud noises of the slot machines. It's like walking into a different world! One should also note that this was the first time Hans Zimmer worked on a Hollywood production. He was advised by director Barry Levinson, Good Morning, Vietnam, to not use strings, mainly cause he was afraid it would make the film too sentimental. The score for the film is unfortunately just fine and despite Levinson's guidelines it actually becomes sentimental at parts. Nothing really impressive or memorable as a hole. In fact, many of the filmmaking aspects of the movie are really unremarkable. The movie is well shot, it's competently directed and well written but it lacks in what I would argue is one of the most important things in movies, something that unfortunately many overlook. That of presentation. For example, on a stylistic level, the film looks and feels like most of the American studio movies released since Orson Welles's Citizen Kane. The problem with using the same formula over and over again becomes apparent in the fact that we get bored of things we become used to. If the audience gets exposed to the same techniques in every movie, the audience starts to become uninterested despite the quality of the script. The film also falls short on the emotional aspects, which is the most important thing when it comes to filmmaking or any art form for that matter. The goal of making art is not to make the audience understand it, but to feel it. Style is something every filmmaker should have of their own. In Hollywood, every filmmaker seems to have the same approach to movies. If we compare this to what Andrei Tarkovsky or Bergman did many years prior, having a unique style and original approach to the medium, Rain Man simply looks uninspired.The movie does however stand its test of time. The honest and heartfelt look into the relationship between the two brothers and the realistic take on autism is really something to admire. It's a feel good movie and it doesn't fall flat in that aspect. Maybe if the filmmakers cared more about presentation I would have cared more about Rain Man, but it does in the end make up for its flaws due to its superb acting and skilled representation of American culture.",Rain Man

His father's attorney reads the will, which gives Charlie the title to Sanford's prize-winning roses and a 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible from the estate. The attorney then discloses that the remainder of the estate including $3 million has been put into a trust for an unnamed beneficiary. Charlie discovers the beneficiary is his autistic-savant brother, Raymond. Charlie kidnaps Raymond, holds him for the ransom of $1.5 million, and the two brothers travel across country in the Buick. Meanwhile, the time the brothers spend together alters the rest of their lives.The theme of Rain Main is family drama with a mentally challenged family member. The film is realistic in regards to the family drama in that father and son are estranged and family secrets are discovered. The secret of Raymond being Charlie's brother held shock value for Charlie. Charlie is angry with his father for not receiving what he thought he should from the estate caused him to take Raymond. Charlie had not planned on connecting with Raymond during their trek across country but developed a bond with him and truly loved him. This film has similar elements of Forest Gump in that Forest inspired everyone he met. Raymond didn't quite inspire people but his sweet ignorance made others slow down and appreciates him for the person he is. Forest was able to live an adventurous life while Raymond feels his life has plenty of adventure with his books, ducks, and watching his TV shows-People's Court, Wheel of Fortune, and Jeopardy. The director used the technique of foils with Susanna taking time to try and understand what Raymond needs, while Charlie is selfish and focuses on what Raymond is not doing. Charlie feels as though Raymond is ignoring him purposefully and doing things against what Charlie is asking him to do. The technique of motif was used with Charlie being a jerk continuously in the film. Almost every interaction Charlie had with people he was rude and cocky. Charlie is rude when Lenny calls him to tell him his father died as Charlie hangs up on Lenny while he is still talking. Charlie is rude to his father's attorney after being given his portion of the estate. Charlie is rude to Susanna in most of their interactions. The theme of the film of family drama makes this film work. If Charlie were not such an ass throughout the film the audience would not yearn for him and Raymond to make a connection. What a tough situation for both Charlie and Raymond. Charlie thought he was an only child and Raymond was not accustomed to being off the property and out into the world. It was heart warming to watch Charlie transform into the understanding man he became in the end of the film. Dustin Hoffman did a phenomenal acting job as the character Raymond.

He's most notable for being able to evoke subtly comedic discussions amongst his leading characters, save the rare occasion when his strained efforts backfire (""Toys"" comes to mind). ""Rain Man"" (1988) is his crowning effort, his best achievement I can think of off-hand.Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise in ""Rain Man,"" but the individual who really lights up the screen and makes us believe is Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt, his autistic brother. Actors Aside, People consider Raymond a wandering innocent who has no idea what he's doing, but as his friendship with his brother proceeds so does the fact that Raymond, though obviously unable to comprehend all his surroundings, recognizes his brother and the bond between them.That's not to say Cruise acts bad in this film. I don't like Tom Cruise, specifically because I think he is more than similar to his ignorant character in this film. But because of his personality, Cruise is able to convincingly portray the type of person vital to ""Rain Man"" -- he's the parallel of the audience. We go into the movie with apprehension and perhaps a little self-assurance, and we come out wholly different and strangely changed. Our perspective is no longer what it was before.Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt, a wealthy car dealer living the high life in California.

-We often watch ""Jeopardy!""
-We like to mark down stuff we want to remember for the rest of our lives (Ray does it with his notebook, I do it with my computer)
-We are good at math (although I can't really calculate massive numbers like he can, e.g. ""How much is 312 x 123?"", ""How much is 4343 x 1234?"" & ""How much is the square root of 2130?"")Some things that differ us include:
-Ray's fear of airplanes (particularly airlines that crashed)
-Ray going to one single store in the world to get his groceries (Kmart at 400 Oak St., Cincinnati, OH)
-I am fluent in 5 other languages: Spanish, French, Italian, German and Russian (it is unknown if Ray knows how to speak any other language or detect which foreign language the text shown on one thing is)Although Ray feels unused to things since his brother Charlie ""kidnapped"" him, he learns about what it is to be around a big world.The movie was really good.
