0,SnoopyStyle,good prequel expansion,7,26 August 2021,New monsters are rising in the woods after Witchers had mostly cleared them. Vesemir is a Witcher for hire. Accusation arises that Witchers are the ones creating the monsters as a scheme to rebuild their work for hire.This is an animated prequel expansion of the world of The Witcher series. It's a good story. The characters are compelling. The old school animation is alright. The Korean studio does a lot of American TV work and it has a good handle on it. This is well made.,The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
1,nogodnomasters,There will always be another monster,4,8 September 2021,"As a child Vesemir's life was saved by a witcher, a mercenary who kills monsters. Vesemir desires to become a witcher in spite of them being despised by humans. And Plot Spoiler, we quickly discover the witchers are creating the monsters to stay in business, something unknown to Vesemir. This leads to issues.I didn't like the characters or the monster graphics.Guide: F-word. Nudity.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
2,paul_haakonsen,Adequately entertaining...,5,28 September 2021,"I am not a head-over-heels fan of ""The Witcher"" franchise, though I found the Netflix series to be entertaining. So I wasn't really overly thrilled about this 2021 animated foray into the franchise. But as the opportunity to sit down and watch it presented itself, of course I did so.And yeah, ""The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf"" certainly was watchable, but it wasn't something that made me sit with raised arms and being particularly thrilled or excited. But I found this animated movie from writer Beau DeMayo to be adequately entertaining.The storyline was pretty straight forward, though it wasn't something that mentally challenges the audience. You simply just lean back, much on the snack and watch the movie unfold on the screen. Certain things in the storyline felt rushed, if not casually brushed over, which was a shame, because a more thoroughly thought through plot would have added to the overall enjoyment.The art style that they opted to use for ""The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf"" was good. It felt like a mixture between traditional animated movie style, say the 1980s cartoons, and mixed in with a dash of Anime. It worked out well enough, and wasn't boring to look at.With ""The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf"" being an animated movie, of course having a proper voice cast is alpha and omega. And they did have an okay ensemble of voice performers to portray the various roles and characters here. Mostly talents that I wasn't familiar with, aside from Graham McTavish.All in all then ""The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf"" is watchable, but I think it has a wider appeal to the hardcore fans of the franchise than it does for someone like me, a casual viewer.My rating of director Kwang Il Han's ""The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf"" lands on a five out of ten stars.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
3,siderite,"It was very good, with a gripping story, if slightly off canon",9,26 August 2021,"A lot of the bad reviews here are about how the film did not respect the canon. Tears, finger gestures and other such nonsense. If you care more about the canon than the story, I guess you should not watch this film. However, if you like compelling characters, good animation and an epic storyline, then this is for you. I have read the books and I have played the games: whoever thinks there is a canon that holds them both is inside an illusion.Now about the film. It's not perfect, but for me it was well close. The animation is good, barring some lazy 3D in some fight scenes, the voices are perfect, the story is beautiful and sad - the scene when he says he is also 70 was great, tons of action like in the games, but also focus on the actual morals and emotions of the characters, like in the books. The ending was epic, but very rushed. A lot of the film was setting it up, to see it end so abruptly was kind of jarring. Also logic was a bit strained there.The story is a prequel, a bit of origin for Geralt, how he became such a goody two shoes, and also explaining why Kaer Morhen is in ruins in his time. The books are not clearly explaining how the hold was destroyed other than say it was a bunch of fanatics spurred and helped by mages, which is consistent with the film. I liked the Netflix Henry Cavill series, but the many characters and random timelines threw me off a little. This film brings a little normality to the franchise, even if it, too, has a lot of flashbacks.Also, apparently, this film sets up the second season of the Witcher. I find the character of Kitsu intriguing, a seed for possible continuations, a creature of such power should have an effect on the world and, being a witcher/monster/elf hybrid, should have a life span allowing her to live to Geralt's time. At least the concept of elven witchers (perhaps bread to battle humans) is great and should be explored further.Bottom line: keep these witchers coming! Can't wait for December 21.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
4,cruise01,Slash em up anime expansion of the witcher series.,5,9 November 2021,2.5 out of 5 stars.A spin off of the witcher series. Which shows a character Vesemir on his origin story. Living in poverty. And joins the witcher to face against a monster that he has seen in his past.Story is okay. I am not a huge fan of the anime direction. Would have been better as a live action. The script is cheesy. The direction is a bit boring. And disappointment compared to the awesome series.,The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
5,digitalbeachbum,I am not a follower,6,5 September 2021,"I did watch The Witcher on Nutflix and liked it. When this arrived I watched it too, but since I don't know the connection between the stories I sort of treated it like a stand alone movie.The animation was good, the script was good, there were some scenes which I didn't care for, but others that were exciting and fun.Overall, I have no idea how this fits in to the scheme of things. I did enjoy it and might even watch it again to see if I can pick up on some on missed details.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
6,kwenchow,"Another worst animation film! Full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Should have done better!",2,28 August 2021,"This film start with a little boy run away from the monster, and a witcher ""Vesemir"" saving him scene! As turnout, this film is about Vesemir need to killing a villain ""Tetra"", who hated witcher! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the running scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the hallucinate scene, overuse of the flashbacks scene, overuse of the kissing scene, overuse of the blackout scene, and overuse of the drinking scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene quite bloody gore, but overall have slow motion, messy, not intense, and occur in too short in time! Make the film frustrated to watch! At the end, after killing Tetra, Vesemir recruit the orphans to join him! That's it! Another disappointed film!",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
7,Movi3DO,Take my coin Witcher,8,23 August 2021,"Toss a coin to your Witcher ... there will always be another monster ...Wow it's been a long while since I've watched the Witcher. This movie is a prequel to the series where we followed Vesemir and learned more about how Witchers were made.This was again another fun and action packed fantasy. Unlike Geralt, who was more calm, Vesemir was a carefree ranger, who gave me the vibes of Castlevania's Trevor Belmont. I liked his character, as well as his bittersweet relationship with his childhood lover, which was similar to Steve Roger and Carter.Although the movie started slow, it effectively showed how unapologetically brutal the training process was to become a Witcher. Lots of blood were shed, children and adults alike, and overall felt like a bottleneck effect.Continuing with the actions, the last half became a lot better with intense and twisty battles that were amazingly entertaining. The animation style was similar to other Netflix shows with the same genre, and it worked well as always. The ending was sad, but featured a fun cameo.My problem besides the slow beginning was that the movie felt like 3 episodes condensed into a movie. There were clear transitions between each arc. Also, the movie felt a bit long despite its short runtime of less than an hour and 20 minutes.Overall, a fun side story that added something to the Witcher universe. 8/10.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
8,djurrepower,"yes yes, good good",7,30 August 2021,"Maybe a little short for the story its trying to carry, but overall a pretty decent film. It does rely somewhat on the already build witcher universe, so it did cut some narrative corners because they could. All in all, solid movie.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
9,eva3si0n,"Anime does not like much, anime from Netflix especially",6,12 September 2021,"Anime does not like much, anime from Netflix especially. The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf causes mixed feelings. On the one hand, I want to see already season 2 of the series, on the other hand, the anime is not a bad option to fuel interest in the franchise. But alas as an independent work, Nightmare of the Wolf looks like a class B product. The plot is boring, the graphics are not surprising and the most important animated film does not affect the overall history of the franchise, without giving it anything new. Alas but mediocre cinema.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
10,garabedian123,Weird time skip,6,27 August 2021,"What was the point of the first half of the movie?So I am kinda confused. The start of the movie shows a boy being saved by a Witcher from a monster that kills all his sisters or friends. He gets taken in by the Witchers grows up, then becomes the Witcher that saves himself as a child...then the story continues from here.. But i am seriously confused. I did not fall asleep or anything. It makes no sense to me but even without this, the movie doesn't really go anywhere. Nightmare of the wolf? What nightmare? What wolf? Not much content in this movie, yet not too bad of a flick.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
11,baunacholi-86159,Average,5,30 August 2021,"As someone with no background to the Witcher universe (be it book or game) I saw a nice fantasy flick with some decent hocus pocus. A bit of cliche in regards to dialogue /characters and - good vs evil - well, not necessarily the newest aspect in story telling. This said, entertaining but average in my POV due to the sheer lack of surprises.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
12,dk77dk,The Witcher: Disappointment,2,24 September 2021,"Another disappointment. This film has almost nothing to do with the Slavic mythology on which these stories originated.Another mediocre production full of clichés that today's producers have to put in almost every film. The characters are generic and boring, the same in almost every modern film production.The animation isn't bad and the voice actors are interesting, but that's about it. The story is boring and generic, as are most of the characters.The characters are only there to meet the demands of the producer, to whom some other things are obviously more important than the story. The potential is great, but like most of today's film production, this film is a complete failure. Most of the film is boring, and the dialogues are hilarious as is the plot itself.The story and atmosphere do not have a Slavic feeling at all, a total disrespect for an interesting mythology and culture.The Witcher universe really has a lot of potential, if it was another producer, this might then become one of those masterpieces that would be debated for decades, and this way it turned out to be just another disappointment.Unfortunately, another disappointment and mediocre production that has almost nothing to do with the original material.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

14,karinahatem,Rather boring,5,24 August 2021,"This is not for kids, as it is too bloody, also they will have difficulty following the dialogue.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
15,samyoung-82648,Surprisingly Good,8,26 August 2021,"Netflix as a company is mostly miss on their productions. This film is one of the few exceptions, it's a solid production.Firstly, Netflix have avoided the woke - it's a well done.Secondly, the story is quite interesting and well paced, although it occasionally jumps and you have to pay close attention.Thirdly, the film is very violent at times and it's something I have never enjoyed about the Witcher series - the violence serves no purpose. If you compare this to Romper Stomper or Fight Club, you will appreciate what I mean. Both of those films revolve around violence with a purpose ... or even V for Vendetta.I would not recommend this for sensitive younger viewers. I enjoyed it enough to watch it a few times.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
16,ssvfolder-1,Not really a Witcher universe,5,2 September 2021,"Anything connected to Witcher universe is widely awaited by the loyal fans of superb Witcher 3 video game. I can also mention books, but to be honest very few people read the books before the game came out. Obviously the series that came out at Netflix wasn't the reason. It's still Netflix quality series after all.Cartoon is decent, but few things come to mind almost immediately. There were never Black royalty families in that universe. The monsters are completely different. The Witchers aren't anime ninjas.All in all it just doesn't give that Witcher feel. So it may be a decent cartoon, but it's all wrong.So I'll give it a 5/10 stars at best. Try better Netflix and stop forcing unneedy diversity or general modern agendas into this amazing universe. It's much better without your adaptation.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
17,BijeshNagesh,Criminally Good,9,25 August 2021,"If you thought the Henry Cavill led ""Witcher"" 2019 series was good, wait till you get a load of this one. ""Nightmare of the Wolf"" put the spotlight on Geralt of Rivia's mentor and father-figure Vesemir. In this animated movie, Vesemir's a young Witcher killing monsters for coin - in keeping with his trade and training.Kwang Il Han's direction did wonders for each scene in this film based on the super-interesting novels - that also inspired the hit game - written by Andrzej Sapkowski. ""Nightmare"" had an accompanying writer, Beau DeMayo, who gave the IP an interesting twist. I loved how they applied a 'corruption and conmanship among Witchers' theme (rather, scheme) to the core plotline.Plenty of notable characters made themselves known. Voicing them were an equally amazing cast. Theo James made Vesemir feel alive and inspiring. Lara Pulver gave Tetra Gilcrest a powerful presence. Mary McDonnell brought class and wisdom to Lady Zerbst - who became my favourite character in ""Nightmare"".Graham McTavish's Deglan (Witcher master) and Tom Canton's Filavandrel (the elf) were splendid. Aside from these, there are other talented voice-cast names on the roster - especially and including young Vesemir (voiced by David Errigo Jr.) and his fellow Witcher-trainees. Harry Hissrich, son of ""The Witcher"" showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich, voiced young Geralt - who was not the main focus of this film, and that's a good thing.The Animation department worked excellence into each frame. It was a 'make or break' factor in this feature based on a super-popular franchise, and I am happy to say they made it work. The pacing, gore, creature design, and realism they imparted to this tale was nothing short of admirable.Musical scoring (composition and performance) by Brian D'Oliveira lent brilliant artistic flavour and storytelling flair to ""The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf"" for Netflix. The tunes composed were hauntingly orchestral.This movie is an excellent 'origins' tale centred around the amazing character Vesemir and his experiences, which include his prepping and upbringing at Kaer Morhen under then-master Deglan who trained him in the 'School of the Wolf'. To not see this brutal and beautiful, candid and realistic animated film would be a crime against Witchers everywhere, and this outstanding IP in particular.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
18,angiris,"5 minutes of woke nonsense at the start, but the rest is great.",7,23 August 2021,"Skip the first 5-8 minutes of the film. The rest is really great.I wont spoil any of the good stuff because its worth a watch and enjoyable whilst a bit hard to get into a first since its a very different type of witcher we're seeing yet thats also the point.At the beginning however we follow 5 out of place characters that ethnically make no sense. Clearly part of the political mandate to include diverse characters.The thing is that it's coming across as both annoying, insulting and plain hilarious at the exact same time.Quite inginuous writing if intended.You got this family that logically can only be from Zerrekania. Why they are here makes no sense and is never explained. Furthermore why the hell would a nobleman travel so damn far... with his ENTIRE family, without any guards and assitance in a monster and bandit filled world.These are literally your only ethnically diverse characters in the entire film, shoe-horned in because 2021 nonsense. But instead of actually doing anything respectful with them per all this agenda stuff, they just kill them all off, minus a kid who gets side-lined after 5 minutes so he might've as well died too.It's absolutely hilarious to watch because all except the twitter people are sick and tired of the contemporary IRL stuff impacting our entertainment, and seemingly the netflix writers are as well and just got the mandate check-marked and then proceeded with the real story which was about the witcher universe and not some woke irrelevancy that has no business in our escapism and established universes.I'll give it a 7 out of 10. Ducking it a point because of the woke stuff, but at the same time maybe I should give it 8 anyway because it made me laugh how totally indifferent they were to the mandate. It's so painfully obvious by now that nobody cares about the politics at all over there. It's all about appeasing the keyboard warriors and silly media.That said though, it's still a 7, because it's actually racist of Netflix to still push this diversity only to result in acting as a complete meat-shield. Not progressive at all. Just makes people of colour in your entertainment act as tokenistic checkmarks.Thats not cool at all.Make another film, give us original zerekkanian witchers and have all the people of color you want. Make it authentic within the lore and make something cool that is respectful to people of color instead of this ridiculous trend.Its the easiest thing to get natural diversity right.It's legitimately embarassing and hilarious, Netflix. But thanks for the 1 armed red headed witcher ! Some people hated on him but i thought he was cool tbh.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
19,eve_dolluk,The Witcher isn't set in the middle ages of Europe,7,24 August 2021,"Ill start with my title as some other reviewers seem to think that this is the case. Unfortunately there were no Elves, Mages, Witches, Magic or Monsters or any sort of mystical things as such in the Middle ages in Europe. There were however dark skinned people, they would travel along the continent ( of Europe ) selling goods from China and India to Europe. There were also African people trading from Zanzibar to Europe.However the Witcher series isn't set in Europe or the Middle ages or Dark ages. It is in fact set on the Continent ( which does look a little like Northern Poland )in a time period not of our own. This means there are Elves, Witches, Mages, Magic and of course Dark skinned people from Zerrikania.In this film it opens with some Zerrikanians getting slaughtered....Now onto the film, this is the story of Vesimir, his witcher training and his current predicament. Its a semi love story but more so deals with how witchers are trained and also the animosity from the citizens of The Continent towards Witchers.This is driven however by a female mage who really hates witchers.One has to remember that Witchers are not really good guys nor are they bad guys, they are sub human genetically modified ( using magic ) beings that go through a barbaric process to become who they are.This of course leaves them a bit unempathetic and unemotional but as we know they are not totally devoid of these traits.This film touches on these ideologies as well as the longer life that witchers have.I have read some reviews that question the ending being true to the books although the section they talk about is mentioned fleetingly in the books and for me this film fits with what was written in that short paragraph,I'm not a huge fan of Animation but this was ok, the voice acting can sometimes be a little bit too 'animation'. This can lead to things becoming a bit to comical which takes away the dark edge of the story. Visually however it was quite pleasant.As a little prequal to the books and the films with a fairly open licence on those events its decent and enjoyable but doesn't really give us more insight into the Witcher world than what we already know. Its more of a homage to Vesimir but also highlights more questionable actions of Witchers past.I presume this was made to give people an introduction to Vesimir who are not familiar with the books or games.A 7/10 as a witcher fan would be my score maybe for someone who is not so much a fan they may find it a little pointless.One question though How old was Vesemir before Imlerith snapped his neck.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
20,iwatchibinge,Not bad at all.,7,26 October 2021,"To nonplayers like me it gives a bit of background of The Witcher series. Apart from this there is nothing much to add to this, as it is as any average anime should be. Just that the background score could have been a bit better.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
21,DaegT,Close to perfect,9,23 August 2021,"Like some others I have waited for months to watch this prequel. The only room of improvement I can think of, at presence, is the visual effect. It's good, but a picky fan like me would expect something better. You know, none of the monsters looks or sounds frightening to me. Is that just me getting blasé here???Yet that's minor, I have to admit. It's a close-to-perfect prequel for Witcher fans.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
22,margineanvladdaniel,"Interesting, but could've been better",7,23 August 2021,"It was nice to have a better view at their origins, but it lacked something.

23,keikoyoshikawa,Toss A Coin to Your Witcher,8,24 August 2021,"Crisp, detailed animation. Engaging story. Mostly good voice acting.

24,pronitmallick,A fine spell under a full moon,8,24 August 2021,"The Witcher Nightmare of the Wolf is a movie that starts with the signature style of the witcher world. The presentation right from the first frame gives you the vibes of The Witcher series back from 2019. The characters and the elements feel like a fine glass of wine and versatile. The thing that makes the witcher series eye-catching is the dynamic and branching storytelling from the beginning to end and that spell didn't fade in this movie also. The flow of the story feels little
predictable at a few points, so does the ending but everything can be ignored in front of this glorious presentation. The editing and transitions feel polished enough for this content. Director Kwang Il Han has done a wonderful job putting together all this and so do the screenwriters, writing this wonderful stuff.

35,bbevis-47954,A Fun Watch,6,28 August 2021,"Casual Witcher Fan here. Not sure what the forced politics complaints are about. I didn't really notice anything out of the ordinary but to each its own.I also understand if people who read the book are frustrated with key details in lore being lost in translation.In my opinion the biggest fault to the movie is how rushed it feels. There is no character development to speak of and scenes are often edited together to move from one set piece to the next. The transitions of many scenes fading to black and abruptly landing in a busy scene with tons of dialogue ruins any flow. The story feels rushed, predictable with all setup and no substance.Beyond all of my gripes I can say I was entertained. The pace is so fast you may never be bored and the action sequences are graphic and abundant. The finale fight scene against a certain Mage was great but again lacks any emotional stakes because the production is so rushed.The Witcher: Nightmare of The Wolf serves as nothing more than passable entertainment if you're remotely interested in the Witcher.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

I've only seen the Netflix series with Henry Cavill. For this reason I am definitly not qualified to talk about the plot and if it's good or bad.But as an ""outsider"" I can tell: It is pretty damn nice to watch. The plot is understandable (If it's good or bad I cant tell) and the animation style and the combination of animation and blood and brutality is pretty dope and a lot of fun to watch.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
37,johnh22,...Go Broke,5,28 August 2021,"The Witcher Nightmare is compromised by casting and writing that shoehorns ""real world"" concerns into a movie: It ruins the suspension of disbelief for the viewer.How else can you describe a movie that includes a character whose sole purpose is talking about his sexual preference for no apparent reason - it's distracting.Movies would improve If screen writers would just tell a story: write dialogue that moves the story forward and cast characters that serve a narrative purpose instead of checking ""real world"" ideology boxes.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
38,Camerenth,A movie worthy of the series,9,24 August 2021,"This was way better than I ever could have expected. Not only does it have amazingly animated fight scenes, but also has emotional moments that are true directly tied to a Witcher's life. My only problem is that this movie isn't longer. It does tend to emphasize action while giving just enough of an origin story for us to care about our main character. They also surprisingly expand the lore of the series as a whole that gives insight that I was not expecting. I only wish they delved into that more than the action. But even so, the fights are so well animated, that I never wanted to see the fights stop. What an amazing Witcher story!",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
39,Erlik_Han,"Not sure why it's rated so low, it's incredible",10,25 August 2021,It tells the story of Vesemir (Geralt's mentor) and how Kear Morhen ended up destroyed. Idk how true it is to the books but it fits in perfectly with the game. The show has great action and a really good story.

40,Shadowboy_25cm,"Dark, gory, fast paced prequel. Entertaining.",7,12 September 2021,"Netflix goes Witcher goes Korean Animation.It's dark, it's gory, it's fast paced.It's a story based on the Witcher Novels. Of course changes have been made, of course the makers wanted to set their own mark, of course fans don't like most of the changes.But: All set aside, it's a prequel: It tells the Story of Vesemir, Geralts' Mentor, and for me it's well done.It's a very watchable movie, the animations are well done, sometimes a little bit to fast paced action scenes, but overall, a good movie.

41,Seb_3,A middling tale about Witchers,6,14 November 2021,"You definitely need to have your expectations in line before watching. It expands the universe of the Witcher that Netflix seems to be building, which as a big fan of the books, games and the series, is great to see. The animation is pretty great and there is some good sequences, it's a close parallel to the Castlevania series which I personally loved.The voice cast do a great job and everybody sounds captivating, especially the voice actor for Vesemir is perfect and he captures the essence of what I expected from a younger Vesemir. The dialogue and story is serviceable, but sadly the movie ends up feeling a bit rushed, as there is a lot of content they try to cramp into a short amount of time, while still pleasing the eyes with amazing animation and action. All in all it does an okay job at expanding the universe and works for telling the story about Vesemir, but also the degradation of the Witcher's.If you're a fan of any of the Witcher content, I think its worth a watch, just to see and hear new stories from the universe, even if it doesn't culminate in anything spectacular.6/10.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

I started to watch this movie with some expectations then, and because I liked ""Castlevania"", but I got disappointed by a story which developed a bit too fast, with a poor script and weak lines for the characters. I know it's an animation movie , but it's for adults, so what's with those childish and futile dialogues ? Animation was nice , action is good (although the Witcher's seemed hugely powerful and yet they seemed not to use their powers fully on the last battle), but after all the movie was running too fast and things never settled up.I feel that after all the work put on animation (which is the best part of the movie), the guys on the drawing desks didn't deserve such a weak story... and neither did we.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

The film does create some interesting moral dilemmas and conflict dynamics. The differently animated flashbacks are beautiful. Beyond these things there's really nothing great to say about this movie. There is some bad animation (including characters such as tetra) and lazy monster CGI in second half of the movie. The second half is not very good or interesting. There are two monster related sequences of female nudity (breasts) . A lot of the characters and character animation feel unrealistic and boring in aesthetic, personality and nature. Slightly above average at best.

The cast is 50% Castlevania and the animation studio, if not the same is at least inspired by it.Music is very generic too and takes almost nothing from the soundtrack of the games.And to really drive home the unimaginativeness of it all, they decided to copy a bunch of stuff from the live action series with Cavill (time skipping, law of surprise, swamp monster, exorcism).

55,shawnyu64,Overall decent but writing is a mixed bag,8,25 August 2021,"The animation was gorgeous, combat scene was amazing and musics are on point, but some creative choices the writer made were mix bags. There are some good arcs mixed other poorly written arcs that neither fit into the Witcher universe nor make sense even considering the movie standalone.Let's go over this one by one, starting with the worst one - sacking of Kaer Morhen.In the source material, though not clearly explained, sacking of Kaer Morhen was by religious mobs instigated by propaganda pieces like the Monstrum, and with the help of handful mages. And because the castle was gate kept by the Witcher's Trail, which was considered dangerous even for young witchers to cross, the siege was only possible with mages' help. But there was definitely no monsters involved. It just makes absolutely NO SENSE that common townsfolks turned mobs would fight along side monsters as fear and hatred toward perceived monstrosity of witcher is the primary motivation of the attack (not to mention they're afraid of monsters too). And there was no Kaedwan knights assisting the assault either - such details seem minor until you realize that it affects all later interactions between witchers and Kaedwan knights, soldiers, nobles, etc., which there are few.Most importantly, the movie choice to have Deglan and Reidrich breed hybrid monsters so that they can make more money make no sense and strongly contradicts how witchers are portrayed in the source materials. In the source materials, witchers are cold, indifferent and maybe callous, but as a group, witchers are was never portrayed as villains capable of such act, and that's even after Kaer Morhen's fall and witchers lose its core organizing structure. And in general, witchers' contracts aren't that lucrative to begin with. A Witcher can make much more coins (and safer) if he's willing to serve a king, as demonstrated by Geralt during his service to Foltest. So, basing the sacking of Kaer Morhen on such setting was both unbelievable and uncomfortable to watch.Which leads to Tetra, whose character arc also leaves much to be desired. Mostly, her hatred toward witchers is not well explained. Initially, it seems like she hates witchers because of something about ""purity"", which is a noble concept in the Witcher universe - neither mage nor human are really ""pure"" to begin with. And though it's perfectly fine to bring a new concept, there's NO EXPLANATION of what ""purity"" even means here. And her personal grudge - something about her mother being wrongly accused because of a witcher wanted to make money - is wrapped into just few sentences. You really can't describe the motivation behind the most important story event on a hollow word ""purity"" and just few sentence of background story. It really felt like she hated witchers because story needed that to happen.And Kitsu (name derived from Kitsune, which means fox in Japanese), an original creation but heavily parallels Aguara race (also means fox in Guarani) from the book, e.g., fox-based, able to cast powerful illusions, made from kidnapped elven girl, etc. These setting are fine but her arc was also heavily flawed. Mainly, why was she attacking civilians in the beginning and was spared at the end of the movie? Illyana said ""she didn't ask for this"" so Vesmir spare it her but uh... did everyone just forgot the entire story started because she used monsters to attack travelers for some unknown reason? And no, she was not under the control of Deglan or Reidrich, Deglan clearly said they thought she was dead.Finally, the good ones - Vesmir and Illyana's arcs were quite good. Vesmir is portrayed very differently in the movie when compared to source materials, but it was nicely done. Origin story was simple and bit too romanticized compared to darker tone of the source materials, but it was complete and made sense. And Illyana's story arc is also surprisingly complete as both her actions and motivations are believable. The chemistry between two was also quite good.Overall, it's still a decent movie, but much of the writings were shallow. It's not too hard to maintain suspension of disbelief during the movie, but once you're done with it and think about what happened, you will get so many ""wait, what?"" moments.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

58,hasanxenith,Not disappointed!,7,5 September 2021,"A good prequel for Netflix's TV serial ""The witcher"" . Nightmare of the Wolf doesn't just tell a new story in this rich universe. It introduces viewers to a character who's about to become a huge deal in The Witcher series. But it glued my eyes on screen every seconds of it's runtime. And the last introducing scene of bald Geralt of rivia was awesome.This movie focused on a interesting thing about witchers, The guild is same but every witcher is different by personality or idealism from one another.

61,janusswti,Bad adaptation/Good Animation... Bad wins... (from a fan),4,27 August 2021,"First of all i can say that the animation of this film is almost excellent. The action scenes and the gore close to my tastes for a film that has the word Witcher in it.Now for the bad part... Andrzej Sapkowski is credited as a writer. I don't know if the author/creator of the world of the Witcher is trying to reboot or adapt or whatever. People talk of money. Dude is rich unless he sold the writes for a penny...There is a polish series from 2001 called Wiedzmin that Andrzej is the writer of the script. In that series we see the actual training of the witchers before the mutagenic transformation process. Maybe he wanted to write that things changed under Vesemir? But if memory serves correctly Vesemir was already old when he recruited Geralt. And not the cocky, young (72 years old) and arrogant of this movie.For dedicated fans the last little nugget is unacceptable. Also the script of this movie has wholes... Huge ones. The plot jumps without explaining back and forth. And although we see the recruitment of Vesemir, we do not actually enjoy it.I cannot in good heart give more than 4 stars.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

63,Edward_Daniells,It works both as a standalone animation and as a Prequel to The Witcher.,7,26 August 2021,"The Witcher: The Legend of the Wolf is a prequel to the Netflix series The Witcher only this time we're following Vesemir's past, long before Gerald even became a Wizard.In the story the Wizards are already starting to have a breakdown, little service, people wanting their death, but a mysterious event occurs where Elves are disappearing and monsters never seen before are appearing, in this Vesemir is sent with a Mage to investigate this event that ends taking an unexpected turn.First of all I wanted to emphasize how well flowing and well done the animation and art direction is, the fight scenes are so well done that I was amazed. The narrative is also very fun, narrating events that happen in the current time of Vesemir already a witch and at times going back to the past when Vesemir was a simple slave, I found it fun to follow this narrative between past and present, because together with the good animation I simply I didn't feel tired watching it, on the contrary I had a lot of fun watching it. It is noteworthy that by default The Witcher this animation also contains a lot of violence, a well done gore including, and also by default also has nudity, but not as much as I expected there to be, it happens very little even.Another thing I liked is that you don't need to have any knowledge of The Witcher to understand this animation, it works just as well as a standalone animation as a Prequel.

Although some of the events do contradict a lot of the original materials. The way the attack on Kaer Morhen happened, for example. Like, come on, this negates an essential point of Sapkowski's work.

In the books witchers would not and do not create monsters just so they can have more things to kill. In season of storms the mages are the ones who create monsters and dwindle in alchemic mutagens, but for whole other reasons. This contradicts the whole idea of the movie in a bad way.Also, Vesemir does not probably look like your standard f boy, and Tetra's motives are pretty stupid. This whole movie paints the witchers like some evil mercenaries thirsty for coin when in reality they aren't heartless killers.

Furthermore, the liberties taken with the lore and overall history are at best questionable and at worst absurd and incoherent.I won't go into spoilers but if you read the books, played the games, hell even watched the series(which had its fair share of liberties), you may reach the credits spitting feathers.Think of what Disney did to the myth of Heracles and you're not far off...",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
94,biplavpoudel,Better than I expected,7,23 August 2021,"The movie was not bad. It was a little fast paced and I was happy to see the familiar characters. The story had potential but they botched it by making this a movie instead of a series. It was nice to see young Geralt, Eskel and Lambert but I had expected Vesemir to be older when he mentored them.One thing that bothered me the most was Vesemir being way more powerful than a typical witcher. He is meant to be an exceptionally talented witcher, but not a ninja. He seems to be mutated with different mutagen than his witchers companions in Kaer Morhen. His Aard and Igni signs should make the witches jealous.One thing I forgot to mention: The animation somehow reminded me of some other Netflix animated shows like Castlevania, Blood of Zeus and Masters of the Universe.

You will enjoy this movie. You like cool animations with a good story? Idem. It's a great watch, and a bit of a roller-coaster too!Oh and on a final note...

But my expectations where very much overthrown.The writing was superb. The movie draws inspiration very much on the style of storytelling from the original books. And consequently it develops story and characters much better than the real life Netflix series.The lore is not always consistent with the books - for example the Witcher medalion, which is supposed to vibrate when magic is being used in its proximity, as opposed to the medalion vibrating when generally monsters are close now.Or Witchers loosing any sort of emotions due to their mutations, which certainly is not the case here.The pacing sometimes is too quick. Some scenes could be extended a tiny bit in length to let the viewer breath in what just happened, because stuff is happening extraordinarily quickly at times. The voice actors generally do a very good job, but at times I had problems following what they said because they would speak a little incomprehensible (for a non native speaker at least).All in all I must say I am very positively surprised, and I cannot wait to see more! The movie focused on the hardships that made the books so fantastic - a world filled with horror, dread, despair, racism, xenophobia, etc. Its a shame that the original series didn't get this type of writing.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

Was it for the ol' switcheroo at the ending? Pretty sure we all saw it coming a mile away.Why would the Witchers go to all the time and expense in trying to create cross-breed monsters when they could just mass produce regular monsters?Why would the Witchers throw untrained, unmutated children into a swamp for the trial of the ""grasses"" and THEN mutate them, possibly causing death.Why did the summoned monsters not attack everyone?

I haven't read the books nor played the games, so, I will just talk about it from the perspective of someone who is just watching the Netflix version.First of all, the animation of the movie is super. I was really disappointed with the animation of the Masters of the Universe (I was disappointed with that series for a lot of things, but, I need a whole different essay just to express that). So, I was actually kind of worried how this movie will do in the area of animation. However, the animation proved to be top-notch. The actions were smooth, the transitions were clear, the character design was great too.The story is cool. The details regarding the origin of a witcher is stated in vividly in the movie. The story telling and the progress of the story is fast paced and you will definitely love the protagonist. He is not Gerald, but an interesting one that I have to say. This movie works around the the plot to add vast knowledge to the audience of the Witcher universe and made a great connection to the live action series in the end too. The ending will just make the people more eager for the second season of the series.Overall, as a stand alone movie this is one fun thing to watch. Maybe a better ending with a greater villain would make this one even more memorable but all in all, this movie is a solid 9/10 from me.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

2) MUSIC WAS GREAT, especially when the violin hits it while he's slicing through all of them

The music.Don't get me wrong, the soundtrack is amazing, but it sometimes drowns out the dialogue.2. The pacing.The emotional impact of the story would have been more, well, impactful, if they would have fleshed out some scenes and slowed down things a bit.Potentially you might need to be somewhat familiar with the world of the Witcher to fully enjoy the story.

I didn't expect such an animation movie with great scenario and storytelling. I wan to shortly describe that I loved the most.The sword fighting kind of reminds me of Castlevania which was quite realistic and exciting to watch. But it is obvious that people who really love the Witcher lore, made these fight scenes. Because it's all fit well as books and games. Scenery and music also as good as games (a little bit with the TV show). Especially the opening theme reminds me Lullaby of Woe of Blood and Wine.But in the end, there are no black and white in Witcher's World. In this world making choices make morality blurry.

If this is animated maybe you should try to focus both on story and design, it's really not that hard, the games follow the books for Godsake Witcher 3 is basically the . You'd think the TV show would represent a Leshen differently but they literally made a Leshen, one of the best monster designs in this RPG into a ghoul with tentacles. That's enough to know those those who wrote and produced this have no idea of Witcher lore or monster design. The games have such creative regard to this but you really have to hate those that create such nonsense out of ease and not creative flair. The games take after the books, but the design of each monster does not. How hard is that to follow. So much of the intensity of a battle is based on what any monster in any book is described as or what any monster in a video game is portrayed and designed as. And Vesimir looks like a younger version of Geralt on top of that.

150,theoldgeek-91730,Astonishing animated movie - Well done!,10,25 August 2021,"As a big fan of the Witcher who read the books and played the video games, I was not expecting much from an animated movie, mainly because I thought it would fail to be faithful to the witcher style.Fear not ! In just 80 minutes this animated movie shows much more than a standard movie could have ever done, The characters are great and the voice acting is very convincing, but above all, I realy felt deep emotions at times which I would have never expected from an animated movie... Well done.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

Overall enjoyable and entertaining but could have been better.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
154,jonathanco-93070,"Gave it a 9 because I enjoyed it and want more, but...",9,25 August 2021,"This could've been so much better, and that is mostly where my disappointment is coming from.The animation itself was beautiful, but knowing studio mir(same studio responsible for the legend of korra), they definitely could've done a better job. It seemed a bit rushed, like the scenes weren't very fluent. At times I felt like I was watching still images because of the amount of cuts that were made.The storyline was interesting, not really true to the source material, but given the era this was set in, it's no big deal. The execution, however, was a bit disappointing. The dialogues felt rushed. Every sentence bombards you with heavy concepts and emotions, but it doesn't feel natural. Regarding the script, not much was explored or explained. I do not know how people who aren't familiar with the witcher universe can understand anything, so keep that in mind if you've never read the books or played the games. It's like they had a tight budget for words or incompetent writers. You could argue previous knowledge isn't necessary in order to enjoy this, but I think it gives certain scenes MUCH more depth.Instead of being a masterpiece, it's just another movie that will be forgotten in a month or 2. The siege of kaer morhen is such a promising story to be portrayed in different mediums. Idk why they settled on a 80 minutes movie instead of a short series.Putting aside the aforementioned, I think people who are fans of animations like this will have a great time.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

Which was ok but so convoluted.The fanatical side of the humans could've been built up over the series about how witchers are abominations to humans and led to quite a good ending with a complex story along the way. I understand not everything can be a series but with fans of the witcher franchise. Dont screw this up like Star Wars did.

The Animation was beautiful with action sequences easy to follow. I wish they would have taken a different approach of storytelling than binding unrelated scenes together and doing narrative jumps. It felt rushed, it felt as I have watched a formulaic fantasy movie with the protagonist being a knight in shining armour. The most interesting thing about this movie was the events happened a long time ago that are mentioned from time to time by uninteresting characters. I would have preferred to see that movie unfold.

162,ridireoiche,Silver for prequels,5,23 August 2021,"This prequel made a few creative decisions I didn't agree with, for example I don't think it was necessary to change the circumstances behind the sacking of Kaer Morhan but I can see the narrative reasoning behind them. The power creep was a very heavy. Anime gravity was turned on for the fight scenes. The Aguara origin being portrayed as a product of witcher scheming? That was uncomfortable. Seeing that one witcher that lost his arm as a kid still alive and making signs without fingers even though if a witchers fingers are broken or tied they can't sign was a bit silly. The characterizations can be a little off putting and the plot is a bit underwhelming, then that is more a compliant for the writers... Those were probably my biggest gripes with this film.It's not enough to turn your average viewer off the main show, far from it, this prequel is still really watchable. The voice acting is really good except the nails on a chalkboard kid at the very start, the animation holds up for the most part but is inconsistant between some scenes and the story rips along a good pace after it gets going.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

But I would've liked more of this!!Vesemir is a cool character, though it takes a bit getting used to a more cocky version instead of the wise mentor.. (But he still has about 100 yrs to grow)
Nice to see more about the origin of the witchers in Kaer Morhen.Also the animation is great, and Theo James voice suites the character.

This anime I did not have confidence in, because it is from Netflix and the work of Netflix anime is not the best thing. The important thing is that I was shocked by the quality of the drawing and the splendor of the legendary beginning and also the end was acceptable.

170,anasehabfarra,Inspiration turned to desperate imitation,5,24 August 2021,"Lord have mercy on anyone who watches this who knows a thing or two about the lore behind the Witcher books or even games. Let's start with what I enjoyed the music for the most part anyway felt nice and epic sometimes it dragged a bit too much into different scenes making it feel a bit awkward since it doesn't fit that scene. The animations are pretty good to be honest it's good to look at despite the 3D work which just looked odd to me. The voice acting obviously is exactly what I expected from a start studded cast like this they're all pretty experienced. That's it that's all I liked the story is the most glaring issue in this animation I enjoyed looking at the inner conflicts of the city but it quickly keeps changing out of that focusing more on V's back story which is fine but it doesn't make sense the swamp scene especially, the fact that the school doesn't get the chance to show more about what they go through just the trials that we're familiar with. Witchers are supposed to be immune to certain emotions or feelings but V seems to have every single emotion expressed here (Anger, remorse, sadness even to the point of crying, love, humor and comedy) it's really crazy stuff almost all of them look dashing! Which again shouldn't be the case since they're literally almost dead during these trials that was portrayed nicely in the Witcher 1 and the books using your imagination, I couldn't for the life of me relate or feel anything to most of the characters I don't if that's intended maybe you're supposed to be the Witcher while watching this movie... jokes aside it's hard to get attached to such cardboard like characters such a shame. The monster hunting part does not go along with the norms you're used to as a fan, the preparation, the intensity and the threat a Witcher feels once approached by monsters of this caliber should be more emphasized but V seems to be very comfortable which just takes away from the entire point of a Witcher and just reminds me time and time again that I'm watching Trevor Belmont at work with the 300 ft air fights the ""morning star"" grappling chain, nuclear igni and aard casting, super fast Slash and dash movement. I could go on longer but it is what it is...if you're not a hardcore fan then give it a watch you might like it just make sure you stay safe and enjoy your day!",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

I wish they did this story line for the show because this could have been a real epic tale if not for it being a bit rushed. It still good with this short runtime but a series could have had some more time to get into each part and show us more of those parts where they fast forward here.

But as only as casual Witcher fan who used the TV show as an intro into the Witcher universe I found this entertaining with some heart felt moments. Action and drama work well together here. The action is a little bit anime over the top. I Figured they wanted to lean into showing the powers of the Witchers they can't really recreate on the live action TV show effectively on the budget. If you have a casual interest in the Witcher series and like animated films you will enjoy this.

Probably because if you try to make a movie without a certain amount of forced diversity no one will pay you for it. The industry is controlled by religious zealots who are compelled to indoctrinate. Quality suffers when you don't focus on doing the best job you can do and instead you just start checking boxes. That being said, I would have given it an 8/10 if there was no Witcher in the title. Good movie. Just create your on original IPs instead of ""fixing/destroying"" others.

So they can be understood and the characters are ambiguous. Quite primitive in fact. The plot seems to be superfluous for the universe, but it seems to complement the story. Probably for those unfamiliar with the original source, the series has now become clearer. The image of Vesemir is unusual. I admit that he has changed in his old age, even at the end of the anime he is already a little different. For some reason I thought that he was like Geralt, out of context I would not have guessed that it was himThe idea that the witchers themselves created new monsters so that they had enough work and people respected them is very strange. Why do we need wizards who were responsible for testing herbs is also unknown. There are a lot of characters that are only needed to merge themBut now at least it is clear why there are almost no witchers left and why they are so disliked. Otherwise, in the game and the book, they seemed unfairly despised, despite their merits.

the animation is good quality for the most partAnd now for the bad:
the world building is inconsistent. People born and raised in the same town have completely different accents for no reason, limiting immersion.the characterisation. Something the source material does excellently is create deep, believable characters, but for whatever reason Netflix decided that one dimensional characters are much better. There also isn't any character development so nothing to get invested in, nor is there any variety in the dialogue (*something happens*, Vesemir: sarcastic comment)Ignores important plot devices. Witchers can use minor magic spells in the source material, which helps makes the victories feel earned and keep the stakes high. In this show they are just as powerful as mages from the very start, so why bother fighting? Why not just blast the monster and the neighbouring nation with a massive fireball? I think the shows' directors made that decision so they could have glitzy fight scenes and no other reason, despite it detracting from the story.TLDR: ignoring source material and watching as a standalone movie, it is still bad.

193,vancedivan,Top tier animation that needed more screen time,10,24 August 2021,"The Witcher Nightmare of the wolf is a true marvel when it comes to animation. This is specially important when we consider that the Witcher franchise is packed with action scenes that are sometimes difficult (or impossible) to portrait in live action. The animation format gives the writers and directors complete freedom of what they want to show, and the movie really benefits of that.The plot itself is good, although sometimes it feels like a mere tool to introduce the viewer to the lore of the Witcher, in hopes of bringing a new audience to the second season of the show. This is most noticeable when we realize how short some of the scenes are, and how unfinished some characters stories feel.This show would've been benefited with the addition of another 30 minutes or so.Before I finish, I would like to praise the music of the movie, which resembles the one from the third game and the voice acting of the main characters. My only complain on this matter is that the music can be sometimes too loud, and the children voice acting doesn't really sound like children.Over all the movie is really good, but felt short and rushed.I give it a 10/10 just to counter balance other ""fans"" that like to give low scored to anything that doesn't look exactly like the third game.

Nothing complicated at all: they are all real, with understandable motivations and losses. Easy to love them, and they are entertaining. Like almost everything in the Witcher universe, the movie is dark as well: there will be a lot of blood, death, and the ending will leave the watcher with mixed feelings.

We have right here a very well written example of it.The movie manages to have a soul, and makes us fall in love with the characters almost instantly. Even if it's short, it packs a lot but still has a fluid and flawless storytelling. In addition to that, it ties in with Season 1 and 2 of the show and for a fan it's another layer of what makes this film pleasurable.The quality of the music, voice acting and animation support this writing marvelously, for a thrilling result.

I think while the characters felt human they lacked charm no one really gave you any true want to bond to them, the romance felt forced and took up too much time, i understand that humans using magic is supposed to be very mundane here but at the same time if you're gonna fight using magic having it be so weak is pointless.But here, here the fighting was great, the characters made you feel for them- i felt hopeful, happy, anger and actually cried a bit, the romance was little but strong enough that it was very sweet, art and animation at times were great again, ost fit well, honestly the only problem i had were the voice acting it felt rushed often and subpar compared to how good everything else was.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

A lot of work was done on the graphics and plot. It had everything you need: beginning, fear, rebirth, love and death. The work on the characters is excellent, but I would like to note that this is a story not only about Vesemir but about all the witchers in general. I especially wanted to mention the work of sound engineers, because every sound in this masterpiece evokes a certain emotion that corresponds to what I saw. In short, the world created by Netflix was created with unambiguous passion and love for fans. There are no limits to my passion.

210,nicksyn,This is terrible actually,2,28 August 2021,"This is terrible actually. They just filled some time to show us the end - wow this is Gerald. The character arc is almost flat, for all characters. Vesemir suddenly turns good, maybe, after he was greedy cold blood killer with flashbacks, who is talking alone. Flashbacks Vesemir - young greedy boy in love. Older Vesemir - old greedy boy in love, but also crazy selfish sociopath. His beloved girl - granny, was there just for emotional support and to die. The main antagonist pseudo Yennefer was out of any established lore. Also she had some kind of motivation to be evil, because witchers are evil, so maybe she is actually good. I'm not sure. The witchers in this movie are actually very, very bad guys. The king is idiot. The support antagonist is some mix of Japaneses nine-tailed fox spirit, elf, and vampire? Amazing mutation, or written by someone who never played the games or read the books. The black nobles? OK, why a nobleman will travel alone with his family? How a black man became a noble in Northern kingdoms? Probably this is more meaningful story. We will never know as black family was there just for the color. The plot twisted antagonist - Deglan is cold blood killer greedy sociopath like all the witchers in this movie, so the twist is kind of vague. His motivation is to create more monsters, but then all these monsters like army attack Kaer Morhen, led by Japaneses nine-tailed fox spirit mutant. So yeah, monsters also have some kind of motivation probably. Anyway I do not really care as all who died were greedy sociopaths, crazy sociopaths and one support character.

211,florianeaud,Just as surprising as a child you'd find as you're going home,8,23 August 2021,"The Witcher : Nightmare of the Wolf had a double objective, to show us how the School of the Wolf dwindled to the point where only a handful of its witchers remained by the time of the books, and to add a much needed backstory to the character of Vesemir. And I'm pleased to say it is highly successful in both.I won't spend time talking about the animation, the soundtrack, the sound effects and the voice acting. It's simply great. The art direction is phenomenal, the soundtrack has that same Polish vibe from the games and the show. You can feel the passion put into the movie, if you don't like the story you'll still enjoy the movie because of this huge production value.But the story is just as solid. Many characters are introduced, most of them unknown to us until now, yet each of them make their impression and add something to the plot or overall mood of the movie. Vesemir of course stands out the most, with a character arc that will ring a bell to Wild Hunt players as it seems to all come from a conversation you can have with him in the game. You understand him throughout the entire movie, you get how he became the character we know in the books, you actually see his evolution, his flaws, where he failed and how he influenced the scenario. This movie is a perfect example of a well-done origin story.All in all Nightmare of the Wold will please long time fans and newcomers alike. There are some missed opportunities here and there, like Kaer Morhen not looking at all like the fortress we know in Wild Hunt. It's also a bit ''too much anime'' at some point, meaning that yes, witchers are superhuman, but not backflip-into-the-air-while-swinging-my-sword-and-throwing chains-everywhere superhuman, and Vesemir's Signs look way to strong at some moments, they're supposed to be a pale imitation of true magic. But these are just details, overall the movie is amazing and honors the source material. Go watch it now.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

But this gets way out of hand and every time they hide behind its just fantasy, while its not only fantasy its also history and part of European folklore. This is how bad things happen by altering history, its just a sneaky way to do so thats why this is not some innocent re-hashing of European folklore.

215,KadenVanSwart,An Honest Review from a Filmmaker,8,23 August 2021,"I've spent the past two year's now studying, filmmaking, directing, and reading the entire Witcher Series, along with completing the Wild Hunt 3 times over.This film was pretty damn great; a prequel that answered my questions about the sacking of Kaer Morhen, and the origins of Vesemir. I personally think the film would've made more sense if it was longer, but it was sped along nicely, sometimes a tad too fast. The animation was stellar, with the writing almost perfect. My issues:
The voice acting felt a bit monotone-not a deal breaker, but frustrating. It took immersion away a bit.Tetra's backstory and motivation was answered, but I could've used more info.Vessemir's true light; hard men are made hard by circumstance-I hope that season 2 of Witcher 3 gives us more of his morally-good side. Kindness is a virtue, even if only ever shown at ones worst moments.The directing seemed to ""direct"" this film to readers of the original book series; we forget, not all of us have invested hundreds of ours rummaging through the novels. Some people may be left in the dark to some extent *cough*, ""season one of the Witcher Netflix series""
All in all, a great prequel that does justice to the Witcher Universe.Time to get back to reading,

216,eboyen,Had its moments but fell flat in the end,4,23 August 2021,"Non-spoilers:
The style is obviously different from previous Witcher material, but still beautiful. They played a bit fast and loose with the Witcher universe (Witchers being too powerful, for one). The voice acting was hit-and-miss. The story had me invested for the most part, but ended up falling apart in my opinion.Spoilers:
My main reason for thinking the story falls apart in the end is that the bad guy is completely in the right, and the Witchers are entirely in the wrong. The main characters seem to agree on this, but still don't switch side or attempt any other solution than killing off the other side.The story about the Witcher (which, unless I misunderstood, turns out to have been Vesemir) that swindled a priest was so stupid, since the same scam could so easily have been pulled off without harming an innocent. At that point, why not just murder the priest and steal his goodies?And towards the end no one explains why the ability to create Witchers have any value whatsoever. Did they forget that they had just revealed that monsters were on the decline and Witchers had to create more to stay in business?Apart from being nonsensical, it was simply boring. We're told in the first 5 minutes who the bad guy is and what she wants (a war with Witchers) and an hour later that's exactly what we get, with no twists or turns. The middle part with Vesemir adventuring with the witch, which had me somewhat interested in what happens next, turned out to be almost entirely pointless.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

218,janbydzovsky,"Meh, Wow and Bleh",5,23 August 2021,"Honestly I really liked the animation, soundtrack and fight scenes, but thats kinda it. I hated the ending and final plot twist, because it completely rewrites a really important plot point in the Witcher universe. If it was made somewhat well, I would be okay with that, but the way the writers did that was just bad. Story is kinda meh, and Vesemir is fun character, until you remember its Vesemir, so another rewrite. Some people coplain about diversity, honestly I did not care about that. Some parts of the story felt without any pay of. If this was made with a completely unknown witcher and completely different school of witchers, or be a completly different universe it would be 8, but the heavy disrespect to the most important parts of the lore really bumed me out.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
219,ramzes-19268,A nearly perfect combination of Witcher and Anime,9,23 August 2021,"Wanted to share my opinion. It has all the witcher stuff that we (I) love the most. The non-black-and-white world that boasts imperfect characters - the ""good"" guys who don't always do the best things and who also screw up. The ""bad"" guys who want to do good and believe they do. The various issues troubling the society, both masses and minorities. A beautiful love story. Amazing combat - anime style, not faithful to the books (but it's fine). A fair, fair portion of lore in it's own adaptation.It's a really great (shonen, I believe?) anime and holding true to that, it changes some things up in the source material. It's definitely to be taken with a grain of salt. But it has managed to pack a lot of good stuff in the short 1.5 hours that it lasts.I suggest keeping an open mind and taking the movie for what it is - a Witcher inspired anime that offers great story, characters, additional backstory and some stunning visuals.I'm also not stating that what was shown that doesn't contradict the books is now to be considered canon, just like other Netflix and CDPR productions it has it's own story and it's up to each of us to treat it as we like. But it was cool and interesting nevertheless.I give the movie a really strong 9/10.

I found the pacing to be a bit rushed and I feel that the movie could have definitely used some extra runtime,but the story was enjoyable and I found myself liking Vesimir,but it's nothing spectacular.However,the script needlessly changed events from the Witcher universe and It messed with the timeline a bit too much in my humble opinion. My biggest gripe is with the powers of the Witcher themselves as they (and especially their signs) are waaay too OP. And I felt as if the derive of Kaer Morhan was needlessly of the top. I could go on for a good while nitpicking all of the seemingly unnecessary changes.

225,jaeferwerda,"Why Netflix, so many fans were counting on you...",1,24 August 2021,"I will begin by saying I am not only a fan of the amazing books Andrzej Sapkowski wrote but also the graphic novels and CD Project Red video game franchise. All of which I enjoyed so i can honestly say I was excited to here about another element of the Witcher I was going to get to immerse myself into. Talk about setting yourself up for disappointment.I feel like whoever wrote the script for this movie only knew the lore from what people who were familiar about it told him. There are multiple parts that reference both Blood of Elves and Season of Storms (two books vastly different from each other set in separate times and places with different characters), all of these parts feel forced and insulting to fans.The monsters are crap. Really Netflix, there is SO much material when it comes to the games and graphic novels that all have consistent looking monsters but you have to go and make up a bunch of garbage? Imagine how excited it would have made a fan of the many works to see a leshin that actually looked like a leshin. Don't even get me started on what was supposed to be a vixen also known as an aguara or she-fox, a creature who already had a perfectly good history in the books and graphic novels. I can not for the life of me see what they were trying to do with that.I don't know what the hype over Vesemir is, he's hardly in the books at at all and only plays a slightly larger part in the games. Don't get me wrong i love his character in both of those works but he absolutely didn't need any backstory. In the book and game he is portrayed as a father figure, a grumpy, sarcastic, gruff, but caring individual who all the witchers at Kaer Morhen respect. Not only that but a man who hated watch the young boys die during the trial of the grasses even though he knew it was necessary to keep his kind alive. But what do we get? An invincible, arrogant, selfish, pretty boy douche bag. I understand character development is necessary but if they wanted to have that much change they needed a mini series and not an hour and twenty-three minute move already crammed with to much unnecessary content.I'll end by saying I know a lot of people who are not familiar with all the separate works liked this film, but there are so many ways it could have pleased both newcomers and faithful fans and its a real shame that it didn't. I really hope it doesn't become a new trend for the other Wither Netflix productions.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

This is contrary to everything.I can come to terms with Vesemir's appearance, but I cannot believe anything about what this story tells.You took a great character loved by many fans of the universe and turned him into nothing, although you could create an incredible story of his becoming. You could tell in detail about the times before the Gerald, why there were few witchers, why mutagens were lost, what was the formation of the world.But for some reason, you decided that it would be more logical to provoke the anger of the community.I hope that your hands will not spoil this universe anymore.You lied about creating a fan story for fans.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

Vesemir is introduced as a cocksure belmont 2.0 with no cunning or guile, just anime back flips and too many one liners in the first fight scene.The origin story was actually quite good and well paced in my opinion. There was some semblance of pacing and giving the audience a moment to breath between scenes, and the characters were believable and established well.It seems like much of the lore around the witcher universe was watered down in service of expediting the story. I don't really care about the ""diversity"", but everything that made the setting interesting was barely shoehorned in. Black eye potions, air-bending, ""JUST TRUST ME!"", and the very sad elf are just a few things I'm thinking of.Beyond that felt like i was watching at 5x speed. Exposition, set-piece, anime-fight. That was the formula. Pop a potion and shoot fireballs. Nothing imaginative or interesting.The fight scenes were certainly flashy but the stupid grinning confidence of Belmont 2.0 facing down legions of monsters had me rolling my eyes several times. There was no tension or stakes outside of the final fight scene and even that seemed to fall flat in my opinion as everything happened way too quickly.Honestly wish they had given this more time to develop but I can see Netflix's reasoning to have a quick release.

1. The song at the very beginning sounds like it was written in some alien language and then translated with Google translate
(I don't really mind the Afro-American family, there are far greater sins in the movie)
2. PLEASE STOP USING 3D ANIMATION like this in an otherwise beautifully animated movie (this happened in the dota2 movie too with the dragons). I am really bothered by this because it's Netflix so you know they have the money to pay an artist to animate the big monsters but they still go with the lazy approach and do some shitty 3d model of a wyvern (or what that monster was called), fighting with the 2d characters.3. They really broke the cannon Witcherverse with some things
3a. Witchers Can't cry
3b. Witchers need fingers to cast signs
3c. Kaer Morhen WAS ATTACKED BY BRAINWASHED PEASANTS, not by some farmers who are afraid of monsters but then forget all about them and decide to charge side by side with a legion of - you guessed it - FREAKING MONSTERS SPAWNED FROM A MAGICAL PORTAL. It makes no freaking sense..

The Witcher stories are, at their heart, more like ""The Mandalorian"" - a slower paced fable of a lone hero making his way through a troubled world - than the Avengers or whatever this was trying to be.So it disrespects the source material, fine. Is the new story entertaining? No. It's uninspired, flawed story-telling that's full of clichés and mediocre writing and lame one-liners.The forced diversity in what's supposed to be a Polish fable adds nothing of substance to the story and is just another question mark in this disappointing cash grab.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
234,Leravalera31,Nightmare of the Witcher fan,3,27 August 2021,"While animation itself was generally ok, I really didn't like how they twisted original story. You have an established fanbase with esbalished expectations, and instead of giving people what they want, you take characters, main plot point (destruction of Kaer Morhen) and rewrite the story around it completely for no apparent reason. The original story was actually good enough for the cartoon. So those changes are annoying.The plot in Nightmare of the wolf is quite simple and predictable.And it does not leave you with better understanding of the witchers, how they are created, why they tend to be emotionless and so fond of doing anything for coin. I feel like it could have been explained better.Some scenes in the show are trying to show the process of witcher creation, but they are abrupt, chaotic, and some of them are just ridiculous attempt at scaring the viewer (like when untrained kids are dumped in swamps just to be eaten - it is just plain stupid idea, and nowhere near like it was in the original story).Also, In the original story, even if you were given to the castle via law of surprise, you still could choose to become or not to become a witcher, because, you know, you might not survive the process of becoming one. You had to undergo training, you had to know how to use weapons. Simply put - before any trials, you prepare for them. In the netflix show, witchers shown as butchers, who instead of training future colleagues, just throw kids into the swamps to be eaten. Trail of Grasses explained very-very poorly, while it is kinda important.And then this plot point, that it all was for revenge. In the original story the idea of people disliking witchers for being mutants is a huge deal. So while witchers were killing monsters, they still were hated by people. It is a problem that makes witchers even colder towards people. In the netflix show all of this just goes out of the window, the conflict simplified to the easy concept for dummies: witchers bad, they made monsters, angry witch good, with acceptible motive of revenge. Mob agrees, because witchers made monsters. And it was not the case in the original - in the source material people didn't need the real valid reason to attack, because of the blind hatred towards any non-human (it is kind of a major issue for most of the conflicts in the Witcher story - how humans are hating all non-human races, as well as witchers). This simplification became the major reason for my dissapointment in this show.Also, Netflix tends to call every cartoon anime nowdays, but it doesn't feel like one, neither it looks like one. It is a cartoon, and it is not a bad thing, it is just as fine. Just stop calling every drawn piece of storytelling an anime.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

0/4 stars for writing/dialog
0/3 stars for character and set design
+1 star for some iconic fan momentsTL;DR looks as good or better than Castlevania but with absolutely none of the charm, intrigue, or character arcs. Would not recommend.Why you should watch this:
1) It looks really cool. Despite how much I disliked the story/dialog, I watched to the end because the animation is excellent (and I was really bored).2) It's a neat tie-in to the Witcher universe in the pre-Geralt period that many fans are familiar with.Why you should not watch this:
1) It's rushed. Very rushed. This contributes to some of the issues below.2) Dialog is delivered heavy-handedly and is often choppy. The choppiness is partly due to a handful of extremely short, exposition-heavy scenes meant to drive the plot forward. Seriously, this dialog is so bad that I found it distracting throughout.3) Set design is uninspired and with so many short scenes there's really no chance to even try to appreciate it.4a) Character design is deeply flawed. The sorceress is completely flat, despite having plenty of screen time, and Vesemir exhibits practically no development over the 90 minutes. At the climax, he does face past regrets but there's no payoff as even if that development were believable, the audience has 0 stake in it at the end.4b) Setting up a wise-cracking, bulletproof Vesemir was tough for me to swallow as a fan of the games.

No one paid that good for killing monsters and Witchers were never rich and went for the money and if they did - they acted as assasins and so on whilst being disrespected by other Witchers.Visimir looks like he's out fresh from the barber but when did he have the time to do so? :D
The royal traveler was black, that's not common for the Slavic region so he's a traveler from far away? Then why didn't he have any guards with him? No one would travel like so with his children if he'd have the money for.The trials - Witchers didn't dump kids in swamp to see who survives, a proper training was in place before the herb trials and actual monster fights.Witchers looked like NFL players whilst they should've looked like a person who just finished chemo therapy, their eyes didn't looks as supposed as well.Netflix, open a department in Poland or Ukraine to get the Slavic atmosphere done properly hence this cartoon looks like someone hired an anime artist from Japan and asked him to do a Disney cartoon.CDProject Red gave a good example on how to create an awesome story and pass the mood to public and you're just ruining their achievements.Stop throwing money out the window and do a proper job cuz I'm ashamed that I got my Netflix subscription just to watch this garbage.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

241,charleynavasaitis,Animation and Voice acting was nice,5,16 October 2021,"I'll start with the good, the animation and voice acting. I recognize several of the voices from other places, and enjoyed them in this. The animation was clean, definitely reminded me of Castlevania more than any anime I've seen, and the fight scenes were enjoyable if very over the top.The bad. I'm a fan of the books, I've listened to the audio books multiple times at this point, have played the games, and I've seen the live action Witcher. They did not ""expand"" the lore, they gutted it and butchered it. They took vaguely remembered plot points and turned them on their head to be clever. We could start with little details that were blatantly wrong, like every witcher wearing a wolf medallion (they all have different animals) or we could go with sorceresses not using fire magic because they aren't talented enough to control it (this was so far off the mark it's easier to say go read the books because the use of fire magic and why it's forbidden is sort of major to the plot). If we stick with the established lore that only boys under ten are taken to train as witchers, due to the trial of the grasses, then Vesemir was the single most intelligent, well spoken ten year old with a better understanding of class structure than most adults in history.It was a generic anime with generic anime story and a Witcher skin slapped on it for marketing purposes. Ignore that it exists and you'll be better off for it. Go listen to the audio books, Peter Kenny does a fantastic job of voicing them.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
242,manutd-99221,Nightmare of a witcher books fan,1,12 November 2021,"This animation is based on a pathetic story which just can't stand up against criticism. The plot demonstrates a lack of a common sense and full of medieval life misinterpretations, but (which is the most discouraging) it fails to follow the books lore which results in the witchers doing their job ""for a thrill and coin"" (©) and literally robbing the common folk. The scenes demonstrating events we know about from the books (eg. Trial of the Grasses) look like a D student trying to write a summary of a book they didn't read properly. The most of the other scenes are lacking the common sense and understanding of medieval life.If you are a witcher books fan or you are familiar with their lore through CDPR video games series or you consider yourself a narrative logic-picky viewer - my advise to you is to avoid this product.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
243,dmitriyspiv,Bruh,5,13 November 2021,"The scriptwriter didn't read the books or played the games, it's basically a fanfic with a lot of plot holes.

And if you are among those that think Witcher 3 is still the greatest game ever. Then this is a 10/10 for you.Incredible character development. Smart, witty, horrifying, grotesquely written.

245,jaye-spade,Perfection!!!,10,31 August 2021,"I loved it. I will start by saying anyone giving this film/anime is probably a hardcore fan of the game and/or the books. I have not played the game or read any of the novels, so all my knowledge of The Witcher lore comes completely from the show.As a hardcore comic book fan, I understand their frustration, as I used to get upset with the film adaptions strayed somewhat from the source material, but if you're like and have never played the game or read the books, this is very well done. Next to Castlevania, this is probably the best Netflix anime (especially based on video game), period. It has a great story, awesome voice cast and beautiful animation. Too be honest, this movie makes me want to read the novels now. This is perfection, IMO.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
246,sour01,"Good, but suffering from similar issues as the show",7,24 August 2021,"I loved the animation, voice acting, and Vesemir was a great lead, compelling and likeable.Unfortunately, it was the story that I couldn't engage with. The pacing was a key issue, and you're often not fully following sequence of events or realising their connection with one another. The story wasn't fleshed out properly and things felt choppy at times. It leads to a disconnected experience. You want to care and to be engaged, but your not. Also, was I the only one to realise lip sync issues??The show had some of the same key issues when it came to pacing and plot.Still enjoyed it and I hope it's a sign for better things to come.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
247,jonathanholen96,"Great potential, but to short.",5,24 August 2021,"I will keep this review short, since i think most of the people don't want a 10 000 word review.First off, i'm a big witcher fan, i've read all the books, and played all the games. The thing the witcher has going, in the books and games, is the story. The overall story arch, and the world story. If you read the books you get a great amount of story regarding everything around the characters and the world etc.The movie, just throws the story out the window. The movies runtime is around 1:20 minutes. It should have been 2 movies. At least. The movie run through the story, doesn't explain monsters, and doesn't explain how the witcher process works. Now, the movie tries to hide this with great animation. Does it succeed with this? Almost. Don't get me wrong, the animation is great. But, if you go to watch this to get a deeper insight in the witcher universe, you're going to be disappointed. If you don't have any prior knowledge about the witcher and the world. You're gonna have a bad time.TL;DR
Story - 3/10. The base story is great. But, they skip to much of it. This should have been 2 movies, story driven.Animation - 8/10. They get lazy sometimes when animating, with stills and just moving mouths. So much that it sometimes becomes unatural. But the fight scenes are amazing! Some of the best fight scenes this year. (I've got 100 days on MAL so don't even try to tell me i don't know animation).Soundtrack - 7/10. Some of the pieces in the movies stand out, and is memorable. But a lot of ""Generic soundtrack"" also.Characters - 2/10. They barely give us information about Vesemir. The main character. All the other? Meh. They don't tell us anything.Enjoyment - 5/10. You can watch it and have a good time. But you probably won't watch it again.You wanna watch a cool animation film about the witcher? Knock yourself out! But don't get your hopes up.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
248,kruglyakovkirill,"Generic Fantasy stuff, good animation. Nothing Witcher-y about it though",4,26 August 2021,"This could have been an easy 7 out of 10 if they made their own original IP. The animation and 2D are solid, some likable characters too and intense fighting scenes. As a Witcher movie, esp one about a backstory of a beloved character - it fails miserably.A powerful message of witchers' downfall because of the hatred of Men towards all that is different is turned on its head - now it's not the zealots and fanatics goaded by power-hungry mages take Kaer Morhen. It's an endless army of monsters from portals created by 'they killed mah mother""-motivated Legolas-wannabe. The movie completely disregards a powerful conflict between mutants and ordinary folk who are afraid of them, twists witcher trials by turning them into a senseless slaughter of unarmed and untrained boys in a monster-infested swamp, and even makes Geralt into a fff Saitama for no reason at all (and no, disguising him until the name ""reveal"" at the end is silly, everyone saw it was Geralt like instantly). And yeah, now you apparently do not need to unnaturally twist your fingers to cast Witcher signs - you no longer even need a hand to do so. Also, every witcher is issued a chain on a bobbin to do Attack on Titan type acrobatics....I could go on and on. As a fan-fiction, as a generic fantasy - this works. As a witcher movie - not so much.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

250,syawaxs,Awful at best,2,24 August 2021,"Ok let me start with this. This is a non canon movie. It has no respect for the original material. The portrait of Vesemir is just something I can't get. Yes Witchers are in it for the money , accpeted , but there is much depth to what they do and how they do what they do. The show is just trying to milk the name .Why would you put Geralt at the end like that? I have no clue what the hell was happening or why it was happening . Please stop making The Witcher. Just read the books .",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
251,arifnw,As a fan of the game,9,4 September 2021,"I've read some reviews, after I finished watching this film. I'm very grateful for that, so I don't have any prejudice on this film. As a fan of the witcher games, I can understand their disappointment. But that shouldn't stop us from judging this film which I think is very good. Yes, Vesemir shouldn't cry, because a witcher has no emotions etc. But the film is still good, well told, cool animations, different enemies and monsters, very fun. Please just enjoy this movie, you will definitely like it. I myself am still curious about the fate of Kitsu, and the elf girl who was saved by his friend Vesemir. Hopefully there will be a continuation of this story, seeing Geralt grow up under Vesemir's tutelage. Well worth the wait. Again, this is just a fantasy, let the writer of this film be able to tell The Witcher according to his perception, just enjoy it! Cheers!",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf
252,kyuubitails,A perfect Witcher story.,10,24 August 2021,"It's a great insight into the gaps the books didn't fill, coming from a passionate team who understands what is the Witcher world about, there is no evil or good just choices, some are completely evil and some are completely good, but they don't define their characters. You simply cannot name a villain or a hero, perfect adaptation.Soundtracks were on spot, will drown you into the Witcher world right away.Animation is incredible and exaggerated just like an anime would be, it's a fresh and welcomed change from what we're used to from the show or the books (closer to the games).Writing is the real gem in this movie, it's beyond what I expected.Overall I would say a great introduction to the Witcher world.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

And a mite ugly, with plot holes.I would recommend watching only if not invested in the stories already ; and if not planning to read or listen to them .

258,markobeslic,Okeish,5,24 August 2021,"From the start, this anime shares one thing with the live-action show that bothers me and that is, there is too little Slavic feel for an anime that is based on books that are heavily inspired by Slavic culture. But I guess that making the Show more appealing to the widest possible audience is much more important to the bottom line.The story is quite predictable and I would not be surprised if I forget it in a month or so. Some details of it did not make sense at all, like the swamp ""test"" the young witchers had to go through. Who in their right mind would think that a test like that would filter out the good candidates from the bad ones in any meaningful way? The story gives some lame explanation that they need to use their senses to figure out a way from the swamps while dozens of monsters are trying to kill them, what senses? They are still children at that point. To me it looks like that part of the story was added just to get some extra gore.The portrayal of Vesimirm was okay-ish, I would have imagined that he was a big talker during his youth but how much 'full of himself' they made him was a bit annoying. Also, he is too similar to the Belmont guy from Castelvania which is not bad in itself, it just looks lazy.The monsters were mostly disappointing and that is sad for a story that revolves around a guy that kills them for a living. Even the Leshen was just like Vesimir described him, a forest hobo.The fact that it was made in the anime style is also annoying, not every animation has to be anime. But to be objective, the animation together with fight scenes are really good, and this is the best part of the anime.Don't get me wrong it was still watchable, and I do not really regret spending some 120 min on it, I was just expecting so much more.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

262,bferwerda-30439,Animation Style...Cool. Everything Else? Not So Much.,1,24 August 2021,"The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf suffers the same fate as most new Hollywood projects. Style over substance. I gave ""Nightmare"" 1 star for the animation, which I thought was pretty good. But that's where the praise stops. From the very first scene, which features some uniquely cringey voice acting, to Vesemir's character, to the completely bungled story-line that takes quite a few notable elements from the source material and basically ruins it. And that is really the most egregious problem with ""Nightmare"".First, the voice acting. Many of the characters are children who were obviously voiced by adults doing their... ""best""...kid voice. It's awkward and took me out the world almost immediately. Also, Vesemir saying ""trend setter"" was just annoying. This is supposed to be hundreds of years ago.Second, Vesemir's character. In the books (of which he is hardly present) Vesemir is a hardened but kind man who acted as a father figure to Geralt, and a grandfatherly figure to Ciri. As possibly the oldest remaining witcher, he was wise and cared deeply for his friends. In ""Nightmare"", Vesemir is smarmy, arrogant, and seemingly invincible, as in one scene where he careens towards earth fighting a monster a la Gandalf in The Two Towers. He is totally unlikeable and doesn't have any of the qualities you imagine him having in the books. Yes, he is younger in this, but I just didn't feel any connection to him at all.And lastly, the story. The source material is a vast wonderland of lore, but not much is known about the attack on Kaer Morhen, except that mages helped carry out the attack ,and Vesemir was one of few witchers left alive. ""Nightmare"" tries to fill in much of this backstory, but in doing so ruins much of what was great about the books. Without spoiling too much, the writers effectively turn witchers into the bad guys in this story, stealing a rather gruesome premise from Season of Storms and projecting it onto the witchers.These are just a few examples of why I do not like Nightmare of the Wolf. And don't even get me started on the Aang, I mean...""Geralt"" cameo.",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

266,petergarnaes,"Looks like The Witcher, that's the best there is to say about it...",2,25 August 2021,"This just violates the spirit of The Witcher so badly I could not finish the movie...The books and games are all about taking the generic fantasy setting and playing it straight, imagining what it would be like if people acted realistically and had a medieval mindset. This movie just turns The Witcher back into generic fantasy in such an uninterested way you would have to think it was written by some sort of AI.The opening scene is in many ways a perfect microcosm of the films many ""issues"" with its source material.We open on the worlds most generic and played out horror setup. Every line of dialogue obviously foreshadows things we already saw coming from a mile away due to the setting alone. Nothing is grounding us in the unique Witcher universe. To nobody's suprise a Witcher shows up to save the day and is just blaze through it like its nothing. Even though this Witcher just risked his own life to save another, he just robs the kid and leaves him in a dangerous place, mocking him in the process. That is cold, even for villains of Witcher universe, and this is supposed to be the protagonist?I don't even know where to start!Both the book and the games goes to great length describing how dangerous the Witcher work is, and how much preparation it takes just so you might come out with non-fatal injuries. Witchers die all the time! Its also just bad writing, when the setup is that generic, why is the fight remotely interesting if its not a challenge at all?The Witchers actions after killing the Leshen are also baffling. The Witcher universe is not a place where you kill monsters ""just because"". Being too much of a badass not to recognize other peoples humanity is the exact opposite of what The Witcher is about. Not even the villains are this careless with their actions in a real Witcher story.I could go on, but lets just say it didn't get any better after 25 minutes, so I turned it off...I understand you have to break away from certain aspects of a work to make a new and interesting take on that work. But you have to engage with the ideas it brings up, even if you reach another conclusion because why else adapt it in the first place?",The Witcher - Nightmare of the Wolf

The story does not make sence and worst of all the lovely atmosphere of the series is completely ruined.
